The game about bunnies and various other animals battling it out to prevent becoming a massive red mess of liquid and to feel the pain the usual ragdoll physic.\n\nAs Overgrowth is currently still in early alpha and has been for a few years, a structured story still hasn't been implemented BUT the current 'challenges' keep you feeling amused and entertained. The main appeal about this game is the combat system (the best of any game I've ever witnessed). Every single encounter provides something new and makes you feel like a complete baddass if you are provided with a victory. The maps feel fresh and different and the in-game editor provides hours and hours of extra interest.\n\nBUY THIS NOW.\n\n(The steam game time doesn't represent what I've played, I've had it for around two years (as of Dec 2013) and I've probably stuck around 150 hours or so into the game as it wasn't on steam before.)","December 17, 2013","true","19.4"," 615 of 676 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","615","676","0","17"

The game's main selling point is it's brutal combat which is best witnessed in the arena where you are automatically pitted against enemies either with your bare hands or with one of the game's few weapons. If you don't want to play the arena you can wander around one of the game's other maps and if you wish you can even spawn in enemies to take on. Despite all of these features the game has one glaring issue which completely changes whether or not you should buy this game.\n\n+Great graphics\n+Brutal and enjoyable combat\n+You can slow down time\n+Good controls\n+Maps are quite nice and reasonably large\n+If you play on the arena you are automatically put in to teams (or not) to fight other enemies and you are equipped with weapons automatically\n+A number of different species you can play as\n+There are different challenges for you to complete\n+Good physics\n+Decent modding community\n+Good platforming mechanics\n\n-This game has been in Alpha since 2008 and it's currently on build 209, updates are few and far between and offer nothing more than bug fixes, they do not add any more ways to keep you playing and more importantly they still haven't added the campaign modes which were promised\n-Gets very repetitive very quickly\n-Horribly overpriced considering what you get\n-The game's platforming mechanics are wasted on the maps that are currently available, i.e. they're very flat maps or easy to get around\n-Frequent crashes\n-Long loading times\n\nVerdict:\nDo not buy this game.\n\nIt's a wonderful concept but I don't think the execution could be much worse and with it's current price tag and considering it's effectively just a tech demo with little to do you'd be wasting your money on a project that has been in Alpha for 7 years and is likely to remain in Alpha for the next 7 years.\n\nEl K.","February 21, 2015","false","4.1"," 686 of 828 people (83%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","83","686","828","19","68"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onematt/recommended/25000/","onematt","Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onematt/","215 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT: To clarify things, I owned Overgrowth a year before it came out on Steam; my Steam playtime is irrelevant.\n\nI make a point not to review games that are in alpha or beta until they're released, but I'll make an exception for Overgrowth for two simple reasons: (1) it's good enough to justify a $30 purchase even in its alpha builds, and (2) I consider it to be an absolutely enormous leap in the slow evolution of fighting games.\n\nWhen you preorder Overgrowth, you get immediate access to the current alpha build, so you can test everything out right away as the developers add stuff. This alleviates the usual problem with preordering games, that is, putting down money for a product that doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe game itself currently boasts some of the smoothest, most fun, most intense combat of any game, ever, and I don't say that lightly. Overgrowth, like many indie games, uses physics as a driving mechanic. When you get kicked, your character reacts dynamically with a blend of animation and ragdoll. When you get stabbed, likewise. Dealing kicks and punches and slashes feels incredibly good -- the combat is fast-paced and frantic. Against more than one opponent, you'll almost inevitably lose unless your opponents are significantly slower or weaker than you, especially in a weapon fight.\n\nLet's talk about weapon combat for a moment: it's just as fast as the unarmed combat, maybe even faster in the case of the fencing swords and knives. It's one or two hits to a kill, so blocking and dodging is absolutely essential. The fights are cinematic and extremely satisfying (this applies to unarmed fights as well), especially if you hit the slow-motion key (currently tab by default) just as either combatant dies.\n\nThe parkour can't go without mention. Though at this point in the game's development, the parkour is its weakest point (momentum doesn't carry while climbing), it's still ahead of many games with parkour elements. Wall-running, wall-jumping, and movement in genreral feel great. Everything flows together without the need for extraneous button-pressing, and when you do press a button, the resulting blended animation is a pleasure to watch. The only bad thing about the parkour, climbing, still isn't bad at all. It's still faster than most games, and still feels better than most games.\n\nI can't recommend Overgrowth enough. You could buy it for the combat alone (setting aside that there's going to be an actual story, with the writer's skill already demonstrated in a full-length comic over at Wolfire's home page). Overgrowth's combat, in my opinion, is the most fun of any melee combat game ever made.","December 17, 2013","true","11.6"," 350 of 408 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","350","408","0","5"

(Seriously, You can kill a lot of time playing versus with your friends) As of 12/17/13 there is no campaign or story related gameplay.

Yes it's fun to play. Yes the combat is good. BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. This game has been in Devlopment since 2008 and it's STILL in Early Access! That's ridiclous! There is nothing to do and it's still extremely glitchy even after 6 full years of development. It feels like something that should be worth about $5 and not $30 (which is how much I paid for it). The developers update it once every 3 months and seriously, what game has 200+ versions of alpha?!? "It is still very much in development" for how much longer? I'll be quiet happy when in 2030 The full game will probably be released at the rate they are making this game.\n\nGraphics 6/10\n\nCombat 9/10\n\nReplayability THERE IS NOTHING TO DO.\n\nStory ?/10\n\nPick this up if it's on sale for $5 MAXIMUM.\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE**\n\nTo the people saying that this is just "a side project" and that the team have full time jobs, go to the steam store and search up Unturned. That game was made BY A 16 YEAR old student and it already has more content than overgrowth. Students are the busiest people with all of their exams and homework and stuff but look at that kid. Did I mention that Unturned is FREE and this "Development" game is $30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars?!? And Unturned is just one example of MANY games made by small groups of people in their free time, so don't give me ♥♥♥♥ing excuses that what they already implemented in this game is "6 years of development".\n\n**EDIT/UDATE** #2\n\nSo most of you hav already listened to me and are not buying this game but there are still a few people who think Overgrowth is still in development because it's hard to make and such. And let me just start off by saying one of the BIGGEST issues I have with this game, it's enourmous price tag. A game this unfinished should be $5 maxium or less. Second thing I want to address that I have been getting alot of hate about: People are saying that in Untured (which is the game I used as an example of a different game)  has nothing in it, yea but that's the point it's FREE and he's updating it way more than overgrowth. Third issue probably the biggest one: Development rate, I know they have full time jobs and I KNOW  it's hard to program a game like this but COME ON people! This game updated like 5 times in this WHOLE YEAR (2014) and there was nothing added, nothing special that screamed "Wow I really should play some of this game!" it was mostly just animaton fixes and such. So for a gmae that costs $30 and tons of people bought it let's just say around 10,000 people bought this game at FULL price expecting a game: 30 x 10,000= $300,000. Where does that money go? straight into the devlopers pockets and you're not getting ANYTHING back.\nI think I have made my point here.","December 12, 2014","false","4.4"," 1,028 of 1,374 people (75%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","75","028","1","91","196"

There has not been an update for 4 months as of this post, and on top of that, most updates only fix animations, or something to do with the combat that is so minor it really doesn't seem necessary.\n\nOn top of all of that, the support and feedback from developers when trying to contact them is non existent. I had contacted them multiple times about certain bugs that have never been fixed, and I had never received a reply.\n\nLastly, due to the fact that this is still "Alpha", the game has many glitches and crashes quite often. I just got a new gaming laptop for over 1500 bucks, and it still crashes every 10 minutes or so.\n\n\n\nThe one pro I have to say though, is that during the time that it does play, it is relatively fun to free run and fight, but really, that is all you can do. There is nothing to do but spawn enemies and fight, or run and climb things. If this game keeps updating at the pace that it is, there will most likely never be a completed game because it will be dropped eventually because there have been almost no noticeable changes at all in the past couple years.","June 1, 2015","false","25.7"," 362 of 479 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","362","479","13","14"

Wait for the overgrowth GOTY in 10 years.\n\nEDIT: Okay some people are a little angry that i'm not giving the game enough credit, because after all it's only one person working on it and they made a whole new game engine, but they did not make it from scratch, which good for them. Here's the problem, they're too ambitious they chose to keep improving the engine over actually making the game fun. When I purchased this game 2 years ago I assumed it would hit beta in one year, because that's how the development looked like it was going.\n\nHere's the thing is it feels like an advanced proof of concept, compared to a EA game like Prison Architect which has a lot of things to do inside it.

This is a combat system like no other, this isn't Button Mashing 101, you actually don't swing when you hit LMB, you have to get up close and hit it, and with each directional button you hit when you swing you do different things, like a roundhouse kick, a jab, hook, roll away, etc.  So if you go into this game expecting to mash buttons and win, you are gonna be on the floor with your neck broken fairly quickly.\n\nNo humans, just animals: There are no humans in this game, just anthro bunnies/wolfs/cats/robots/dogs, which is a different change, and probably a huge A+ when it comes to the Furry community, which I am part of.  But I really like the fact it isn't just "Another human" this guy is actually putting something different in place of what a character usually is, and I like it.\n\nClasses: There are other classes, as I said the wolf, cat, etc.  The wolf is basically a one hit kill for the bunnies, as for the others I haven't tried yet, I like the Rabbit too much.\n\nThe Ninjas: Every class is apparently a Ninja, I guess that would make sense since they wallrun, hop REALLY HIGH, with the amazing fighting skills and the ability to throw a spear/sword at a opponent and get a 1 hit kill off of it.\n\nNo stamina/health bar: I like this honestly, you just kind of have to guess if you are about to die or not, since they don't bother you with a little health bar, plus you don't really have little stamina, as far as I know you have infinite, but you kind of have to watch how much blood you lose, especially when it comes to weaopns\n\nWeapons: There are weapons in this game, and I really love them, despite the fact you can 1 hit kill if you throw it at them from behind or throw a spear at the opponents head, I got into some really heated sword battles that lasted several minutes or longer, and damn they were really fun too.\n\nFeel like a total bada$$: The title speaks for itself, when you start rolling around punching, roundhousing, jump kicking, and slicing everyone up I felt like the Master of weapons untill I got constantly kicked while rolling, but it was nice while it lasted.\n\nWounds: If you get wounded by a weapon he actually holds near the wound with a hand if he has a open hand, I just think it's a neat little feature to notice that you are injured, like the ammount of blood pouring out of you wasn't enough already.\n\nDifferent maps + Arena: I love the Arena even though on ocassions I get totally screwed over with how laggy it can get in that stupid arena on slight ocassions, but there is different maps to run around with and explore, with enemies you can fight so you can do something.\n\nResponsive controls: I feel as if when I hit something it actually DOES what I want, instead of me hitting a button and it just kind of does whatever it's supposed to, problem though is with some weapon fighting the Roll doesn't really want to work on ocassions, and I don't know why.\n\nChallenges: There are many challenges to do and they are pretty fun, I only did a few like kill a few enemies with just your fists, I'll have to try the rest later on.\n\nDifferent skins/clothes: Each animal has different clothes, mainly the Bunny though, like there is a Assassin like outfit if you hit the "1" key a few times it changes his color, clothes, and clothes color, so you can be the one you want.\n\nCONS:\n\nREALLY long loading times: Half the time the levels take FOREVER to load, yet I get around 300 frames, I don't think it should take several minutes to load up a level that I've played several times over and still take me 5 minutes to load up.\n\nConstantly kicked: As I said in the pros I'll explain abit more, I was playing on a Dune level and I found a rabbit to fight, he kicked me down, I rolled, he kicked me WHILE I was rolling and then I snapped my neck, then when I tried to go back and kick the s%*t out of him he did it AGAIN.  I think the roll needs to be a little bit tweaked, maybe when you roll you can't get hit untill the moment he starts getting up or something? That way you get some time to get up and get your thoughts together, as well as be able to fight back.\n\nJumping Physics: These are really weird, I was jumping around and had to jump back to where a enemy was cause I jumped away, he litterally did a 0.1 milisecond turn and had a s@%t ton of momentum and jumped all the way back, which kind of struck me as off, it's also weird to jump around a enemy cause you can't really turn all that well which feels kind of weird.  It doesn't help that when you land on a slope he instantly turns to go down the slope and moves down, so if i'm on a small ledge and jump and land, i'm most likely gonna fall off.\n\nNot much after a while: After you do the maps and arena a few times there isn't a whole lot left, there are challenges but even then it feels like it needs something, I say a Randomly generated map or something, just click a button, it randomizes a map and enemies with terrain and you go around exploring it to see what you can find.\n\nWHAT I THINK:\n\nI think this game is really fun and can have a lot of potential, and I feel confident it's gonna go somewhere in this guy's hands, he's already shown a lot of potential with just the combat system and the way it feels to roll around and fight instead of just another game where you press buttons and hope to win.  The game gets a 7/10 It needs some work and some additions but it's pretty f$#%ing good for what "I" was expecting out of it.","May 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 177 of 241 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","177","241","0","5"

There's a robust level editor and a growing library of user content.\n\nBut that's not what makes Overgrowth so fun, so addicting, and challenging. In my opinion, gameplay itself is paramount to making or breaking a game, and Overgrowth delivers in spades. The combat is up there with Arkham Asylum as my favorite fighting system in a game, simple to control yet complex in its execution and endlessly satisfying to watch. From agile evasion to smooth judo counters to tense knife fights or rolling under a swinging blade and digging a spear into an enemy's chest, the combat is just glorious fun\n\nThe movement alone offers some of the best 3D platforming I've played since Prince of Persia in 2003. You're fast and insanely maneuverable, able to jump huge distances, wall run with ease, bounce between walls and roll under obstacles. Speed running through the community parkour maps is so entertaining.\n\nBut Overgrowth isn't just great in its execution, but as a whole package inside and out. The anthropomorphic animal warriors and the semi-realistic atmosphere bring to mind classics like Redwall and Watership Down, and the brutality only cements those associations. A fight isn't just a simple exchange of blows; blades and hard hits leave bloody wounds across the body, blood that drips and stains in physics-accurate patterns. Fatal impacts against hard surfaces are accompanied by crunching bone. A stealthy neck slice sends arterial spray everywhere. A tough fight leaves you bloody and battered. Dodge at the wrong time and a kick will impact your head with a tangible sense of weight and momentum. It's these aspects that make the game such an enjoyable experience\n\nBut there's more to come, from the proper integration of species like dogs, rats, and cats, and a full story. The backstory of the world has already been fleshed out in Lugaru and this fascinating digital comic (http://www.wolfire.com/comic#1) and if the game's story is as engrossing as the stories in those pages, Overgrowth could truly be the Redwall of gaming.","January 29, 2014","true","27.2"," 93 of 124 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","93","124","0","0"

SIX WHOLE YEARS.\n\nI realize Wolfire is a very small studio, but thirty dollars for a buggy alpha is an extremely bad deal. They're at least transparent that it's an alpha, but I bought the game years ago before it was Greenlighted on Steam never even imagining that they would take this ridiculously long.\n\nIf you want to give Wolfire your money, go ahead. But keep in mind that this is nowhere NEAR a complete game---it's basically only a level editor/modkit and some assets at this point---and it's not clear when, if ever, a beta and/or a complete game will be forthcoming.\n\nI recommend just buying Receiver instead. It's finished, it's cheap, it's interesting, and overall not only is it more bang for your buck but it still supports Wolfire.\n\nIf Wolfire learns some better time management skills and gets things moving, I may rewrite this review after sampling new features and content. Until then, this is a bad deal, and an example of the shortcomings of both Steam Greenlight and, to a greater extent, the whole concept of 'early access' in game sales.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone gets snarky, I bought this game through Wolfire's website some time before it ever came to Steam. Also, I play games on a laptop, so sometimes I play games more than the time played record indicates. Now if you're going to make sarcastic comments at me, at least say something productive instead of trying to punch holes in my review, especially given that I at least tried to be fair.","February 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 537 of 820 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","537","820","0","25"

I want to say it has a bright future. The physics, the combat, the game engine itself, the platforming, are all *very* promising.  Unfortunately, in it's current state it simply (to me) not worth the backing cost at all.\n\nLately I've looked at my library, and I'm glad to say that out of all my titles, I regret very few purchases. Unfortunately, Overgrowth is a backing that for me is starting to look worthy of seeking a refund for. The speed of updates, the years it's been in development, and the.. state of the game/engine itself, (which grants me a low frame rate and crashes regardless of my settings, [important to note, I can run and enjoy GTAV and BF4 on this machine] even now), bring the centrally poised thumb downward.\n\nI won't say don't support them. And I am not yet decided on whether I would seek a refund with Wolfire Games.  I believe they are honest and don't spend the funds they receive wrongly necessarily, but I also can't say I think this price is worth what is offered. If this game does come to fruition within the next 1-2 decades, I'm sure it would be a great game, with a great engine, physics, combat based on said physics, and maybe an interesting story and (possibly?) multiplayer.\n\nAs of now, you are putting your faith, and money, into a product which, (for some reason I personally cannot run very well at all), is ultimately far from finished and contains very little replay value in my view.\n\nThat said, when/if this title is *ever* finished or near finished, I imagine it would certainly be worth this price, if not more.","May 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 98 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","73","98","135","11","6"

A lot has happened over the span of 9 years; Duke Nukem Forever and Th4f released and were both awful, Half Life 3 still isn't out (Though at this rate it'll be out before overgrowth even gets into beta) I've had my first alcoholic drink, I've found someone I love enough to marry, David Rosen, a man behind this project(?) who made me want to get into game development when I was younger cause of how much I loved Black Shades and Lugaru has said some unbelievably ignorant things on twitter, yet still, despite all of that, Overgrowth is still in alpha.\n\nThey update this game half as often as they used to since the game went on steam; Presumably because they have made the money they wanted to make off of this through early access.\n\nIt's tough to complain about a game that is still being updated because I'd be the first to say that I'd rather a game get developed long enough to be polished rather than release in an Ubisoft tier state of bugginess, but there comes a point where it's just time to let go.

If there were more updates and some actual hope that the project would be done, I'd recommend hands down, but as of now, it's been in "development" for years.

The combat system is probably the most intense and fast paced I've ever seen. This game also has some of my favorite fighting mechanics in any fighting game, ever. The rabbits and other animals move blindingly fast, and attack unrelentingly, with each single move possibly ending in death. If Tony Jaa was a rabbit he would be in this game. It's like my dream Redwall game but totally not for kids(although those books were pretty damn violent). The graphics are aesthetically pleasing, but the really impressive part is the near perfect animation of the characters. They move so freakin'  fast that it's hard to appreciate all the work that's gone into animating these animals, but when viewed in slow motion (available at any time by pressing tab) you'll see each character inflict gruesome wounds on each other and block/ dodge in a convincing dance of death. When you see detailed blood streams running down your rabbit avatar's face and dripping onto the cold snow after a gruesome fight you'll see what I mean.\n\nI played the alpha for this a bit prior to the steam release and while there's not really anything concrete to do yet I'm super excited to see where this goes. There's plenty of user created maps and stuff to mess around in too. Unfortunately the game kind of comes off as an early tech demo but so far the combat and parkour elements are super fun by themselves.\n\nThis game is a sequel to Lugaru HD, which came out quite a long time ago but featured the same peculiar rabbit on rabbit combat. The creator is Wolfire Games, who were responsible for organizing the first Humble Bundle. They deserve your money just for creating such an amazingly affordable method of pc game distribution while giving so much to charity!\n\nYou should probably get this if you have any interest in a brutal fast paced fighting game.

This game in the 2 years i have owned it has had very little meaningful aditions to it ,through out the 2 years i have had it there has only been a extra game mode ,that is a arena mode which has only one map for it and has you fighting against a certain amount of opponents each round which gets boring fast and some editor additions which allows you to construct your own maps which would be great if it was a little easier to use and really i am struggling to find more things that have been added because updates are few and far between and have very little meaningful additions to a average player i mean at one point i forgot about it for a long time and i was looking throught my game library and came across this again and thought to my self "hey i should have a look at this i havent played it in a while so surely there will be some new featuer that i could have some fun with " well boy was i shocked to find that when i started the game up there was literally nothing that i could see without going onto the fourms to find out what had been added well in the fourms i found that all that had been added were some bug fixes and some animation changes to the characters which by the way were not large changes at all.\n\nbut to wrap up my review, dont buy this game it has been in development for 7 years and this game is still feel naked there is alot of things missing from this game and quite honestly i dont think this game is ever going to be finished see how little substance there is to this game after 7 years. My recommendations are that if you are going to buy a game dont buy this one find a game that is either complete or is in early access and looks alot more promising and actaully has a update shedule and adds new content on a regualr basis the games that you can get for £22 are alot better than this game .

As I entered Campaign mode, I was thrown off by not one campaign with open-world gameplay, but 3, with set objectives for each. After discovering that I could not play 2 of the campaigns, I chose Gladiator, which forces you to fight for an infinite amount of time with infinite amounts of matches. Once in-game, I found it to be extremely buggy, with simple combat controls (LMB is the only way to attack). The graphics were alright, however, I found it annoying that the most common attack is a kick. Soon, the controls made more sense. I discovered how to duck and roll around like a wheel. Countering was difficult, but fun. The enemies were ridiculously difficult to defeat, but I got a 'kick' out of the ragdoll of their bodies and cheapshotting the other rabbits by throwing spears at them as soon as the match starts. Eventually, I found that you could revive all rabbits, including yourself, by simply hitting X. I used this to stay in the matches, even after I had died. Soon came the 'Lightning Key', as I called it, which allows your rabbit to send out a lightning bolt from his chest, instantly killing all other rabbits. I used this to get my skillset up to well over 2000. I had over 4 quadrillion fans, and my rabbit's apparel was completely black. The enemies were bugged by this point, being larger than the building itself, and simply put, a large mass of glitched black. They were impossible to defeat, and could kick me infinite distances. I crashed the game 4 times before I gave up this cheating lifestyle and moved on to beat all of the challenge missions, which, surprisingly, were ridiculously easy. This whole review may seem like I'm bashing on this game, but that is not the case.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game. I got Receiver with it, which I still actively play. I waited ever since I got Steam to get this game, so it was a relief when I finally played it for the first time. The countless bugs and glitches make this game awfully fun, and I think it has quite a bit of potential, once it actually gets out of Alpha.\n\n10/10","May 30, 2014","true","25.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","2"

Even as a game just getting off the ground it shows features many triple A titles seem to leave out. The AI is better than most, the physics and damage system is revolutionary, and above all it is a truly fun and enjoyable game ! When it comes to gameplay there are a few quirks, bugs can appear from time to time, and preformance is fairly limited even on beastly Pc's. But these are things we can expect from a game still in Beta. And besides that the gameplay is outstanding both un-armed and armed combat is a blast and doesnt take too long to get used to. From massive AI battles to one on one areana matches you cant stop having fun with this game.

Since the game isn't complete, I'm going to give my impressions of the current state of gameplay.\n\nWhat it is:  A game of exploration and combat with anthropomorphic animals.  Exploration is done by using physics based "parkour" on objects in the environment.  Combat is also physics based using punches, kicks, blocks, jumps, rolls, and melee weapons (which can be thrown and even caught).  It's probably better to view one of the many videos out there than try to comprehend my explanation of it here.  Don't worry, there are no spoilers yet, since there is no main game campaign as of the time I write this.\n\nThe initial Steam install contains some basic maps in which one can experience the gameplay.  There is a combat map where two people can fight matches on the same computer using keyboard/mouse and a controller.  While the mouse has an invert look option in the setup menu, the controller does not.  Another level is a simple arena where one can fight endless battles against the AI.  The AI doesn't currently have all the move sets possible to the player, but it's still quite capable of killing me!  It's probably the best single player experience available for the game so far.  The remaining maps are basic environments, sometimes with a few enemies to be defeated.\n\nIn addition to the basic installation, there are mods created by the community that are available for download and automatic installation via the Wolfire website and the SUMLauncher application, which is currently required for managing your game install.  Overgrowth can be launched directly from SUMLauncher or by Steam, but only launching through Steam allows access to the overlay and hours spent playing the game.\n\nThe community mods are a mixed bag.  Some haven't been updated with the game and will likely crash.  Most of the others suffer from poor level design and bad optimization.  Still, despite my personal criticisms, I have to say that the game seems wide open for modders to express their creativity and hone their skills.  It's a tinkerer's paradise, to be sure!\n\nShould you buy it?  If you want a polished and finished gaming experience, NO.  If you don't mind supporting a small developer who has built a framework for what could be a great adventure game in the future, then yes.  The potential is certainly there, and you could do worse.  As with any Early Access game, only buy it if you are willing to take the risk that what you buy is all you'll ever get.  Recommended, but with strong caution that you know what you're getting into.","August 30, 2015","true","16.9"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","3"

There hasn't been major changes or even new content in two years.\n\nBut lets go back to my history with the game,\nBack in the day (two years ago) the game was on a website, updates would come out once every week or so and new content was added some of those weeks, then roughly a year later the game gets released on steam. Yay! The people who bought the game on the website got a code for the new steam release. After the game gets released on steam people expected a major inprovement on the engine? maybe the graphics? oh and what about the combat? but nope, it was just another version of the game on steam. updates still kept coming out every week but all the updates about new content had and still have stopped and updates felt more like crappy patches than anything, the game kept crashing for no reason and I would be able to understand this because it's Early Access, and we all know that Early Access games arn't going to be bug free, but if the game keeps crashing for two years and the developer hasn't did anything about it? I really can't understand that. even if the developer would have released an update every three days it would still feel cheap.\n\nSo that's why im giving this game a negitive review, it was such a shame as I like the idea of a third person parkour, action game, the parkour even felt amazing when you mastered it and the combat was amazing yet brutal. But sadly there's just too many flaws with the game for me to justify thats it is worth £23.99.","January 3","false","4.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Hitting ESC turns your fighter into an AI while you go into an unorganized spawning menu and it's just a big mess. It's been in Alpha for as long as I remember, but it just barely makes progress.

(And no I don't mean that the Earth just engulfs your enemies when you're about to die)\n\nThe fighting is fast paced and based on a sort of skeletal structure, which means if you get hard enough, somethings going to break. IE. Throwing someone over your shoulder and it just so happens they land on their neck and it kills them, or you boot some poor soul hard enough you send him flying into a wall to have his spine broken and then he is paralyzed and no longer a problem.\n\nThe parkour, from what I've seen and is very fast paced, wall jumping, wall running, leaping great distances, this allows people to make very interesting and huge maps that require you to be a skilled ninja rabbit (Unlike me because I usually make my rabbits 8 feet tall and obese, so I can use that as an excuse as to why I can't parkour to even save my life) to succeed in such levels.\n\nSpeaking of creating very intense parkour levels and such, The Level editor is great for allowing you to, as I stated above to create interesting and unique levels whether it be a large scale battle with swords and spears or an intense ninja parkour challenge, or both, you are able to create it, and if you are too lazy to build an interesting map or the base game materials aren't enough for you, theres a program created for modding the game known as the SUMLauncher(Supported by the Devs themselves) which instantly downloads and places the files in the correct areas so you can use them with no hassle of moving the files yourself, this program has lots of user created mods that range from maps to characters to props.\n\nHowever the game is still in Alpha and if you're not the person to purhase early and follow a games progress untill its finished then perhaps wait until the game is finished as it is very worth it already in its current state, and I recommend getting it early and watching it grow and develop.","November 17, 2014","true","79.9"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","36","63","3","0"

There's an excellent sense of movement and weight to your character as they move, which makes the freerunning mechanics of game really shine. The combat is brutal, unforgiving and very fun. It's a simple left-click to attack and right-click to block, but add in the quick movement, sound and fantastic animation the combat is bliss. In it's current state there's also an arena mode that to allow you to only fight. It's very barebones, but it demonstrates the games excellent capabilities. The concept of ninja bunnies and other creatures like cats and dogs is great and I do look forward to how this idea will play out. The game is also easy to mod and has a solid creator tool for making your own environments and arenas. Did I mention the game has the best blood physics of any game I've ever seen?\n\nThe Bad\nFrom what I know Overgrowth has been in development for seven years and I've been playing it for two of those years. In all that time the game has changed very little. Since I got it in 2013, there have been a few new, but small features, new models, new items and a bevy of bug fixes. None of these however really changed the games experience or made it feel improved all that much. I understand some games take time to develop, but this is just silly given how much money you have to pay for the game. There's no campaign (yet) and there's very little voice acting aside from the occasional grunt and yell. The game also crashes, a lot. There's also a good deal of bugs, some even gamebreaking.\n\nSummary\nIt hurts to see such a good idea and base game stagnate. It's a lot of fun, but paying that price for something with such a lack of things to do, I just can't condone buying it right now. I can condone waiting for it to improve, but we've been waiting a very long time already so don't get your hopes up. If you really like freerunning ninja bunnies who beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of each other and you're willing to pay the price, you'll have plenty of fun for a while. If you're like me, someone who expected more for what they payed, add it to your wishlist and wait until a sale or until the game reaches a more complete state.\n\n6.5/10","November 15, 2015","false","6.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

In fact, I've never seen another openworld game quite like it. In it's present state, this game has tremendous potential and requires community support to see that potential realized. I feel that many Steam users have been spoiled by more polished alpha state games and expect the same from Overgrowth. This title is a reminder of what an EARLY ACCESS game really is. Developers bring their games to Steam in Early Access looking for community support to shape the game into something they want to play. This game is perfect for that concept. At the time of this review (update 206), Wolfire is focusing on the campaign mode for the game. However, there is plenty of room for change while the game remains in alpha. I highly recommend this game to anyone who finds it appealing. Everything this game has to offer is out in the open and plain to see. You are getting an openworld close quarters combat simulator. The physics are impressive, and the character models are a welcome break from the staples in the fantasy genre. If you are expecting a polished, complete game, stop looking at early access titles. Only get this game if you are willing to support Wolfire and see this game reach completion.","June 22, 2014","true","3.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

This has been my most anticipated game for the last 2 years.\n\nFinally being able to get my hands on a Steam release and even the alpha lives up to everything I had hoped for.\n\nBeing a ninja rabbit (or the other animals featured in the game) is such fun. Much joy. Many gameplay. Wow. The parkour elements are incredibly fluid and fun to execute. The climbing, wall running, and jumping all feel so satisfying that you'll find yourself doing it over and over again even without a clear goal to do so.\n\nThe combat system is fantastic. Technically very simple - very few buttons are used. The system however is incredibly deep and complex - very hard to master. All the characters, aside from being able to carry out loads of moves, can also pick up weapons to use in combat. Those can also be thrown (Which is a lot of fun)\n\nThe one mode which convinced me this game has neverended potential is the versus mode. Although only one map is featured, and the mode is literally "Player 1 tries to kill Player 2 while Player 2 tries to do kill Player 1" when me and my sister played it for the first time we spent 40+ minutes on it, constantly having fun. There was always some new combat move to execute, there was always some discovery to do - turning on slow motion and throwing swords at each other and watch them bounce back and kill us in recoil, chasing each other whilst throwing combat knives, doing nothing but jump kicks, etc.\n\nThe game at the current state also features some stealth elements, allowing you to sneak up on enemies and take them out silently rather than engaging in a fight.\nBest part? You can mod and change everything as you please.\nWant to make a map with 20 rabbits fighting to the death with dog bones on top of a giant mountain? You can.\nWant to make your own story map with characters, dialogue, jumping puzzles and combat? You can.\nWant to download mods and maps and new characters or try making your own? You can.\n\nI could go on for ages, but even for an alpha this game not only offers a lot of content, but provides something I really enjoy in games - The ability for the player to make their own content. To make their own world and fun, and I dont mean this in terms of the editor but in terms of gameplay. Hours can be spent on creating characters with various weaponry and then fighting them on maps you designed, Wolfire designed, or the community designed, OR hours can be spent doing parkour and slow motion flips as a ninja rabbit.\n\nIf this doesn't convince you to buy this game - I dont know what will.\nTotally worth the 30 bucks and I cant wait for more and more and more content to be continouly added such as the campaigns, more arenas, more versus maps (although you can already play Split Screen on any map downloaded) and of course the online multiplayer.\n\nAlready a candidate for game of the year.","January 3, 2014","true","12.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Every move is physics-based - when your rabbit punches, instead of animating a punch and reducing the opponent's health by 10, it properly simulates a rapidly moving fist, calculates pressure, and then applies damage based on relative velocity. All behind the scenes, so what you get is a cool fighting system that's really smooth.\n[-4] Infrequent updates. There's a lot already there, but the devs (a team of 3, by the way) release updates preeetty rarely.\n[-8] No real structure. A handful of challenges, and arena mode... that's it. This would be a deal-breaker if the blow wasn't lessened by the expansive level editor.\nOVERALL SCORE: +12","August 9, 2015","true","19.9"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","37","67","4","0"

I truly wish I never bought this 'game' almost 4 years ago. I am baffled as to why there are so many positive reviews of it. I feel as though the majority of people here are trying to justify their purchases. I respect all Early Access Games to an extent, but this product has been in Alpha for over 6 years now, and there is absolutely no difference in gameplay since the last time I played it.\n\nThe developer has focused all his time improving the physics and game engine for 4 years, which is not acceptable at all. Especially considering the fact that the changes are not noticable at all. There doesn't appear to be any core aim to this product at all, to me it is nothing but a ragdoll rabbit fighting game that gets tiresome after 20 minutes of playing.\n\nI am shocked they are charging £22.99 for this. Before buying this, please have a look at the older Alpha videos on Youtube; for example Alpha 109. (The current being 205...) and judge for yourself wether you do in fact see any changes.\n\n\n(EDIT: 2016, January 29th) Wow. It has been years since I posted this review. Played it again just now to see that absolutely nothing has changed.

I played Lugaru at an early age and in these following years I have been awaiting Overgrowths release for years. It is and definitely will become (if it ever is finished) an amazing game in the years to come. I really enjoy this game but with no story it gets boring very quickly and please read before judging me as I do enjoy this game but many reasons make up why I don't recommend it.\nPros:\n•Gameplay is awesome and action packed\n•Physics are awesome\n•You can play as ninja rabbits, dogs, rats, cats, wolves, hares.\n•Graphics are good and blood is quite realistic\n\nCons:\n•Been in development since 2008 (Most new games an indie team makes game in year or less to release into early access, this game has been in early access for 7 years now and the team consists of 4 people)\n•Boring with no real story\n•Glitchy at times and you can't say 'its understandable' as its in early access FOR 7 YEARS! (I understand most other indie games are released really buggy and some not with such good physics and great graphics as Overgrowth, although I fail to see why it has taken so long and updates consist of minimal changes at times)\n\nOverall it's a good game with a lot of potential but then again this potential has still taken 7+ years to unveil itself and I am not sure at this rate of updates (about once every few months) that it will become great in a short space of time. It could mould into an open world/parkour/survival game where you kill other animals for pleasure or food, build a hut to live in, etc,  etc. The future of this game is in the devs hands and it doesn't seem they know what to do with it. They have had more than enough time to at least make it something better and they have failed to do so. I think they can still improve and make this an amazing game, but for now its not recommended by me.\n\nNote: Its been 8 months now since I wrote this review and still, main thing being added in updates is bug fixes. Take a look for yourself, this was  the most recent update (in a while)\n\nNew arena mode\nMajor optimizations like instancing and z-prepass\nOption for simplified shadow rendering to greatly improve performance on slower GPU\nCan enable and disable mods from different folders, instead of having to overwrite game data\nPost processing including color grading and HDR bloom\nGlobal illumination through tetrahedral light probe mesh\nUpdated renderer from OpenGL 2.2 to 3.2 core\nScript improvements (dictionary support, script fragments, etc)\nFixed arena crash bug (usually when a level ends in which weapons were used)\nCommand line flags to load specific levels or alter config\n\nNew update:\nAdded 3  New Arenas: Cave Arena, Magma Arena and Waterfall Arena. Story Mode now has levels although as soon as I load them it crashes the game","March 20, 2015","false","10.1"," 36 of 67 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","36","67","2","19"

However I am basing this review off of "Is it worth the money?" and the answer is no. This game has been in developement for over 8 years and is still in alpha. I have had this game for over 2 years and heres my experience with it:\n\nThe game has very little maps to play on, which are limited to arena, player vs player(Local Only), and then some random empty maps with no enemys. So basically you have to download maps out of the community content, which is where this game ultimatly faults. There are many errors and glitches which cause your whole game to crash, the game will also run very unstable on these maps.\n\nSo being that the custom maps are what generate most of the enjoyment in this game, and that they are subject to consistant crashing, and unstable gameplay, then I would not recommend this title to anyone for the time being. Hopefully in the future, the developers will bring this game into beta and have more content present for us. Right now though this game is very bare bones and it's only chance of being fully enjoyed is in the hands of modders that either create unstable content, or content this unstable early access game can't handle.","March 15","false","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At this rate the game might be done in... let's say 20 or more years. It's fun for a bit but pricey for such little content.

Do you like karate? Do you like animals beating the living crap out of each other? Then you will love this game. There are about 7 different races of animals to play as (all mammals) rabbit, rat, cat, wolf, dog, and ROBOBUNNY! Each has its own attributes, rabbits jump high, rats are short- derp, cats... i dont know what cats do yet, wolves are one hit killers, i have no idea what dogs do, and robobunnies cause lag.There is plenty of things to do in this game, will without campaign- sadly, there is still a large sand box allowing you to make custom levels and even your own campaign, dialog, outfits (in a way). While this game advertises parkour, i still have yet to climb to the top of the most simpliest of pillars, but it is an indie game and i soon hope to see some improvements and more content. To top it off, the controls are responsive, good karate moves, fun with sharp things, and great mechanics, but to every good reveiw there is a bad part. This game is more for higher end computers, the game is lacking in content like a campaign, and ironically hitting people causes lag- which is a good thing because its not like the point of the game is to hit anyone right?  Now for the only part you are probably going to read, do i suggest this game? What you see in the video on the store page is pretty much all there is to it, but it is already well polished and even if you arent interested in it now, jump on and when the game hits its full price you might like it, or just buy it to support the devs. Anyways thanks for reading these last few sentences, or really thank for reading this paragraph i forked 10 minutes over to.\nWhat you need devs, is to fix some weps (dog hammer, glaive, ect) and co-op, i have been enjoying the rabbit dropkicking goodness that is this game for almost a year, which means the versus isnt really doing it for me and my cousin. so if you could add co-op challenges, maps, or arenas, i would be most greatful.

As others have said, it only recently came out on Steam and I've had it for over a year now. In that time, I have had a lot of fun with the combat system, and the fairly recent addition of the arena is a blast. However over the course of a full year very little progress has been made with the game, and I really am hoping one day to see a full open world that we can explore while fighting enemies along the way. Nothing like that is implemented yet though, so I don't think I can recommend this until it is. Obviously the combat is a blast, but other than that there's just not enough content here to warrant a thirty dollar purchase, IMO. Nevertheless, keep an eye out, because like I said this game definetly has the most brutal and enjoyable and 'realistic' combat system around!","December 30, 2013","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Take for example Call of Duty where you have much more health than the AI opponenets. Of course there is also a need of skill in Call of Duty, all i'm trying to say is that Overgrowth is very unique on those two exact points. And for this point i count it as a pro, but someone else could easily count it as a con, so as i said in the beginning, these are just my opinions.\n- I've always loved gladiator games/modes and the arena mode in Overgrowth is a great idea. But as much as this is a pro, it's also a con, becuase i feel that they could have improved the mode so much. For example they could have added the actual possibility to achive something like a new rank, so you could compete global. Take for example the Fifa Ultimate Team mode, they feature divisions, and if you win enough games out of 10, you move up. They could add things like this to make the game mode a game for itself.\n- Superpowers without superpowers. I love how you can jump high, long and run on walls, but what i love even more is that everyone else can too. You're not overpowered in any unfair way, it is just plain fun! Just as before this may be a pro for some, and a con for others.\n- The realism. The fact that some kicks and punches are more lethal compared to others, and it is a mather of the placement. The fact that if you get kicked into a wall you are most likely to suffer dramatically more damage, and you're most likely dead if it was the second kick or punch. Just as before this may be a pro for some, and a con for others.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of worked through gamemodes. As fun as the game is, no matter how much you like it. Killing the same old rabbit without achieving anything just becomes boring at some stage.\n- Multiplayer. I really wish that they at some point will add multiplayer to the game.\n- The fact that they haven't made one proper level yet also is a bad disappointing.\n- The sounds aren't really that satisfying, you could really wish for some better sound effects when the combat system is so great, but the sound just dosen't match you lethal and awesome kicks.\n\nFinally my score for this game would be 8/10\n\nThat was all i could think off first handed.

There are plenty of levels that people have created where you're given a huge tower to climb or have to fight enemies, but there are currently no campaign levels created by the developers themselves.\n\nAt the moment, Overgrowth is little more than a level editor with decent (but shallow and fairly limited) combat. With the combat being as limited as it is, there doesn't feel like much reason to play the game right now which is made worse by the lack of multiplayer. From the sporadic updates the devs give on their YouTube channel, it seems likely that the game will end up being genuinely good once the game has some focused level design. However, considering it has been in development for six years and has only a small possibility of being in beta by the end of the year, it's not really worth spending £22 on what is (currently) a glorified level editor. Once the developers release the full campaign mode (which is unlikely to happen for a while) I will probably be able to recommend Overgrowth.\n\nUntil the game is fully finished, I would recommend holding off on purchasing it and seeing whether you think the full game is worth it.","June 11, 2014","false","5.4"," 47 of 89 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","47","89","0","6"

However, the reason I don't reccomend it is because it's barely a game yet. There's nothing to do other than the fight mechanics which get quite boring and abusable after a while. They are good at first, but the only challenge the game can add is more health or faster attacks from enemies. The amount of good levels is sparse and there aren't enough ingame objects to make very good levels yet. Also, updates roll out painfully slow. This game has been in develoment for years and still isn't very fun for long periods of time.\n\nOverall, it's a good concept but seriously needs some more work before I can reccomend it.

For where Overgrowth is at now, it shows great potential of being a great third-person fighting game with anthropomorphic animals, but don't let the latter turn you off. The fighting mechanics are easy to learn, but difficult to master, with precise timing being the key to whether you defeat you opponent or you ♥♥♥♥♥ing pummeled to the ground. The game also shows off its beauty with a very gorgeous engine, with the models of each character being well-detailed and constructed, and the enviorments, although simple, showing off some very interesting architecture. The technology for the damage system is quite nice as well, with it being based off skeletal-like models, and recieving more or less damage in certain areas and how hard the impact is on the models. Weapon combat, just like in hand-to-hand combat, is very difficult to master, since the reaction time needed to block and parry attacks will determine whether you instantly get killed or come out unscathed. With the weapon combat comes the very nice blood decals, with every slice, stab, and thrown weapon leaving a nice, sharp cut or hole of blood on the body, probably the most realistic i've seen thus far in video games, though it only leaves blood marks and doesn't show signs of any physical degradation.\n\nBut probably one of the biggest strong points of Overgrowth is its editor, which leaves the user to creating their own maps, missions, and stories to their hearts content. With the devs leaving a fairly abundent assortment of props, enviorments, path-finding and other tools to the user's disposal, it leaves the user with their imagination on what they wish to create, or what they want to test. Though it will take time getting used to a rather bare-bones UI, the capabilities given supplies the user a tool that will keep the game alive from now until hopefully way long after release.\n\nAlthough Overgrowth is still in development, it shows its technologic capabilities greatly, leaving only a few bugs and still incorporating mechanics like stealth into the mix. Although non-existant, it will be left to the users imagination what the story of Overgrowth will be about, and how our favorite ninja-rabbit Turner is doing after the events of Lugaru.","February 9, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(back when it wasn't on Steam) There is still no end in sight and the progress isn't all that impressive even with the additional employees. It's a shame, because the actual gameplay is great. They could have released this 3-4 years ago with glowing recommendations from the highest outlest (as the game had some media buzz a few years back). If only they focused on online multiplayer! Instead time was wasted with pointless feature creep and obsessive early optimizations.\n\nOnce this game gets online multiplayer (which was promised on the website!) and steam workshop support it will be a great game, but not earlier.

Ever since I backed the project (what has been maybe a year or two ago) I've seen NO visible changes in the game. Sure, every couple months there's the occasional bug fix, but these usually deal with some animation issue or a minor tweak to combat that you never noticed anyway. The larger bugs, such as the constant crashes or failing to load, the developers have steered clear of and have not attempted to fix in any way.\n\nHowever, there is one pro to the game - it has, what I consider, the absolute BEST combat in any game out there. It feels like you're really in the action, allowing you to control exactly how you hit while keeping the game very quick paced (and it manages to do this without the "mash X to kill" technique many games use - if you haven't looked up the controls, go do it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised). As such, if you find you enjoy sitting in the arena and fighting a couple rounds every once in a while, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. However, you shouldn't expect any more progress to be made on it - not now, not ever - because it simply isn't coming.","September 12, 2015","false","15.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The overall look of the world and design of characters is both beautiful and unique.\n\nSadly this game has been in development for several years and will most likely not be completed any time soon.\n\nBut if you're like me and enjoying setting up your own missions and levels then you'll have hours of fun.

WILL be, but IS NOT. I paid 30 bucks and i havn't been able to entertain myself for more than five minutes in one sitting. Although this game has great physics and is fun as all hell to play with a friend, it only takes you like a fight or two before you're just running around. As this stands, which currently I don't think is fair to price at 30 bucks, I would have to say do not buy this game. Maybe a decade from now when the next update comes out they'll add another map.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent physics fighting and character animations\n-Overall concept is solid (but not fully backed with story)\n-Controller compatable\n-Art and play style is unique enough to label this game as its own genre\n\nCons: (keep in mind these end up like a rant)\n-I've seen one update since I bought it, and that was like over three or four months ago\n-On the same note: update history is really really bad. Being both very far apart and little changes made\n-I have not found any kind of story mode or arcade mode of any kind to give you a goal.\n-The two modes that are most prominant are still really bland. Versus in a giant field with a single rock in the middle, and the arena mode is just a big box you fight in.\n-I still have not determined what the point of having different races is in the versus mode if they haven't been given any real balancing to make them unique. Changing from a bunny to rat only really makes you smaller, but you seem to still do the same damage and have the same health.\n-Weapon combat still seems really awkward, you either slash the enemy down in one swing, or you just throw your weapon and they cant block it.\n-The development of any kind of goal in the game is nowhere to be seen. I've seen dev videos showing new things and mechanics spotlights, but where the hell are the missions and challenges? We can't just fight the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI the entire time, theres nothing else to do. Not even a town to go talk to people in a free roam map or anything, no character names with stories or a world to explore and get sucked into the game with. Just... Pick your little map thing and play it for a minute, then close the game.\n\nI apologize for how long the cons were, but really this is a game that needs some major love. I wish i could recommend it to people, I'd like to see it go somewhere. With the condition its in, that will never be the case. The dev's are just pocketing the profit from whoever falls for the cool trailers of fighting. If you see this for a dollar, buy it!

At this point, the game is pretty bare, but the potential is astounding, and the physics engine is phenominal; I don't think I've ever played in a better physics sandbox, actually. Combat is simple, but fast and fun. There's a stealth system, a weapons system, a massive array of easy to use world building tools, diverse character models, and the list goes on.\n\nEven in this early build, the game's combat can stand up to that of any action or figthing game out there. Since the player's power level is the same as each NPC, the game quickly becomes about skill and coordination, and in that aspect the game is very rewarding. You'll never find an opponent that you can't take on, and the only thing limiting your advancement is yourself.\n\nOh, and the game also has a really fun parkour system. Overall, Overgrowth is ♥♥♥♥ing fun, and is my favorite Early Access game. Totally worth the $30 price tag. I can't wait to see how it turns out.\n\n(08/21/2014)\n\nEDIT: My Steam notes that I only have 2 hours on record for this game. In fact, I've owned the game for longer than it's been on Steam, and have only recently begun launching the game via Steam.

But I'm going to do an honest to goodness sales pitch here. It's for an amazing title that I have been following for a long time. Overgrowth by Wolfire. (http://blog.wolfire.com/2014/01/Overgrowth-a205-video-changelog) blog here.\nThis is a Third Person fighting game with a key focus on ninja rabbits.\nThe fighting is very bushido-blade esque. As in, each fight is a challenge. You will feel on the edge of your seat and you never quite know what will happen next. Not to mention, each fight is very free form.\nFighting an enemy with a sword? You can either stab them with it, or while they are charging you, throw the damn sword at them. However, this is where the game gets interesting. Most AI nowadays would just eat the spear and call it good. This AI however, is already sophisticated enough (In alpha mind you) to not only dodge the sword, but catch the sword, in mid throw, and then chase you with it\nEach fight is as dynamic as you want it to be. One of my favorites was I was in a free for all. (1v1v1v1) and it was down to me and the last enemy. He had me cornered, so using the games awesome parkour system, I ran up the wall, backflipped over the enemy, gave myself a space advantage, sweep his legs from under him and kicked him in his dumbass rabbit face.\nAnother thing, as stated in his video in his blog, the dev states 'Its 2014, and I believe that people shouldn't have to restart their game in order to see graphic changes from the settings.' So if you switch your graphical settings, no restart needed. It happens in real time, and get this. Since the pause menu is literally just a popup box over the game, you will get to see the changes happen.\nNow, here is where a lot of people would be like ugh no.\nIt is still an EARLY alpha. Like I'm talking command prompt boots from it. It still is kinda crashy, and its 30.00.\nBut trust me, this is a great investment. And you get a free game of Receiver from it.\nThe dev is actively working on it, posting constant updates on his blog with youtube videos describing what changes in every patch.\nThis is worth the 30.00 investment, trust me.","May 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/recommended/25000/","SrAwesome","sjcbcolby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SrAwesome/","205 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI like this game a lot, event though it's still very much in developement, it's still enjoyable. I always enjoy finding games that have some new twist to them and this is one of them. It's a game about kung-fu rabbits,as a like to say (eventhough it has dogs, rats, cats, and wolves also). though it lacks in super combo moves, ang the ability to shoot lasers, and what not that you might see in other games, you know which ones i'm talking about that say theyre all about martial arts and such, but honestly, im happey this game lacks in that stuff. it keeps it real... or at least as real as "kung- fu bunnies" gets. This game really stands out to me for a few things, it's fighting with phisics, sceletal structure, parkour, dynamic AI, how damage is shown, armed combat vs hand to hand, and last but not least the ears. Now when I say that this game keeps it real, i mean really real. I say this because of the fighting with phisics I mentioned. what this meants is that when you get hit, its not a set amount of damage that is done, its all in how you get hit, where you get hit, what you get hit into etc. and they do an outstanding job with this. for example, lets say that some one punched you in the arm, of course you arent going to die, if they punch you in the leg you will probaably be fine, but once they hit you in the head chances are, you're going to die. Also  moving into to sceletal structure at the same time, if they do hit you in the arm or leg enough, it will break that bone and you will be considered defeated. also like i said what you get hit into, if you get round house kicked in the side, you might be able to roll it off, but if you get round house kicked into a wall you're taking some damage from the kick and that much more from the wall therefore doubleing your damage and potentialy causeing your enemy to hit something critical and most likely defeating them. Also, parkour was a great addition thanks to some of the things you can do. You can wall run, do flips over stuff, ledge grab just about anything you should be able to,  and more. this is great in combat if you use it well, for example, if someone is chasing you, you can wall run up the wall, jump off (even do a flip off of it if you're feeling styleish ;P)grab a ledge pull yourself up and fluip off and "leg cannon" your enemy. also what sets this game appart is the dynamic AI. in this game, if you dare button mash, you are almost guarenteed to lose, if you just keep swinging at your enemy you will lose, if you never throw a punch, you will lose. The AI will learn any patters you make or tendencies of yours and will adapt, you must continuously change your fighting style and mix things up or else, chances are, the AI will catch on. Moving on tho combat and how damage is shown more.most of the time, damage isn't shown. you just have to guess, but often times there is some blood you can see dribble down you character and drip (bonus point to that because, you dont always bleed the same way) although it's easier to tell with armed combat vs unarmed, in unarmed since it's all blunt damage it's almost impossible to tell whereas in armed combat, unless you get hit with a dagger it's a instakill. with daggers it may take a few swings (depending how you use it).  If you do get hit by a dagger, it's easier to judge damage due to showing externally, you can get scratched just about anywhere and it will show, also if heavily damaged, your character may go slightly limp and grasp his chest/ the injury. my point is, it's realistic how it show damage, you cant always see it but sometimes it thows up quite well, but unlike some games, it wont show up the same way every time. then moving on to combat a little more, theres armed and unarmed, for both you can parry/ block or counter hits, you can perform stealth kills, etc. unlike most games though, any weapon you hold you can throw it aty your enemy, and if theyre good enough they can catch it (and vise versa). However armed combat for he most part is hit block hit block, for unarmed it's a bit more interesting such as something that goes: you punch, enemy counters by pulling your arm in attempt to flip you on your back, you then notice this and counter by pulling your arm back and return the favor with a punch to the head, but you were too slow and they ducked and kicked your legs out from under you, you are critically hurt but prevent furtherdamage by rolling it off, the enemy then tries to kick you again but you grab his leg and flip him backwards, before the enemy can recover from being thrown onto the ground you curb stomp them and end the fight. this is the awesome combat in the game in addition to the parkour type stuff I said before. lastly, like I said, the ears. this is really small but I love it, little things like ears or tales move and flail in accordance to witch way you move. To wrap this up I would like to appologise for this giant unatractive wall of tet, typos and all. I highly recomend this game, get it when a sale comes but it is the finest hand to hand combat I have experienced in a game to this day (unless im totally blanking out wich I doubt). It's still in developement but its still very enertaining. (and if you're up for a challenge fight and revieve your enemies so they are even more adapted to your strategies).","August 2, 2014","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, this game is great and has Game of The Year potential, but right now there isn't much to do besides fighting at the arena, which after proggesing to harder stages, becomes literally impossible to defeat the giant colored blobs that are 10x faster and stronger than you (this is a reference to one of the major bugs of the game), or you can fight at the maps given, but quickly becomes boring, but yes, you can spawn other rabbits to fight by your side or enemies and make a small battle, but the game is constantly crashing . One interesting feature is the combat engine in Overgrowth, which left me speechless. It's extremely realistic and you must survive a fight by doging, jumping, and countering and blocking your enemies at just the right time.You can also stop the violence and just parkour around a map and run across the walls.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is, save your money for now, because the $29.99 isn't worth it until they add the campaign and more features, not to mention the many bugs in the game.\n\nPROS\n-Great fighting engine\n-Cool slow-mo feature\n-You can do parkour\n-You're a rabbit\n\nCONS\n-Rarely updates\n-Graphics are ehh\n-Crappy music\n-Little to do\n\nAnd yes,before you say anything, I am well informed that this game is still in Alpha stages.","December 31, 2013","false","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very early alpha and the content is minimal but it loads so fast that you can just jump in and out whenever you feel like it. It's also extremely graphic because of how the damage system works. You don't have HP, you have a skeleton that can be broken.\nFrom watching people play you would think that it has a complicated control scheme but it couldn't be simpler. Left click is attack and right click is block. The combat reminds me of Assassin's creed but less one-sided toward the player. The AI stands a chance against you. In fact, You're going to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you more often than not at first.\nGreat fun.

I had never even heard of Overgrowth until it came to steam only recently and it had been in development years before it even came to steam. I quickly became curious and watched videos on it online to see what the fuss was all about. This game has the potential for greatness. Overgrowth is a third person action game that has some of the most impressive physics combat I've seen. For an independently made game It is an absolute blast to get into a brawl with enemies and come out on top. However with the game being in production it isnt really a game... You see, when you log in to the menu it gives you a variety of premade maps to mess about in. There is no single player story to be had and there are some challenge modes that are very lack luster. However once you choose a map there is an ingame editor that lets you spawn objects, enemies and tweak with the games settings sort of like Little Big Planet. This is where things get interesting. You can create different senarios to the existing maps and can even share your creations online with other players and friends. It is a bit of an ordeal to do this as you have to sign up for the developers fourms and other time comsuming methods to get it working properly. However once it is done you never have to do it again and it is painless from there on out to share your work. I have to admit the price tag for an unfinished game is hard to justify, but this is purely a chance for the developers to show people their game and to promote it. I think Overgrowth has some great ideas to become an awesome game and It is worth to give it a shot. Not only will it help an independent game developer but give this game the attention it deserves.","February 2, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This mode simply pits the player against one to three AI opponents, round after round, with the objective being not to die. Sometimes the round will be a 2v2, sometimes it’ll be a 1v1, and other times it’s a free-for-all. It is a perfect mode to highlight the most interesting thing about Overgrowth, the combat, and a wonderful place to refine the skills needed to comprehend what’s going on.","February 15, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game will soon be the sequel to the game Lugaru, a full campaign you should check out. For the moment, you can only play pre-made levels such as Dropping In, Gladiatior, Two Bunnies Enter, One Bunny Leaves, etc. This game caught my eye, mainly because of the fact that there were bunnies in it, and I love bunnies SOO MUCH! Let's get on with the review.\n\nStory: 0/10\nOvergrowth at the moment has no storyline but is bound to have one in the full release... at least some missions in later builds. I will change this section when that happens though.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nThis game has beautiful landscape, amazing artstyle, and cool charactor designs. The blood could look a little more realistic, though.\n\nMechanics: 9/10\nThe mechanics and programming of the game is great. There are a lot of things to do such as Climbing, Rolling, Aerial Attacks, Sweeps, Dodging, Ninja Crouching, Throwing bunnies over your shoulder, Throwing bunnies over your shoulder and then curb-stomping them (which is SO satisfying), and much, much more.\n\nControls: 9.5/10\nThere's really nothing wrong with the controls. 1-9 changes your player model, jump then hold RMB to cling to ledges (sometimes it flings you upwards then you "accidently" roll and satisfyingly break your neck), LMB attacks, Shift to roll, and other basic controls. I would have given it a 10/10, if it weren't for the "hold [W,A,S, or D] then you do this [Random attack that never works]" bs.\n\nOverall: 8.95/10\nAs you can tell, this is an amazing game. Not a lot of content, but it is still in early access (As of 2/16/2014), so that can change.","February 16, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But dont let that stop you from getting it.\n\nOvergrowht has great gameplay. The game can be very difficult at times, with smart enemy AI and weapons that would kill you just as fast as in real life. The fighting goes hand in hand with the parcour. Walljumps and ledge climbing can get you almost anywhere, but they can be just as usefull when outnumbered to escape or make counter attack easier to pull off.\n\nGraphic whise the game looks pretty nice, every species has it's own culture and with it weapons, clothing and more. For now the rabbit's appear to be the main focus. However, there are more kinds of characters implemented allready\n\nConcluding, the game in this stage has some very interesting gameplay mechanics but is'nt finished right now.\nOvergrowht is a promising game and I can't wait to see the final product.","December 20, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But dont let that stop you from getting it.\n\nOvergrowht has great gameplay. The game can be very difficult at times, with smart enemy AI and weapons that would kill you just as fast as in real life. The fighting goes hand in hand with the parcour. Walljumps and ledge climbing can get you almost anywhere, but they can be just as usefull when outnumbered to escape or make counter attack easier to pull off.\n\nGraphic whise the game looks pretty nice, every species has it's own culture and with it weapons, clothing and more. For now the rabbit's appear to be the main focus. However, there are more kinds of characters implemented allready\n\nConcluding, the game in this stage has some very interesting gameplay mechanics but is'nt finished right now.\nOvergrowht is a promising game and I can't wait to see the final product.","December 20, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controller support that runs smoothly into 2 player co-op whether it is split screen or one camera.\n\nThe combat is delicious and really requires thought and precision. You can even slow done time as to think about your moves carefully and to make cool cinematics. You can level edit and even play custom levels (You have to download them of other websites but it should be getting steam workshop soon).\n\nI don't normally give ratings out of 10 but if I had to I would give it a 9/10.

Don't get me wrong, this game is great and has Game of The Year potential, but right now there isn't much to do besides fighting at the arena, which after proggesing to harder stages, becomes literally impossible to defeat the giant colored blobs that are 10x faster and stronger than you (this is a reference to one of the major bugs of the game), or you can fight at the maps given, but quickly becomes boring, but yes, you can spawn other rabbits to fight by your side or enemies and make a small battle, but the game is constantly crashing . One interesting feature is the combat engine in Overgrowth, which left me speechless. It's extremely realistic and you must survive a fight by doging, jumping, and countering and blocking your enemies at just the right time.You can also stop the violence and just parkour around a map and run across the walls.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is, save your money for now, because the $29.99 isn't worth it until they add the campaign and more features, not to mention the many bugs in the game.\n\nPROS\n-Great fighting engine\n-Cool slow-mo feature\n-You can do parkour\n-You're a rabbit\n\nCONS\n-Rarely updates\n-Graphics are ehh\n-Crappy music\n-Little to do\n\nAnd yes,before you say anything, I am well informed that this game is still in Alpha stages.","December 31, 2013","false","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Buy it now. There is not that much content, but you be assured it will come over time. This is probably the best Alpha stage game I have EVER played. The combat? 10/10. The action and movement? 11/10. The game feels amazingly fluid and fun, like Assassin's Creed's and Mirrors Edge had a child! The art is stunning - the blood and injuries are genius in design, they look hyper-realistic! The audio is amazing as well, there are over 2500 sound files, which make all the sounds varied and realistic. The physics add a whole new level to the gameplay; you can drop your weapon from a large height and brutally murder someone using only gravity!\nThe only missing aspect is a full campaign - there is currently only an Arena and some challenge levels, but many more full levels are promised. Everything else is in place, and you can make your own levels with dialogue, stealth elements, characters, enemies, and everything in-between! The AI is also some of the best I have ever seen - it enriches the combat 10 fold!

But if you read his Twitter he's starting to pick up the pace and is soon going to hire more people, so far everything he's done in this game is pretty much superior to all these triple AAA games that create a new and super buggy game every year. The Core mechanics of the game are solid and he's obviously worked very hard to bring it from the ground up like this from scratch. I hate the talking down upon this amazing work he's done, I do agree Wolfire needs some new recruits if he wants to progress this game. Although it's taken a long time many mods give you plenty of more hours of this game and I've been designing my own map, character, and story; With the map editor and character action editors...\nBut seriously, is really being negative about what he's doing the best option? Why not tell him that he's doing great with all these nice things, but these small little changes like ear twitches should not be the best thing to work on at the moment. What I say he  really should begin working on is the story, mechanics, physics, animation, and levels. I believe hiring people to work on the small stuff like minor bug fixes, small improvements, concept ideas, multiplayer, performance, and graphics. While the main developers can work on what's truly important, the story, level design, and gameplay. I believe we should start motivating David, because he is very talented in what he does but he needs support not negativety for making a amazing game from scratch. We just need to talk him into hiring people that he can trust to help him code, having a team of 10 could possibly durastically increase game production. So please hear me out when I say these things and think about it for a second and help us snap David out of the endless minor improvements so we can have a GREAT GAME!!\n\n\n*EDIT*\n\nSadly as many as come to realize david has made no true efforts to impove his game to a state of "bang for your buck" in terms of it's still $30 dollars and there are many other games out there that have way more content, value and quality than this game can provide. I would call this a $10 dollar game at most. Seems like it will never make progress into a full game like I anticipated, with my hopes of a awesome game crushed due to procrastination and the pursuit of easy money; I will definitely take this game off my reccomended list many should do the same, so people aren't caught in a trap of this same excitement when they first see the game only to be punched in the mouth and get hardly any value for what the person paid. I do not reccomend this anymore.","May 1, 2015","false","60.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Buy it now. There is not that much content, but you be assured it will come over time. This is probably the best Alpha stage game I have EVER played. The combat? 10/10. The action and movement? 11/10. The game feels amazingly fluid and fun, like Assassin's Creed's and Mirrors Edge had a child! The art is stunning - the blood and injuries are genius in design, they look hyper-realistic! The audio is amazing as well, there are over 2500 sound files, which make all the sounds varied and realistic. The physics add a whole new level to the gameplay; you can drop your weapon from a large height and brutally murder someone using only gravity!\nThe only missing aspect is a full campaign - there is currently only an Arena and some challenge levels, but many more full levels are promised. Everything else is in place, and you can make your own levels with dialogue, stealth elements, characters, enemies, and everything in-between! The AI is also some of the best I have ever seen - it enriches the combat 10 fold! There are a few minor things that could be improved, but so far it has been an amazing experience.\nFor a game in its alpha stages, made by an indie team of four guys, this is literally a masterpiece.","December 21, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The good thing about this game is that its in alpha so there will be amazing things to come.\nWhat i found amazing about this game is that it is based off a skeleton system meaning that there is no health bar just your body so it is like if you jump and land on your neck you die unless you go into editor mode (yes this game has and editor mode) you can change your characters attributes like his strength, attack speed, run speed ect.\nNow for the attacks you can do\n1. You can punch (no dip).\n2. You can kick.\n3. You can drop kick (figured to put it below because its basically an instant kill).\n4. You can stab or slash.\n5. You can choke people from behind.\n6. You can throw your weapons.\n7. The most interesting thing i think is the counter attack (this feature is what i think is a good feature)","January 7, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most people will buy Overgrowth expecting to be able to get right into it and play it, This is not true at all. This is just a very user friendly engine that allows new players to: Join, get confused, hit things, get bored, and leave. At this point in the development I feel as though this developer is not actually doing anything with the engine. He makes updates every other month that include changing shadows a bit or tweaking that small bush on the edge of the map that was overlapping with a rock. This game would be better off being handed to a better developer who could actually make a game out of it.\n\nThat being said I think it's still a very fun toy that you can play with and get bored of in about 2 hours.

I have had it in my library for 2 years, and I have seen progress, but I have been told that it has been in development for much longer. Honestly, if you check it out, its a good distraction for a few hours, and the gameplay is fun. I would say the fighting system is also somewhat innovative. But I feel like this game will never be released, 4+ years in development and no clear timeline doesn't bode well. If you can get it on sale, do it, but not being a full game, there is no way to justify a $30 price tag.

But i can assure you it isn't. It's very alive. If you want to see the developement they usually have a OGWeekly episode on twitch every 2 weeks on sundays. They also hired new members onto the team. Alright now that thats out of the way. I have been with overgrowth for a long time now, and I can say it's getting better and better every update. They have a-lot of planned  interesting stuff for this game.  Alright lets get into the mechanics, the combat is solid! The stealth seems a bit too easy but it is working pretty well. And the parkour is AMAZING. Oh yeah, and they have a level editor built in. I would suggest looking of gameplay on YouTube for this game before purchase. But I think i have covered everything in this review. So I am bringing it to a close. Think about buying this game and ask yourself is it worth it or could I live without it?","January 10","true","38.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The thing is, I really don't.\nI bought Overgrowth years ago, and even though a lot of work has been put into it since, it's very much the same game I played back then. It looks better, has more character models, better UI, all that good stuff. BUT it still doesn't have any substance. It's not a sequel to Lugaru, it's a sandbox tech demo, where you can play around with the Overgrowth engine. And to be fair, the Steam store description and Early Access information both make this very clear.\n\nI have no doubt that if Overgrowth ever gets finished it'll be worth the $30€ price tag. But right now, I wouldn't recommend buying it. People interested in Overgrowth for what it is currently will  buy it regardless of my recommendation, but I think people looking for a game, should definitely wait, unless they're willing to think of the purchase as a pre-order with an undefined release date.\n\nA bit of perspective:Things that have happened while Overgrowth has been in development: Barack Obama get's elected president of the United States, Apple debuted the iPad, the first solar-sail tech demonstration is produced, Osama bin Laden is killed, Japan suffers the effects of a massive earthquake and a tsunami, the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico causing the worst marine enviromental disaster in US history, 3d printers and scanners enter the consumer market, mouse genome is fully sequenced, world population breaks the 7 billion mark, usb 3.0 is introduced, 22nm chips begin mass production, Curiosity is launched and lands on mars, I got married, got a job, lost the job, moved houses four times and learned to juggle.\n\nOvergrowth is the indie Daikatana. Except unlike Daikatana, Overgrowth when finished will be awesome, and not the most mediocre entry in its genre.","June 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(though the developer is starting to get more manpower to speed things up a bit) i have to advise anyone who doesn't know exactly what they are getting to not buy this game until you've researched what the game in its current state has to offer. before you buy this game you have to be satisfied with whats already there.\n\nive been running this game beautifully on my hp elite 8000 compaq, it has 4 gigs of RAM, a 244 watt PSU, an intel duo processor, and a geforce 730 2g DDR5 card. if you have a better set up than me you'll probably be able to handle the bigger, more detailed maps you can get from the SUM launcher community mods, but please note. experience may vary.\n\nnow the game play is where it all comes together, the parkour is fun, combat challenging and brutal, weapon play is excelent and amount of customizability the editor gives you is wonderful. the editor itself is a bit wonky, and using the editor to create levels/scenarios is where you will face 90% of your crashes. its pretty annoying, but i recomend saving the level after every major change, and when your fps starts to drop in editor to save every single change after that. once you save the level it will load automatically when you pick the level you saved it on. (which is nice) it reminds me of gmod, to get the most out of solo play you have to take the time to set everything up, both games (at least for me) tend to crash alot when doing this, but in the end the game play on your custom level is enough to justify it all.\n\ntl;dr 8.2/10 dont buy blindly","December 4, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Probably because I was too busy playing it. I have more hours on this game offline because I use a community mod loader and launcher to play the game. Overgrowth is in development and has been percolating in the minds of the developers since 2005 when they dropped Lugaru, the spiritual predecessor as they put it to Overgrowth.\nThe reason I love this game is because of it's combat system. The lead developer mentioned once that he took inspiration from Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee movie fight scenes. I like mortal combat street fighter and every other game in that genre in their own rights, but combos for crazy moves put me off. The combat system in this game is based of attacking, blocking, countering, or dodging. The way you are moving around your target determines what kind of attack you will throw. To counter you have to press the block button which is the RMB or right trigger on game pad.\n\nYou'll have to just watch the game played and see for yourself if you're interested. What drew me in was the combat and wall jumping! Also user generated content if you're interested in that kinda thing. It won't be as vital to the game when the developers add their mass of content.

Within 2008 it was renamed to Overgrowth, and in 2011 released on steam. Yes....that's a long time to develop a game....but....note this. This IS NOT a AAA title nor is it made by professional developers. Wolfire is comprised of only 4 devs, and that's why updates come slowly and its still in early access. Also They are now moving to a new engine due to the crashes that is being complained about....Now this definately will take a while with only 4 devs. Now lets get back to talking about a triple A game....which is comprised of not just a single team...but multiple teams of Devs up to over hundreds of developers.....How do you think its capable for a CoD game to come out yearly? Plus in games like those they reuse mechanics and code to make  development easier. And NO this game is not abandoned.\n\nNow that we got that out in the open....lets look at some good'Ol PROS and CONS\n\n+Combat is unique and easy to get used to but not easy to win unless you cheat or....like to spam certain moves\n+Great ninja feel, and gravity and movement gives the game an old martial arts movie vibe to it.\n+Great Collisions\n+Local Co-op works well especially with multiple controller support\n+Level editing with every prop and tool in the game including materials, Ai, weapons and....other unique stuf\n+stealth and quest creator\n+Throw weapons at enemies xD\n+Multiple races to fight and play against from dog/wolf/rabbit/mouse/cat people\n+Endless Arena Mode (unless u die)\n+Great visuals good enough to enjoy, and fit the game itself.\n+Slow Motion button\n+Button that shoots a magical beam and insta kills everything (cheat attack as i said)\n+great ragdoll physics\n\n-Crashes (most occurring problem)\n-lag at times....depending on the total amount of data within a single area.\n-Long development process (Just be patient and enjoy what it gives)\n-Players just judge the game without understanding the situation or how development works >,> and ruins it for others\n-A lot of wasted reviews that don't provide any supportive information (just me angry right now xD )\n\nI should also point out there, that they plan on taking the campaign/story from Luguru and implementing it within this since......so far it doesn't have any....so that's something to look forward too after the engine transfer (Unreal Engine 4)\n\nThey do keep us posted on twitter and other sites with Q/A's so please check that out if your interested. thanks for taking the time reading this and sorry for the grammar xD","May 9, 2015","true","9.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

A nice combination of Parkour and Melee combat. WITH FURRIES!!! It has been in development since forever (like 2008), but the updates keep coming and are substantial. Also, having anthropomorphs that are realistic instead of Anime-ish is a nice change.\n\nThere is a massive amount of community made content, but you need to do sketchy stuff to get to it. Freaking SPOF.\n\nAnyway, the Parkour is a normal 3rd person platformer, only you are a ninja rabbit. Also it doesn't suck. You can do more modren things like wall running and climb up ledges. The melee combat is interesting, as you can murder people (Rabbits, Wolves, Rats, Cats, and Dogs) by using weapons, or you can beat them up. Or you can keep beating them up after they are KO'ed and kill them. Stealth is important too, as you can sneak up on dudes to choke them out, or slit their throats, but lone guards might run away and get help. Or rush you with a sword. Then there is a arena, you can practice you combat skills there.\n\nIt doesn't run very well on my PC though, I think I need more CPU power.\n\n8 Turners out of 10","March 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

At least not for Mac. Performance on the Mac is really very very bad, despite having a very fast iMac 27inch with more than capable hardware it seems to often reach a slideshow fps for some reason. It didn't used to be like this and the game itself has it's awesomeness to some extent, but it's currently simply unplayable on Mac.\n\nNow.. it would be unfair to comment just on the Mac version and leave it at that. The current game build itself has a pretty cool melee focused combat (and parkour style movement) going for it that feels both incredibly fluid and very unique. It's graphics and style is also great, but there's still a genuine problem.\n\nThe game doesn't feature any actual game content yet. Well, at least not in form of a singleplayer campaign or story mode or even more of a free roaming sandbox world. At the moment it consists of loading what I would call 'test' levels. Now I am sure it serves it's purpose for testing stuff out, but for a player there's very little value to be had here.\n\nThe developer does put out regular updates and that's great, but adding new main game content seems to take a very very long time. To most people I would recommend to wait until more of either free roaming mode with stuff to do or indeed a singleplayer campaign is done. From the current game mechanics in place it is clear the developer knows how to make for decent gameplay, so don't mistake this recommendation for stating the game itself will turn out bad. But for now, I'd wait.\n(also.. in case anyone knows how to get rid of the slideshow fps performance on Mac, I'd gladly hear about it and update the above..)","June 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had to remove the link/actual title because Steam isn't particularly fond of them.\n\nIt's definitely a lot of fun if you can run it and like the combat, but updates haven't come too often and it's likely you won't see much more progress than what's offered here in the final release. However, that isn't to say it hasn't definitely been updated. It seems they have kicked up their efforts recently, as well, but I can't say much for sure. There's a lot more to the game than there was when it started off, including the fact that it is MUCH easier to run now. If you own the game and didn't like the way it ran before, I heavily recommend revisiting it.\n\nThe game doesn't stretch very far past what you can see in the screenshots and trailer, but for a quick rundown, and things you should consider before buying:\n- The game features relatively quick, primarily hand-to-hand and melee fighting, with a very intricate movement system. There are many maps dedicated entirely to parkour.\n- The modding community is fairly sized, and extremely dedicated. If you own the game or plan on getting it, you should definitely download SUMLauncher for it as well. You can easily install and manage mods, as well as adjust advanced graphics settings, controls, etc. I consider it essential.\n- There are no current plans for multiplayer, though there is a decent mod for it currently in development.\n- The dev team is pretty small, and probably won't expand. As of the last few months, updates have come a bit more frequent, but just keep in mind that anything could happen to this game.\n\nDev blog, keep up with the game here.[blog.wolfire.com]","February 17","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It even drips off of the characters onto the ground itself. Very well detailed, with a blood color option of variety.\n\nVery Classy\n\nConsidering the small amount of dialogue in the alpha, due to the incompleteness of the campaign mode, there is little that could be SAID about the dialogue maturity, over all the game is very mature in the sense that it’s nothing atrocious or rude, but it is very violent. It is, after all, a fighting game. But it composes itself well and nothing about the game seems childish or over the top. Well poised.\n\nI Might Need Rehabilitation\n\n...when this game is released.\nThe mechanics of the fighting in this game are VERY in depth for the few number of actual button inputs given. Q, Space, Shift, WADS, Right click, Left click. Besides options/load/menu/creation keys, this is all you need and Q is only used for items (only weapons right now?). But the number of actions you can perform is very deep. You can jump, flip, jump off walls, FLIP off walls, roll, duck, low kick, punch, straight kick, roundhouse kick, passive block, active block (just guard), throw, escape throw, hit them while they’re down, FLYING JUMP KICK, attack with weapons, THROW WEAPONS, climb walls, save fall, roll from fall, sneak grab choke hold, move bodies, roll to pick up weapons faster, catch weapons in mid air after they’ve been thrown at you..I may have missed some actions...but these things combined, with so few buttons, creates a VERY intense skill cap. Multiplayer, which has already started implementation in the form of a special 1 screen game mode (with split screen option even), will be very fierce and competitive right out of the gate. The fighting mechanics take about an hour to get used to. The hand to hand mechanics, after 8+ hours of gameplay, I still haven’t mastered. The weapons mechanics are an enigma to me. The AI actually fights intelligently and will give you a consistent challenge. I could sit here and train for hours, which I have...if the game wasn’t crashing every 30 or so minutes.\nIt IS after all just in alpha, so this is to be expected. Surprisingly few crashes with that in mind. But they will have to be smoothed out before release.\n\n\n\nThis game is so shiny, I need sunglasses.\n\nI’ve mentioned this multiple times, it’s in alpha, but it LOOKS and FEELS like a full scale production game, but it’s only worked on by 4 people, bug reporters notwithstanding. However if you ever watch a video, you can see a character’s torso move around… you may think “oh that’s cool it bobs and weaves”. What you are actually seeing is a direct reflection (with very little latency) of the WADS keys being pressed. The feet are simply following along with what the body is wanting to do. And while this is not exactly proportional to real physics, it is very good to have in a game where you need to be exactly where you want to be as soon as possible, and that is what determines how close you ACTUALLY are to your opponent/wall/objective.\nThe ragdolls are absolutely adorable to watch. Dying is actually fun because of that. Hitting someone at just the right time before they kick the bucket can result in them being sent reeling across the fighting area. It’s rather comical, yet heartwarming at the same time. The game is an absolute gem of quality workmanship and the people working on it deserve a very special recognition for that. KUDOS and BRAVO to them. The game FEELS alive, it LOOKS alive, I mentioned the blood in the addiction factor section. It’s such a well made game, even though, ONCE AGAIN, it crashes frequently.\n\nIf this game were a human, it would be a woman. That’s how complex it is.\n\nI don’t even need to go into detail about the complexity of the game as it had to be mentioned in the addiction section due to the high skill cap bringing back for more.\nThere is also a scripting and level editing mode. Scripting is done through .xml files and level editing is done right in the game itself, including placing actors/objects.\nHowever, it’s only downfall in this topic right now would be...you guessed it...it’s lack of content. The game itself is great, but it’s not a game yet, but I can’t wait to see it when it’s done.

Now that my only major negative point is out of the way, let me say that this game, in my opinion, has the best combat in any game that I have played so far. Instead of a health system, like most games have, the combat is based on a bone structure system, enemies' bodies will react realistically to being hit, and a single fight with one opponent can take quite a while, which might not be good for everyone, but it's something I really enjoy. You can perform various moves that you can figure out yourself, for example a jump kick, that allows you to bounce off enemies and sometimes land head-first on the ground and snap your neck. There are a few levels already in the game, along with some challenges and an arena, but there is a vast selection of custom maps for you to enjoy, all made with the in-game editor. The parkour, while hard to learn, is VERY satisfying once you are able to even perform some basic actions. This game is definitely not without its problems, but shows a lot of promise, especially considering that it's this fun while it's in alpha.","November 20, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

At least not for Mac. Performance on the Mac is really very very bad, despite having a very fast iMac 27inch with more than capable hardware it seems to often reach a slideshow fps for some reason. It didn't used to be like this and the game itself has it's awesomeness to some extent, but it's currently simply unplayable on Mac.\n\nNow.. it would be unfair to comment just on the Mac version and leave it at that. The current game build itself has a pretty cool melee focused combat (and parkour style movement) going for it that feels both incredibly fluid and very unique. It's graphics and style is also great, but there's still a genuine problem.\n\nThe game doesn't feature any actual game content yet. Well, at least not in form of a singleplayer campaign or story mode or even more of a free roaming sandbox world. At the moment it consists of loading what I would call 'test' levels. Now I am sure it serves it's purpose for testing stuff out, but for a player there's very little value to be had here.\n\nThe developer does put out regular updates and that's great, but adding new main game content seems to take a very very long time. To most people I would recommend to wait until more of either free roaming mode with stuff to do or indeed a singleplayer campaign is done. From the current game mechanics in place it is clear the developer knows how to make for decent gameplay, so don't mistake this recommendation for stating the game itself will turn out bad. But for now, I'd wait.\n(also.. in case anyone knows how to get rid of the slideshow fps performance on Mac, I'd gladly hear about it and update the above..)","June 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had to remove the link/actual title because Steam isn't particularly fond of them.\n\nIt's definitely a lot of fun if you can run it and like the combat, but updates haven't come too often and it's likely you won't see much more progress than what's offered here in the final release. However, that isn't to say it hasn't definitely been updated. It seems they have kicked up their efforts recently, as well, but I can't say much for sure. There's a lot more to the game than there was when it started off, including the fact that it is MUCH easier to run now. If you own the game and didn't like the way it ran before, I heavily recommend revisiting it.\n\nThe game doesn't stretch very far past what you can see in the screenshots and trailer, but for a quick rundown, and things you should consider before buying:\n- The game features relatively quick, primarily hand-to-hand and melee fighting, with a very intricate movement system. There are many maps dedicated entirely to parkour.\n- The modding community is fairly sized, and extremely dedicated. If you own the game or plan on getting it, you should definitely download SUMLauncher for it as well. You can easily install and manage mods, as well as adjust advanced graphics settings, controls, etc. I consider it essential.\n- There are no current plans for multiplayer, though there is a decent mod for it currently in development.\n- The dev team is pretty small, and probably won't expand.

I personally got it because Nerdcubed did a Lets Play on Youtube on it. It looked like much fun playing with the sandbox and the new arena.\n\nArena: The new arena gameplay is pretty dope. I love the fights without weapons, because you have to fully use all the mechanics in combat that your rabbot has. Also the polearm fights are awesome, I just throw it and then try to retrieve it while not getting killed. One vs One fights are too easy right now. Just jump towards them and kill them with a precise kick.\n\nSandbox: The sandbox does not have a hughmangous amount of stuff to do, but it is fun and I enjoyed playing it. Play with the mechanics, build your own challenges and fight against an army of rabbits and wolves.\n\nAlso it is possible to download custom made maps through the SUMLauncher (retrievable through the "secret" Overgrowth Alpha forum at Wolfire Games). Some of them are already great, some don't even launch on my computer. Much work to do, but awesome already.\n\nSo if you're up for some fun and combat with a rabbit, this is cool. It's still an early Alpha, that is to be remembered while playing. But I think the developers are on a good way and this game will be great fun with a good story coming in the full customer version.","January 3, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Im curious what is that rabbits-wolves thing all about.\nMultiplayer features are propably going to be only avaible on shared screen as far as i know, but it's fault physics based gameplay, not developers way of thinking.

Honestly, when anyone ever asks what my favourite game is, I will always answer "Overgrowth"\n\nI understand that many people will be angered by the seemingly "slow production", however there are often updates every 2-3 months at most, though according to news, that will be dropped to 2 weeks, with small nightly updates.\n\nThis games code is almost completely open, meaning that the modders have access to make the awesome mods that they do, because of this and the in game editor included, the whole thing becomes almost limitless even in its alpha stages. Some that are either in development or already released at the time of this message are; the bow and arrow mod (by Gyrth), the multiplayer mod OGMP (by Surak and Gyrth) and Therium 2 a , currently, 32 level campaign with full storyline, backstories, lore and exclusive items (by Timbles)\n\nAnother great thing about Overgrowth is its community, the thousands of users on its forums are almost always happy to answer your questions and provide content and most posts are replied to within 30 minutes any issue you have is sure to be sorted on there (forums.wolfire.com)\n\nThe SUMlauncher application is an unofficial add on that you can run alongside your game, it allows for update alerts, latest news from the development of the game, all the settings options, game reports and automatic downloads for all the best mods found on the forums. This only enhances what is currently available with the alpha.\n\nI would thoroughly encourage the purchase of this game, though quite bare in features in its initial state, the mods and community more than make up for what is missing\n\n(Before you buy, one downfall, this game requires OpenGL 3.2, this has become an issue for a few players rendering their game unusable including me. Alpha 209 is still playable without 3.2, but just in case, I suggest you check)","December 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

Buy it! Omg! Something combat! Something Bunnies!\nMe: (2 years later):... -_-\n\nOkay, to be honest the combat is pretty damn good.  This was the selling point for me. I'm a combat (W)hore (that just sounds... bad). And to be honest, that is the only thing this game has going for it. "But of course! It's a fighting game!" *bell*- Wrong. Kinda. Okay, this game is a fighting game (I think) and it's combat serves that purpose. But really the bugs, optimization, price (YES THIS GAME IS OVERPRICED AS FUDGE [litterly]), and of course the really crappy developers make this game terrible. This game has been out since... 2012?

(Combat [W]hore refferance) then you might like this game. If you can run it and it can run you (Ya. Bugs.) then do what I did when I bought the game... Take a deep breath and say... "YOLO!".\n\nNow, Keep in mind this game is still in Alpha (4 years later....) so who knows, this game might be totally abandoned by the developers (kinda already is....), or the game could get a lot better. It's really a gamble. So if you have $30 to burn...  Save it and buy a good game.\n\nMe (2 years later): Hey remeber Overgrowth?\nFriend (2 years later): WTFluff is Overgrowth...

Hopefully by the end of this it'll be somewhat clear why.\n\nThis game is really cool. It's a third person outdoor map game with awesome running, jumping, climbing and fighting mechanics. The dude who made the game made the engine himself from scratch and it is slick as HELL. It runs wicked smooth on hardware it doesn't have any right to run so smoothly on and looks great. The animations for everything from crouching to running to fighting to jumping and rolling are also slick as hell. The guy making the engine is incredibly talented and has done some really neat stuff with animations that make the game very immersive. The combat is pretty realistic and enjoyable too. You can get into some very fast, very intense kicking/grappling/swordfighting fights that are very brutal and satisfying.\n\nNow, having said all that, I'm not sure this game is EVER going to be finished. I backed it on kickstarter a few years ago just because I happened to have a bit of cash and thought "hey, this looks like it deserves support". While the game has certainly had a fair amount of updates, a lot of them have been pretty minor tweaks to thinks like textures and animations, in other words: all tech. I'm worried this game is going to get stuck in a permanent "tinker" phase and nothing concrete that can be called an actual game will ever come out of the process, or at best it'll take way too long. The latest update for example had something like procedural idle animations, so that the animation of the character standing there would have some somewhat randomized aspects to it...turning the head, breathing, etc. That is very neat...and very cool, but uhhhh....are they going to do stuff like this for 2 more years? I am not very assured that there is anyone on this tiny team who is actually working hard at creating good game CONTENT. Right now it's basically a jumping and fighting sandbox, and normally I wouldn't care, but as I've said, it's been that for YEARS now.","January 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

But thats about the only thing i applaud in this game. Its buggy, its been an alpha for years. The bundle with Recievers ok, but Reciever doesnt even have a story and its just an excuse to buy this game so you think your getting a deal. When you Alt+Tab out of the game, it totally bugs out. For some reason, the level editor and the level are one thing. Thats not very good. Also if you spawn in an enemy, they'll only fight when you are in the level editor mode, they won't fight when they are in the game. The arena mode can be buggy aswell. Its a cool aspect and all, but if you use the lightning bolt thing ability to kill everyone nothing can be decided because the game can't figure out that everyone died due to you. Also, I grabbed this on steam a few months back, and there hasnt been an update since before I even owned the game. The game was appeasing before as a cool little alpha that should be more reasonably priced or just kinda free. This game is a bad deal for an alpha, nothing that this game is nowhere near complete. The developers need to learn better management and to maybe just release a quick update that may fix some issues with the game and make the level editor mode in a different function of the game. This game has alot of potential, but the game developers aren't caring enough to take it. If you asked me, I would just buy some other game that has a physics based engine like this, which are not scarce on the internet if you just search a bit. Good luck to the developers and I hope you figure out something new for this game.","July 5, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

That's good for Overgrowth, which from the start was built from scratch, on their own engine, that simulates realistic physics, forces, impacts and flowing blood, all in real-time. It runs smoother than butter for me.\n\nWhat it is currently is really a sandbox. There's a big selection of pre-made levels, mostly Arenas and landscapes, and you can spawn in many items (trees, buildings, NPCs, weaponry). There's a lot of potential to make your own stuff too, since you can resize and transform assets as you please, as well as plot paths for NPCs to move on. Personally I'm not too interested in all of that but it leaves huge room for mods, which you can download from the SUMLauncher on the Wolfire site.\n\nBut enough of brushing over the technical details, the gameplay is key. Combat is phenomenal in every way. You can throw your adversaries over your head, kick them to death, roundhouse kick their faces, disarm them, whatever you please - all of it can be done by the left and right mouse button. Incredibly easy to learn, incredibly hard to master. The game's got fluid animations and motion too, and it's very easy to do parkour and blend that into fighting. Wallrun, jump off and slam dunk a bunny. This game's got it all.\n\nI personally love this game, though I understand it's not for everyone. Something something furry heaven, blah blah development hell etc. For what's in the game now I think it's well worth your money.","March 7","true","12.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

While I do enjoy the combat, and the level editor is as deep and accessible as that of Farcry 2, there really isn't enough content to justify the price tag. Depth is fine, but even the "levels" made for expressly showcasing said depth are plagued by errors that contradict their intended purpose. There are faulty checkpoints, glitched movement in some areas, crashes, and AI that doesn't know what to do with itself. Modders have done a much better job creating good-looking levels that fully use the power of the game.\n\nVisually, the game is great, except when I start hitting hiccups associated wih either bad hardware optimization and missing files. (I found the "checker skybox" to be particularly amusing.) Once these glitches start, they don't stop.\n\nI could forgive all of this, except for one fact. Before playing it again for this review, I last sat down with it at least half a year ago. I was impressed, but I remember thinking, "I bet this is going to have more content later." Present day, I played again, and was confused at how little had been added.\nSuch a wait is minimal, from what I've heard. Apparently, this game has been in development limbo for almost seven years. During the time this game has been in its alpha stages, I've seen members of my family be born and later attend first grade, and this game still isn't finished. I understand that not many people are working on it, but charging $30 for a product that has taken this long, that is this devoid of longevity, and that still has not been completed... ah...\nIt's like paying for a car that's over half a decade old, and missing pieces, under the promise that one day, I will be able to drive it around and have fun.\nUntil then, this game is little more than a glorified level editor for ninja animals.","June 24, 2015","false","7.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I cant really do an average rate of each element yet because this game is so under-developed. It is very much alpha, and will probably be some time before we see a full-release. That alone can be a negative for most. Im going to tell you why its not.\n\n1. The developers are doing something amazing here. This is already one of the most complex combat games I have every seen. Its one of the few games out there that repects physically to the full extent durring combat.\n\n2. It has a continuely growing gameplay and updates are added frequently. They are not only building a storyline game, but a mod friendly, developer game. Right now, you can change everything. They give you as much ability as them, and that is currently what the game is.\n\n3. The vast ability oft his game is more than a few blank maps, 1 model enemy, a few weapons, and thats it. There is some of the most creative maps I have seen in a combat game in awhile. The time era here is difficult to pin, (Because all characters are animal :P) but they only have swords, axes, spears, hammers, etc. that makes the games combat a little more interesting, and forces it to be more detailed.\n\n4. Despite the fact that you play as 7 foot tall rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, etc, this game is very realalistic. You can literally kill yourself by jumping of a high structure and snapping your neck. The sword fighting is also very detailed. Ending a 3 minute battle with no hits with a slow motion throat slit of your enemy is satisfying to say the least.\n\nIf you dont like waiting for a game to have its release, and hate waiting on developers, maybe this game isnt for you. But its a shame is you dont, because you have no idea what your missing out on. When this game has its full release and has an amazing story, the best combat ever, beautiful graphics, and is rated extremely highly. Go ahead an buy it then. Im just trying to say you're gonna miss out on some very intriguing gameplay pre-release, and getting to keep updating with developers to witnesss one of the best games ever be made.

Its fun, and a refreshing take on fighting. Even though its animals fighting each other, its a very realistic fighting game. And parkour game. But once you go through all the "scenario's", it gets really boring. Nothing to do but spawn in a ton of enemies to fight you. Sure this is also fun for a while, but soon becomes a hassle to reset the level, spawn the characters in, spawn weapons in, and then do it over again. This most of the time will crash the game at least once after you open it. I want to like this game, and a lot of replayability, but with so little content the replayability factor wears down. Not to mention a lot of levels are almost unplayable because of missing textures. Again, I want to love this game, but its not worth 30$ and has been in development for a LONG time, with no changes whatsoever in the last year.\n\nIn short, a game that is so close to being awesome, but because of development levels and lack of anything but sandbox and arena, it's a sharp knife of fresh combat that breaks off a piece every time you play, slowly dulling into boring repetitiveness.","February 17, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overgrowth puts the onus on the player more-so than Lugaru did for attacking when jumping off the wall.\n\nYou can catch weapons, you can block attacks, you can counter attacks, you can select how you attack via a mouse click, LMB+D, LMB+A... well just reference the aforementioned Overgrowth Control Wiki[wiki.wolfire.com] in the "Attack and Defense" section if you desire to understand how the combat works then watch some gameplay videos.\n\nOne can use a controller with the game... but only in combat currently... mouse and keyboard feels fluid though (as I am that type of player)... but the controller controls were suprisingly intuitive/easy to use last I tried.\n\nPvP (1v1... versus) Local Split Screen - Convert to this game already you 2D versus brawlers... or don't, idc.\n\nThis video might be meaningful to you all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoWa3Z_w99s","January 21, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It may be in development now but Wolfire is doing a good job on updating and fixing many of the problems. The only problem that I have faced with this game is the lag and extreme drops in the FPS when on a large level with many objects. It is recommended to have a computer that can handle the graphics and speed of the game. I recommend getting it due to the free Reciever game that is attached before it is officially released.","January 31, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, most average Joe's would find that a bad sign and just give up, but i find it a good sign. This may not look like an Indie game but it is (yeah, big wow to the average Joe's who don't check the tags) and a game like this takes time . . . especially as an indie game. There is no multiplayer yet and i have multiple missing textures for the sky . . . which should be fixed, lots of bad sign's but when this game is finished it will have multiplayer, and hopefully no missing textures. the combat is great and the parkour is fun, making your own levels is extra fun. Just give the game a chance, and if you don't like it well now Steam has a refund system so there you go . . . just try it.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the game does crash once in a while but what can you expect from an alpha? I doubt that will be the case in the finished product.

Created by Wolfire Games overgrowth is more of a spiritual successor to the game Lugaru that a sequel at the moment. There is no true point to the game yet, it is a free roam thing with an IN DEPTH level editor with plenty of ways to make machinima and custom armoer for your character. In the game you play as a delightfully awesome cast of human? like? animals that include so far as bunny(with different types of bunnies),cat,wolf,dog, and a robot bunny? Each character has there own perks from running faster, jumping higher, or when it comes to the wolf ANIALATING ALL ENEMIES VERY QUICKLY. As well as amazing intuitive smooth parkour which i am in love with, it has what i would only describe as the best combat in all of video games. A system were rather than puncg with individual clicks, you enter a battle mode by holding the mouse button allowing you to focus entirely on what forms of attack you will perform usiing the directionals,crouch(shift),and jumping(space to perform the coolest manuver in all of video games!). The blocking system is fast you must block at the right time when the blow would have hit you which isnt easy even when the games in slow motion, oh yeah by the way tab makes the game slow mo and double tapping it freezes the game... HOW ARE U NOT BUYING THIS. As of now there is no story but the level editor and arena mode(truly test your combat skills) is enough to keep me entranced hours on end. Best part about it with steams auto update system you can be sure you are getting the most of the experience. The company that makes it, Wolfire, seem like cool guys(or guy?) on there website and forum you can see the latest news on updates and how to play the game not to mention there youtube channel Wolfire Games. I can see they have alot of hope in this game and truly want it to go places i mean its been in work for a while. With mods and hopefully in the future Steam Workshop support i cant imagine putting this game down.\n\nRating- Buy it if u value your life","March 5, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

I dont want to be too critical of him since it might give the guy anxiety and cause even more delays. i wonder if he has thought about getting a company like double fine to back him. this is coming from a berserk fan, but then again, the dev for this game is not miura. i think he should get a development team to help him and split the profits so he can start working on the next game, im sure in eight years he has come up with some new ideaas that he would like to work on. Gang beasts is similiar and just recently got updated for the new unity engine. i might get that soon, but i want to wait until it comes out of early access, otherwise i might have two unfinished physics based combat games in my library.","October 29, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Created by Wolfire Games overgrowth is more of a spiritual successor to the game Lugaru that a sequel at the moment. There is no true point to the game yet, it is a free roam thing with an IN DEPTH level editor with plenty of ways to make machinima and custom armoer for your character. In the game you play as a delightfully awesome cast of human? like? animals that include so far as bunny(with different types of bunnies),cat,wolf,dog, and a robot bunny? Each character has there own perks from running faster, jumping higher, or when it comes to the wolf ANIALATING ALL ENEMIES VERY QUICKLY. As well as amazing intuitive smooth parkour which i am in love with, it has what i would only describe as the best combat in all of video games. A system were rather than puncg with individual clicks, you enter a battle mode by holding the mouse button allowing you to focus entirely on what forms of attack you will perform usiing the directionals,crouch(shift),and jumping(space to perform the coolest manuver in all of video games!). The blocking system is fast you must block at the right time when the blow would have hit you which isnt easy even when the games in slow motion, oh yeah by the way tab makes the game slow mo and double tapping it freezes the game... HOW ARE U NOT BUYING THIS. As of now there is no story but the level editor and arena mode(truly test your combat skills) is enough to keep me entranced hours on end. Best part about it with steams auto update system you can be sure you are getting the most of the experience. The company that makes it, Wolfire, seem like cool guys(or guy?) on there website and forum you can see the latest news on updates and how to play the game not to mention there youtube channel Wolfire Games. I can see they have alot of hope in this game and truly want it to go places i mean its been in work for a while. With mods and hopefully in the future Steam Workshop support i cant imagine putting this game down.\n\nRating- Buy it if u value your life","March 5, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

This game takes a two/three (depending on how you look at it) combat system to a whole new level. With the great physics and the fluid combat this game has A LOT of potential.\n\nMy only wish is that they will add in a Multiplayer over the internet. If they can do that the game would get a 9.5/10 from me. If not it's still like an 8/10 for a game in alpha.\n\nEven if no MP is added, the single player is fun, and sounds fun.

You can parkour off walls and ledges; seeing as you play as a rabbit, you can jump really high and far. Even though it's in alpha, it plays beautifully. So far, there is no mulitplayer. But Wolfire has already promised the creation of multiplayer and a full campaign. It's fun to play around with the ragdoll and the slowmotion effects. I have really high expectations for this game, and even though its cost is higher then you might want to pay, I bought it on a whim, and ended up getting lucky. If it's fun as it is now, I can't wait to see what Wolfire has in store for us. And now it comes with Receiver, which i suggest you also look into.","February 28, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Created by Wolfire Games overgrowth is more of a spiritual successor to the game Lugaru that a sequel at the moment. There is no true point to the game yet, it is a free roam thing with an IN DEPTH level editor with plenty of ways to make machinima and custom armoer for your character. In the game you play as a delightfully awesome cast of human? like? animals that include so far as bunny(with different types of bunnies),cat,wolf,dog, and a robot bunny? Each character has there own perks from running faster, jumping higher, or when it comes to the wolf ANIALATING ALL ENEMIES VERY QUICKLY. As well as amazing intuitive smooth parkour which i am in love with, it has what i would only describe as the best combat in all of video games. A system were rather than puncg with individual clicks, you enter a battle mode by holding the mouse button allowing you to focus entirely on what forms of attack you will perform usiing the directionals,crouch(shift),and jumping(space to perform the coolest manuver in all of video games!). The blocking system is fast you must block at the right time when the blow would have hit you which isnt easy even when the games in slow motion, oh yeah by the way tab makes the game slow mo and double tapping it freezes the game... HOW ARE U NOT BUYING THIS. As of now there is no story but the level editor and arena mode(truly test your combat skills) is enough to keep me entranced hours on end. Best part about it with steams auto update system you can be sure you are getting the most of the experience. The company that makes it, Wolfire, seem like cool guys(or guy?) on there website and forum you can see the latest news on updates and how to play the game not to mention there youtube channel Wolfire Games. I can see they have alot of hope in this game and truly want it to go places i mean its been in work for a while. With mods and hopefully in the future Steam Workshop support i cant imagine putting this game down.\n\nRating- Buy it if u value your life","March 5, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

This game takes a two/three (depending on how you look at it) combat system to a whole new level. With the great physics and the fluid combat this game has A LOT of potential.\n\nMy only wish is that they will add in a Multiplayer over the internet. If they can do that the game would get a 9.5/10 from me. If not it's still like an 8/10 for a game in alpha.\n\nEven if no MP is added, the single player is fun, and sounds fun.

This game is fun for a while, but then it gets boring, even when you have someone to play with- but even multiplayer takes some setting up. I find myself not playing for longer than half an hour to an hour, before eventually getting bored.\n\nThe physics and combat are great, don't get me wrong. It can be fun running around for a while and doing some parkour, but it is still limited. Very limited.\n\nI understand it is still in Alpha, but it's just like Day-Z Standalone- early access, £20 and feels almost abandoned. The only difference is that Overgrowth has been in Alpha for 7 years. Yes, SEVEN years. I am unhappy about this and I feel that I should be waiting for an announcement for the project being cancelled than a big update coming. The updates recently are small and unimpressive. 3 new arenas in arena mode as well as some bug fixing was the most recent as of writing. They don't even feel like they belong in the game- they are more like mods, and they can easily be replicated in the level editor.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA great concept, but it feels like it has been abandoned, updates unimpressive and small, Alpha for 7 years.\n\nIt is a good concept, but I don't see it coming out of Alpha within a year or two, and for that reason, I am giving it\n4/10","December 13, 2015","false","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I digress, the parkour/free running is as it should be, not too easy and not too hard, but it has challenge. Unlike the Assassins creed games where it is run at a wall and hope for the best. What makes it better is when you pull of an awesome stunt, look back and feel awesome. Combat is superb, It feels real. You can dodge and counter in many different ways. Like ducking under a kick and sweeping, Sparta kick them when they go to sweep you, roll and hit them from behind or simply parry and judo throw them over your shoulder. The weapons aren't "hit, block,hit, block, take the hit, hit, take 20x hits, hit once dead" oh no, it is incredibly balanced between PvP and PvE. It is like "hit, block, dodge, hit, get hit, dead". Also, this game comes bundled with the first person horror game 'reciever' made by wolfire games (which cannot be purchased on steam and is pretty good). I wish it came with Lugaru (the previous game) but beggars can't be choosers. Anyway, I highly recommend this game.","August 31, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun brawler. Credit to the Dev for communicating the updates so well. Lots of love and detail put into it. Do not buy unless you want to support it. Buy Lugaru.\n\nMostly reviewing because I belive the game deserves a positive review. All the negativity kinda sucks. Yes the game updates very slowly, but it's been consistenly updated. And yeah, there used to be a lot less content.\n\nAlso a lot of the little details you just kinda miss unless you know about them. Such as the blood, various injury poses, critical damage spots, the ragdoll animations.\n\nIt's fun, but ultimately empty right now. Honestly if it takes after Lugaru, the gameplay that there is now, is all there will be. Some platforming, and some satisfying combat.\n\n6/10 for just right now, 7/10 if you like the type of game, 8/10 if you can appreciate the little details. Overall, above average to good. For me, I like it, it's quite good.\n\nBut as I say with early access games, buy it ONLY if you're okay with the content in the game right now, and if you're okay with the Dev being a dumbass and potentially releasing a string of bad updates and ignoring the community (seems unlikely here, but still, beware).","January 22","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun brawler. Credit to the Dev for communicating the updates so well. Lots of love and detail put into it. Do not buy unless you want to support it. Buy Lugaru.\n\nMostly reviewing because I belive the game deserves a positive review. All the negativity kinda sucks. Yes the game updates very slowly, but it's been consistenly updated. And yeah, there used to be a lot less content.\n\nAlso a lot of the little details you just kinda miss unless you know about them. Such as the blood, various injury poses, critical damage spots, the ragdoll animations.\n\nIt's fun, but ultimately empty right now. Honestly if it takes after Lugaru, the gameplay that there is now, is all there will be. Some platforming, and some satisfying combat.\n\n6/10 for just right now, 7/10 if you like the type of game, 8/10 if you can appreciate the little details. Overall, above average to good. For me, I like it, it's quite good.\n\nBut as I say with early access games, buy it ONLY if you're okay with the content in the game right now, and if you're okay with the Dev being a dumbass and potentially releasing a string of bad updates and ignoring the community (seems unlikely here, but still, beware).","January 22","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I however, cannot recommend this game at all in it's current state. The slow process of updates does not really factor into that. There is just not enough game here. Even if it was sale price it does not change  my opinion.\n\nWhen I bought it, I had hoped for a much quicker turnaround. As it stands, I feel like I have made a 30 buck bet that may pay off sometime in the future. There really has not been a fraction of the progress I had hoped for. And while I kind of appreciate the sandbox editor. I would have hoped that the devs would themselves add more content to the game which still feels like a bare tech demo. Hopefully the finished game will eventually live up to it's unique design and beautiful enviroments. But I have to strongly suggest against purchasing this game right now. If the finished game ends up being amazing then I will gladly amend my review. But as it stands. Keep away until the devs prove out and the game gets at least a campaign mode. Most early access games have the foundations of what the full game will play like.

It has consistently been a lot of fun, and i'm glad they brought it too Steam so it can reach a wider audience.\n\nTL;DR - Fun, very fluid and brutal 3rd person fighting game with rabbits and wolves, is definetely an alpha so expect bugs and a pretty good PC too run it.\n\nThis game at this current stage is basically an arena brawler with rabbits and wolves that are somewhat "humanoid", there are a number of different preset scenarios with slightly different objectives. For example, reach the coloured block without being killed, which is quite difficult when there are rabbit guards with broadswords and spears!  There is also a proper arena mode where you are in an actual arena and will fight waves of different rabbits, this is random and will spawn you with either a friendly NPC or on your own and is a lot of fun.\n\nThe fighting mechanic is pretty unique and reminds of me of kung fu movies, it consists of left clicking to attack and right clicking to block and shift to duck and roll, but it is very challenging at times and looks AMAZING when you finally master it. It also shows blood stains on the characters and on the walls when you get hit against them, and sound effects are pretty good as the actual hits that you manage to connect sound very satisfying and brutal.\n\nYes the game WILL CRASH and yes it is a bit BUGGY, but overall the fighting mechanics are beautiful in action and it feels so satisfying roundhouse kicking a rabbit into a brick wall. The game also needs pretty much a dedicated gaming PC to run well, and i find particularly the areas with multiple guards wielding weapons to take a slight hit in frame drop but otherwise it's great and will only continue to improve as more and more content is implemented.","December 17, 2013","true","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The game crashes very frequently, and the load times are worse than sonic 06' at times. I'm not trying to hate on the game, because it does have some redeeming qualities, but considering how long this fricken things been in development, and because people haven't really played since the last time they opened it up, got frustrated by its primary problems and only played it for about 20 minuets and then got bored with it, I don't think the game has much of a future. Even if they add a good story mode, few people are going to go back because a majority of its problems probably wont be addressed. And I am using a pretty modern laptop to run this, and I have RARELY had any technical problems with any other games. Except for this one. Of the 100% amount of fun you can have with an indie game, or just games in general, this game falls between the 15% and 35% range. (at least for me) And you know that this game isn't very good when all this is coming from a guy who absoloutley LOVES open world sandbox games. (like Garry's mod, minecraft, goat simulator, Gta, saints row, etc)\n\nVerdict: Definitely not recommended","June 3, 2015","false","11.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papadelta/recommended/25000/","papadelta","PapaDelta138","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papadelta/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOvergrowth is a third-person action-adventure game, and acts as a successor to the game Lugaru, developed by Wolfire Games. It continues the story of an anthropomorphic rabbit, named Turner, who seeks to live with a new purpose, after suffering through many events of loss and betrayal. As of 2008, the game is still in development, with frequent updates made to it.\n\nGameplayOvergrowth is similar to its predecessor in terms of the mechanics of it, with some major tweaks made to it, like detailed environments, improvements made to the context-sensitive combat system, smoother and more fluid animations, and so on. The player can make use of different weapons to neutralize his or her opponents, such as knives, broadswords, and spears. The game is still in Alpha phase, so one can only play the game in its Sandbox-like mode, free to use different character models, and try out different things like arena fighting, or environmental exploration.\n\nVisualsThe improved visuals are a huge stepping stone to making the game much more enticing to its users. Comparatively, Overgrowth produces a much fresher take on the appearance of the characters and the environment to those who are familiar with Lugaru. For an independent developer, this game must be applauded for its overall artistic design.\n\nControlsThe traditional use of K&M is encouraged here, as the response time is quicker and invigorating. The combat system also works remarkably well with them. A gamepad can also be used, but I would like to recommend the K&M instead.\n\nStoryThe game is still in Alpha Testing, so there is no story mode. The developer instead continues to release periodic Alpha updates, citing new changes and modifications made to the game and its coding. But, so far, what we know is that the game will take place in a pre-industrial era where the anthropomorphic community now exists without a leader, putting their world in a state of anarchy.\n\nConclusionFor an independent developer like Wolfire Games, they have to be applauded for their hard work they have put into this game, in order to fulfill what a player really needs in a fighter game such as this. I own a Non-Steam version of it, and I've stacked up atleast 30+ Hours in it, because I found it extremely fun to mess around with it, as a way to pass time. But, I will admit that it's been too damn long since the game was in Early Access. It would be best if one gets it when it's on sale, but do get it if you're into fighter games.\n\nADVICE: I will say that the game is still on Early Access, which means the full version has not released yet. So far, I have not encountered any bugs, except for framerate issues, and a few weird glitches. Buy the game only if you want to support the developers.","November 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
