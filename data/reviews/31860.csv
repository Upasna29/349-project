It has a fantastic dark atmosphere that you can get lost in. My only gripe is that there are far too few characters, which makes guessing the culprit pretty easy.","February 13, 2014","true","11.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

For starters, basing a game around a legend is pretty darn cool -- the skull itself was a beautiful work of art. The puzzles in this game have really been stepped up to a challenging level. Even on junior sleuth, the puzzles are quite challenging, almost as if you were playing as a senior detective. Not to mention, the entire locations and scenes in New Oreleans really adds to the entire story background and the mystery of this game. This is most certainly a game worth playing! Happy sleuthing!","June 7, 2014","true","3.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Also, I think their games are way too underrated.\n\nND games have full of challenging puzzles, so much to explore that just makes you busy! And each series explore certain locations that makes you feel like you have been there and learnt some new knowleges about that place.\n\nThe  graphics might not be the most beautiful things amongst other games but, to me, the adventure games is not really about how beautiful it looks, but it is about the content of the game.\n\nLike other ND games, solving the mystery of the "Legend of the Crystal Skull" really depends on the player. You will seriously need to explore, solve puzzles, obtain informations so forth! Which at the end, gives you such a satisfaction!\n\nAnd I found Henry very sexy...\n\nIf you like adveture games, solving mysteries on your own, I recommend ND games!","October 20, 2014","true","12.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game, at least for me, is a lot more scary than the others despite it being one of the older titles. It deals with voodoo, rainy weather, exploring in a grave yard, etc. A bit too spooky for me!\n\n♥ There's an iguana.\n\nGator. Tarantula too. Since I have "exotic" animals myself (a bearded dragon, pumpkin patch tarantula, and crested geckos) I really liked seeing the little guys in the game! The gator did make me jump since it snaps at you.. ;;\n\n♥ Filled with puzzles!\n\nLike all the Nandy Drew games, it's filled with mystery, puzzles, and interesting characters. I don't think I'll be finishing this, the  dummy in the attic was too much for me but I do want to know who did it...! It made me guess and guess and guess again.\n\n✘ Steam overlay...\n\nIt may just be glitched for me but Steam overlay never worked when I played the game. I either had to play it windowed (too small to properly see anything) or have it in full screen and was unable to reply to messages. Not a huge deal, just was a bit of a pain >.<;;\n\n✘ The eyes.\n\nThey made me feel a bit watched, everywhere I went, a feeling that I found I couldn't shake. Eeek!\n\n✘ If you want to play a Nancy Drew\n\nthat focuses less on horror and more on mystery, I would pick a different title before playing this one. I think they did a wonderful job with the game, this isn't quite a "con", however it IS something to keep in mind...especially if you're thinking of getting this for someone younger.\n\nOverall if you're older or/and looking for a creepy game to play, Crystal Skull would be perfect.","June 4","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
