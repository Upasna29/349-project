"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wubsicles/recommended/439920/","wubsicles","Kenuda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wubsicles/","330 products in account","Let's look at the pros for a second:\n\nThis is more of a mobile game but, it was ported to the PC well. The controls are fine and there are none of the usual problems with a PC port of a mobile game.\n\nThis comes from a guy with a decent history of making games. He was even entrusted to make the mobile Majesty game, which was actually pretty good.\n\nNow for the cons:\n\nThe art style isn't simply recognizable, he hasn't changed the art style in any way. This guy has made multiple flash and mobile games, and all of them use the exact same art style. It hasn't even upgraded or improved over two years, literally nothing has changed. It's all copy and paste.\n\nTooltip errors and glitches are a regular occurance. Glitches are to be expected but, I would expect them to catch the tooltip errors.\n\nOn the topic of glitches, and this is just from personal experience so don't expect it to happen to you as well, I played through a few 'missions' and unlocked the wizard's guild. Which I promptly lost and never got back. I had no way of using spells, so it was all up to my soldiers.\n\nThere is very little strategy to this game. You don't tell your soldiers where to go, you line them up before the missions and once the missions start they just automatically move towards the enemy. This is less a strategy game and more of a tactical game, which I know is a thin line between the two. However, it isn't even a good tactical game. I remember playing something with the exact same game mechanics. I believe it was called Mini Warriors. The difference between the two games is that Mini Warriors always told you what you were facing and how to expect it when the battle started, so you could plan your troop placement accordingly. Royal Heroes does tell you what enemies you'll be facing but, not in what order or placement they will be, so even that amount of strategy is removed.\n\n\nI ended up dropping this game shortly after starting it. I just can't get in to it. It's far too simplified, to the point that everything that could be thought of as fun is gone. It might be worth it to play on Armor Games, since it's free there, but not here. It isn't worth the $2 or $3 price tag. Sorry, Badim, it just isn't worth it. I do look forward to other games in the future though. Think about upgrading the art style a little, and not taking away everything that makes a strategy game what it is.","March 19","false","0.2"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","54","79","2","3"

You hire, equip, and position heroes and their armies in order to attack enemies that become progressively more difficult.  You get gold and materials from each fight which you then use to improve them further, build gear to equip them with, or learn spells to cast directly during the fight.  For the amount of time you get out of it it's worth the low price tag.\n\nComplaints I still have are:\n\n1.  It can be  quite grindy in places as if you don't have the right army (the heroes you get from chalices are random, and you can wind up with too many mages/arches and not enough tanks or vice versa).  The dimension warp option (reset the map, take some stuff with you) partially mitigates this, but it still only lets you bring up to three heroes to the next area whereas you will need 25 for your army.  It's possible doing it more times will allow more than three heroes further on, I've just not seen it yet myself.  I've warped four times and it allowed 1 at first, then 3 each time after.\n\n2.  You don't control much once the fighting starts, you cannot give orders, only position your troops beforehand, all you can do during combat is cast spells.\n\n3.  If you have too many items, they will scroll off the screen and you won't be able to see them or select them in the dimension warp menu.  Similar problem in the crafting screen and with heroes after level 38 or 40 when leveling up, their skill box will be full, although they may have learned all possible skills at this point anyway.\n\n4.  I see this game is being updated currently which is good, but there is another verison on armorgames which is both free and has a more functional UI.  The graphics are worse, but they have corrected some of the UI problems I mentioned above, as well as have a total HP indicator for both you and the enemy during combat which is nice.  The prices are also more balanced, at least in the beginning (I didn't play there for long, just wanted to see what was different).\n\n5.  There seem to be some unfinished aspects of the game--there is a "storyline" screen but it is empty, and nothing happens when you beat the final areas on the far right side of the screen.  Although at this point I have not beaten all of the bonus areas on the bottom left, with the boss-only battles that drop runes every time.\n\nOverall this is a decent game but would be better with some of the above fixed.\n\n*It is possible that some of these issues have already been fixed, it seems there were a couple of patches since the last time I used the warp, and since I pretty much beat the game minus the bonus areas last time, I have not yet played far enough back in to see if these things still happen.  Total HP bar on both sides like on armorgames would be nice though.\n\nEdit - this version also lists each hero's "favorite weapon" in the hiring screen but not in the barracks, and gives no indication of what that means if anything.  In the Armorgames version, they can only equip their favorite weapon, and a picture of it is indicated in the barracks equipment screen.","March 25","true","33.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Placement of troops play a huge role in defeating the goblin enemies. If a certain arrangement don't work, try another.\n\nThe game is pretty passive (a good break from other games since many games require you to react) as you can just start the round and watch the enemy get massacred. Crafting weapons is on a 3x3 grid which is similar to another popular game.\n\nI guess this game is pretty good overall but a better tutorial would help.","March 17","true","5.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

It has so many things that rpg and strategy lovers will find familiar, but also interesting. The crafting system is not too complicated, and if you have played Minecraft, then you know a lot of the recipes already. Some of the higher tier items will require some grinding to acquire the materials, or some  investigating to figure out the hidden blueprint hinted at by one of your counselors.\n\nThis game as I said before, is not perfect, and there are some parts of the game that aren't as sharp as the rest, but I don't see anything that is poorly done, or not well thought out. The dev is very active in the community here on the Steam Forum, as well as developing a few other games that make it feel something akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion. The games use the similar art style, and many of the characters look the same, which gives this game a sense of familiarity, and letting you immerse yourself in this world. I would love to see a tie in, that shows where in the game world, each of these games are taking place, and perhaps even a game that connects many of the characters together to fight together for a common goal.\n\n\nIf you enjoy games that have many characters to try to find and recruit, countless pieces of equipment, to craft and equip on your characters to best suit their skills, Increasing your personal magic abilities, learning and upgrading spells from 5 different schools of magic and tactically setting up your army to to best protect your key heroes while also finding the weak spot in the enemies formation, than you could definitely have a lot of fun, especially for the price. This game is a blast and I would say would be worth $15, especially with how often the dev updates the game, adding new features.","March 28","true","89.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Also please give detailed information about spells and skills that hero class using. The UI of heroes ability is clunky if you reach certain lvl and spells slot will go over the border when unlocked beyond 10.\n\nOverall this is a good game but feel empty with not so many feature. I hope there will be a future patch or sequel with storyline, improved graphic (can go full screen, support high resolution, etc), customization setting (battle speed, skip feature, auto spells, etc), additional feature (auto equip, quick crafting, additional resources to collect, player overall army upgrade, etc), and maybe online interaction (leaderboard, pvp encounter, etc).\n\nI know this game even if imported to steam, it's still feels like a typical flash/mobile games.

If the bugs are fixed and some more features are introduced. Like expanding the slots to place the troops "formation for the troops" making it larger so you can stack more Warriors in a row. Another feature that would take this game to the next level would be to have either automatic fights or a mode where you tell the troops where to go before the fights starts then you start it and they follow the pattern you have chosen.\n\n+ Good game considering how cheap it is.\n+ Good looking art.\n+ The description of what a hero like Favorite spell, Favorite weapon etc makes the game a little better and interesting.\n+ The creatures that is just walking around the map actually effect certain monsters etc. Trolls eat them to heal, cool effect cause i thought they were just there for visual effect on the map.\n+ It's a very easy game to multitask with since battles and everything is automatic.\n\n- Grinding is a bit too much at certain points. "The map before you can complete with 3 stars and the next one is too hard too complete. Not even talking about the final boss level on each section of the map"\n- Descriptions on heroes disappear after you buy them and doesn't show before you buy them.\n- Lack of description in the ui and overall. Some items you even have to hold left mouse button on them just to see what stats it gives. A simple hover description instead would make it so much easier and faster to switch items.\n\n\nNeutral: I don't know if there is a bonus if you equip a heroes favorite weapon, but if there is that's a + for sure.\nThe magic the player can use himself is kinda slow and boring cause you have to grind it up, neutral opionion because some people likes grinding and some doesn't.\n\nEdit:\n+ The new hotkey system for players casting made the spells more usefull since you just have to aim and press 1, 2, 3 and if you use the first spell the second spell becomes the first.\n\n+ Fixed a lot of the descriptions in menus, helps a lot. Also getting information about heroes before buying them, is really helpfull\n\n+ Added description in the Rally, being able to check heroes levels and what troops they have with them. It helps a lot when you are about to place the troops for strategy purposes\n\n- You can get duplicates of the blueprints..","March 18","true","12.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I generally like games with tower defense mentality where you have to kill or defend against a large diverse mass of enemies.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because while you can do all the basics - fight your fights, progress down the mission chain, manage your army - two issues make this a thing to stay away from.\n\nOne is that there is almost no explanation of anything.  "What happens when I click a button in the blue magic hat menu?  Oh, I learn a new random spell... but what happened to my water rune that took me hours to get?  Gone, though I wanted to save up two of them so I could upgrade my bless spell.  Guess I'll have to grind it out again."  The game is full of this kind of thing.  You have no idea how to do anything without experimentation which is often more expensive than you would like.\n\nThe second issue is that menus often overlap eachother so the icons of a top menu stack on the icons of the bottom menu, and the top menu buttons are always click-through.  You might want to do something on a top menu, but you didn't scroll the bottom menu just right before opening the top menu.  Now since the top menu button is stacked on the bottom menu button, the top menu button won't work, so its another mission you didn't want to do or worse - something that costs you an item for something you didn't want.\n\nThe point where I stopped playing the game was when I thought I would try out the dimension portal.  I could not figure out how to make it work.  The menu claims you can take one character to the next dimension, yet there are three character choices to make.  Picking three different characters does nothing.  Picking the same character in all three windows does nothing.  Not to mension that the items it wanted me to choose to bring were crowded on top of the OK / Cancel buttons.","March 21","false","14.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Rest of the text is raw text used during development. <- This problem was due to the corrupted files and in case you encounter it, i would suggest reinstalling the game.\n\n2) Game feels like it's lacking in real content - as in things to do other than grind a way on the maps. Adding new levels with new mobs isn't real content, the game needs something more.\n\nAfter unlocking the game features and testing them out I have to say that the warp system just resets the world so that you can keep your top 3 heroes and gear, but even the heroes levels go back to 1, I don't see how this feature brings anything to the table really - feels more like a way to create an unlimited loop that does not help with the lack of content.\n\nThe crafting system is kinda pointless in a way - it doesn't really bring anything to the table in the game, as all the loots are random and you just get them automaticly by going forward in the game. Sure some people might be amused with "guessing" some recepies and so forth, but the gear itself doesn't help in customising any way. The gear are just plain +stat and therefore really boring and I wouldn't mind at all if the system was removed completely.\n\n3) UI problems. The UI is lacking in several parts, more things need explaining and slight tweaks. Example: choosing a skill to heroes would be better off by making it into a list:\n\n"1-Skill icon" "description"\n"2-skill icon" "description"\n"3-skill icon" "description"\n\nThe encyclopedia has issues such as losing the first window with all the units if you click any filter on. You need to exit and return to view the full list.\n\n4) Bugs. I won't go deeper into the ones I have discovered since some of them can be game breaking. I have reported the issues to the developer.\n\nOver all I feel that this game should be f2p since even with 2€ price the game is way too unfinished for sale. Instead of being b2p I believe the correct way would be to move to f2p with some low cost skins or just donation possibilities.\n\nRoyal Heroes attempts to be somewhat of a magement rpg meets unlimited grind. But lacks in content and is hurt by all the little problems that gather into a large pile.","March 18","false","4.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","8"

Even if you opt for option 2 like I did you will still find the game is a dull grind fest.","March 24","false","11.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Any one that liked the series Royal Offense [out for mobile and flash sites like armorgames] will enjoy this. There are about 20 or so heros you can recruit. Each with small sets of troops that can also be built up. You can craft tons of equipment for  your heros to use, many with "sets" that give you a bonus. There are many levels and enemies to fight. With very hard bonus campaigns. There is a feature to reset your progress when you get far and bored, and this unlocks many bonus features and special gear that cant be obtained any other way. Thus making replay value high and enjoyable. You can also position your troops for a bit of strategy. Also the creator and staff is very active.  They listen to their players and make constant improvements. So this game has a future for it.

Another aspect i enjoyed was the unit variety and watching my army go to work with the skills and equipment i choose for everyone having a noticiable effect. Fun but simple. edit: so someone on the forums said they hadnt experienced this issue either and that maybe i just reinstall my game, doing so fixed it BUT i am going to keep playing for the same length i did last time before the bug prescented itself and see if i can recreate it or if it was just something that happened and worked itself out.  if thats the case ill edit my review to reflec this. edit again.. this time ive played it for about the same length as before but without any issues. not sure whats up but it seems like it was just me that was having issues and the dev and a forum user helped me work it out so im changing my review acordingly.","March 17","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The interface is big and easy to resize, the game has a mute button, runs in a resizeable window and is mouse only so it is a drawing tablet friendly game.\n\nThe unit graphics are really nice pixelart. At first, it feels like you don't effect the flow of the battle but as you unlock more skills, crafting options and spells, you will be able to customize and even name each unit until they feel like your own. The levels start off easy and gradually get harder. This game is not a truly difficult challenge but I still enjoy playing it.\n\nThis is the perfect game for listening to a podcast or an audiobook because you set up your tactics prior to battle, battle is automatic and so is loot-collecting. It has a good feedback loop of changing unit positions and loadouts.","May 8","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seirennaito/recommended/439920/","Seirennaito","SNKN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seirennaito/","1014 products in account","Review for Royal Heroes\n\nRoyal Heroes is a casual game with suprisingly great rpg mechanics and progression. It has an impressive array of features that make this game truthfully entertaining and it is very apt to suck you into its easy to use interface and solid strategic mechanics for a casual game.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nFull Review and Features\n\nThe following will rate the games mechanics, sound, graphics, replayability, and value for price on a 1 to 10 score.\n\nA score of 1 being do NOT buy the game if you value this feature. 10 being you MUST buy this game if you value this feature.  5 is a completely average score meaning I have no problems with it but at the same time nothing about it impresses me.\n\nMechanics: 9\n\nThis is a simple casual game that really gets itself in front of the rather large and dull pack of casual games on offer.  The premise of the game is direct. You simply hire units, put them in a formation of your choice, and start a battle. You watch your battles commence for the most part as their is no direct control of the armies. However the meat of the game is setting up your armies equipment, skills, squad size and strength, spells, and so on. The strategy comes in on how you set up your formations which will vary based on the types of enemies you will face. Some control of your armies will begin when you obtain mages for your party as they can use AOE (Area Of Effect) spells that you may place on the battlefield for your advantage.\n\nThe game gives you the ability to craft weapons, armor, trinkets, and other stuff using a minecraft-esque system of loot management and crafting on a 3 by 3 grid. You can obtain recipies as loot that will show you how to craft a specific type of item, however you can also experiment with your crafting items and learn how to craft items on your own in case you want something before you find a blueprint for it. You can also recycle unwanted gear in the crafting section which will give you a chance to obtain a different peice of equipment that may be more useful.\n\nOnce you unlock the mages guild you obtain access to a spellbook, as you unlock more spells and spell slots you can equip any combonation of the spells to your spellbook. As you use the spells in battle they will level up and become stronger. This is highly customizable to your playstyle and allows your mages to take on versatile roles.\n\nThe games overworld is setup in a familiar mobile game like style where each level has sub levels where you can obtain 1 to 3 stars based on how long it takes you to defeat the enemy army. Getting three stars will let you obtain more gold and loot. You unlock new levels by defeating all the sub levels in each level. Obtaining 100% of the stars in a level can unlock special levels that are more challenging and will require more strategy on your part to defeat them.\n\nSound: 6\n\nThere is not much to say about the music and effects in this game. The overworld music is rather relaxing and nice. The music in general is high quality for a casual game you won't be wowwed by anything but at the same time there is nothing here that will annoy you or grate on you over time.\n\nGraphics: 7\n\nThe graphics are about what you would expect from a casual indie game. The entire feel of the graphics would suggest this game was ported from mobile, or meant to be a mobile game originally. However the graphics do have a certain charm to them. They definitly fit the overall style of the game and there is nothing really to complain about graphically. Some assets get reused a bit too often however there is a decent variety to the types of units you can hire. The amount of units that are fielded at one time in battles gets quite impressive and is a real treat to watch.\n\nReplayability: 9\n\nThis is the kind of game that will keep you coming back for more when you are bored. It is easy enough to pick up and play even after an extended period of time away from the game. The game does give some incentive to come back and play again after a day as it will give you goals to complete once in a while that will grant you loot and gold. There are no microtransactions at all which is refreshing for this kind of game. It is great fun wrapped in a neat package.\n\nValue for price: 9\n\nAt 2.99 for the content and replayability of this game on the steam platform it is extremely reasonable. You will get hours of entertainment out of this game. This game however does have free versions on websites such as kongregate. However the web version has lower quality graphics and music. It also has less features, updates, and an inferior interface. The 2.99 price in this case is extremely justified. If this game did not have free web versions and they were selling it on steam for 4.99 I would still consider that a very fair value.\n\nChanges from free version\n-  Graphical improvements\n-  Audio Improvements\n-  Mechanic improvements\n-  Added features\n-  Steam trading cards\n-  More frequent patches and updates\n-  Very active development staff for Steam platform\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOverall: 8.5\n\nIf you are looking for a great casual game to sit back and play frusteration free yet still challenging if you take on its special challenges this is the game for you. If you prefer a deeper and more interactive experience in your combat instead of pre combat strategy then you may want to stay away from this game. I personally highly reccomend this game for anyone who wants something to fill up some spare time, or have a game to casually play while studying, web surfering, or doing meanial tasks. It will keep you entertained but not overly distracted.\n\nThank you for reading this review. If you have requests for me to review another game please add me and I will give a game a fair and honest review. I own nearly one thousand games on my account and chances are I have the game you would like reviewed. If I do not own it I can do research for you and give you a reccomendation.\n\nHave a great day!","April 30","true","12.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The developer is very active and are working on more patches, addons and storyline to the game all the time. BIG THUMPS UP!\n\nThey rock and they are active! (two importen things for gamers)\n\nThere are constructive discussions and debates within the community and the fanbasen is growing all the time. They ask what gamers want to have implemented in the game. They are even talking about pvp game play and other game modes..;)\n\nThis is a perfect example of a development team who are gamers themselves! They know what we want and they listen to the criticism coming their way (not that there has been much criticism), but suggestions they use for new ides to the game...\n\nI simply love playing this game in my private studio, when i am not making music. Sometimes i enjoy this game a little too much, so i am gaming instead of making music and earning money...LOL..:)\n\nAt this low price tag i give this game a solid 10/10 - And i base that on the constant expending of the game and the great dev´s - Elite Games Ltd - YOU ROCK!","May 20","true","55.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
