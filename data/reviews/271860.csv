"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/271860/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection feels like the sort of game that would come to a developer out of a bizarre fever dream. Imagine a hyperactive shmup, involving a homicidal insect (which may actually be a spaceship), fighting a barrage of alien demon creatures across planets. Now picture it set to a soundtrack by British hip-hop rock artist The Sixty Fours, in which you create combos and get upgrades by solving basic math problems, and you've got a pretty good idea of what Killer Hornet is.\n\nFor as ludicrous as the premise sounds, as a fan of shmups I was still open to giving it a chance and hoping to be if not impressed, then at least entertained. The problem though is two fold: firstly the outlandish components fit poorly together, and on top of being really weird seem gimmicky, like the developers pulled random nouns and adjectives out of a hat and based the game around them.\n\nSecond, taken by themselves the different parts that make up Killer Hornet are of a very low quality, almost to the point of embarrassment. The shooting is bland and the enemies the very definition of "cannon fodder", flinging themselves into the path of my gun and being incredibly boring to fight. Few new enemies get added over the games 6 levels (which take about 30 minutes to complete, but this is countered by bosses being reused repetitively to inflate the length of the levels without actually adding anything new. Neither of the two soundtracks are noteworthy, with The Sixty Four's being particularly jarring as it is essentially the same as playing an MP3 over the sound effects and doesn't effect or connect with the action on screen. Most glaring though is the art direction, an area I historically give a lot of slack for the sake of "artistic expression", but in this case cannot dismiss how truly awful it looks (made even worse by running at a locked 640x480 resolution).\n\nIt's been awhile since a game has inspired the roller coaster of momentary surprise and excitement so quickly followed by disappointment and disgust that Super Killer Hornet did. It's a shallow, poorly made game with an absurd price tag that I honestly don't believe belongs on Steam. It's crazy setup might have made for a fun 5-minute flash game, but is not something I can get behind as a retail title, and my advice for anyone considering it would be the same as for those confronted by an actual hornet: stay away or expect to get stung!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 6, 2014","false","2.6"," 168 of 201 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","168","201","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hqDM/recommended/271860/","hqDM","黄昏帝国★hqDM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hqDM/","779 products in account","I think the verdict on this one is save your money.\nIt plays and looks very much like a student's term project, rather than a fleshed out game.\nAs a bonus addon to a groupees bundle, it's right at home. But charging $7 for this, on sale, just seems unethical.\n\nBoasts full controller support, but there's noticeable input lag with a 360 controller on movement and bombs. Bombs don't go off immediately when used, so you can still die after bombing (and it'll still use your bomb). It's also not clear what level of enemy they destroy, some will survive the bomb and instantly KO you, as there doesn't seem to be hit invuln while bombing. Maybe chalk that up as a "feature".\n\nThe soundtrack options are limited to a few songs, nothing autoswaps. When you pick a song, you're limited to that one song on repeat for the rest of your gameplay, until you start a new game and pick a new one. Gets old real fast.\n\nGraphics, well..  you can see the screenshots. But instead of endearing retro, it just feels cheap. Not a major point of contention, but it's a little weird. Clash of styles.\n\nFinally, the math system is wholly unnecessary. What demographic is this being marketed towards? The "Brain train twist" is elementary-grade addition, subtraction, and ohboy sometimes multiplication being thrown at you amidst the bullets. It feels poorly thought out to say the least. Various numbers will fall during gameplay, and you collect them to boost your power upgrades, forming equations + answers. 8+1=45 is totally mentally taxing, I think this game just might be too hard for me. Once you hit max power, it then becomes a game of dodging the numbers, so you don't accidentally downgrade yourself. During the 2nd stage's razor blade mode, you can't even see the numbers falling in the swarm of enemies that appears, and will likely eat a downgrade or two. The 2nd stage boss forces you to assemble these equations, if i may even call them that, while dodging bullets as your sole way of damaging the boss in the second phase of the fight. Just let me shoot stuff, please.\n\nAll in all, I think this is the first shmup I really disliked. The math system is an unnecessary dilution of what would be otherwise somewhat passable gameplay.\n\nedit: In survival mode it does away with the math, feels much more coherent.","February 6, 2014","false","7.9"," 97 of 122 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","97","122","0","0"

Hope you guys find it helpful and if so, a thumbs up would be appreciated, thanks. :D\n--------------------\nScoring Guide\n1 - 3 Terrible\n4 - 6 Decent\n7 - 9 Good\n10 Perfect\n--------------------\n\nSo after writing my first review,  I had a chat with the Dev (which you can see in the comments below) and decided to put a little bit more time into Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection. I booted up the game, played all of the modes, killed all the things, and now feel like I have my review to write.\n\n[Gameplay] 8/10\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo the Gameplay is rock-solid, the best thing about this game in my humble opinion. There are Three different Ships to choose from. The first being average damage and average area of attack, The second having a lower damage but higher area of attack, and a Third with higher damae but very small area of attack. They all felt very good while playing them. I did find the higher area of attack to be the best one, although this may just be personal opinion. If i had one complaint about the Ships would be the lack of a boost/quick dash button. Sometimes I feel like that would help things out a ton, and would add a nice other level to the game. Deffinetly not needed, but I would have liked to see one none the less.\nYou do have bombs, like in most other games in this genre, and they work the same way. I'm not 100% on if you can refill the bombs, it may have said something in the tutorial that I missed, but other than that I did not find a way to.\n\nThe main difference in this and others in the genre is the math. "Destruction is just part of the equation" is exactly what it sounds like. In certain game mode, there are numbers that will fall down, such as 7+, a few seconds later another will fall, such as 5, Lastly 3 other numbers will fall, one of them being the answer. You must solve the problem and you will get a multiplier to your score. I will say, as I did in my first review I am not a fan of this. It is not bad, and it is well done, I just am not a fan.\n\nAs in game modes, this game has quite a few for an indie title.\nYou have your regular mode, as well as an easy mode in which it will automatically use one of your bombs after you get hit.\nTime Attack pits you against the clock, and gives you a max multiplier at the start. Doing the math in this mode will give you +30 seconds to the clock, which I actually like alot more than the regular mode, not sure why it just "feels" better to me. Personal opinion I guess.\nLastly you have a survival mode, which has no math, you have one life and max multiplier.\nThe game modes are well varried, and you can play around with them and find your favorite.\n\nSo I'm not sure weather to put this under Gameplay or Design but  think it may go best here. I did have trouble seeing the numbers sometimes while playing. As this is a bullet hell type game, I won't say this is a huge problem, and it may be just me, but i felt like sometimes i got "cheated" out of the correct answer because of so much stuff going on on-screen. Again this may just be me and being bad at the game, but if I had one major gripe about the gameplay this would be it.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Design] 8/10\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe design of the game is pretty good for an indie game. All of the menue's look and feel fine while navigating them, and the particles are actually very well done for an indie game.\nNow let me make it clear that there are better looking indie games out there, but Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection looks just fine, no complaints here.\n\nThe enemy ships while being generic are varried in design, and while I only reached the 2nd level, I will say I do find a certain charm in the enemy design. I would like to play farther, just to see what else the game has in store for me. Bosses are the same way, although I will say I only reached the first one as I did not beat the second level. Again I would like to get farther, just to see some of the other boss design. :D\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Music/Sound] 6/10\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe music in Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection is solid. The intro had me hyped from the very beggining. It is a metal/rock track and gets you ready to blow some ♥♥♥♥ up.\nThere are a total of 5 tracks and they are all prety good, tho not amazing. They seem to get quite repetitive, quite fast, and would have liked to have seen a different type of music in the actual game. You can switch tracks in game with the press of a button, which i greatly appreciate as not enough games do this. All in all I would say the music, while good, is the weakest part of the game.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Conclusion] 7/10\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll in all I feel like Super Killer Hornet: Ressurection (love the name by the way :D) is a very well made indie game and deffinetly, if you are a fan of the genre, worth your time and money. For the fair price of $4.99 I would deffinetly recommend this title.\n\nThanks for reading doods.","November 4, 2014","true","0.9"," 83 of 114 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","83","114","9","16"

Throughout the stages you "pick-up" different numbers. My first "1+" the next...."10". That's easy, 11. You fly through the number 11, you get a bigger and better gun! Oh awesome! As you get further and further into the level, the questions become a little harder and the multiple choice answers appear much quicker. You better know your times table up to 13 off by heart because otherwise you are in for a bumpy ride.\n\nTo me this screams out as a learning aid for children, but whether parents or teachers would want the kids to be playing a game so heavily involving shooting stuff as being suitable, I don't know.\n\nThere is multiple different game modes, Arcade, time attack as well as in game awards. Sadly these aren't linked to Steam achievements though.  Another downfall is there is no options at all here. You are stuck with the poor resolution which is stretched terribly when you enter full screen, the music is horribly repetitive after the first 5 or 6 plays and you'll probably end up turning the music off all together to be honest.\n\nFor the price, I'd recommend it, some real classic bullet hell action with the added twist of math!","January 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","27","41","7","4"

Take old-school shmup action and throw in some math problems in order to increase your multiplier and power up your ship. The game itself is short, with only 6 stages, but it's a single-sitting game, which makes it infinitely replayable. After beating the game on "Auto-Bomb" difficulty, which is effectively the game's standard difficulty, I've found myself mostly replaying in Survival mode, which is an interesting change of pace. There's also a Time Attack mode, with three difficulty settings, which puts you on a limited timer, which can only be refilled by completing math equations correctly. Playing Time Attack mode on Survival difficulty is a pretty fun time killer, once you've completed the game's main campaign.\n\nThe graphical style seems to invoke old-school DOS games in my opinion, which is a welcome change of pace compared to most retro-inspired aesthetics, which go for an 8-bit NES look.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd have to say SKH:R is definitely worth the $5 Flump Studios is asking for.

Nothing feels under-done in the weapon effects and explosions department, but importantly enemy bullets never get visually lost amongst it all.\n\nThe main thing to recommend it for me is the idea that it has of powering up your ship's weapons by doing maths - the power-ups make simple maths problems and you have to get them right to power your gun.\n\nAs well as the maths problems it has some novel combo-based scoring mechanics that come in with specific enemies and in general communicates them well to the player (I worked them out more or less straight away).\n\nDefinitely a fun diversion from the run of the mill shmups.","February 8, 2014","true","0.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

And this game is fast, fun and intresting. But bad raelisation is almost ruined it. First of all - primitive menu and no settings at all. Like sound options, graphics, change controls etc. I know it is very easy to implement. Why it is not done yet I don't get it. Second is only two resolutions in the game. Small and very small. What the hell is it video game from 90-s? And at the end is too much challenge, cos you can't see numbers or just can't reach them any way (usually I takes wrong number on my way to correct one). Need to bright up numbers some way or to shine and reduce reach radius of them just a little.\n\nSo if dev will fix all issues... I will strongly recommend this game to play. For now you can give it a try, when it's cheap.\n\nAnd I like the music. It's strange I know but...

You get 2 games for the price of 1 cheap game, so I'll break down this review accordingly.  Please bear in mind, I got this game for $0.50.  Let's begin.\n\nThe original game feels like it's trying to be something it's not, and that is a touhou game.  If you don't know what a touhou game is, look it up online.  It want's to be one, but isn't.  The overall concept is sound enough, but I'm not sure who their intended audience is.  To get power-ups, you need to correctly solve relatively simple math problems.  So is it ment to be an educational game?  If that's the case, it's far too edgey for practical classroom use, and far too difficult for at-home use by the average pre-schooler.  Overall, it's not bad, it's just misguided.  It's trying to bridge to completely unalike genres, and it fails to do so.  Does that make it a bad game in it's own right? No, or at least, I don't think so.\n\nThe main game you buy is Resurrection, and it suffers from the same problems as the first, with some more fluid controls, better graphics, and even SIMPLER math.  I know math is a core element of the franchise, but it really doesn't belong in a shoot-em-up.  Also, british rock for the main soundtrack?  Odd choice, but at this point, we're far beyond the point of random.  It fits, nonetheless.  Overall, better than the first, but I'm still mixed about it.  Not that it's a bad game, it just doesn't define it's place very well.\n\nFor the both of them together, you won't be disappointed.  The gameplay is solid, the controls fluid, and the soundtrack will leave you rocking out for a while at least.  The core fundamentals are unique, but slightly awkward.  Don't let that distract you.\n\nThis game gets my Seal of Approval.  Pick it up the next time it's on sale, or if you're genuinely curious.","January 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals and gameplay are a little dated, but whether that's from laziness or intended as an homage to its retro forebears, this game could still hold its own among the crowd of old 16-bit arcade shooters. The choice of soundtrack is puzzling, but at least it can be changed on the fly with the press of a single button to something a little more fitting. The game's gimmick of solving elementary school math problems while dodging bullets in order to powerup falls a bit flat, as I wasn't so distracted by the action that I fumbled with the problems, which I think was the developer's intent. Instead, I found it a lot harder to navigate through the bullets to collect the correct answer. Still, this added more to the simple gameplay than it detracted. Finally, the inclusion of the original Super Killer Hornet was a nice touch, even though it isn't a good game. All in all, I'm pretty surprised by how many negative reviews there are of this game. It's an average title on its worst day.","December 1, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can make it run fullscreen but you have to use your keyboard to make it fit the whole screen (no black bars).\n\nSound\n\nThe music is very good, specially the one that plays when you start the game.\n\nDifficulty\n\nIt's a pity there isn't a more casual option, as I gave up playing it because of the difficulty.  As a comparison, I am playing Jamestown and was able to get to the final level, beating the other levels on the Legendary difficulty (equal to "hard").\n\nVeredict\n\nI recommend this game if you like shoot'em'up games, but only grab it in a sale.","December 27, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This suits well as a retro style game of the shoot em up/bullet hell type games with a twist of math for upgrades. However being released for 2014 its pretty lack luster for what it should be for its age.\n\nI imagine those that are new to this genre of games will not enjoy this because of that.\n\nThose that grew up knowing or playing many of the old or starters of the genre can enjoy it as a throw back with the new math concept thrown into the mix. It is not the math that is tough at all, but a certain times trying to maneuver across the screen dodging all the bullets to the correct number you need can get rough.\n\nOverall though enjoyable.","January 15, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It feels and looks very much like an old shareware game from the 1990s although some may find that appealing but personally it isn't something that encourages me to buy a game.\n\nFor a windowed game with extremely low requirements it sure doesn't like being alt-tabbed or otherwise not in focus and often freezes when brought back in focus. I missed the way to change the volume my first time playing it which was my fault, but you still cannot change the volume until you are almost ready to start the game and it was rather loud and the default song is very repetitve. Also its icon on my taskbar is of a Xbox 360 controller, which just looks weird on PC. The game seems to control fine enough with keyboard & mouse and the solving simple math puzzles to power up is novel but I feel like the meme "Nobody ain't got time for that!" applies most of the time, although given it is a bullet hell that is quite fitting.\n\nSKH:R is limited to 60FPS and the bonus original SKH is limited to 30 FPS.\n\nHaving the option to play the old arcade version is pretty cool, the music is much better in that IMO, but it also seems to lack options for volume and changing key bindings, although upon retrying it they aren't as weirdly placed as I first thought. It is definitely a lot harder too.\n\nPerhaps someone really into (retro) bullet hells would enjoy this, but personally I don't think I would recommend it to anyone unless they were.","February 3, 2015","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

A bullet hell shooter that originally destined for XBox Live eventually made it’s way onto Steam. I originally was going to write a review for Danmaku Unlimited 2, but this game caught my attention and I decided to try something new first.\n\nStarting with the good, SKH:R is a decent shoot em’ up (shmup for short). Controls are alright, but the hit-box for the ship and bullets can get dodgy at points in the game. The game isn’t as hard as other bullet hell shooters or shmups, making it a good entry point for someone who wants to get into the genre.\n\nThe way you power up your ship is a bit annoying. In the midst of shooting enemies and dodging bullets you have to a number ranging from 1 to 11 with a math sign next to it (+, - , / or x), then grab another number (again 1 through 11), then grab the correct answer. Answering correctly powers up your ship, an incorrect answer will power down your ship. Rhythm Destruction had this same issue of distracting the player from the gameplay. Not only do you have to dodge bullets, you have to focus on picking up two numbers, solving an equation, then finding the corresponding answer in the onslaught of bullets. However unlike Rhythm Destruction, this style of powering up feels tacked on and isn’t fully integrated into the gameplay as one would hope. The gameplay is solid, but the overall look of the game lacks polish.\n\nWhile I wish a bit more polish went into the final product, it is a decent schmup. At $4.99 it's a good beginners introduction into the schmup / bullet hell genre (or for someone who likes a retro game look), however for die-hard lovers of the genre I would pass for other games in the genre at the same price point.\n\nSee more of the review at: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/super-killer-hornet-resurrection","October 7, 2014","false","2.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Congratulations you just got your wish.\n\nThe idea isn’t a horrible one, but the implementation is less-than-stellar to say the least. The sprites and action feel less “retro” and more just “cheap” with a dodgy hit-box, underwhelming visuals (some of the enemy designs are creative, but the actual quality is iffy), and bullet patterns that feel like they were tossed in at random.\n\nThis would be bad enough but the whole unique selling point of solving math equations feels like it was shoehorned in at the last moment. Not only are they dreadfully simple; rarely being more than fifth-grade multiplication, but the whole system feels like an afterthought rather than what the game was built around. You can play with the math system off if you wish, but take it away and you’re left with the subpar bullet hell I described above. Definitely can’t suggest it.\n\nNote: As for the music I’ll leave that one up to you. You can play with the music you hear in the trailer or a more traditional soundtrack. The traditional one is a very generic, if working, shmup soundtrack. The licensed songs are much more a matter of taste being a very niche-genre so if you like what you hear in the trailer then you’ll probably like the other ones on offer. Or vice-versa.","April 14, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

If I could give neutral, I would but for now I don't recommend.","January 7","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
