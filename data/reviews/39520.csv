"http://steamcommunity.com/id/benatssu/recommended/39520/","benatssu","benatssu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/benatssu/","289 products in account","First up, I am writing this review as how it plays today.  It's annoying reading someone's review and it starts out something like this:  "I remember when this first came out and blah blah blah"  and they're reminiscing of the good old days and basing their review on the experience they had when it was new.  I mean, the original Wolfenstein and Doom was awesome back in its time but to rate it on todays standards they're pretty crappy..\n\nAlthough this game is dated in its appearance, it is stll loads of fun!  You can literally sit on it for hours it's one of those games you lose track of time with as you start to hear birds outside for the sun is coming up.. I have this game on GoG but got it in a package here on Steam, and after reading in other people's reviews they said its buggy and keeps crashing, I thought I'd test it out to see if it runs OK.. Well, 4 hours whooshed by as I got stuck into a new game of it as a blacksmith, worked my way up to goldsmith and now I'm looking for a wife coz if you dont have any kids there's no one to carry on your business and estates!\n\nAs for bugs and/or crashed?  Zero.. Game runs fine on Windows 7 with a nvidia graphics card.  The graphics are quite dated as to be expected it's over 10 years old.  Perhaps other users didn't run the graphics first time set up correctly?  It does ask for your primary graphics, and an option when you click play "Launch with newer graphics card"...  Well everyone's rig is different so who knows what is conflicting with them, but as for me I didn't have any problems but I'm sure there are ways to fix it if you do experience any faults.\n\nThe learning curve seems a bit steep at first.  If you jump into a new game with no knowledge how the mechanics work I doubt you will get far.  There are tutorials to go thru accessed in the main menu, enough to get you started and once you pick it up you can lose yourself in the game.  And there always seems to be new stuff to discover.  For example, you can run for government positions and the higher up you go, there are more perks such as additional income, and abilities to change tax rates, laws, etc..\n\nSo when you start a new game, you choose what profession you wish to be.  Blacksmith, Carpenter, Perfumer, Priest, Gravedigger, just to name some.  Each profession has different things to be done, and has different benefits that can help you.  And example here would be a carpenter can make a toy, and usually you would sell them at the marketplace but if you have kids, you want them to be happy and do well so you can give them as a gift.  You can still do that as a blacksmith but you would just have to buy the toy at the sell price from the marketplace.  A goldsmith can make jewellery to woo a potential wife, and so on.  There is so much to do in this game, while you're expanding your business, hiring more employees, improving your workshops, buying raw materials, selling finished products, extending your home, learning new skills, blackmailing an official, bribing a judge, finding a wife (especially good if she is rich, boost the ol' bank ballance!), having some kids, putting them though school, making sure they get into the best university so when you kick the bucket they have the best stats you can give them and then you carry on the game as them!\n\nStarting a new game as a different profession is almost an entire new game in itself.  Choosing a city to start in determines the difficutly, building areas, size, etc.. I haven't even tried them all yet, some are more difficult and require a whole different approach.  Some differ as in the trade you choose, the products and materials needed are different, as a thief you are pickpocketing and scouting homes and businesses, robbing trade carts, etc.  As a grave digger you're digging up bones and making stuff with it, as a priest you're in a church making paper and writing scrolls..\n\nIt really is pretty addicitive, and not quite like any other game.  It's very complex but only as much as you want it to be.  You can go thru an entire game just growing your business buy making and selling stuff... Or you apsire to be emperor, climbing your way up the political ladder, gathering dirt on your opponents, starting rumors, sabotaging, and all sorts of stuff... And if you pick it up on special for $1.99 like it is now, it's well worth it.. And if you're too late and it's back to its normal price of $9.99 then pop it on your wishlist and wait for the xmas sales ;)","September 20, 2014","true","26.7"," 108 of 115 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","108","115","3","2"

What suprised me was the depth that this game had and how much strategy you had to use to plan ahead the future of your character. Your first game will be rough, at the start you won't know what to do and you'll make mistakes!

It is quite old, so the graphics - especially the people animations - are almost painful to look at, while the buildings are still more or less ok. It is fun, even if on the long run it can get a bit boring; all in all, there is not that much that you can do: evolving your buildings, micro-managing the production of some goods to sell, fighting to rise the social ladder applying for jobs in the Empire. Someone really needs to explain to me why if you play in London, the highest authority is the Emperor - meaning the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, of which England has never been a part...\nI bought it together with The Guild II and all its expansions; I am pretty sure those are gonna have more to offer, but for less than 1 euro it was definitely worth my time!","July 9, 2015","true","15.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

If you really want a business sim in the 1400's, then this might be for you. If you are willing to do some odd workarounds and have patience with flaws then it's definitely for you. The core of it, a business sim, is still very good.\n\nThe game is buggy and unfriendly and has a lot of things going on that it is hard to keep up the patience with. The UI is very very poorly designed - you can learn to like it, but it will take some time. Early game is somewhat ruined by the blatant cheating from the AI. Late game is somewhat ruined by the lack of working auto-features that makes you have to micromanage a lot of things. Sometimes you need to save and reload to be able do do stuff or progress.

Dont let the time count fool you i played the original Guild for easily over 1k+ hours back during high school (minus all the patches...) and now we have a fully patched and somewhat great release of The Guild Gold on steam.\n\nI wont ramble too much but heres the jist of the game: You are a poor boy from a poor family out in the forest that comes to the big city to make yourself into something. Sounds simple right? Nope! you cant make yourself super big and successful on your first character so youll be making a Dynasty in the city you'll be playing in to which there are several cities spread across Europe who have their own politics and events to deal with with one of them being other dynasties.\n\nOne of the great things about The Guild is that not only are you trying to run your business and not go broke, you also have to not only contend with other dynasties in the same town but also regional politics, everyone can at some point be eligible for every job in the game except for the Emperor/King itself, so while you are climbing the political and economic ladders your opponents and friends in other dynasties will be doing the same, it helps keep the game competitive as it wont take long for you and others to carve battle lines throughout the town (You and your allied Dynasties vs the others).\n\nThe game with the expansion pack which is part of the Gold edition allows for a variety of careers to play with, some are downright impossible to play due to being at the mercy of the marketplace or the one place that you and 5 other dynasties are buying stock from while others are so laughably easy that once you have several of these businesses running you only need to focus on politics or underhanded methods to screw around with other dynasties.\n\nBut as this is quite an old game it does have its problems, Gold does work on Windows 7 but for some it requires changing the desktop to 16bit to actually play, the game (as well as its sequels) were notoriously buggy at release and while the current final version of gold to my knowledge is bug free keep an eye out while playing as well as save often.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable and comfy game, definitely worth a buy so you can chill out and build your business as the seasons roll on by.","November 7, 2015","true","9.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Occasionally though, enemy dynasties will die out on their own if they don't have any children.

Came in with low expectations, and it's been a gem so far.  Interesting enough to play with my 10/13-year-old boys, and captures their interest too.  Has a lot of character and charm to it, and the occasional understated humor keeps it lively.  UI is definitely...  not quite painful, but uncomfortable and quirky.\n\nBut the UI aside, it's just delightful with its variety and little surprises.  I love the variety there is between how the game plays with different professions.  I just wish multiplayer worked, but I guess when I get to The Guild 2 I'll do it there.\n\nThe more I play it, the more I love it.  Heartily recommended.  You *will* have to be patient at first as you scale the learning curve, but it's very much worth the climb.\n\nsgd.

The game does not work correctly on Windows 8 & 10. It is very laggy to a point of being barely playable (least enjoyable) and even if you manage to make it run smooth in a small window or low resolution fullscreen in the middle of a display with the rest of the screen blacked out, it keeps crashing approximately every half an hour.\n\nIf you're running Windows 7 or older, you'll get quite deep trading/building strategy game with social elements reminiscent those of Crusader Kings 2 on a smaller city-level scale. You start the game as one of several handicraft craftsmen and produce, buy and sell goods and later meddle into politics. The game has it's own life of a sort so while a player is doing 'his thing', the other AI characters in game are doing the same. Getting married, producing children, rising into political functions, gaining noble titles based on their wealth, breaking into people's homes and businesses to steal, blackmailing, attending court charges, influencing judges by money/gifts/black magic, abusing political power to own advantage (like outlawing the use of body oils & sprays if your enemy is a perfumer by profession), setting business competitor buildings on fire and so on. The game is not built around a player awaiting his input.\n\nThere's quite a lot going on in the game. Once an old character dies and his child takes over, you lose control of other family tree branches, but they still do exist in the background and get on with their lives in game, so you occasionally encounter other people with the same surname (even their descendants) running other businesses or in politics. It's a quite good indicator the game indeed works on deep levels and is not just a shining gold for the eyes pretending to be complex.\n\nMusic is absolutely great and is the best medieval styled music I've ever heard in a computer game. This GOLD edition includes an Expansion Pack, which added lot of magic&fantasy styled theme, items, zombies and professions into the game to some extent destroying the feel of more or less realistic medieval period. Back in the days I never installed it, which is not possible with this Gold version.\n\nOverall I always had a blast with this game and sticked to it over it's successor 'The Guild 2' which was plagued by bugs to a point of not being enjoyable. Since there is 'The Guild 3' in development, the newly established team started fixing standalone 'The Guild 2 Renaissance' (which has never been fixed due to it's publisher JoWood going bankrupt) as sort of advertisement for the upcoming game. If anything, I'd suggest skipping this old game on new Windows OS and try 'The Guild 2 Renaissance' with the latest patches available instead. IF you DO run older Windows OS, this game is worth trying, otherwise I have to regrettably suggest avoiding it, despite it's qualities.","April 28","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During the intial install, if you have a graphics card that can support dual monitors, there is a drop down with your graphics card listed twice.  Out of curiosity I picked the second option.\n\nNow, the game movies will play on my primary monitor as they should.  But the game itself plays on my secondary monitor.  I have never found that drop down again, even after uninstalling and reinstalling.  So I cannot recommend this game if it won't even let me change something like which monitor it plays on (AFTER FIRST GIVING ME THAT OPTION AT SETUP!)\n\nIf someone can tell me how to fix this issue, I will change my recommendation.","October 18, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","4","11","3","0"

The biggest gripe I have with this game, that you can't alt-tab or run in windows mode. Before the gold edition, you could fix this problem with a registry edit. However, with the gold edition, the developers took that option away. Because of that, I refuse to recommend this game. It's not a bad game, it's the kind of game that either enthralls you for days on end or drives you up the wall to gnaw at the curtain rods. Regardless, the developers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for disabling alt-tab and not including a windows mode. My advice, get this game in a humblebundle and make sure all the proceeds goes to charity.

Make any changes to graphics options and the game may not open and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled for any chance of playing again.  All in all, a typical JoWood "kiss of death" game -- most of the games this company was involved with or collaborated on at the time earned bad reviews, and from this one you will understand why.  Almost no effort has been put into making it good.","November 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","0"

It is set within the 1400s, with you being a poor boy in search of becoming rich and creating a successful dynasty. The game itself feels very unfinished with bugs left, right and center and animations being off with the sound/voice acting. The first couple of minutes into this game, really made me want to play it. It had a brilliant storyline, the cutscenes were captivating and seemed like an interesting concept, though getting into the main menu and finding out that ALT+TAB and the Steam Overlay don't work made me instantly feel it was user unfriendly. The tutorial also was very lacking and bugged quite a bit.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:☆Good storyline.\n☆Good voice acting.\n☆Good music.\n☆Sound effects are good.\n\nNegatives:☆Animations off point with sound/voice acting.\n☆Mouse felt laggy and quite buggy.\n☆Tutorial was glitched, unable to click the dynasty symbol.\n☆Steam Overlay was disabled.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSummary:Overall, this game felt like an unfinished and buggy mess with a decent concept. This, to me, would be for nostalgia reasons or unless you are able to play through the bugs and glitches that the game has to offer. This was a great concept, which will be interesting in the upcoming Guild 3, though for now a buggy mess.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════Find this review helpful?
