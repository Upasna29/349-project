After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour.\n\nSure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet.\n\nYeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!","June 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","53","56","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/recommended/263980/","ferencmato","Pickles Giggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/","275 products in account","Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.\n\nWhat is it about?\nOut there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.\nYou take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…\n\nGameplay\nAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire "teleshots" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.\nLater in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...\n\n\nSidenotes\nPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.\nEven though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too.\nNot to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.\nLike I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.","April 22, 2015","true","3.6"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/263980/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2361 products in account","Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.\n\nThere is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything.\n\nThe main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.\n\nOut There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.","December 10, 2014","true","4.5"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","41","47","2","0"

And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute.\n\nThe game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.\n\nIt's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich.

It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.\n\n\nLevel Design - 9/10:\nLevel Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.\n\n\nAudio - 7/10:\nThe music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...\n\n\nGraphics - 7/10:\nThe graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.\n\n\n\nOverall - 8.0/10:\nA bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though...

It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.\n\nThat arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.\n\nOut There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.\n\nOne could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNqcZZ-li-k&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 11, 2015","true","1.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.\n\nThe game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.\n\nYou accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?\n\nGraphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over.\n\nMusic is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!\n\nGameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.\n\nAs an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.\n\nPuzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of "Oh! Now I see it".\n\nOverall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!\n\nFinal Mark: 7.5/10","April 24, 2015","true","3.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.\n\nIt doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.","April 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit "new game" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The "portal gun", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating.\nOut There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes.\nSo what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10","March 19","true","3.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.","August 31, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.\n\nMy only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be.

I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.\n\nStoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.\n\nGraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?\n\nMusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.\n\nGameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.\nThe shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.\n\nContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything.\nHonestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!\nTo compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands.

Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).\n\nThis is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.\n\nWhile aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.","April 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 51 of 96 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","51","96","0","0"

The art grabbed my attention, as did the very positive reviews, so I checked it out. Here's what I think:\n\nPROS\n--------------------------------------------\n- Excellent gameplay (it's so cool that people are *still* finding new things to do with platformers. I love it! ^_^ )\n- Tight controls. I never felt overwhelmed, and that's a good thing.\n- Great art! (though I'm not sure why the backgrounds were moving underground - maybe to keep things visually interesting >_< )\n- The tone, feel and setting are all really good.\n- The pacing is just incredible. I started playing it saying, 'I'll just play it for a little while', and the game moves at such a pace that I found myself playing for far longer than I thought. I beat the game in two sittings! I love games that can grab your attention and keep it like that.\n- The characters and puzzles kept me glued to my chair. I tell ya - there's something great about this game. Once you start - you don't want to put the game down!\n- Frequent checkpoints that enforce the fact that you're always making progress.\n- I also really like the fact that the last boss, while challenging is not SUPER-HARD-OH-MY-GOSH-YOU'LL NEVER-BEAT-THIS that so many platformers end with. While challenging, the game is more fun than hard - and I like that a lot.\n\n\nCONS\n----------------------------------------\n- The music, while good, never really connected with me. I still listen to the 'Shovel Knight' and 'Super Mario 3D World' soundtracks, for example. But here, nothing really jumped out. The music is not bad - it just didn't stand out to me.\n- While the controls felt fair, there were a few parts that I thought the difficulty curve was a bit steep. Reflecting back on it, I think it's because the devs wanted to put in as many different puzzles in as small a time frame as possible. I never got stuck or had to look solutions up online (which is great!), but smoothly transitioning from one puzzle to another sometimes felt a little weird. Maybe that's a nitpick. Just thought I'd mention it.\n- At a little over two hours, the game is *short*. What it lacks in length, it more than make up for in variety and fun, though.\n\nOVERALL\n----------------------------------------\nI was really pleasantly surprised with 'Out There Somewhere'. The pacing was excellent, the art was really fun and quirky and the platforming action kept me coming back for more (and kept showing me things I'd never seen before - so I loved that). I loved the fact that I went into this 'blind', so everything it showed me was a surprise. Love it! I had a great time and I look forward to seeing what else the devs have made. Bring on more great games! :)\n\nFINAL SCORE\n---------------------------------------\n8.5 out of 10","September 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways.

An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice.

You get ship wrecked and you find things so you can fly your ship again.\nThe difference that this platformer brings to the table is that the main character uses a portal like gun, when the bullet hits certain surfaces you get teleported to that location. This added in some puzzles to the platforming and made it more unique.\n\n+Retro art if you are into it\n+Nice mechanics\n+Easy to pick up and play\n+Why walk when you can shoot a wall\n\n-Music gets repetitive\n-Dialog is not even worth mentioning\n-no replay value(at least I do not feel like its worth doing speed runs)\n\nAll in all the price for this game is probably not worth it since you can get more fun games or more "value" games that take longer to beat.

Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption.\n\nWhen I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths.\n\nOnly negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!\n\nShout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nKun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän.\n\nKun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan.\n\nAinoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa!\n\nMyös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases","June 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was asked to spread the joy of this game if I personally enjoyed the game. So that's where you, the reader, comes in....\n\nA very small, yet very awesome game! I'm sad this game is quite short (1 hour to complete it), but there are, of course, secrets, puzzles and secret puzzles on your way. There is also a small batch of achievements waiting for you to unlock. So you might be sticking longer on this game when you want to go 100%.\n\nThe greatest thing I like of this game is the gameplay which reminds me of:\n- VVVVVV\n- Portal\n- Risk of Rain\n\nIt's so lovely to wander through the game. Everything feels so smooth and fitting, even the OST. Favorite thing of this game: Player walking animation.\nAs said, the game is short and the mechanics are simple, but for 1 euro you should definitely buy this game!\n\nRating: 8/10","February 3","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!\n\nTeleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.\n\nNormal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.\n\nThis is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)\nI love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)\n★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nGraphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!\n★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nStory: The Story is also well made. "Brevity is the soul of wit!" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.\n\nI really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nLeveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!\nThere are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)\nThe normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑\nI don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nMusic: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks. I nearly love all of them and for a good reason. If you wanna take a look at the main Theme:  Menu Theme\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nThe summary is, I would buy it again and the most time it is in sale for less than 30c. xD Get it.

Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.\n\nThe controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.\n\nAs far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.\n\nAesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.\n\nFinally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.\n\nOverall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.","April 22, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.\n\nThe various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.\n\nI may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.\n\n(some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).\n\nAs it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.","April 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's unfortunately rather short, which is about the only bad thing I could say about it. The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting. The final boss is a bit weak/simplistic, I suppose, but the level design is great throughout to make up for it. Considering that it's currently $.19 USD on steam right now, there's no real excuse not to pick this one up and give it a shot.","April 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/263980/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.\n\nThe story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow.\nThe gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works.\nThe absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.\n\nThe game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game.\nIf you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee.","April 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it also includes elements of a metroidvania (you collect 1 power-up to enable access to more of the zones, as well as a few health/ship powerups), I would prefer to compare the game to VVVVVV, Cave Story, and Portal 2.\n\nThe sounds and graphics are throwbacks to Nintendo/Super Nintendo era, which is more than adequate for a 2d "pixel-perfect" platformer. As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable. This game is about puzzle-platforming.\n\nPlay control is super-tight. Any errors made are completely your fault.\n\nThe biggest drawback to the game is its length. It is extremely short (a speedrun of the game should take you between 12-20 minutes). This isn't necessarily a negative--there are only so many ways to do the same kind of puzzle before it becomes tedious, and the game avoids that by not padding the game out.","April 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a short game, my first playthrough was just over an hour. Some people might complain about that, but I thought it was perfect. With all the games in my backlog, I prefer a lean game that plays well, and isn't full of fluff.\n\nThe game has a very straightforward premise, you crash land on a planet and need to find parts to repair your ship. You start off with a gun that shoots portals that you teleport to when they hit a surface. Every screen has some sort of puzzle requiring timing and finesse to progress. You eventually get a pea shooter, but it's mainly for breaking rocks and getting the odd enemy out of your way.\n\nThere are a fair amount of achievements that require a second playthrough, but it's pretty much a breeze, because once you're familiar with the mechanics of the game, you can plow right through it.","June 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEM\n\nYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content. However, if you seek mouse support in menues or in the game you will have to keep seeking. The English, French, and Portuguese languages are available via a toggle in the options menu. The ingame menu is limited so don't expect to change volume or controls outside of the main menu at the start of the game. This game has a unique menu option to show or hide playtime.

The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^.\n\nStory\n-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.\n\nGrigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?\nMaybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"\n\n\nPros\n+Stage Design.\n+Music suits\nthe game\nperfectly.\n+Good cutscene\nArt.\n+Responsive controls.\n+Fluid sprite animation.\n+More than one way\nto complete the game.\n+Cards are easy to get.\n\nCons-Kinda Short.\n-Some music tracks\nare forgettable.\n-,,But How?"

Decided to try it a bit and I instantly fell in love to the art style and music; it felt so nostalgic, like something from the NES era.\n\nOut There Somewhere is a puzzle platformer game. The puzzle is on how you get to that side of the screen. To do it, you'll need to think, plan, and execute it with perfect timing which most of the time will require several tries to get it right. There are diverse mechanics in the game and it is combined in later areas to make challenging puzzles. What I really like is how the game made you understand the mechanic without long or complex tutorial. The game will just say "If you do X then Y." After that, the game will throw you a simple puzzle that revolve around that one mechanic. Some other time the game won't even tell anything; you just found yourself in a new area with some element you never see before. The area's goal is to make you familiar with a new gameplay mechanic without even telling you it's there. That is what other game needs to copy.\n\nThe game is rather short. I beat the story (not 100%) in under 1 hour (58 minutes to be exact). I was surprised when the credit rolls because I really really really want to play more. Yes, this game is that good. The story itself is really underdeveloped. It's like the developer just need an excuse for player to go to the end game. Yet, that somehow reminds me of most Old School games with lackluster story (The princess is in another castle GFF!F@%@R#&!!!!)\n\nOverall, the game is really enjoyable, easy to learn, but challenging.

It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.\n\n\n\nLevel Design - 9/10:\nLevel Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.\n\n\n\nAudio - 7/10:\nThe music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...\n\n\n\nGraphics - 7/10:\nThe graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.\n\n\n\n\nOverall - 8.0/10:\nA bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!","June 9, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaiyoGamer/recommended/263980/","TaiyoGamer","Taiyo Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaiyoGamer/","371 products in account","Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an "R-Type"-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being "Out There Somewhere".\n\nThe gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them.\n\nYour teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.\n\nThe music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds).\n\nStory is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.\n\nGameplay: 9\nMusic: 8\nStory: N/A\nMechanics/Controls: 9\n\nOverall: 8.75/10\n\nThe game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).","September 1, 2015","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)\n\nIts still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the "all your base are belong to us"esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.\n\nSo: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.","June 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.\n\nThis game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel.\n\nThe game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better.\n\nOverall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.","June 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start off with a gun that shoots portals that you teleport to when they hit a surface. Every screen has some sort of puzzle requiring timing and finesse to progress. You eventually get a pea shooter, but it's mainly for breaking rocks and getting the odd enemy out of your way.\n\nThere are a fair amount of achievements that require a second playthrough, but it's pretty much a breeze, because once you're familiar with the mechanics of the game, you can plow right through it.","June 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initially, you begin with a side-scrolling space-shooter sequence that takes you through an army of rival space ships.  After the initial boss fight (which you are supposed to lose), you begin exploring a planet armed initially with only a portal gun.  You'll find an actual weapon later on to fight enemies with and to help with solving puzzles.\n\nThe game is basically an action-platformer in the vein of games like Metroid with its exploration for various items, including extenders to your life meter and components which can power-up your repaired ship at the end of the game.  There aren't a whole lot of mechanics to the game, which is fitting for its short length.  This also makes the game easy to pick up and play.  There is a good challenge to the later sections, but there is nothing that truly feels overwhelming or unfair, which is a testament to the overall game design.  The price is fair as there is replayability to earn achievements.  For such a short title, there is a fairly large number to attain, and I can see people earning all of them with lots of practice.\n\nI can find very little to criticize about this game.  You do have to be careful of scene switches because you can walk and/or jump into a hazard without fully realizing it, similar to Castle in the Darkness, though not nearly as unfair as in the latter title.  Also, in some of the vertical sections, I had to stop and search for my character, who was just about as far down the screen as possible, usually in a corner!  A brief, flashing arrow pointing to your character would help here, but this is not a big criticism.  It's possible to solve every room on the first try if you're observant and careful; I can even see a few people maybe having a deathless run on the first playthrough.\n\nOut There Somewhere has just the right length for casual gamers while being robust enough for those looking for a challenge, especially those seeking to 100% the game through both winning and through completing the achievements.  I highly recommend this game.  It is both well-crafted and extremely well balanced.  Buy it!\n\n9.0 / 10","October 28, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.\n\nMost of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the "end" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.\n\nOut There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts. The game's atmosphere and (retro) music are just too adorable for that.\n\nThe game can be completed in ~2 hours. And while it may not be a game that will keep you coming back for more, unless you're an achievement junkie, you can rest assured that it will provide you with few hours of pure, retro platforming fun!","December 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's short and sweet for a quick playthrough, but very enjoyable.

There's minimal combat, aside from some shooty bits. I beat it in a little over an hour on my first playthrough. There are achievements to unlock that can extend your time with the game, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nIt's pretty simple, but that's a lot of its charm.

Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap.\n\nBut rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the "upgrades" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles.\n\nInstead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect.\n\nMost of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.\n\nThis is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project.\n\nThese aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value.\n\nAt $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.","August 10, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.\n\nThis game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel.\n\nThe game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better.\n\nOverall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.","June 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.\n\n\n\nLevel Design - 9/10:\nLevel Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.\n\n\n\nAudio - 7/10:\nThe music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...\n\n\n\nGraphics - 7/10:\nThe graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.\n\n\n\n\nOverall - 8.0/10:\nA bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!","June 9, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game gets a lot longer once you try to get 100% on the achievements. I got the full 100% now in about 9 hours and trust me that's not an amazing achievement, it is just that short. And the time added to the game is mostly just artificially added to the game. Not actual gameplay, just a lot of things you have to do a certain way that a lot of time to the game.

They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEM\n\nYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content. However, if you seek mouse support in menues or in the game you will have to keep seeking. The English, French, and Portuguese languages are available via a toggle in the options menu. The ingame menu is limited so don't expect to change volume or controls outside of the main menu at the start of the game. This game has a unique menu option to show or hide playtime.

First the price to gameplay ratio is amazing. I have eight hours in this game, thats 10p an hour, and then there's the gameplay. The puzzles vary in hardness, but a lot of this requires high reaction time. Thus being said, I feel that the rage adds to the gameplay, but not in the way that puts you off the game and you leave to take up space space in your steam library for the rest of your life. I feel as if this game is extremely underrated and I would buy it for ten times the price. 10/10","February 4","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me about an hour and a half to play through on the first go. However, the smart achievements and great gameplay had me coming back for more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 2D side scrolling game. I was able to grab it on sale but if I had known how good the game was, I would have bought it at full price. Well worth it. Oh, and there are some great 8 bit scores that go perfectly with the tone of the game (lol see what I did there).

Another pixel art puzzle platformer. But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks.

At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not.\n\nThe game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be.\n\nThere is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite "feels" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay.\n\nWhen you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.\n\nThe game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end.\n\nOverall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.","September 5, 2015","false","2.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Yea it sure is but I guess I can't really complain about a game priced as cheap as this one but they should of never of compaired this game to Metroid... ever... again... period. My passion for that game runs deep and this game has about as much in common with Super Metroid as I'd say checkers to chess. Metroid you powered up and got equipment that opened up levels you couldn't get to and this game you get a teleport gun and... oh? Just the teleport gun? Oh well, they got me on the discription. Didn't get too far into the game either. Got stuck on a part that's there no visible solution to. After banging my head against a brick wall for twenty minutes I figured I must be too stupid to figure it out (more likely too smart to figure it out.) I hoped I'd get far enough to get the ship running and gunning and maybe I'd like that part of the game better and that's the only reason I tried as long as I did. I thought the eight bit style graphics would work in favor to this game but they went a little too simple and the sound to this game.

It teases with the start being a classic arcade space scroller, but instantly turns into a puzzle platformer. Non of that is bad, it just threw me right from the start and made me crave a style of game that I wasn’t going to receive for a long time. The sorry excuse for puzzles and the interesting weapon/ game mechanics are the only thing that almost save this game, but in the end the tediousness of the controls and gameplay force it into the bad game category.\n\nIt is an interesting concept, but one that was poorly executed.

Yea it sure is but I guess I can't really complain about a game priced as cheap as this one but they should of never of compaired this game to Metroid... ever... again... period. My passion for that game runs deep and this game has about as much in common with Super Metroid as I'd say checkers to chess. Metroid you powered up and got equipment that opened up levels you couldn't get to and this game you get a teleport gun and... oh? Just the teleport gun? Oh well, they got me on the discription. Didn't get too far into the game either. Got stuck on a part that's there no visible solution to. After banging my head against a brick wall for twenty minutes I figured I must be too stupid to figure it out (more likely too smart to figure it out.) I hoped I'd get far enough to get the ship running and gunning and maybe I'd like that part of the game better and that's the only reason I tried as long as I did. I thought the eight bit style graphics would work in favor to this game but they went a little too simple and the sound to this game. I can't even remember it right now, that's how uninpressed I was.\n\nCan I recommend this game?

Claiming to have need for precise jumps. Which might depend on your skill level, but the platforms are usually so close together and large so it's hard to miss a jump that was your fault and not the cause of a misplaced teleport or enemy knockback.\nThis game was rather short and easy. I think the reason why it was easy was because it only revolves around one ability, and level design revolving around three types of beams to mess with your device's shots in some way. Now you may argue games like Portal only gave one ability, how ever in that game you could pick up objects, and the level design varied greatly, showing just how many ways portals could be used. This game's levels don't.\nSometimes you need to use teleports to get over large gaps quickly (which is just used to give you cheap thrills; it's real easy to get throught those types of levles.) Sometimes you need to jump after right before you teleport to keep momentum, which isn't hard. Later in the game you do those multiple times over and over in one puzzle (again, cheap thrills).\nSometimes you-\nOh wait.\nThat's it.\nOh but wait, sometimes they put enemies in the level.\nI guess that makes it "harder." Except it doesn't because you get a gun near the start of the game. It's easy to get rid of them, too. Just repeatedly shoot them and jump out of there way and shoot some more! It's such a grind, too, either your gun sucks, or the enemies have too much health. Either way, it's boring.\nThe beams used to "spice up" the gameplay look out of place, especially in the underground segments. Why were they there? What are their purpouse? Is this game even worth 0.99?\nAnd while I know none of those questions will be answered, at least the game had music...\nThat got annoying after the third time they repeated.\nEvery screen besides the beginning and end have a title, it's either a joke, or a boring title. I stopped caring about them after the 7th screen of the game.\nNext I'll talk about are the ship piloting segments.\nThey suck.\nThe starting one was unecessary, all you had to do was say "Commander! The ship's main power is overheating! I'm gonna crash!" Instead we get a rip off of Parodius.\nThe ending didn't have to involve ships. The ending battle should've just had involved teleporting! And the beams! Y'know, the ability that the WHOLE GAME focused about!\nThen only thing that made me chuckle was that at the end they make the final line confirm that there could be a sequal.\n\nGood luck with that, guys.","September 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation.\n\nWould reccomend it at the normal price.

I would say that this game has its moments, but really, the game does nothing much to make itself have moments of impact.\n\nIt's a metroidvania game that lacks bosses, powerups, or smart puzzles that offer diversity over difficulty. You'll get tired of it unless you enjoy games like the Witness for its puzzles alone. There's no climax other than getting minor upgrades or entering your ship for the final boss. There's no control of pacing aside from locking off features to your character. A new game+ mode would've really helped, where it lets you explore the game world past the final boss considering how the map makes a complete circuit but the game decides to be far too linear, and for that I think it fails.\n\nIt's a short combination of megaman and portal without the gripping soundtrack, hardcore gameplay, or unique narrative. If you're a sucker for gameplay that doesn't dip in quality, then sure, pick this game up for the dollar (or 25 cents) it's worth. You get it's full worth for what you pay. It's a short, but mildly sweet experience. It's got cute character designs, neat gameplay designs, but when it comes to anything more than puzzle solving and waiting for monster cycles, it falls short. On the plus side, it's short, and easy to speedrun with the in-game timer mechanic.\n\nAs far as minimally priced games go, this is one of the better ones, but you could always save up your money for a fantastic 10 dollar game over the short-lived "experience" of this one.","March 14","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Drawing clear inspiration from Pixel's work (Cave Story and its successors), Out There Somewhere manages to dish out the right amount of nostalgia, while being unique enough to earn its own place in Indie game history.\nThe first playthrough will take about one hour, but with so many hidden secrets and alternate ways to complete the puzzles, I can almost guarantee you'll start a new game at least two more times.\nTruth be told, I've written and deleted at least three paragraphs trying to describe this game, and I still can't do it.

Really?! I'm glad I didn't spend a whole lot on this one.\n\nTo the designer's credit, the game was incredibly fun, despite being incredibly short and linear. The teleportation and platforming puzzles were excellent. The retro cut scenes were hilarious. However, I was hoping that when they said "inspired by Metroid" they'd actually have some Metroid-esque RPG elements. No such luck I'm afraid.\n\n\nIf you can get this title for less than a dollar, I'd say go for it. At least you get steam cards and an hour of fun.

EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.\n-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.\n-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.\n-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations\n-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them\n-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.\n-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.\n-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.\n\nConclusion:\nNot really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less.","May 11","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

My experience is it's not possible to actually play it. I emailed the developers a couple months ago asking for help but haven't heard a thing from them.\n\nThe problem is that the controls don't work using gamepad or keyboard & mouse. Once the start screen has loaded up, it's like there is a stuck key for pressing left and also up and down are reversed. So after eventually getting the game to load, your character immediately goes left and thats it ! the level is supposed to progress to the right so that screws that up, 2-3 seconds of seeing a sprite move to the left of a level isn't a good game in my books.\n\nI have googled the problem and searched forums but found nothing to help. So I'd avoid this game as it will be a gamble paying anything for it.","May 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.\nAnother issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.\n\nOut There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere.","March 16","false","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I have to say though, the game would be greatly improved if the story line was much longer, if you could get more health, maybe get armor, get different guns with different damages/attack rates/ explosion radius/etc., and definately a wider variety of enemies. Also an MMO mode would be cool, with pvp worlds that have upgrades around the course. It would also be cool if you could create your own maps. Setting blocks and enemies down how you want to make a world that you like, then having the option to share it publicly, just with your friends, or keep it private. If this game had the added things I just listed, it would easily be one of my top favorite games. Before then though, I have to say it's too short and limited to be worth the $5 it costs.","May 1, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:\n\nPros:\nSilly fun and cool acheivements\nOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoying\nClever easter eggs and references\nFun "2D Portal" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done well\n\nSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:\n\nCons:\nThe plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of "You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. "We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!"\n\nThis ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?\n\nOh yes.\n\nSimon ♥♥♥♥ING says.\n\nGrigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.\n\nThen Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....\n\nSIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.\n\nYes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...\n\nMaybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...\n\nNo, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\n3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall.","April 24, 2015","false","2.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","0"

When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price.","April 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

There's only 2 small part with space shooting which are quite boring (no ship upgrades, etc...).\n\nThis is more like a demo than a full game.

Best deal ever!\nThis game is like metriod meets a portal gun. Except a little diffrent. When you shoot your gun when the "teleshot" as the game calls it, hits a wall, you instantley teleport there. Sounds simple, huh? Well just like portal, it gets crazy. Your teleshot preserves movement, so if you fire and then jump at the last second, you will jump at that other place you just teleported to. This can be used to jump, fire, then as soon as you hit the ground jump again to do basically a double jump. Theres also a bunch more mechanics as well, such as 3 diffrent beams, enemies, glass and wood, mirrors, and a bunch of other stuff. Also the achievments are pretty challanging (all but one) to get and can add hours of gameplay if you're into that.\n\nOverall, great mechanic, great soundtrack, love the metriod style, and challanging achievments.\n9/10.\n\nEdit: theres a HUGE difficulty spike at the final boss, one misclick and you're screwed.

I have now played the game completely though with a play time of 1:20 or so. In reality, if you all up all of the times I died, it's more like 1:45. Even though it is short, it's a great game. The game has a sort of quality to it that is hard to put your finger on. Though it's a good bit different from Cave Story, it does remind me of it. While, this game has a certain metroid element to it, there is very little backtracking. However, I've already seen secrets near the beginning that one would have to return to in order to obtain the items. The game get's hard at times, but never too hard. Even after beating the game, I could easily pick it up and play it though again, which is one of the few games I could say that about. This game is really all about the gameplay, but the game makers took the time to give it a little story. There are minor characters that talk to you, as well as a brief opening with artwork and brief ending with artwork.\n\n+++ PROS +++\n+ Nice clean, old school graphics.\n+ Great, catchy retro music\n+ Completely clean in content (no blood, cursing, inappropriate content)\n+ Low Price\n+ Frequent auto-save feature\n+ Multiple Save slots\n\n- - - CONS - - -\n- Short (runs about 1 1/2 to 2 hours)\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this game.

Still, executed greatly.\n\nReplay value: 4\nThere is no big reasons to keep going much further if not to get the 100% (for completionists).

Best deal ever!\nThis game is like metriod meets a portal gun. Except a little diffrent. When you shoot your gun when the "teleshot" as the game calls it, hits a wall, you instantley teleport there. Sounds simple, huh? Well just like portal, it gets crazy. Your teleshot preserves movement, so if you fire and then jump at the last second, you will jump at that other place you just teleported to. This can be used to jump, fire, then as soon as you hit the ground jump again to do basically a double jump. Theres also a bunch more mechanics as well, such as 3 diffrent beams, enemies, glass and wood, mirrors, and a bunch of other stuff. Also the achievments are pretty challanging (all but one) to get and can add hours of gameplay if you're into that.\n\nOverall, great mechanic, great soundtrack, love the metriod style, and challanging achievments.\n9/10.\n\nEdit: theres a HUGE difficulty spike at the final boss, one misclick and you're screwed.
