And why is the flashlight(lighter) bound to the button L? Why not T or Q or something closer to the rest of the buttons.\nHorrible, absolutelly horrible performance. I have a pretty damn strong PC and I was lagging all over and my FPS was in the ground, I had to turn everything to the worst setting to be able to play without ripping my hair out.\n\nThe game tries to be scary, it tries to be some sort of horror but fails.\nThe only scary thing if you really want it to be scary is the vocie of a woman talking, and her voice is extremely low, if you want to be able to make out any words then you'll have to turn your windows volume WAY up which will make you deaf as there is no in-game volume sliders, so all other sounds will probably blast your eardrums out.\n\nThis game is simply unfinished. I don't.. I can't phatom why this was released as a finished product when it's clearly not. Why not just wait until it's finished or at least put it in early access.\nI'm really sad that this game got released so early, I bet if this game was released when it was actually finished, you know, when the game is playable performance-wise, when you've finished the options menu, it would've been so much better but now you've tainted everyone with a bad experience to this game.\n\nI can only assume that most of the positive reviews where for a CD-Key to the game or something. No one in their right mind would rate this game good.\n\nAnd by the way I'm pretty sure that the developers or something are going around disliking all negative reviews because as far as I can see most negative reviews instantly get like 2 or 3 dislikes.\n\nEdit: And yea, I almost instantly got 2 downvotes, cool.","April 9","false","3.4"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

They seem to care about making the game polished.\n\nThis would be ok if it was free , and was optimized. I assume it is either some kind of effect, or badly optimized physics asset (in Unity), but the game stutters a lot, and makes it nearly unplayable (On a decent system).  (Game runs OK now. Not great... but it's playable). There are still a lot of issues, and honestly, and I only realize that now that I can play it with better performance.\n\nThe game itself starts off like a horror, but itsn't at all. It has a scary voice, and background noises, so you think something will jump out.\n\nIt should also warn you that there is no save.\n\nHonestly, this feels like someone took a few Unity assets and mashed them together in a way that looks beautiful,  but doesn't at all mesh well but meshes together only ok. Absolutely NOT ready for free or pay. I'll recommend this once the performance is better.. ****At least put this game in early access / alpha. This is ridiculous***\n\nSome more issues:\n-Turning on the lights is a bit of a chore. When you point at a light, the dialog should come up... but sometimes you have to fish for it.\n-Turning items around in 3D when picking them up is not clear... should be instructions.\n-I got stuck in the bedroom, inside the walking closet. The chair fell back and trapped me in, and there's no jump option. So I closed out immediately.\n-Would be nice if there was a symbol that popped up over an item so you know you're centered on it... like Dreamfall Chapters, or Life is Strange.\n- At the beginning it says press "E" to look, but that doesn't do anything, and seems like the character looks before you do that\n\nIt just isn't polished yet.","March 9","false","0.7"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","28","39","0","13"

It boots, asks "Rus or Eng?" when I click Eng the screen goes black.  I can hear music, but the screen remains black.  I have tried revalidating the files and uninstalling it multiple times, but the problem persists.\n-The one time I was able to play, it stuttered like mad, even with no antialiasing, lowest graphics settings, etc, even though I have a GTX 960, a newer Intel Core I-5 and 8 GB of ram\n-The game claims that you can "Interact" with everything in the house.  While "Interacting" in this case just means picking things up(And not being able to move while doing so) and then putting them back down in the same place.  This doesn't really accomplish anything.\n-The lighter that you use illumnates almost nothing, making it difficult to navigate dark places, which is a lot of the map.\n-The grammar is awful.  I know this is not a gameplay critique, but the only elements of story are found on notes throughout the house.  It makes it difficult to understand the story when it seems like somebody just copied a note in Russian, pasted it into google translate, and used whatever came out without checking if it even made sense.\n-Taking a look at the achievements and seeing that  0.9% of people have any of them, basically means that none of them work.  (The only people who have them are people that hack steam achievements)\n\n(My Opinion)\n-Overall, Not very motivated to continue playing the game/not sure what to do/not sure if there is even an ending","April 28","false","4.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I got 70-100fps in BF4 on ultra and 25-40 here. Physics are broken and it is hard to use objects/doors and also dark as hell. You have a lighter but it lights up only ground under your feet and objects 1-2 steps in front of you which doesn't help much.\nBut I must admit graphics in home are very good and textures looks pretty high res, good work here. This time you really get what you see on screenshots, no fake here. But game needs a lot of optimisation and normal lighter/flashlight or at least Brightness options (which is obvious btw) for outdoor exploring.","March 30","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

In my very brief playtime, the game repeatedly crashed at start-up.  In the two occasions I actually got into the game, once my mouse locked up in the settings menu unable to alter anything until the game crashed completely.  The other time I went straight into the game, getting about 1-2 FPS.  I believed my system was capable of handling this game with a GeForce GTX 970 and 16GB RAM, but alas, it was not to be.  I got a refund and that was that.\n\nNonetheless, I kept thinking about the game, wishing I could have experienced it, and then I saw it again, on sale for £0.36, at that price I could hardly say no, it was worth seeing if it had been fixed.\n\nThe technical problems I suffered are all gone, I’m happy to confirm I’m now running the game smoothly with all the settings maxed out, I knew my set-up could handle it.  This is the sort of game made for me, I love the writings of Edgar Allan Poe, I love games like Gone Home which give me a place to fully explore at my will.  But perhaps this game works better in the native Russian language.  It is clear the developers are trying hard, but the English translation is so bizarre I just can’t quite work out what the writing is trying to convey half the time. The quality of the writing is the key factor of a game such as this, when that doesn’t work, you’re just left to explore without any real sense of purpose or immersion.\n\nThe developers have an interesting sense of humour, I’m sure there is a joke I’m missing about the fork next to the toilet.  I don’t understand it, but it’s still funny on a simple visual level.  Also the physics on the chest of drawers are pretty special, just pick them up and move them around like they’re in zero gravity, it’s quite novel in what is supposed to be a dark and moody game.\n\nThe big issue for me though, is that the game entirely lacks an Invert Mouse option, which is simply unacceptable.  This can easily be patched in, but for a game claiming to be a release build and not an Early Access preview, this is inexcusable, especially as it has been out for some time now and has still not being implemented.  When basic essentials are missing from a game, you have to seriously question what is going on at the development end.  I'll happily edit this once (or if?) this essential feature is patched in.  But two months after the alleged release build was made available on Steam, I don't have high hopes.\n\nFrom an objective perspective, this game is not good and I cannot possibly recommend it.  But from a subjective personal perspective, I find it all quite entertaining.  If you want something competent, maybe look elsewhere.  If you’re happy to take a chance on a game that will utterly confuse and amaze you with unintended craziness, you could do a lot worse.  I'm going to go back in now and see what else I can do.\n","April 28","false","1.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"
