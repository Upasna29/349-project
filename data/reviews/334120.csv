I was a big fan of The Neverhood and Skullmonkeys. I was hyped when Tennapel said about the movie, then I heard about Neverhood sequel and I was hyped even more. Even helped to kickstart the game. But today, when I finally managed to play it i was...dissapointed.\nThe story is just dull, the world isnt shown at all, unlike in the neverhood. You see some rooms, some creatures pop sometimes, but it just feels forced and like the creators were just putting stuff into the game so it would not feel empty. The main antagonist is dull, his story, motives and transformation are not explained. Cant even dare to compare him to Klogg.\nAlso, given the time and money, it should be longer. Feels like I just finished the episode 1 of the 6 part series, like Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead.\nI really expected something greater and better storywise. In previous games I loved the world, its humour and sadism. There is almost none. If I wasnt The Neverhood fan, I would have never bought or played Armikrog.","September 30, 2015","false","6.0"," 188 of 224 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","188","224","7","8"

I didn't back this on Kickstarter because I didn't have the money at that time, otherwise I would have, just because I'm a big fan of Doug TenNapel works, like the Earthworm Jim franchise and The Neverhood. I did however pre-buy the digital copy via Steam 2 or maybe 3 months before release. I remember seeing the game pushed back over and over and thinking "Oh, this is getting so much work done, it's going to be amazing!". These are a few of my first thoughts while playing the game (I'll try not to spoil anything):\n\n- The game starts with a cinematic with it's own soundtrack piece, telling us a little introduction to the story, keeping it brief and entertaining. Next, the first clay motion pictures start rolling. We see the main character and his sidekick, great animation, the voice acting is amazing, some jokes here and there, even the non-clay materials from the ship and wandering monsters look awesome. Great start! ...and sadly it all goes downhill from here.\n\n- You are presented with the first room where you can actually interact with stuff. The first thing that caught my eye was the cursor, Windows default cursor. I mean, really? I know a fair amount of designing and programming, and I can tell you, making a custom cursor for a POINT AND CLICK GAME is a must and easy as f***! Do a friggin clay arrow and throw it in there! But at that time I was still hyped and didn't care.\n\n- You can actually look out the window, which triggers a series of events going on outside that don't affect you at all, but are quite interesting and funny. You get to see multiple cutscenes of the outside situation. And that's it! Never again in the whole game you encounter such thing again. Come on! A point and click game feeds on these kind of "events" throughout the entire game!\n\n- Moving on, you go through the next couple rooms, encounter some characters and your first couple puzzles. Now, I haven't played many games like this, but my first reaction when you pick up the first lever was "Ok lets open the inventory and see what I just grabbed". Hit I(nventory), clicked Tommy's body, hit Esc (more on that later)... nothing. Huh... You go up to the door and it's closed, so you click on the thingy next to it and he pulls out the lever and does all the action automatically. Would've been more exciting to at least do the thinking of "What do I use here?" right?\n\n- Esc brings up the Menu, if you wanna call it that. You got the Resume and Quit button, of course, and Options. Go into Options to find some resolutions, subtitles and... Save?? WTH? Since when is Save inside the options of a game? I don't wanna sound like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing about everything here, but in my opinion these things make the game look unfinished and unprofessional.\n\n- Next, lets talk about the puzzles. I've read people saying the game is super hard and that the puzzles are near impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. I don't think they are that bad. Personally I like getting handed a puzzle and figuring it out on my own. But here's the next thing that went wrong: the interactivity is terrible. You are not sure what is an object and what is just clutter. I am not saying "Make it obvious", but at least the objects could get highlighted when you hover above them. 15 minutes into the game, I was already stuck. I clicked everything, went back and forth, there was a point I even thought I had glitched something out. Apparently, when you control Beaky, he is blind or whatever, so he sees things differently. Once you go through a tunnel you come out on one of the previous rooms, where I had clicked everything a thousand times. Here you are supposed to "speak" to an octopus-like creature that is hanging from the ceiling and serves as the elevator. Tell me, how the hell are you supposed to know that, having clicked on it countless times as Tommy and Beaky, but only going back through the hole and doing it, works!?? AARGGHH!!! I don't think that is a hard puzzle, I think that is poor design.\n\n- Last, but not least, game length. Finishing the game takes you from 2 to 4 hours, unless you get super stuck and decided to invest a whole afternoon just trying to get through the game without help. I even figured it out while I was halfway through it, since you are collecting some items and you already have half of them. This is the thing that hurt me the most. So much waiting for a couple lousy hours of entertainment. Even if they didn't add more content to the main story, they could've added more random stuff like the window event from the first room I mentioned earlier. And with these, you can add a lot more stuff. Doing certain random stuff unlocks Concept Art pieces, Interviews with the creators, Videos showing the creative process of the whole game which is AMAZING. The worst thing is all this already exists!! I've seen it countless times! And this also gives the game replayability. For f*** sake if I can think of this stuff how didn't they!!!???\n\nAnyway... rant aside, I think the only positive side of this game is the art that makes it come to life (except for some areas where they decided to go with Photoshop, for whatever reason...). Did they dump all the money on the creative process and were left with very poor programming? It makes me wonder how bad it was before they decided to push it back. I'm not mad, I don't think this was done neither on purpose or due to lack of interest, you can clearly see the creators working on the game with passion for what they do, but somewhere between that and the release, something went terribly wrong. Again, I'm not mad. I'm just terribly disappointed :(","October 4, 2015","false","7.3"," 112 of 132 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","112","132","5","2"

Hear me out.\n---------------------------updated review: 08.Oct-15-------------------------------------------------------\nNow that I've had a week to reflect on this game, I'm finally ready to review it. Patch 1.1 and 1.2 is out. fixed alot of my problems.\nSo... This game isn't a Neverhood sequel. It's Not even close to Neverhood but I will judge this game on its own, but I will compare it to it.\nAnd I wont lie, I did buy it in hope of a sequel in the spirit of The Neverhood. Lets do this quick.\nI did finish this game, twice. And I'm Really done with the game.\nNow I'm gona sum up the game:\n\nAnimation:\n-gameplay: 9/10\n-Cutscene: 9/10\n-End Cutscene: 5/10\n\nStory: Its completely fine. It got the humor of Doug Tennaple(who worked on The Neverhood and Earthworm Jim). I think it falls flat in some places.\n\nVoice acting: Great. Huge fan of Rob Paulsen(voice of Pinky, Yakko Warner, 2 of the turtles of TMNT and Spike from Land Before Time)\n\nPuzzles: This is where I'm really sad to say. Alot of it are too easy, some is confusing.\n\nAND THE MUSIC: F**K, S**T, F**K. Im so disapointed, BUT the music in this game fits this game.\nIf anyone Remember The Neverhood, You know the music was memorible, also those small jingles. In this game It was REALLY disapointing.\nTheres a video out of Terry S. Taylor playing a song that was for this game. its called "Boo hoo Hah". Its just like The Neverhood. And Its amazing. I WANT THAT SOUNDTRACK.\n\nFinal thoughts: Short game. Fantastic Animation. Great voice acting. Okey Music. MEhdiocer music, Fine story. NO replay value.\nRecomend waiting for a sale. But by all means buy it and experience it. Its a great game.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay. This is fantastic game as far as I've played. Got a great Claymation and grafics thats good. Steady FPS, no lagg spikes or anything, but the cutscenes seems to be in a different resolution.\n\nBUT the reason I stop right now, is the release build has a couple problems. Menu screenS(both the ingame and menuscreen) text aren't there... Trying to save? Grafic settings? Load? Where to click? well I guess Thats the first puzzle of the game, to find the right one to click. I dont f**king know.\nI've had a couple of crashes too. Currently according to the devs twitter they are working on it and investigating the problems. Give them some time. (Ok. text problem is fixed)\n\nSo as of right now(1hour after the game was released) the game has some problems. As soon as they have fixed these problems I will remove this review, and put up another one. Why? Because I Want to play it so I can get the right experience. I've waited 10years for The Neverhood sequel that we never got(I rediscovered it, play it in 99)(Also Yes I know, Skullmonkeys. It was a platformer so its is as much of a sequel as Nut and Bolts are to the Banjo Kazooie/Tooie.) so Ofc I'm going to give it a posetive review. Just wait a day or two to you see the reviews/devs say that its fixed. If you like Point and/or Clicks, buy it.\n\nI cant give it a negative reivew. Because I want it to be good, it is as far as I've seen. But give them some time to fix up the release bugs. like a couple days.\n\nnow from the information you've gotten: you can decide if you want to buy it.\n\n\n\n\nDo it. Its gona be great as soon as everything is fixed.","September 30, 2015","true","7.3"," 184 of 249 people (74%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","74","184","249","14","10"

A big fan of Dougs work on Earth Worm Jim and calling this the spiritual successor of the Neverhood I couldn't say no to this.\n\nI will get the pros out of the way first. Animation and voice acting is stunning. The visuals pop and you can see that charm we have grown to love.\n\nThe backstory is amazing. If you read the hall of records and learn the tale of Armikrog its an amazing story.\n\nIt made me feel like I was back in the computer shop playing my childhood all over again.\n\nBut as for the negatives. The main characters do feel like they are out of place in a story that is so much grander. Its almost as if they dont connect too well. The back story is well versed but when trying to play the game you feel its overshaddowed by characters that dont belong.\n\nI love the writing dont get me wrong its amazing. But when Klayman was a part of the Neverhood he was a part of the story. Here it just feels like a side note to a grand story.\n\nThe game even though Ive heard is the same length in screens seems way shorter. I beat it in two days over an hour a day. And the ending is clear they want to continue with the story but Im not invested in Tommynaught as a character.\n\nThe puzzles are repeated alot. The Neverhood mixes them up. Having not just button pushing or slide puzzles but puzzles that have a different look and feel to them. Some may operate the same but they physical appearance changes which keeps it fresh. Here it just felt filled in.\n\nSome of the assets seem repeated besides the puzzles. In particular stretching a character to make him seem taller instead of making a new one seemed cheap. Same with mixing cartoon eggs with animated ones. The styles clashed alot.\n\nThe soundtrack was something I was looking forward to the most but the game decided that instead of theming rooms with songs that it would just pick and choose what to play. Id like to think this is a glitch. Because I dont know what the hell they are going to put on the soundtrack. Honestly each rooms music made it. Here it doesnt even function.\n\nThere was a lot less cutscenes. Even quirky ones that made the Neverhood fun to play. The ones that just stick out and dont mean anything but are just plain funny to watch. Even in SkullMonkeys they had that down easy!\n\nAnd last. The glitches are so high! From my save file being erased. Passing through doors I shouldnt. Clicking something that doesnt work only to leave or move slighty to the right and clicking it again until it does. Crashing the game and seeing the hotspots not even mash with the mouse. The Unity engine almost seems like a last thought in making this work.\n\nTo delay the game an extra month makes me wonder what they did. Not in a rude way but Id like to know what went wrong. The bug testing team didnt do a damn thing. And the other night someone from the team said there wasnt too many issues and they were happy with it.\n\nI can accept everything else. If it wasnt for the glitches. A month is enough time to fine tune it. There should be no issue.\nAgain I love the game itself and can ignore the rest if it wasnt for that. But this falls short of The Neverhood and trying to recapture it. And does make you want to come back for more. But the question is....will they make things right if they decide to continue the story?\n\nI hope that my kickstarter gear is amazing as they said because it breaks my heart to say that I feel a bit let down.","October 5, 2015","false","10.0"," 76 of 89 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","76","89","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/recommended/334120/","exofreeze","eXoFreeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/","1243 products in account","I just had a lengthy debate with myself over whether or not I could recommend this game. Ultimately,  I can not.\n\nI grew up in the heart of the adventure game era. I am very forgiving of the pitfalls of most adventure games as long as I feel like I had fun at the end of the day. As a fan of Neverhood, Earthworm Jim, and adventure gaming in general, I was quite excited when this popped up on Kickstarter. I dropped WAY more cash than normal to get art books, signed prints from Doug, and other swag.\n\nI've learned to temper my expectations from kickstarter, I've also learned to not expect these games for several years and even then, not to play them when they are first released. I picked up Armikrog the day after a patch which added context sensitive cursors, and several other minor fixes.\n\nRight off the bat I was thrown into a static menu screen. I immediately missed the lively, animated title screen from Neverhood that set the tone for he rest of the game.  Unfortunately, this static screen was setting the tone for this game as well.\n\nA majority of the game is played across sparse rooms. Some are simply a few walls made of clay with a couple fingernail lines drawn into them. Others have gorgeous set pieces using found objects. But even the gorgeous scenes typically revolved around a single item. In the intro we get a glimpse of this planet, it's wildlife, the slapstick style 'klayman' humor we loved in Neverhood, and a glimpse at the relationship between Tommynaut and Beak Beak. And then the game starts and we might as well throw all that out the window. It becomes painfully obvious that after the intro, the minds who developed Neverhood stepped out and the clay jockeys stepped in.\n\nThe game itself takes place fully inside a fortress. So the organic puzzles that inhabited Neverhood are nowhere to be found. The fortress itself is composes of 3 towers (4 technically, but the final one is *very* limited).\n\nEach tower has the exact same setup. Get the main door open, get the power on, get some more doors open, move to the next tower. Even the puzzle types repeat themselves, almost always relying on "find a symbol somewhere else and type it in here".\n\nOne puzzle in particular has a baby crying until you solve it. The puzzle itself happens to be an audio puzzle. It requires careful listening and patience. After several minutes of having a baby cry over your the sounds of the puzzle and then having to sit there while the tune plays to verify you got the puzzle right.... well, let's just say that it can drive a person nuts.  And like most puzzles in the game, you will get to redo this multiple times.\n\nOn top of the above complaints, and in spite of the repetition, the game is quite short. If it takes you more than a few hours, then it is simply because you are trying to figure out what to do next based on X number of symbols you have and Y number of cryptic devices you can type them into. I never felt particularly smart after solving a puzzle in the game. I actually accidentally solved 2 puzzles just by messing around with the mechanics of them to see how they worked. Only later did I accidentally stumble across the clues that I was supposed to find. Speaking of the "clues", some of them are so obvious they might as well just solve the puzzle for you. Need to find 3 colors? Walk one screen over and push a button. Look, 3 colors! Walk back, type in 3 colors. That's not a specific puzzle in the game, rather it is indicative of the game's puzzles in general.\n\nWhat about the soundtrack? Terry S Taylor was brought on to do this, and that alone should have added a huge bright spot. Yet many of the tracks were short and, hey it's the word of the day, repetitive. I swear some rooms appeared to be on a 15 second audio loop. Where were the full length background songs from Skullmonkeys and Neverhood? Other times there was absolutely no background music at all.  Just silence. I'm not sure if this was a bug or not (sometimes the sound effects simply dropped out as well). But then a few minutes later a seemingly random background tune would suddenly fade in. And by random, I mean random. Right after a scene that should have been quite sad, a funky little upbeat jazz tune kicked on. What? Where did this come from? It doesn't match a single section of the game, let alone this particular moment.\n\nSo after all was said and done, I felt a little empty. I felt a little let down. I felt that if this game wasn't built out of clay, then it really wouldn't have anything going for it at all. And the medium should be a tool that simply enhances the game.... not provide it's defining characteristic across the board. And yet, when I read the games reviews they almost always praise the graphics... and then stop there. I lost count of how many suggested playing the game simply to "see it". At that point, would it not have been better as a non-interactive show or movie? Oh... wait, no, because that would have required a plot.\n\nA plot. Yes, the games plot is pretty paper thin. One room has a novel's worth of text that gives background, however it is key to note here that high level backers were promised the ability to name items and characters in the game. Considering the only items that Tommynaut ever picks up are battery packs and levers, this means that every single named item, character place, and whatever else that came from kickstarter got dumped into this gigantic "history". The history can be skipped 100% as it has nothing to do with the games plot or puzzles. It literally exists simply so they could sell $200 tiers on kickstarter to folks and promise them they could name some item that is mentioned once in a throw away text that hardly anyone will ever read.\n\nA lot of these reviews sum up whether or not to buy the game at full price, or sale price, or whatever. Ultimately, I don't care how much a game is if it's not fun. If you just want to see the graphics, go watch a youtube video of it. The reason to PLAY a game is to PLAY a game. And playing this game simply isn't fun. And it really pains me to say that. I wanted it to be fun. The world needs more creative, smart, funny games like The Neverhood.\n\nAt the end of the day, Armikrog is just another disappointing promise from kickstarter. A reminder that publishers actually play a very important role in the business, whether we like it or not.","November 6, 2015","false","3.5"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","57","64","0","2"

Not only is it riddled with game breaking bugs, but a good chunk of the game is recycled content. Furthermore, it's full of general design problems that I just can't forgive. Ones that The Neverhood didn't have.\n\nIt often falls into the 'Why doesn't anything react to my actions' adventure game pitfall. This is mainly because you're controlling both Tommynaut and Beakbeak. For example, buttons that Tommynaut should realistically be able to press can only be pressed by Beakbeak. The problem stems from the fact that there's no negative feedback on elements like that. Clicking on something you can't use under that context just doesn't get a response, so you can't be sure if an object can be interacted with, or if it's a background object only. This becomes even more apparent when you're making a point and click game in an alien setting where puzzle elements aren't conventional things. This is where a tough brain teaser turns into a test of persistence. In my opinion, you should never have to brute force a puzzle because you don't even know what the components of the puzzle are.\n\nThe menus are unresponsive as hell. Again, an example of the lack of conveyance this game has in general. Turns out the game sometimes doesn't save over files properly. It has an autosave feature, but that's worthless if you load a file that isn't actually the one you wanted, since the game just autosaves immediately. Hitboxes on a lot of clickable things are rather finicky. It seems to improve as the game progresses, but holy moly is the first section a mess of bad hit detection. Basically it's all problems that should've evolved out of the point and click genre by now.\n\nI have to cut it some slack on account of how well it is presented outside of the game design, however. It looks just like I'd want a 1080p Neverhood to look. The setting is interesting. I'm a little bummed that the FMV parts aren't in 1080p too though. The music is great when it actually plays. The audio often doesn't seem to trigger properly, including character dialogue. Terry S Taylor's music in this game is a lot more ambient this time around, which really fits the desolate and spooky kind of setting that the Armikrog fortress has.\n\nBugs and buyer's remorse aside, I'd give this game an average out of ten. To anyone who is a fan of puzzle games and point and click adventures, click away from this one (hur hurr) and save your money. It's most likely not what you're looking for. Now excuse me while I go hang myself.","September 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 75 of 99 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","75","99","7","2"

This unique selling hook was the reason that The Neverhood was able to stand out from the crowd back in the day in an adventure game genre that had slowly devolved into terrible full motion video (FMV) games staring z-grade actors that saw the gaming industry try and compete with Hollywood and fail miserably. It also arrived during the sundown of the golden age of adventure gaming as the genre slowly lost ground to new the kid on the block - the 3D first person shooter. Naturally my interest was piqued upon hearing about Armikrog even though the creator, Doug TenNabel, would go on to utter some distrubing bigotry that left many fans the world over reeling in shock and refusing to support anymore of his work. While I don't agree with the remarks he passed at all, personally - I don't put much stock in the ramblings of a fool on the wrong side of history.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534285674\nHaving now fully completed Armikrog what amazes me the most is that the game feels like it was something made at gunpoint. It's almost as if everyone involved didn't really want to be involved or they either lost interest rather quickly after becoming involved. While the claymation modeled environments are utterly gorgeous to look at, you soon start to realize as time marches on that what the game is missing the most is a heart and rather importantly a soul. It is almost as if the life has been sapped right out of Armikrog leaving nothing behind but a husk of reused puzzles that honestly seem like they required very little thought to put together. I can't imagine kickstarter backers being terribly impressed with what they got for their investment because despite the pedigree and talent behind Armikrog it appears they were referencing the manual Game Development for Dummies.\n\nThe game was even repeatedly delayed, much to the ire of the fans, but based on what is in the final offer it honestly feels like 1/3 of the game got developed while the remainder was abandoned in favor of reuse. Now I know that constructing an entire game out of clay is no small feat and possibly incredibly time consuming (I am not sure I have never tried it) but that does not excuse a collection of puzzles that get reused in four different locations. Once the player has advanced past the first gate Armikrog looses all its appeal as the remaining three are just different flavors of the same set of puzzles. Even if this game had somehow gotten publisher funding back in the late nineties it would have still been a pale imitation of what the genre was offering at the time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534503683\nIt all starts out rather well with a cracker theme tune set to an impressive montage that tells you how our two intrepid heroes Tommynaught and his trusted companion Beak-Beak find themselves in the situation they are in. I was generally enjoying the first hour even though the two leads have absolutely no chemistry and say very little to each other let alone the gamer. There is no feedback at all from either character concerning the game world around you. Armikrog simply just devolves into a click everything in site festival while controlling both characters in the hope one of them will respond to the action or say something. Most of the time they simply just stand silently on the spot gazing off in separate distances leaving the player wondering why on earth they are investing time and effort into a game where the two lead characters are so disinterested in their own adventure.\n\nThe world they populate is also completely devoid of any kind of life outside of the ghosts that once populated the fortress they hole themselves up in after escaping a vicious looking monster with an anthropomorphic tongue at the start of the game. Items picked up during the play are never given any sort of description simply getting stashed inside the stomach of Tommynaught. There isn't even a way to see what items Tommynaught has stored via an inventory. Even by old school standards some of the design decisions made are so archaic that you simply have to wonder what the hell was going through these peoples minds, if anything at all, as they construted this ill-fated labour of love. Music is once again composed by the same composer from The Neverhood and while the soundtrack is incredibly sparse what is on offer is often quite delightful. I just wish more of it would have played since the game is just filled with so many uncomfortable silences. Things do pick up towards the end but by then the game has worn out all of its welcome and most gamers and fans of the original The Neverhood will have ceased caring as the clouds of disappointment hang thickly in the air.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534284738\nSo now the important question is do I recommend Armikrog? At the full of price of $24.99 - HELL NO! If you can pick up the game for less then $10 then I would say - YES. There is some genuine awe and wonder at work in all the modeled clay environments and at that price they may just be worth fighting your way through tedium to discover. It is such a pity that all the goodwill the game generates in its opening and concluding sections is squandered by a middle that looks like it was cobbled together on the fly with little to no passion for genre or the hobby. You have ask yourself why did they even bother and if the truth be told it's because they simply just didn't care or care enough to actually put something worthwhile together because Armikrog is sadly a failure on most accounts. Sad news indeed for fans of The Neverhood.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 13, 2015","true","6.0"," 81 of 111 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","81","111","0","2"

The OST might be nice by itself, though you have to decide for yourself how much you want to pay for 17 songs/51 minutes.\n\nLet me start with the good stuff:\n+ Visual style (Claymation) is nice, though bland animations and static lighting ruin the effect.\n+ Music is great, though it occasionally just stops in between.\n\nNow for the disillusioning rest:\n- This is not a game, it's barely a trailer! My steam library says 4h, though that's because I was cooking something in between! Actual gameplay is more around 1.5h, and that even only due to unskippable videos, forcedly slow waiting-puzzles, no possibility to run and the requirement to re-walk through every location just as you’re about to finish.\n- Gameplay missed every piece of usability learned during the last 10-20 years… There are no indications for what is clickable, what is not, or if you just missed the seemingly random click areas. Obvious interactive elements, which are just not yet active, are simply not clickable without any indication why this might be the case. Things that are interactive have terrible click zones, which sometimes leaves no option as to leave and reenter a room in hopes to make the clicking work again. And occasionally buttons have to be pressed by your companion dog, because they’re 3cm too low for the main character (who can’t be bothered with bending down that much).\n- Even the level design occasionally doesn’t make sense. Complete sections could have been simply skipped or severely shortened without losing any part of gameplay, story or mechanic. On the other hand there is one part with critical information for the finale, which is impossible to revisit as soon as you actually need this information (spoiler-less hint: as soon as you get the “translations”, take a screenshot and learn the spoken sequence by heart!).\n- Finally even the story does not make sense (It doesn’t affect the gameplay at all, but be warned: spoilers ahead): Three brothers are sent out into space to collect a critical energy source for their home planet. The protagonist randomly crashes somewhere, flees into a castle full of convenient riddles, has to safe a baby in between, and suddenly one of the brothers turns up being evil, having caused havoc apparent minutes before the game started, and threatening you for no reason. All of a sudden the “ancient” texts turn into a live commentary, and the whole setup was only to give you the power source you needed anyway after testing your honor? The third brother is only ever mentioned in the end without any other context other than to try and tie in a forced sequel?\n\nI backed this game on Kickstarter, only because I was so interested in the Claymation style. Good thing, the game was already delayed so often, so I already wrote off that money, otherwise I’d be (more) annoyed by this waste of money.\n","October 12, 2015","false","4.9"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","0"

You'll see why.\n\nIn my personal opinion, The Neverhood was a game whose charm arose primarily from the presentation and the unspoken intrigue. You have no idea who or what Klaymen, or for that matter, anything else is, and set out to find the story of the world and yourself by solving a series of often lackluster puzzles. The things that really string you along are the occasional zany claymation sequences, and the infodisks scattered around that contain segments of Willie telling the game's story in snippets. It has a hook that holds it through, and the puzzles, while cumbersome and uninspired, are not usually a major nuisance as long as you have pen and paper handy.\n\nArmikrog dispels half of its intrigue out of the gate by endowing its protagonists with, star talent as they may be, some of the most boring (and poorly recorded) voices I've ever heard, and giving you a synopsis of the backstory in the damn title sequence. You want to know the story? Here it is: you need to find a rare energy source on another planet to help sustain your people, but end up crash-landing during your trip.\n\nThe game assassinates its own intrigue before you even get to play it. I don't have any questions about who these oddballs are, they're just some dumb shmucks on a delivery run. There is a Hall of Records equivalent a short ways into the game detailing the life of an enslaved miner from some point in history that is infinitely more interesting than whatever is going on here!\n\nOnce you do start playing, you'll probably get about 3 screens in before the utter purple monkey dishwasher leaps of logic required to progress start to sink in. Blocking a doorway with a large, fuzzy creature will cause a tentacle elevator to descend from a trapdoor in the ceiling. The thing those tentacles are attached to is actually a key item and massive plot-dump device (speaking in an alien language so as to blue-ball you as much as possible with regards to deciphering what lore is left to uncover), but only if interacted with while playing solo as Beak-Beak. There are no prompts or hints whatsoever towards this. The incidental characters so far have not been a bizarre face sticking out of a TV, a murderous green crablike creature, nor a giant robot with a teddy bear. Instead, they have been Abrahant Lincoln and Thomas Jeffersant. Get it? Like the historical figures, except ants. Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nAnd then I spent a solid hour working on the Planetarium puzzle, which is of the breed of puzzles that you know exactly what to do with from one quick prod at it, but takes an agonizing length of time to actually execute.\n\nIt is also at this point that I feel the need to mention that the game is, despite its delays, bugged out the butt. Clicking hotspots are extremely finicky sometimes, the wall-mounted rider will always get stuck on certain sections until you manage to dislodge it, and clicking on the wrong thing at the wrong time WILL break the game and render progress impossible. Of course, if you don't click on everything in every possible way then you're not going to find out how to progress either!\n\nNeverhood was an interesting story told in a fantastical manner, with a series of dumb puzzles standing in your way as an excuse to call it a game. Armikrog may yet have a fascinating story to begin to unravel, but has been such an abjectly miserable gameplay experience that I can't bring myself to care enough to continue bashing my head against it.\n\nIt's still well animated, at least.","September 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","56","76","8","1"

The promise was amazing: the team that made The Neverhood, including the composer, to make a brand new clay stop motion adventure. But the result is just not up to the hype.\n\nThe main problem is repetitiveness. They happened to make a set of puzzles and managed to reuse them 4 times over.

The developers did a wonderful job in imagining their world, developing lovable characters and flushing out a compelling plot with only a page worth of dialogue. The Neverhood was very short, very easy and more charming than anything else. I would encourage anyone who thinks the Neverhood was SO MUCH superior to Armikrog to go back and re-play it, then see if those comparisons still hold up. I did, and I don't think Armikrog is worse than the Neverhood. For the most part, I think it is as good.\n\nStrengths in both games are largely the same. The dev team pulls together a very charming cast and a quirky environment that is fun to explore, staples of the original concept in the Neverhood. Contemporary games have expanded considerably in content, so it's not surprising to see gripes about the game being too short. Truth be told, I found the puzzles in Armikrog much more difficult than in the Neverhood, so my 1st playthrough clocked in around 12hrs. Add 2hrs if you want to read the new "Hall of Records."\n\nThe game's launch was mired in glitches unfortunately. Running on Windows 10, I only experienced trouble with looping "P" having a tantrum (happened only once) and the music cutting in and out infrequently. No save glitches etc. So I'd hardly call the game broken. Too much of people's impressions are centered on relatively minor issues. This unfortunately is the new trend in game development: publishers push development to release an unfinished game, telling them to fix it with post-release patches, development listens, game sales take a nosedive at release and no one is happy. Big AAA game studios do this too. Since Armikrog's release, the developers have made several patches and the game works fine now. Can't speak for OSX, but why own a mac anyway?\n\nMy final verdict on this game is generally positive and it very much resembles a fantastic game no one played back in the 90s. For nostalgia's sake, anyone who played the Neverhood should play Armikrog. For that matter, if you can't get a copy of the Neverhood, you should play Armikrog. The big issue people seem to have is neither game really fits contemporary expectations for most commercial games. Armikrog could have had a cult following like the Neverhood, but sadly it won't. I wish Douglas TenNapel would do more games. Earthworm Jim, the Neverhood, Skullmonkeys, all amazing games that deserve recognition even today. Especially when you consider how horribly trite and unimaginative contemporary games are. Similarly, Armikrog deserves more recognition than it got. At the very least, you have to appreciate an effort to bring clay modelling back into games, something that we probably haven't seen since BoomBots or ClayFighter.","November 12, 2015","true","12.3"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","40","53","0","0"

It wasn't meant to be, so get that expectation out of your head before playing. The story isn't nearly as thrilling; that beautiful minimalism is gone and replaced by a sort of hollow Saturday-morning-adventure feel. You learn to live with it.\n2) There's a real lack of balance with puzzles. For the vast majority of the game, you're working room-to-room through fairly linear puzzles. Near the end, things become exceedingly abstract: the final puzzle, many people have chosen walkthroughs over the actual work of translating the runic shapes (best done by watching these special FMVs a second time after playing through the whole game, hunting down certain NPCs).\n3) The game is SHORT. My logged time, just over 4 hours, is what it took me to clear this game. That's a first-time play, taking time to explore everything I could, even watching the special "backer room" area and reading the long wall-o-text (not nearly as long as the insane wall from Neverhood, but still long-ish). Short, short game.\n4) Terry S. Taylor's music isn't nearly as stand-out in this game as it was in Neverhood, or even Skullmonkeys. There were a few catchy tracks, but he didn't go nutso-crazy like he used to. His backer-name track was probably his best.\n5) For all my complaints, the claymation is SUPERB. This is one area where they really stayed true to the original design plans. The game is really worth it for the visuals alone.\n6) Short-short game sets itself up for a possible sequel at the end. It's a sort of "well, more adventures time!" But because Tommynaut has two siblings, and you only meet one of them on Armikrog, the studio has room to do another game with the third of the "nauts" siblings, and maybe improve on their failings that time around. Only time will tell.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI acknowledge the glut of point-and-click adventures coming down the Steam pipe these days. I think the low metacritic score for this game has to do with pedigree ("wasn't this supposed to be as good as The Neverhood?") as well as significant bugs that have since been patched (for the most part). It's not so bad a game as to deserve being "mixed" in the public eye, IMO. It makes me nervous that this reception will put an end to "Pencil Test Studios" before they really got started. And that would be a shame, because they could probably move on to bigger and better now that they're no longer "rusty" in game dev land.","December 20, 2015","true","4.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

I was a huge fan of The Neverhood which greatly fueled my anticipation for Armikrog.  Armikrog delivers exactly what you would expect from the spiritual successor: unique visuals with a playful soundtrack.  And then it builds on The Neverhood with the addition of quality voice acting that perfectly fits inside this fantastical world.\n\nGameplay is basic point & click.  You can't even view your inventory.  If you click on something that requires an item you already have, Tommy reaches into his... pocket... and grabs the right item.\n\nThe puzzles are typically nonsensical and sometimes completely irrational just as you'd expect from such a game, not too dissimilar to The Neverhood.\n\nA serious lack of options, such as audio sliders, is disappointing.  The captions don't match up to exactly what the characters say, but they aren't wildly different either (I recall one comment that was WILDLY different but it felt intentional).  Several audio issues such as missing sound effects, characters talking when they aren't even there.\n\nThe game uses several unfortunate ways to lengthen the game. First, it recycles a few puzzles.  Second, it uses walking and retracing steps unecessarily.\n\nThere isn't much interaction between the characters.  Not a whole lot of dialogue.  With such great voice talent, I was hoping to hear more of it.\n\nThe game is quite short, probably less than half the length of The Neverhood.\n\nI know the price point is going to scare away people that aren't into the point & click genre- and I can't blame them for that.  Honestly, I would wait for it to come down in price.\n\nMaybe it's the nostalgia of The Neverhood that got to me.

The menus are the worst. The only customizeable thing inside the options menu is wether you want subtitles or not. And turning on the subtitles will sometimes give you subtitles INSTEAD of voiceacting. Also those subtitles will sometimes not be correct. Don't turn on subtitles if you play this game.\nThe save menu is also archaic and won't allow you to overwrite files.\n1. WAY too short. You could probably complete the game in around 4 hours, if it weren't because it's chock full of bugs. Half my gametime is litteraly having to complete half the game again because it bugged and wouldn't allow me to progress.\n2. Bugs. Way too many bugs. Some of them ruins immersion by not triggering at the right time. But mostly it's gameplay bugs. Sometimes buttons/levers won't work when you press them. Sometimes you might have solved a puzzle prematurely -> rest of the game now thinks you did things you didn't do and doesn't allow you to progress. Did I mention this is a point and click game?\n3. Gameplay is boring/repetitive. The gameplay is FULL of repetitive puzzles. You basically end up doing the same puzzles for each "act", with a few unique puzzles for that act. Also you spend half the time playing this game just walking between puzzles.\n4. Storytelling AND story is boring.  There is no humour -> random banter occurs perhaps 4-5 times in the whole game, leaving you with music SOMETIMES. There's way too few cutscenes for a point and click game.\n5. Claymation is good, for the most part. The graphics of this game look great, however some places could really use a touch up.\n\nFinal score: 2/10 -> Nobody should ever play this game.

If you're coming from that to this, Armikrog is not going to quite live up to what the Neverhood was, but still serves as a decent homage when your options are kinda limited for this genre. The same great production values are there, and you'll need a notebook on hand to draw down the various nonsense symbols that will be used in puzzles later. It hits the right notes for that mix of bizarre and comedy.\n\nThe game was clearly rushed for launch, even after Pencil Test Studios had to push back the release date twice, and it shows. Early on, you'll run into issues where Beak-Beak can't hit a button, and you'll be fumbling around clicking everywhere to get Tommy or Beak-Beak to do what you want them to. A lot of puzzle solutions aren't intuitive because of this -- one of the major gameplay solutions can be missed entirely unless you're clicking around everywhere. I also found various instances where Tommy would jump to unexpected places in the terrain.\n\nThis may also be a bug, but the game is somewhat silent. I mean this in that you'll find that sometimes no music or sound effects seem to play for a couple of rooms. The music that does play will usually be gone sooner than later, so a lot of the time Armikrog feels very desolate and eerie compared to Neverhood (and that's saying a lot). This is coupled with the fact that while the characters are voice-acted, they don't have a lot of lines at all. For all the craziness that happens in the game, they have surprisingly little to talk about to each other.\n\nThe game will probably take you about 4-6 hours to complete, at what looks like 100% (seeing absolutely everything there is to see). I can think of only one puzzle that was an actual head-scratcher and took a bit of thought. The rest were on the easier side of what you'd expect from Neverhood, and were mostly symbol-matching from clues you'd seen earlier in the game. Pretty straightforward.\n\nNot a bad game by any means, but the cards were stacked against it in trying to match The Neverhood, and the game was clearly rushed out the door when they could have spent another month to give it the polish it needed.\n\n8/10. Try to grab it when it's on sale for around $15. $25 is steep for what you get -- and that's coming from a Kickstarter backer and huge fan of the source material.","September 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

Yeah, of course it's a tough one to live up to, and it's not fair to compare the games like for like.... WRONG. If they raise money for this game on the back of "Hey! Remember Neverhood? We want to do more of that!" then they invite comparisons. And it fails miserably.\n\nIt's nice to have HD graphics, but in nearly every other situation this game falls flat on it's face. The music is forgettable. It's hard to believe it's actually the same composer as Neverhood. Here it's just generic background music that you'll start ignoring after about five minutes. The voice acting, despite getting some big names like Mike Nelson from MST3K is lazy. They sound like they can't be bothered and just want to get it over and done with so they can get their paycheques. Also... why do the characters talk with loads of reverb when they're outdoors? Seriously. They sound like they're in a stadium or something. And the sound in the cutscenes keeps going out of sync. Sometimes when the characters talk in the game itself, their lips don't move at all, like they recorded the lines later but couldn't afford to go back and animate them.\n\nThe puzzles mostly consist of "see something, go to a different room, duplicate what you saw". Yes, Neverhood had those puzzles too, but here they seem to make up most of the game. The rest mostly seem to consist of "find a lever, put it in the hole and pull it." How many times did we have to do that? Eight? Nine? And you have to do the same lullaby puzzle three times. The same door-opening puzzle FOUR times. And the game is short. Very, very short. The reptition of puzzles just feels padding in a desperate attempt to make it last more than an hour. That 2.4 hours on record? That's how long it took me to finish the entire game...including lunch.\n\nIt's also buggy, I can't speak for the Windows version, but the custom cursors are overlayed with the system cursor...the hotspots don't seem to line up well with the items, and it keeps crashing without errors for some reason. Sometimes when a character animation begins [such as picking up an item], they'll jump out of place across the room and snap back when the animation finishes. And there's lots and lots and lots of loading. Every time you leave the room, up to 15 seconds or so, even if you've already been there. After about an hour of gameplay the sound effects [such as footsteps] died on me completely, though dialogue and music continued. Subtitles came and went on a whim, sometimes without the dialogue to accompany them.\n\nIt's completely devoid of any wit or charm. It thinks it's funny, but I didn't even smile once. A wisecracking, sarcastic sidekick. Wow! How original! None of the characters are enjoyable or fun to be around, and the whole thing seems devoid of purpose. They also can't make up their minds whether the characters are silent or not. There's plenty of dialogue during the opening and in some of the cutscenes, but both characters fall strangely silent the rest of the time. Part of the appeal of this game is supposed to be the claymation, but a large percentage of the cutscenes, including most of the opening and the backstory videos are digitally animated... And where are the set-pieces such as the "Battle of Robot Bil" or "Pulling the Pin"? There's very little feel of progression, and you just end up wandering around looking for something to do.\n\nAnd...what's the excuse for a complete lack of Steamworks integration? No achievements....no trading cards....no Steam Cloud saves, nothing. I'm not saying that these things are essential for a game, but it does suggest a lack of care and effort.\n\nYes, I was a kickstarter for this game. And I feel utterly cheated. There's the kernel of a good game in here, and there are some interesting ideas, but it feels like a total waste of time and money.

The game is filled with just as much fantastic claymation (with some 2D animation incorporated) and TenNapel's imaginative visual splendor as The Neverhood, perhaps even moreso thanks to the advancements in technology since 1996. Terry Scott Taylor's soundtrack is also exceptional, once again capturing the unique flavor of The Neverhood's iconic musical style. Though the game only has a handful of cutscenes, Michael J. Nelson, Jon Heder and Rob Paulsen do add some entertaining voice acting to them.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the game is sadly kind of short. I don't consider myself a point-and-click adventure puzzle expert in the slightest and I still managed to beat the game in about 5 hours, though I did have help from some friends who were also playing along with me. Hilariously the longest I got stuck was probably just trying to find a lever that was camouflaged among some debris.\n\nThere's a lot of other early reviews saying the game is currently very buggy, however during my playthrough I only encounted one or two extremely minor glitches, and certainly none that were game-breaking. Plus I think it's silly to not recommend a game just because it hasn't even been released for an entire day yet and there's still a few things the developers need to patch out and probably will within the next couple days if not sooner. Still, if you are concerned about bugs and aren't in a huge hurry, maybe wait a little bit for those last few issues to get ironed out.\n\nArmikrog is a must-own for fans of The Neverhood, anyone who enjoys truly original and visually stunning games, and old school adventure gamers who miss the days where you actually had to get a pen and paper and write things down. You can get it now for $25 (or less if on sale), but for me it was well worth the more than $100 I pledged to the Kickstarter campaign.","September 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

But guys, you should have thought about what made the neverhood so great before even atempting to make a successor: for example, the neverhood is great because you develop a sense of how the whole 3D world is mapped out and learn to navigate and come to love it. but in armikrogm it doesnt feel like a world, it feels like a constant mash up of rooms made from fitted together layers of seperatley recorded clay, and this makes the whole thing feel flat and insted of navigating, exploring and walking around you just pace back and forth in room upon room. also the storey is hardly explained in enough detail and beak beak feels like he is just their for gameplay purpose because the relationship of the two main characters of the game is not developed at all, making it all feel forced.\nThe biggest concern for me is also something that no-one else had mentioned, the Neverhood felt solid because everything was one and all the rooms where the same size and klaymans slow pace actually gave a nicer feel to the game, however, in Armikrog some rooms were hugely zoomed out, ruining the mystery and feel of the game also the game felt really flimsy and that every action and movement had no real weight behind it, and all those layers also ruined the soul of the game and it feels rushed. the other con for me was the music, partley because it barley playes and also is sort of boring and ambiant, it is good but not what i was expecting from Taylor. where is the catchy giberish and acoustic gituar!? i heard the boo-ha-ha song and it put my expectations high because i loved it and then the music disaponted it is like something out of Rayman, not the neverhood. also the bugs could be fixed but it still would not fix the feel of the game. Nice effort tho and i can see what it was meant to be, but next time when you want to bring the soul of the neverhood in to 2015, write down all the things why the neverhood has its unique soal and what makes it so great.

However, after finally having gotten to play it, I can't help but getting a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nWhile the art design and animation is superb, the aspect that it truly falls flat on is the puzzles, and that's pretty bad for an adventure game. There are truly only a handful of variations of puzzles throughout the whole thing, only ramping up in complexity each time, and the only way I can easily explain them is: Tedious. It felt like a chore to work through these puzzles, and I was actively looking forward to the whole thing being over after a while. I can only describe it as being boring.\n\nIt's sad, but this turned out to be a prime example of why Kickstarter is such a gamble.

I recommend it just because it has a charming design and animation. The story, the dialouges, they were all a kind of not professional, I think it is not an appropriate game for adults.\nThe Neverhood was so much more mysterious because of the silence characters that it had and it had a longer story with more interesting and challenging puzzles. It seems that it's creators did'nt spend enough time on Armikrog as much as Neverhood. I have lots of good memories with Neverhood as I was around 13 at that time and I had lots of fun with it.\nAnyway hope you enjoy it.

Before you get a chance to come around after this epic blow to all your senses (or in my case, nostalgia) comes another amazing animation, this time in a stop-motion technique in the sumptuous claymation style from the rest of the game. The visual style is definitely the main selling point of this game, and a large number of models and locations were really made from plasticine/clay and other materials and later the photos were incorporated into scenes that we see in the final product. As a spiritual successor to the almost two decades old game, The Neverhood, Armikrog also places the player in a weird world full of mysteries that invite you to investigate. It’s a pity that the rest of the game’s quality does not follow up to the one it starts with.\n\nArmikrog would have easily been discarded as an amateur half-product if it didn’t look so lovely and unusual. It’s a great shame that because of programmers’ and designers’ incompetence all this hard work is gone to waste, all those stunning landscapes and objects which someone’s been building for months and carefully animated picture by picture are now in the same boat with some of the most irritating puzzles I've seen in the last few years. Considering that it doesn’t take more than 3-4 hours to finish the game, the price of 25€ is an insult. Just like Broken Age before it, Armikrog is a million-worth Kickstarter project that fails to justify it’s pedigree and unsuccessfully relies on the good will and nostalgia of fans.\n\nFull review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/11/review-armikrog/","March 1","false","4.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

With all that aside, Armikrog just wasn't as enjoyable as I hoped. This wasn't a hope for Neverhood 2 or any sort of nostalgia, but more a hope that it'd be a decent point and click puzzle adventure. It wasn't.\n\nI backed this on kickstarter a good while back, when the opening cutscene was animated and looked pretty awesome. The animation is a great part of the game, there's no denying that. However the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. The lack of any examine dialogue makes the larger puzzles rather unintuative, and I found myself coming across a lot of solutions through dumb luck as opposed to any form of logic.\n\nPixel hunting is not a good mechanic for a puzzle game, and the problems are made even worse with really shoddy clickzones. I found myself jumping off tentacles when I didn't want to, and being unable to start puzzles as I was clicking on an obvious button rather than the drawing next to it.\n\nI can't say I was that interested in the story either. The motivations for Tommynaut and Beak-Beak aren't exactly that clear, and although towards the end the dialogue makes it more coherant, I just stopped caring and just wanted to get the game over and done with. I can't recommend, even on sale, as I'd have asked for a refund if I had got it from Steam outright.","November 1, 2015","false","4.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylangallagher/recommended/334120/","dylangallagher","BONESNRUB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylangallagher/","345 products in account","Fairly mediocre adventure game. Unfortunate to see Earthworm Jim's creator continue to make a game that suffers the same mistakes two decades later, which is to say that Armikrog feels like a game designed by visual artists instead of actual game designers. I will give it credit for being very aesthetically pleasing, but under the surface I found it to be a very sloppy, toothless gameplay experience.\n\nI found very few of the puzzles to be particularly well-designed. Many are simply designed to be time-consuming rather than require actual problem solving (the most egregious examples of which are repeated multiple times over the course of the game). The game utilizes a very minimalist interface that sounds fine on paper, but in practice is hampered by a complete lack of feedback and some appallingly broken hotspots. On more than one occasion I tried to perform an action to no avail and was stumped until it randomly decided to accept my inputs for no discernible reason. The player isn't even allowed to make the protagonists press buttons if pressing it won't do anything; they have to solve the corresponding puzzle first. This is compounded by the game's lack of any kind of feedback, leaving the player to wonder if they're not solving it correctly or if the game is outright broken. Maybe it would have been too costly to get Tommynaut's voice actor to say "Hmm... nope. That didn't do anything.", or animate some kind of shrug, but the game ought to AT LEAST trust the player enough to press a button!\n\nStorywise, Armikrog is merely passable. The cutscene animations are very well done, and it seems like a lot of effort was spent on the game's lore, but beyond the game's opening cinematic Tommynaut and Beak-Beak have almost no character. Outside of a couple cutscenes they're almost totally mute. The opening cinematic would have you believe the game is a fun, character driven, buddy adventure in the vein of Sam & Max or Grim Fandango, but in actuality their dynamic can be boiled down to "one of them is small enough to fit in small spaces, the other is not as small".\n\nArmikrog is not a very long game. This is not a problem in itself, but it's so lacking in charm and fun gameplay and it feels so stretched-thin as it is, for a game of such brevity. In the interest of full disclosure, I have never played The Neverhood at the time of this writing, but I backed Armikrog on Kickstarter based on its strong pitch that painted it as The Neverhood's spiritual successor. Instead, I received what feels like a half-finished cautionary tale about crowdfunding. I wouldn't say Armikrog is an outright terrible game, but it's so half-baked that your money would probably be better spent on just one of the myriad superior adventure games that have come out in the last twenty years. You'd be better versed in adventure games than any of Armikrog's developers, to be sure.","October 6, 2015","false","7.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I will probably reference The Neverhood quite a lot in this review. It's perhaps a bit unfair to compare Armikrog and The Neverhood, truth be told. But it's rather difficult not to when describing some of the nuances of Armikrog; as both games draw from the same creative water source.\n\nArmikrog has a wonderful introduction sequence, with great music from Terry Taylor, and oozing with fun clay-sculpted, stop-motion imagination. Hitting planet side has a real feeling of wonder of what's in store for us! I wonder what catchy ditty the first room will have!?\n\n\nUntil the gameplay starts.\n\nThe world:\nOne of the things that made The Neverhood so immersive, was the amount of interactive things in the world. The mushroom tree, the scorpion booger monster clipping Klayman's head off if he strayed too close to the door. The freaking drain, that is clearly signposted as being 'deadly', and can end your game if you jump down it anyway. To name but a few instances where the world can be interacted with, and interact with you. The areas are all distinct, yet skillfully connected.\n\nArmikrog offers nothing to really 'pull' players into the world around them. And what little there is, it's just another vehicle to advance the story. The ants were kind of cool, but are random with no actual context or reason for being in Armikrog. Abraham Lincoln ant with a puzzle clue, right next to a completely unrelated puzzle? It's not immediately clear whether the two are somehow connected ( they aren't), so I spent a frustrated half an hour on that alone.\n\nStory:\nThe overarching story is communicated predominantly through the ceiling barnacles, and I find it a bit neat that the developers used a very particular language for them. There's no real incentive for the player to bother learning it themselves however: the story isn't deep enough to warrant that level of commitment.\n\nThe cassettes that contained the Neverhood story were brilliant for one simple reason: they made learning the story, a puzzle in itself. You explored this colourful world and catchy soundtrack, Klayman's rythmic plodding your only companion, but the world fed you bits of information here and there. And each thread organically flowed into the next, weaving the whole story together by the end.\n\nYou can get the gist of what happened at Armikrog very, very quickly. And the only drive forward after that, is to find some power source that you have no idea what it looks like, and a baby that exists to forcibly inject an occasional audio puzzle at pre-determined points in the progression.\n\nPuzzles (the thing you absolutely want to get right in your point & click puzzle adventure game)\nThe puzzles aren't particularly rewarding to solve, and the process of figuring them out is monotonous. There's really no other way to describe them.\nBeak Beak is a nice physical design (but I was always a sucker for Barking birds), but the buddy system feels very tacked on, and it's nothing groundbreaking in this day and age.\n\n\nMusic:\nThe music ost is worth getting hold of, and has just the right amount of nostalgic style, while still doing it's own thing; a treat to listen to in-game. When it plays anyway.\nWhich leads me onto another thing that bothers me: through experimentation, it appears the music play as a nod of "yeah you're doing it right" as you progress. But if you hang around too much, or take a wrong turn, it abruptly ends, and you will be back to silence. It's never enough time to really appreciate it, to the point it might as well not even be in the game itself.\n\nIt's less memorable than the Neverhood OST, but it's still worth a listen.\n\nPros:\nDecent music track\nVaguely Nostalgic for anyone who grew up with The Neverhood or just appreciates Claymation\nCons:\nLevels are barren of world interaction\nProgress is very much on-rails\nPuzzles are not engaging, and offer so-so 'reward' experience\nMusic is rarely heard for any appreciable, consistent length of time","October 3, 2015","false","4.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The writing, voice acting and the fantastic use of claymation make for a hugely enjoyable gaming experience. You can tell there has been some real passion put into the character design and the creation of all these incredibly tactile levels. This game has a lot of heart.\n\nAlso this is an adventure game where you don't have to worry about your inventory and the usual "will this item work with this object". That feels really refreshing. And, being a traditional point 'n' click, there is a nice variety of puzzles (some of which do actually force you to pay attention and take notes). But once you peel back that thin layer plasticine that makes up the enticing veneer of this game I'm afraid the underlying armature is a little wonky.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bGliGbrRGA\n\nThe puzzles feel inconsitent. The clues (and the puzzles themselves) vary from the blatantly obvious to not even cryptic just plain unhelpful. For the longest time I was stuck on one section because at no point does it indicate that Beak-Beak can interact with the creatures in Armikrog. After learning that I could breeze through the rest of the game but it was not something that was obvious at the time or even hinted at.\n\nAlso some of the puzzles are incredibly repetitive and feel like they are there just to drag out and artifically extend the length of the game.\n\nAlso, I can understand a few bugs here and there but actually being able to to walk through closed doors or not being able to interact with buttons (no matter how many times or where you click on them) is a pretty big flaw for a point & click game. And the save system is incredibly buggy, more than once I had to replay entire sections as the game failed to save.\n\nI suppose for me Armikrog doesn't really feel like a million bucks (or rather the $974.5K raised on Kickstarter). Yes, it's a nice game with some decent puzzles and a lot of nostalgic charm about it but it feels a little over priced and under-polished. If it was in the knd of $15 price range and some of the bugs were patched out I would probably recommend it but as it stands at the moment I'd say maybe hold off on buying it unless you a die hard adventure game or The Neverhood fan.","October 1, 2015","false","7.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

There isn't a better word to describe the game other than BAD.\nThis review isn't going to be Pros and Cons based because there ARE NOT any Pros to it, but if you really wanna save your money you might want to read this.\n\nSo let me tell you my story of me buying the game, it's pretty short but it's crucial to understanding why in my opinion the game is so bad.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a game called "The Neverhood". It was a game that was made entirely out of plasteline with lots of humor added to it and fun puzzles to solve with an environment that was so fantastic and awesome, and the best part is - it came out at 1996. 1996! DO YOU REALISE HOW OLD IT IS? AND YET, SO, SO GREAT.\n\nAnyways, moving on to why I purchased this game, It's actually pretty obvious isn't it?:\nIt's made out of plasteline - just like "The Neverhood".\nIt's from the same creators of "The Neverhood".\nIt even has the same amazing soundtrack composer Daniel Amos just like "The Neverhood".\n\nSo why is it so BAD you ask?\nWell first of all, this game is so, so very short, which in my opinion does not even begin to come close to be worth 25$ to play around 5-6 hours - because as you've probably guessed, there's no point in re-playing it.\nSecondly, this game unlike "The Neverhood" presents puzzles which are much less logical and with terrible solutions. Some of them are so weird and without logic that you'll actually find yourself going over to Youtube in order to see someone else walk you through it..\nAnd finally, the original release date of this game was if I'm not mistaken 18th of August, then they postponed it to the 8th of September due to "bug fixing" in order to release the game without bugs, which is great, but then they postponed it again 4 days before the actual release to the 30th of September again due to "bug fixing". But why do we care? We just wanted the game so badly we didn't care it was postponed without any notice. So it finally came out and guess what? YES, you are absolutely right! THE GAME HAS BUGS!. So many bugs it's almost unplayable. You can actually find yourself stuck because you did something slightly wrong that you can't move forward and have to reload your game save, and if you saved after you've made that mistake you are practically screwed..\n\nSo my final rating for this disappointing game is 4/10 and that's after being very nice about it because it does not deserve it..\nHope you save your money and don't make the mistake of buying this, especially if you played "The Neverhood", because you'll just be deeply disappointed.","October 17, 2015","false","5.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Today I am bringing you a review of the new point & click adventure, Armikrog!\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nArmikrog Review\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nA beautiful game, visually. However, I cannot justify the $24.99 price tag. Poor gameplay, uninspired puzzles. 2 out of 5. Pick up at 75-80% off during a Steam sale. Perhaps diehard fans of the original Neverhood may enjoy this sequel.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe game play is your very basic point and click adventure. You click a spot,  you move to that spot. You click an item, you interact with that item.  Unfortunately you appear to have been cursed with seeing the basic, standard Windows cursor as your clicker thing. Nothing fancy should have been expected, but a little creativity in these spots would go over much better. Any cartoony cursor would have been better. Also, while you do pick up and acquire items,there is no inventory at all. None. Pick up everything and then when you arrive at the applicable puzzle, the item will automatically work for you upon simply clicking the object. The puzzles, otherwise, are fairly standard and none are truly noteworthy or overwhelming.\n\nThe noteworthy and overwhelming things to be enjoyed here are the graphics and sounds. You can certainly tell that a massive amount of the budget went into the art. The art itself is simply magnificent.  The claymation style must have taken nearly every single moment available for production. It truly is breathtaking at points, the flowing art style and claymation are beautiful. Almost equally solid is the music. The sounds are awful...squishy at times, but the game has a soundtrack of music that would be worth every penny if sold separately (It is). If you enjoyed the opening intro to the game, you'll love the music. The voice acting is also top quality.  Featuring none other than Mike Nelson as Terrynaut. Mike you may know from a funny little thing known as Mystery Science Theater 3000 and/or Rifftrax. Armikrog also features Rob Paulsen as Beak-Beak (Raph and Donatello on tmnt and Pinky and Animaniacs). Surely you'll recognize a few other voices as well!\n\nAll in all,  even the awesomeness of the voice actors and the very, very beautiful art cannot justify the $24.99 price tag. Out of 5 stars i couldn't rate this game much higher than a 2. It is, at best, worth a look if/when it drops to a nice 80% off during a Steam sale. Perhaps diehard fans of the original Neverhood may enjoy this sequel. I cant really say i do.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","October 6, 2015","false","2.2"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psykhophear/recommended/334120/","psykhophear","Psykhophear™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psykhophear/","335 products in account","Armikrog is finally here and does the game live up to the hype? Well, yes and no.\n\nIn a nutshell, Armikrog is a beautiful game from beginning to end. The claymation aesthestic is gorgeous and makes it stand out than other games on the market. Both the characters and backgrounds are delightful to look at and you can tell a lot of work was put into it. Unfortunately, if only the same thing can be said about the gameplay.\n\nArmikrog is your standard point 'n' click game that requires no input on the keyboard (except for saving which will get to later), just the mouse. The problem is is that the game doesn't do a good job of explaining that to you as there is no tutorial or guideline to tell you the basics. The game assumes that you know how to change characters, that there's no inventory menu, and that the save/load screen is in the option menu, which is weird.\n\nOverall, Armikrog feels very outdated as the UI design is lacking and the puzzle solving requires you to memorize icons and patterns. I believe this is what the developers are going for but as much as I enjoy nostalgia, it just doesn't feel right. I don't want to be writing down stuff and halt my progress - I just want to keep playing. Throughout the game, there are these green conveyor belts that you use to move from one area to the next. I find personally find them a bore because there's nothing much going on in the background. It's a filler more or less. In addition, I had trouble of knowing how to stop the conveyer belt and exit the vehicle. Again, the game assumes you know how to do it.\n\nSoundwise, it's great. The soundtrack is most definitely the highlight of Armikrog and I find myself listening to it on my iPhone. Unfortunately, the music tends to cut off or starts off out of the blue which can break the gameplay experience. Same goes with the voice over, which is of low quality as if the voice actors recorded them in their bedroom and not in a real professional studio.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me is how short the game is. It took me about 3 hours to complete it and when I first saw the credits, I thought it was joke. It's strange how to story got resolved very quickly just as things were about to get more interesting. I was hoping to see more claymation cutscenes but it didn't happen. I also wanted to explore more of the environment but there's only so much you can see or do, which is a letdown.\n\nAgain, I was disappointed when the game ended but the next day, I played it again and ended up enjoying it than before. I guess I began to appreciate what the game has to offer the second time around. Plus, I have a soft spot for claymation. Despite its technical flaws, Armikrog is pretty enjoyable. It's by no means a masterpiece but you have to give it credit for the amount of effort the developers put into making Armikrog a reality. There is no way this game can ever be made by a AAA publisher in this day and age so be thankful that this game isn't just another mindless shooter.\n\nIf you are into claymation like me and are looking for a one-of-a-kind game with catchy music and interesting world to explore, I'd say give Armikrog a try but if you're in no hurry, just wait until it goes on sale.\n\n\nSummary:\nPros:\nClaymation goodness!\nFun protagonists\nCatchy soundtrackCons:\nVery outdated UI design\nA few bugs here and there\nPuzzles require memorizing\nA lot of flash but no substance\nVoice over don't sound good\nVery short game\n\nSCORE:\nGameplay - 0.5\nGraphics - 1\nAudio - 0.5\nReplay Value: - 0.5\nOverall - 0.5\nTOTAL: 3/5 Stars","October 11, 2015","true","5.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

That's fine. I will say that when I sat down to play it, I loved the visuals, I had fun drawing the non-sensical symbols all over pieces of paper to keep track of puzzles, and I had fun... playing a game. Whodathunk. Given, I didn't run into any of the 'game-breaking' bugs I've read about. Most of the times I got frustrated, it was just because I wasn't following the old adventure game adage 'when in doubt, click EVERYTHING'. Sometimes you've got to be methodical to realize certain characters interact with certain ways with objects, it doesn't sugarcoat anything.\n\nAnyways, my main critique is just that I would love more. More puzzles, more cutscenes, more animation, more voice acting etc. And that is fine. That means I really enjoyed the work that was put out there and I hope to see more from the Pencil Test folks.","October 6, 2015","true","8.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's probably worth me adding that I have never played the Neverhood,  so that hasn't factored into my review.\n\nPros\n+ Fantastic aesthetics - the claymation is truly brilliant\n+ Great music (although I hear that for some it doesn't always play)\n+ Interesting puzzles\n\nCons\n\n- Dreadful UI. I know this is a matter of preference, so you may well feel differently, but for me this just wasn't what I would expect from a modern point and click adventure. The cursor is the standard windows one - this may not sound like a big deal but I don't ever remember seeing this on a game I've paid for... I was so surprised in fact that I thought the game hadn't loaded correctly. Pixel hunting is rife in this game. While I can understand that some may not want the feeling of being handheld by having clear hotspots or a dynamic cursor, the game just doesn't give you feedback leading to a bit of frustration, clicking on everything repeatedly. Why? The hotspot sensitivity/radius is really odd (sometimes you have to click in a slightly odd place to get something to work); sometimes the clicks don't seem to register even though you're clicking on something that's definitely interactive; and sometimes when you're clicking on, for example, a button 'too early' (ie a puzzle somewhere needs to be solved first) you'd expect the character to press it (and it then does nothing). Actually the character does nothing at all, there's no feedback/sounds or anything, so you're left thinking perhaps it isn't something you can interact with (even though it is). I can't help but think that this is not where the puzzles are supposed to be. Clicking on a button for 10 minutes to get something to happen just isn't fun. I don't expect puzzle hints, I do expect some even vague clues on how to play the game. There's no inventory, for example - in fact it's purely pointing and clicking, there are no keyboard controls.\n\n- Very little story or character development. Yes, there is a (text only) novella part way through the game but usually in a point and click I'd get a decent story propelling me throughout that compels me to keep playing. I didn't get that from this game at all. There's very little dialogue and not as much humour as I had expected.\n\n- Lots of bugs, some of which are minor, others are more major - you can get yourself stuck in no-win situations, for example, and in some instances the save game function is not working properly (for instance when overwriting a previous save). I understand it only launched yesterday (at time of writing) so I'm really hoping these things will be fixed soon.\n\n- Quality on the cinematics/sound seems poor, as though it had been over-compressed.\n\n- Bit short for the price at (approximately) 3-5 hours playtime. Little replay value (as it is linear)\n\nUltimately although the devs doing the claymation did a stellar job, I really feel this game has been let down by gameplay mechanics, story and bugs. I would love to give this a recommendation but I just can't in its present state. Hopefully over time the game will evolve into a more polished version, and at that time I'll play it through again and amend my review.","October 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

The claymation style is beautiful, very well animated, it's really funny at times, and the plot is overall pretty good, with tons of story in the background to find (and by tons, I mean there's a wall - a literal wall - of exposition for you to read at your own devices).\n\nBut then, there's the bad. It's really bare bones. No interactions with the environment, no clever uses of items, no inventory at all... There is absolutely nothing to do besides the essential; it's too simplistic for its own good.  Also, it's surprisingly short. I just beat it in one sitting, and there's really nothing to do afterwards.\n\nAlso, the audio. Oh boy, it's a bit of a mess. The voice acting seems like it's missing some punch to it; the main character in particular seems like he's just uninterested in everything. And for some reason, his recordings in particular sound really low quality in relation to all other voices. The soundtrack is fantastic, but there are a few bugs that will make the whole game go silent.\n\nBut I'd still say to give it a go. It gets frustrating at times, for various reasons, but its charm is undeniable. Just make sure to get it at a discount, because it is NOT worth its full price.","December 24, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This may be due in part to the music.. what happened there? for 90% of the game there is little to no sound outside of effects, I only really noticed about 4 or 5 songs throughout and with no settings in the menu to adjust the volume levels its a major let down. (dont get me wrong the soundtrack to neverhood was so spot on that my expectations may have been unreasonably high). That being said the sound effects themselves are repetative almost to the point of agitating depending on which section you are in. Story line is also a bit lack luster and paired with puzzles that are quite abstract a lot of the play time comes from wandering around wondering what the hell you missed or forgot to try clicking on.\n\nI have to sum this up by saying its very clear a lot of time and effort went into the making of this but I had high hopes for a longer playthrough and for the length of the wait from conception to release I wasn't sure what to expect but by the time the game is done it lacks a lot of the reward you hope for from a point and click puzzler. I expect most people will be able to wrap this game in under 10 hours with very little replay value.\n\ntl:dr - Great effort but if you are looking for complex inventory built style point and click this game will not be for you, if you are looking for a visually appealing as well as unique p&c then make sure to add this to your list.\n\nnostalgic-bias rating - 8/10\nrealistic rating - 5 ollie ollies out of 10 very lacking oxenfrees","October 1, 2015","true","8.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","0"

The games visuals are what sells it, from the claymation to the stop motion animation. Armikrog visually is top notch, with a comedic twist but it doesn't stop there. The soundtrack, voicework, of Armikrog is also a treat for the ears. The games intro immediately sets the tone for whats sure to be an entertaining adventure. Now where things begin to get hazy is gameplay and bugs. Armikrog was a game that was delayed a few times and I think it would've benefited from staying in the oven a bit longer. Mostly Armikrog lacks polish, areas like the options menu, interactions with the environment, and lack of inventory make the gameplay feel hollow at times. While I didn't run into many game breaking bugs I did notice some sound issues would occur after cut scenes. It's these types of things that need to be patched out, which I am sure the developer is working on. At the end of the day though I don't think these issues hold the game back from being enjoyed. If you read between the lines you can see that the game is a passion project and it shows. Everything is there as far audio/visuals, all the game needs is a little TLC and polish.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/3ULO1eyXrxY\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 1, 2015","true","2.7"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

You'll see a lot of negative reviews here with very short play times here, and they're justified. The initial release had broken music that didn't play most of the time, a static cursor that made it tough to tell what you could interact with, some game-breaking bugs, and other issues that added up to a game that was not as fun as it should be, Almost all of this has now been fixed in the months since launch, and while it could still stand to have a few options and more logical menu design, it's playable in all the important ways.\n\nSo let's back up and forget the messy launch and start over. Most of the interest in this game surrounds its connection to The Neverhood, a cult-classic from 1996. Indeed this is the work of the same key staff: Writer/artist Doug Tennapel, animator/designers Ed Schofield and Mike Dietz, and composer Terry S. Taylor. Although there's no connection to the story or characters of The Neverhood, it is in every other way a direct successor, with the same distinctive claymation style, same basic gameplay, and similarly weirdo soundtrack.\n\nTo that effect, Armikrog is a smashing success. The backgrounds and characters are more gorgeous than ever, now in glorious high-def and with lighting and shadow not possible in the original. The animation is even better, and it shows that the project leads are best known as animators. The soundtrack, while maybe not quite as memorable or plain-old weird as The Neverhood, is still pretty fantastic, blending eerie sci-fi theramins with Taylor's playful whimsy.\n\nGame design also follows a lot of the same cues, for better or worse. It uses the same, simple one-click interface, and inventory puzzles are of the simple lock-and-key sort, and work automatically if you have the right item. There's also plenty of logic puzzles, which, like Neverhood, often fall into tropes like sliding tiles around, entering in codes, or putting things in sequence. They're not wildly original, but they're balanced well, forcing players to think but rarely escalating to the point of frustration, with the possible exception of a difficult puzzle at the very end of the game.\n\nMost of the game's strengths and flaws are the same as its predecessor, so if you liked The Neverhood, it's easy to recommend Armikrog. The only caveat is that Armikrog is missing the one thing that made The Neverhood stand out most of all: It's originality. The Neverhood defied comparisons by being totally unlike anything before it, while Armikrog is, by very nature of what it is, planted squarely in its predecessor's shadow. It might be a new world and a new story, but almost everything about Armikrog is a call-back to The Neverhood in some way. For most of us, that's exactly why we want to play it, but it also can't quite have the same impact the second time around.","January 10","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's very tough to say whether I recommend this game or not.\n\nLet's start with the positive stuff. The style of the game is unmistakable. As soon as you dive in, the clay animation and the goofiness of the main character sends you right back to the good days of the developer's previous works. Now our character has a sidekick with whom it has extensive interaction throughout the game which seems a pretty good find to me.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also very familiar for the fans. Strange mechanisms, weird symbols, looking for the right tip - all of that is back. Some solutions will require working together with the sidekick which definitely brings something new into the game.\n\nThe backstory is there, and it is given in separate pieces, just like before. So you uncover all the details as you go. I think it was also a great decision to implement it as stories which language you do not yet understand, so at first you just try to guess what it tries to tell you by looking at the picture.\n\nSo why do I doubt whether I should be recommending the game? The main reason is probably that it is simply too damn little. The gameplay time is surprisingly short. I spent about 5 hours in the game, even though I didn't rush anything and was trying to get into the game. That's simply too little. Some people suggested that this could be a demo, and I somewhat agree, it's does not feel like a full game.\n\nThe game offers little in terms of the game world as well. In Neverhood we used to have a fairly large world with many locations and free movement between them. In here we only get several locations which are all inside the same castle. We don't get to go outside, the only available mode of transportation is the electric cart.\n\nSame thing can be said about the story. Characters other than the main one and his sidekick get very little development. So when I finished the game, I definitely felt hungry for much more.\n\nSome people here also complained about bugs, but I can't say that's true for me. For the entirety of this game I don't remember being stuck because of the bugs even once. Probably it's because I played the game much later after the launch, but that doesn't change the fact: it's well made by now.\n\nMy verdict: yes, you should probably play it. Despite being short, it is well-made and pretty enjoyable. Get it on a sale, and you will have some good time on a weekend. Just one thing you have to keep in mind: don't expect the scale of Neverhood, or you will be very disappointed.","April 7","true","5.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But I will start with the good things. Awesome claymation art style. Good voice work. Fun to play. Great soundtrack. I only have 2 complaints and they weigh it down pretty heavily. A few of the reoccurring puzzles get very annoying because they are just unintuitive guessing games or time wasters that feel like they were included just to increase the length of the game which is my other complaint. I don't normally mind a game being short but 4 hours is kind of ridiculous for the price especially when you know the core content could be reduced to about 2 hours if you got rid of the time wasters and guessing puzzles.

All I know about it from the forums tells me that I've A) seen most of the locations and puzzles in the first half-hour; and B) ran face-first into 3 game-breaking bugs out of at least 6 widely reported.\n\nIndependent, free-spirited game development is great. Channeling the worst amateur attitudes (like busting deadlines, then hiring unpaid interns, then (presumably) doing the programming itself on the last scraps of money and time) - is not charming in any way.

It was a fun playthrough for me, but it didnt took me a long time to beat it. I really like the soundtrack in this game. Just like in Neverhood and Skullmonekys. Spot on!\n\nThere were a few bugs here and there. First thing what I saw was that the audio was off in the cutscenes. Not too much, but still. In the last cutscene it was WAAY off. Subtitles were a bit messy. Sometimes a bit off or it just came too late. Music sometimes didnt play at all and it worried me, because the game has a GREAT soundtrack. Be careful on some puzzles. I did 2 puzzles accidently twice and it messed the game a bit, but I was able to fix it by doing the puzzle one more time. Some clicks were a bit akward. For example Beak, you're sidekick "dog" were sometimes hard to push a button. I pressed it alot of times and in diffirent places, but nothing.

You can finish this game in about 2 hours, not worth $25 price tag. The puzzles are too easy and for game which puzzles make up 100% of the gameplay, that is unacceptable. But worse of all the characters and story are so bland. After completing the game I know next to nothing about Tommynaut and Beak-Beak. Which is really sad because one of them dies in the game. This game doesn't try to flesh out the characters at all as their is little to no dialogue between the two or cutscenes. The voices of Michael J. Nelson and Rob Paulsen was wasted in this game. The Story is the greatest failure of this game. The story is so bland and so simple that it can't even hold a candle to The Neverhood's story.

I almost threw my wallet through my laptop screen. I danced around my room. I moulded my own face out of clay. The game fully exceeded its targets. Then like, two years happened. Great! I thought. The game will be longer! Better! More beautiful! I couldn't wait for The Neverhood's massively intricate backstory, rock-hard puzzles that furthered the story, characters with stories and personalities you could invest in and unique setting and gameplay.\n\nWell, the good news is that the setting and animation live up to that hype. It looks beautiful. The animation is gorgeous. The cutscenes are fabulous. There's really good music and one hell of a lot of humour in this game. There's the beginnings of a really good backstory, too. Unfortunately it just doesn't feel finished. This game started to tell a really good, intricate story and then it just kind of forgot about it and only really honoured that story when it absolutely had to. The villain is terrible. All we know about him is that he has a name and that he knows the protagonist. That's it. No motivation. No personality. No backstory. And the same pretty much goes for our protagonists; He's just a guy. That really disappointed me, even if The Neverhood's ENTIRE WALK THROUGH BOOK was a bit excessive.\n\nIt's short, too. Me and Luke clocked up a grand total of 5 hours of this on Steam and it's done. Completed. No more. No reason to replay. No reason to go back and explore. No hidden tidbits. Everything in this game is just there to further the gameplay. Nothing to embellish at all.\n\nAnd then the gameplay itself is just not that fantastic. Sure there's puzzles but some of them are repeated two or three times. There's no guidance or hints, and the only real way to solve most of them is brute-force and trial-and-error, which really pales in comparison to, say, The Neverhood's mouse maze, or the radio room.  They set the ending up for a PERFECT alternate ending. But we just weren't given the choice. Why? I wanted that choice! It's like they wanted to do it but they just didn't have time. Even though they had more time than they originally asked fo\n\nOverall, I'm glad I only paid £10 for this game, and I wouldn't really recommend anyone spends full price on it.

But it turn out to be very disappointing. Aside of being very buggy, the game is very short (i finished it under 3 hours withouth walkthrough) and two puzzles repeat not 2 but 3 times each to artificially increase game length. I'm not regretting my purchase that much, since the game is gorgeous, but wouldn't recomment it to most of the people.","October 1, 2015","false","3.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

A game that I love and cherished in my childhood for its creativeness, that dark, scarey tone, and bits of comedy. This game however feels lacking in just about all of that. You play as Tommynaut, 1 of 3 brother astronauts that are sent on a planet saving mission to find P-tonium, a source of fuel they rely on. Tommynaut ends up crash landing, and takes shelter in the fortress Armikrog where the game takes place.\n\nPuzzles: The game did not feel as difficult as The Neverhood, but then that may have been because the younger me had trouble with the Neverhoods insane puzzles, but even when I played it recently, the puzzles were still difficult... Armikrog did not have that problem. I had trouble with one puzzle because I overlooked one teeny tiny detail so the answer was incorrect. Aside from that, some puzzles took no time at all, some took no more than 5 minutes, 10 minutes at the VERY most.\n\nStability: Being Day 1 Release, the game did have some bugs, despite being delayed for the past two months. Nothing game breaking, just annoying. Some sound issues, clipping issues, and a save issue that set me back a few minutes.\n\nLength: Very short. Granted you can only put so much into a point and click adventure/puzzler that takes place in a fortress, I finished this game in about 5 hours. The neverhood took me 6-8 hours last I played it, and I played it straight through with no breaks. Plus the neverhood felt more full, having a much larger world to explore, a 3D point of view, and tons more puzzles. Armikrog recycled 2 seperate puzzles 3-4 times each, and the others were similar in concept.\n\nMusic: I couldnt tell you how much I loved the music from the Neverhood, but the music in Armikrog does not live up to that unfortunately. Armikrogs music was good when I could hear it, but the game's bugs often cut the music for me, leaving me with very little noise. The music in the Neverhood was a lot of fun, you even find yourself singing along to the gibberish sometimes, but Armikrogs music was a bit more serious, more mysterious, less entertaining.\n\nOverall: I am honestly disappointed in this game. I DID have fun while playing it, but it just felt too short, too easy, and did not live up to the Neverhood's legacy. If you enjoyed the neverhood, you might still enjoy this game, but dont set your hopes too high.\n\n\n\n\n** END OF GAME SPOILERS**\nIf there is an expansion (that adds at least 10 hours of gameplay) where we rescue tommynauts other brother after recieving his mayday call, I may reconsider this game, but for now, I could not recommend it. 5 hours on a game that cost me 25$ is not a very good value in my opinion. Maybe I'll come back and replay it and get more of my moneys worth in time, but I cant see it happening any time soon.","September 30, 2015","false","5.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

All I knew is that it was a point and click adventure puzzle game made in stop motion, and for what it was it was pretty great. I became aware of the game a few week before it was released on steam and it had my interest. After release I heard that the game suffered from bugs, and I held off buying for a month or so while the patches came in. So coming into this I had a bug free experience that didn't effect my opinion of the game.\n\nVisuals:\nThe visuals are pretty damn nice looking and the stop motion animations are of some damn good quality. Nothing looks off other than a few minor parts of the game where the green screen effect wasn't 100% removed from the objects in the world, but honestly its so minor I noticed it only on 2 things.\n\nGameplay:\nPretty standard as far as a point and click goes, but they did manage to streamline the whole clicking aspect. By this I mean you have no accessable inventory to grab items from and try and use them on different things. If you have the right object you'll be able to interact with it and progress. This elminates the trouble of "use-everything-on-everything-until-something-happens" part of PnC games that eventually happens. This makes the game more puzzle focused in terms of problem solving and finding the right clues to the puzzle and working with the puzzle with the knowledge you have.\n\nI will say however that one puzzle isn't very clear in what you are needing to do, and for some reason has the puzzle solution given after you've already cleared the puzzle. However the solution is visible in the room its in, just not very obvious.\n\nAll in all this was a prtty solid game for what it was, and for me it was 3.6 hours start to finish, but the price tag of 25$ is a bit much. I paided 15$ for the deluxe edition that comes with the sounds track and I feel that the 15-20$ range of the base game is a much better price for the amount of content in the game. So if my opinion is worth anything I say get this when you can on sale for a bit cheaper.","January 8","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was disappointed mainly because of issues and bugs that are not supposed to be there since the game is not on Early Access. I got a cWTB (conditional walkthrough break) and I pretty much stopped there since I need to start from the beginning over again. I have seen other people with similar issues.\n\nBut that is not the only thing, I hate that there is nothing that helps the player to understand what can be interact with. I mean I dont want a big highlight or something, but at least make it different than the rest of the non interacting objects. Give them attract. In the Neverhood, the rooms are pretty much empty so you know what can be interacted with and in the Neverhood, the mouse cursor change when there is a direction to take and in the Neverhood the mouse cursor fit with the rest of the artstyle. Okay thats a small complaint, but what about a default window cursor now that pop-in cause it just does not fit. Or you click too much on the side and you lose control of the game since windows take on.\n\nI wanted to ignore them, but each time something bad come up and I just cant ignore it anymore. There is also some design choice that are just bad. The baby puzzle is.....is.. really bad, the baby sound is annoying (Yoshi's Island only flaw is that you?) and the wait, oh GOD THE WAIT for the puzzle music to play. BTW speaking of music, they just stop playing randomly and then there is no music at all, even ambient.\n\nI have issues with the animation and the music, little things that pill-up more on top of the main problems.\nThe music is not as funky and out of this world as I was expecting, its a little let down for me + the fact that it just stop randomly does not help so I cannot listen to it. They did not polish little things like TommyNaut entering door from the front, where you can see it not aligned with the door and the animation is stiff. His walkcycle was kind of disappointing, I have difficulty to read is personalty. I can just see him as a couragous space traveller. The personality of the main guy is important because you need to like to be him kind of. If I compare it as the main guy in the Neverhood, where you can clearly see that he is born like an old child, he does not even know the difference between bad and good and when he walks, he just dont give a ♥♥♥♥ (probably one of the best walkcycle Iv seen in a game). It sound maybe weird that I talk about walkcycle or the mouse cursor, but they are important in a game where you see them all the time.\n\nIts sad a little too that you see the world at the beginning, but you stay in the Armikrog fortress for the rest of the game without exploring the place more. I like how there is animation, dialogues and extra elements to interact (window) in the first room of the game, but after that those things that you find in a finish product are gone. I was hopping for some extra jokes or interaction, hell there is a part where the bird can ♥♥♥♥ on you, was a good place to insert a funny thing, but no !\n\nIs there good things, yes, it is fu/$?ing stop motion claymation making the artstyle awesome. A really beautiful adventure. Not only pretty, but the design shape of things that are twisted. its less dark and lonely than the Neverhood.\n\nThey keep the same simple point and click no inventory gameplay, I dont have complaint with that. However the puzzles already started repeating themselve when I stopped.\n\nTo conclude, Armikrog seems unfinish and full of issues giving a feel that there was few QA work. Waiting can maybe fix most of the annoyances if the devs are still working on it. Sorry Doug but for the moment I cannot recommand it :<","November 8, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Truth is, it follows a lot of the same beats. The puzzles are maddening. There's a lot of boring transition time. Notepads and basic doodling skills are required. The plot doesn't really make an appearance until the very end. All of these things make up Armikrog, too.\n\nYou can finish the game in just a few hours with a walkthrough.

The Neverhood wasn't exactly a Day One critical success either. It took a few years. That said, don't buy it on Steam. Get it on GOG.com instead.

"The Neverhood" is its own game, and "Armikrog" is its own game. Are there some similarities? Of course there are. But as far as I can tell, the world of "Armikrog" has nothing to do with the world of "The Neverhood."\n\nI've been following the progress of "Armikrog" since the beginning. As a huge Doug TenNapel fan, I was ecstatic to learn that he was making a new game. I've always been a fan of stop-motion works; there's just something about how you can see the fingerprints in the characters and the scenery, and knowing how much time and energy it took to create every single little frame that I just find so awe-inspiring. Visually, this is a beautiful game; you can tell the animators and set designers spent a lot of time making each room and character. The soundtrack, courtesy of TenNapel once again collaborating with Terry Taylor, is pretty catchy too.\n\nThat being said, the game does have its flaws. I found some of the puzzles a little confusing, but that could be just because I'm not much of a point-and-click puzzle gamer. The story is a little lacking at times, and some plot points can seem to come out of nowhere, but I do feel that the ending is satisfying. The voice acting isn't the best I've ever heard, but you can tell that the actors and actresses were into it (Rob Paulsen is, as usual, amazing). Some people have complained that the game is too short, but I finished it in about four hours. And once again, it's stop motion; that stuff takes a long time to make, you know!\n\nSo...is the end result of "Armikrog" perfect? No, of course not. But what I do know is that everyone who worked on this project was passionate about it. At the end of the day, this was a labor of love for Doug TenNapel, and that's satisfying enough for me. If you're a hardcore fan of TenNapel's other games, I definitely recommend checking out "Armikrog."","September 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I'm personally not a huge fan of Kickstarter projects, but I am a fan of TenNapel and of the intricate visual style that can only be provided by stop-motion. This was something I've been waiting on for a while.\n\nArmikrog plays exactly like The Neverhood: A point and click adventure game with strange puzzles to solve in order to progress. Though similar in visual style and surrealness, Armikrog differentiates itself from The Neverhood by being more science fiction inspired. You are exploring a relative catastrophe, rather than a world created by a deity. Sections with the blind dog Beak-Beak, with the appropriate visuals for a blind dog, help Armikrog stand out from its forerunner.\n\nThe game is really good, but it is an acquired taste. The puzzles in this game do require a lot of memorization and outside of the box thinking. The hints provided are also very vague, often you can find yourself getting stuck with no clue what to do. You need to have patience for these kinds of puzzles. If you don’t, then this game probably isn't for you.\n\nThe game could still use a bit of a tune-up, but is otherwise ready to go. A good return for the Neverhood crew!","October 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

It had a much smaller budget to start with, and no game studio to keep the development funded twice as long as originally intended, which unfortunately happened. When you come to terms with that, it is actually a fun little game worth playing.\n\n$25 is too expensive, though, because the playing time will probably not exceed 5 hours and the content is not that dense. Fine for Kickstarter purposes, but after release, the price should (and probably will have to, eventually) reflect that.\n\nPRAISE\n+ I mostly appreciate the visuals, which are expertly animated, beautifully crafted and Mike Dietz with Ed Schofield really showed us that they still got it.\n+ The same goes for the music by Terry Taylor, which could be a little more prominent in the game.\n+ There are some original, pretty and fun puzzles.\n\nRANT\n- The scripting and the story are the weakest point. The plot is explained in 4 pencil-animated sequences, including the intro, and the ending is just a plain deus-ex-machina. The villain wants to get the child, eliminates its mother and father, who then help you to save the child. Unfortunately, that's not a dumbed-down version, but pretty close to how the story is actually presented.\n- All of the characters are very superficially treated and undeveloped. The authors threw away the main advantage of having two protagonists, who only act in the few cutscenes there are.\n- Bugs that are annoying, but at least in my experience, they were not game-breaking.\n\nIt seems to me that the developers, facing the fixed budget, must have focused on the most expensive and essential thing to do: the hand-crafted, hand-animated visuals. You cannot have such a game without that. The biggest problem is that this part comes last, after all the story and all the pencil-testing are finished. Rolling this big boulder before them must have been pretty daunting, and the game looks like they needed to plan much less than what they hoped for, out of fear that there would not be enough money to finish.\n\nI think that this game is cursed with both "not appealing to the mainstream enough" for any game studio to fund it, and "too budget-tricky" for Kickstarter, which is a shame. My verdict is that you should buy it on a sale, because it is still a showcase of rare talents and there will be very few, if any other games like it.","October 4, 2015","true","5.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

Meaning it plays the same, and has a very similar feel to it, however doesn't share any characters or world.\n\nArmikrog has some really awesome Claymation skills behind it, and some of the environments really are a joy to look at. One thing that I felt fell short, was the fact that sometimes digital effects are used. This takes you out of the immersion. One of the things that made The Neverhood look so real, was the fact that everything WAS real. The lighting bounced off the clay naturally. Most of it is traditional clay, but you'll catch the occasional digital effect.\n\nThe game has some funny characters, dialogue and situations, which will get a bit of a chuckle out of you. A few times it also got me laughing pretty hard.\n\nThe puzzles are the perfect difficulty in my opinion. Enough to make you scratch your head from time to time, but not impossible. My main gripe with these is there's one puzzle that you will do multiple times, with increasing difficulty and little variety. It's not awful, but I would have preferred if it was left out.\n\nSimilarly to The Neverhood, the soundtrack is composed by Terry Taylor. The music is nowhere near as amazing and catchy as it was in The Neverhood, because it's not as crazy. That's not saying the music is bad, it's well composed and a joy to listen to, but easily forgettable when compared to the soundtrack of the Neverhood.\n\nOverall, it's still a very fun game (Although a tad bit short). Not as good as The Neverhood, but still a unique and enjoyable experience!","September 30, 2015","true","6.0"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","23","43","0","5"

It's very much a sequel to the Neverhood in the thematic sense, like Phantasmagoria 2 or the Final Fantasy games as it uses many of the same themes and structure.  Like the Neverhood, it's claymation, the story never really goes much of anywhere until near the end, the backstory is told through animated line art, there's a giant wall of text with more optional backstory and lots of puzzles in a relatively small structure.  Thankfully there aren't many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles like in the Neverhood, but the tradeoff is they're mostly pretty easy.  I thought a few were clever though.  It's also shorter, but feels like it would have dragged on if it went on for too much longer.  The ending isn't the best, but that's just another comparison to the Neverhood.\n\nArmikrog made me feel nostalgic.  It made me feel like I was in the 90s again, and that makes it special.  If you aren't the kind of person who likes 90s adventure games, then it will seem dated in many ways.

It’s important to note that the claymation has an incredibly raw look to it, which I assume is intentional, like old-school Wallace & Gromit or The Trap Door.\n\nUnlike most point and click adventures, there’s no real inventory management as most items are more or less given to you upon completion of the puzzles, which are the meat of the adventure. And even better, they are all rather intuitive logic puzzles. When you put your mind to it, they are all possible to complete without trawling through google for walkthroughs.\n\nThe story itself is simple in construct and while you have to back-track every now and then, the back-trackings flows naturally and often requires to approach the same place from a different route. The characters lack a bit of personality, and as such, any real motivations behind their actions and the events that take place. But I didn’t find this too disconcerting as the main focus is the puzzles.\n\nMy only real criticism for the game is its steep price for a max of two hours (give or take) of gameplay. Even this criticism I’m reserved in making as I’m aware of the amount of time and effort that goes into making claymation films (I’ve watched those Wallace and Gromit behind-the-scenes films). Then again, this was a kickstarter with close to a million dollars invested into it.\n\nDespite all this, still worth the play and an examplery point and click adventure.","February 7","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story was super odd. It felt as if they had an ambitious story in mind but didn't have the resources to pull it off. Character development was non-existent. Who is Vaugnaut and Tommy? Maybe they went for a mysterious or minimalist vibe but it comes off as half-baked. Interesting to see Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) play Vaugnaut.\n\nThere's a momentous amount of text inscribed across a large wall in the game which contained a far more complete story, which although provides some context for the events and settings in the game, is hugely disconnected from the gameplay. I enjoyed reading it nonetheless despite some obvious pandering to kickstarter funders.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeusNikMachine/recommended/334120/","DeusNikMachine","deusnikmachina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeusNikMachine/","166 products in account","The Neverhood is one of my all time favorite games and holds a very dear place in my nostalgic gaming heart. I can understand the want for others to hold Armikrog to the standard of its spritual predecessor, but I'd like to steer clear of a direct comparison as I believe it's a tad unfair to do so. After all, The Neverhood was a big budget title published by Dreamworks Interactive, green lit by Spielberg himself, and released at full game price. For the lack of this financial support and a smaller team Armikrog is a bit shorter and a smaller scale.\n\nVisuals:\nPros: Armikrog has creative character models and envoronments that made me feel in a sense that I was picking up right where The Neverhood left off. I can't enough of these claymation worlds. Armikrog is quite colorful and real treat to look at. If I had to give Armikrog anything over The Neverhood, it would be the be expanded color pallette and extra care that was put into the detail of the rooms overall. The animation and cutscenes (though few) were top notch. I played it on a 55inch tv at 1920x1080 and it looked great.\nCons:  I get this feeling though that more in the way of cutscenes (not to mention dialogue and immersive elements) but may have been cut for budget or time. I would like to have seen more easter eggs similar to the monster scene when you look through the window repeatedly. Another odd thing is that there is no lip movement from the characters outside of cutscenes.\n\nSound:\nPros: The music of Terry Scott Taylor is top notch as usuall, though I would like to have heard a couple more memorable tracks. The sound effects are acceptable.\nCons: I feel like not including more dialogue between our 2 heroes was a big missed opportunity. Even just a funny exchange about each room you enter would have been a huge improvement.\n\nGameplay:\nPros: Fairly straight forward and liked the addition of a second character (Beak Beak!). There were atleast 3 big puzzles that I found to be quite unique and creative.\nCons: I feel like the overall difficulty on some of the puzzles could have been kicked up a notch. Also thought it would be nice to include a bit more complexity to how you use BeakBeak. For instance maybe he could eat other things that give him other abilities you could add to the puzzles. Perhaps swimming or digging.\n\nStory:\nPros: Overall I loved the story that was told here. Where The Neverhood had an entire biblical chronical written, Armikrog offers some of its lore in a different way. You couldtell that a lot of time was spent on the hieroglyphs and the alien language that you can for the most part transalte your self. When the games translates it later and the full back story is known, I couldn'thelp but be reminded of the Willy tapes.\nCons: I would like to have had a bit more back story on Tommy, Beak Beak, and the main villain. Again this could have been easily fixed by more dialogue exchange to deliver some exposition. The ending/wrap could have been a bit longer and tad more rewarding.\n\nBugs: I didn't experience any and really do believe some of the reports are people losing their patience or maybe (perhaps never had) their old school adventure gaming skin. If the lever you have doesn't work, than it is the wrong lever. If a button or control panel doesn't work, than you prob haven't activated it. Just Sayin...\n\nArmikrog is not as good as The Neverhood. In someways it was problably incapable of being that, but there are flaws they could have without a doubt avoided. Overall though I enjoyed the experience and would buy another game if they made one.\n\n7.5/10","October 1, 2015","true","27.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not great, not even good. It is just nice. Paying the full price is not acceptable, And I'm sorry I didn't wait for a sale to buy it.\nI had so many expectations for this game, I loved playing The Neverhood so much, but Armikrog seems so pale in comparison. It's not bad at all, I had some fun hours playing it, but I wanted so much more..\n\nI really loved the way they put some references to The Neverhood, like robot bill on the wall, or the history writings in the wall, or even the cannon , those little details made me smile.\n\nThe graphics and the music were gorgeous, really great, but it felt like 80% of the resources for the game were spent on them. The important part about this game was suposed to be the puzzles. I expected that feeling, when you have collected so many clues you have no idea where  to use, and as you progress in the game you find some riddles you have the answer, and find some more clues, and in the end it all FITS it all makes sense. When you are being told a story but there is some fulcral detail you discover in the end that makes you suddenly understand the hole game. I am really sad I didn't have that, the game felt so empty. Most of the clues you knew what they were for not that much later into the game. You never really had to turn back to solve a puzzle that has the answer further ahead.\n\nIt was really linear and really short.The puzzles were not that hard, and I was expecting something much more complicated, more conected, more complex. The game was short, the story had so much potential to be developed and it wasn't. But it wasn't, because to have a satisfactory story the game would have to be SO much longer than it was. They probably didn't have the funds or the time, and that is verry sad indeed, because this game was full of potential.\n\nSomehow the development team missed something indescribable that made The Neverhood so loved. The verry essence of the game, what made it special (besides the claymation, of course) is missing in armikrog. The contents of the game were shallow and underdeveloped and it's really unfortunate it turned out like this.\n\nNevertheless, it is still worth playing, and worth buying, and I'm sure the development team made the best they could with waht they had. A good game, for those who had no previous expectations for it.","October 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I would welcome many more goofy lines, many more tweaks like own game cursor, which would eliminate pixel hunting. I would also not be affraid to put in some puzzles that need much more time spent to be solved (not my 2 hours of gameplay...) And I would most definitely try to create atmosphere that would just suck me inside of this game (maybe it was due to bugs that this didnt haeppen), but for sure the story was too short without anything unpredicatable...

The voice acting, what little there was, is top notch. And the story, while I barely understood most of it due to the strange alien language spoken by the octopi during their tales (it would have been great to have some subtitles there) the ending alone is worth trudging through the landscapes to reach your goal.

Armikrog is made by much of the original Neverhood team, including lead designer Doug TenNapel and wacky musician Terry S. Taylor. It’s a lot like The Neverhood, and if you haven’t played that, it’s similar in gameplay to Myst.\n\nSo there’s good and bad. The good is pretty much all of the game design, story, art and music. It’s fantastic. More on that in a bit.\n\nThe bad is mostly technical. As you will see from many of these Steam reviews, this game is buggy. Like, really buggy. Little bugs, big bugs. A missing animation here, a difficult-to-find click-spot there, a game-breaking save corrupting bug every once in awhile. Save often, with a new name every time, because you never know how far back you’ll have to load because your game is in an (accidentally) unwinnable state. The good news is that the team have patched the game four times in the past few months and fixed many of the bugs and issues. There are still some left, but they are working on it.\n\nSo, looking past that, what’s the game like? As with its predecessor, Armikrog is a claymation game, and that’s just cool. In 1996, the cost and difficulty of producing a clay game vs a 3D computer graphics game was probably about even. In 2015, the tools and technology for 3D are so advanced that it’s the obvious choice. The team absolutely chose the hard road here and it’s worth it --- the soul of this game is in the fact that everything is literally hand-crafted. It feels so unique. Unlike The Neverhood, this game also uses bits of other materials like fake fur, paper, metal, and yes, an accordion.\n\nSo you basically control this clay guy called Tommynaut who looks suspiciously like Klaymen, and can switch between him and his blind talking dog, Beak Beak. Each character has his own unique abilities: Tommynaut can pick up and use items and complex interfaces, while Beak Beak can go through small holes to reach new locations. So you have to use both characters in tandem to solve puzzles. The most annoying part is having to switch to the other character for non-obvious reasons (most common: if there is a knee-height switch, it won’t even register as an object for Tommy; you have to switch to Beaky and have him press it). There is also a distinct lack of feedback when you try the wrong thing, or the right thing at the wrong time. The puzzles are pretty simple and intuitive, and mostly based around learning a strange alphabet of symbols. Have a pen and paper handy and write down any clues you find, and you should be fine.\n\nThe game is missing the first-person outdoor areas from The Neverhood. You pretty much never go outside, but it does have the track/cart sections connecting the different buildings together.\n\nIt’s a little short --- took me about 5 hours. The characters are likeable. The story is simple but compelling and worth seeing through to the end. All up, this is an undervalued gem, that lives up to the original game, and that I would wholeheartedly recommend, save for the many UI and technical issues.","December 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think if you get frustrated by incredibly obscure puzzles, look elsewhere. Fortunately there are hints for the puzzles dotted around the game, but they in themselves are obscure. You will be challenged. You will need perserverance. I'm not the best puzzler around either, so I had to check on the ol' internet walkthrough a few times, but I'm so used to that it really didn't bother me.\n\nPerhaps those who are not familiar with Doug TenNapel's earlier works (Neverhood, Earthworm Jim, Kog-Head & Meatus) will struggle to enjoy Armikrog. You almost need to know what to expect to really 'get it'. To quote TenNapel in an interview, Armikrog is 'iconoclastic'. It really is. And to me that's what really makes it enjoyable.\n\nWhile the limited plot makes not a huge amount of sense, the stop-motion claymation visuals are so off-the-wall in a typical TenNapel way that makes the game impossible not to be endearing.\n\nFinishing the game left me wanting more, in a way Earthworm Jim provided through sequels, a TV show and action figures. Armikrog may not reach those lofty heights, but it stirred that strange feeling of nostalgia all the same.","April 3","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Neverhood managed to feel like a whole world that you moved around, a world with an interesting and mysterious backstory, whereas this comes across as a series of disconnected rooms, one puzzle after the next, with a predictable, weak, and very short, story underpinning it.  There's also not a lot of originality in the puzzles, the same three or four get repeated several times with slightly different colours/icons/sounds/etc\n\nFrom a production standpoint the animation/clay is nicely done, however the voice acting is appalling, both in script and in recording quality.\n\nThe weird music in the Neverhood was always a favourite of mine, and when i saw the same guy was doing the score for this i had high hopes, but with the wild variations in volume, the buggy sound and the speed with which you can complete each section meant i didn't really notice it :\\n\nAt 4 hours of playtime i feel a bit short-changed.  It's not really a game you would replay, so it works out pretty expensive if i look at it from a cash-per-hour-of-fun perspective!\n\nSeems pretty buggy too, for such a technically simple game, particularly the sound.  Several times it just cuts out entirely until you quit and reload.  A couple of the puzzles don't seem to store their state properly, for instance it's possible to retrieve certain objects multiple times.  Nothing that broke the gameplay, fortunately, although it did make me nervous.  When you're stuck with a puzzle it's all too easy to wonder if the game's just broken.\n\nOverall, i'm a bit dissappointed. Had this been made by a couple of students as a college project then i'd say "this is awesome", but as an offering from a professional team, it's embaressingly poor.\n\nI'd recommend this game when it's down to a couple of quid in the bargain basket, but until then, just not worth it.

Maybe it's just me getting used to the billion of games around, while we had much less entertainment available at the times of Neverhood,and every game which could have been qualified as 'moderately interesting' was already a win... but still... This game is short, without single grain of humour, and with very strange puzzles, which are mostly not puzzles at all.

By no means is this a BAD production, but when you compare it to the truly magical masterpieces such as 'The Neverhood' this unfortunately just stands sluggishly in it's shadows.\n\nSince the developers no longer own licensing rights to the Neverhood and a evergrowing cult fan base were constantly demanding a similar stimulating imaginitive claymation adventure, some of those responsible in the previous game went on to make this one in the hope that they could copy the magic of the first one. Here is where it fizzles out into a pile of playdoh.\n\nI can't help but think that the developers cut some serious corners thinking that they would get away with it or that it would simply pay off. IT DIDN'T!\n\nSo what makes this one rather limp wristed in comparison to its predecessor? First of all there is a serious lack of facial expressive shennanigans on the characters, therefore the animations seem rather dull in comparison to the Neverhood. Isn't facial expressions what makes fast paced animations like Roger Rabbit so memorable? While we mention fast pace, there isn't a real lot of that. Most of the backgrounds seem rather the same. The modes of travel along the cliff scaling clay cart was tediously long.\n\nThe music was constantly cutting in and out at random moments, producing long moments of deadly silence. There seemed to be a real lack of a musical score. While there was some momentful songs in the game like 'I wrote a song with your name in it', they were very few and far between.\n\nSeveral places you could not only make the sound glitch by clicking on cut animations more than once, but you could also click your character off the cliff in various places where you were not suppose to go making your character spasm violently like he has been possessed.\n\nThe puzzles seemed to very similar to one another and not as imaginitive or as respectfully designed as it was in the Neverhood. While they built a long elaborate story to go with this game, one that is comparable to the size of the Bible just like they did in the Neverhood, but because of the lack of connection that most people will have with both characters and the uninspiring backgrounds and creatures, not many will even bother to read it.\n\nOne of their biggest mistakes was taking out the 3D dimensional view which was in the Neverhood and which made you feel like you were part of the alien landscape exploring it.\n\nIn short all this production did for me is long even more for the magic of 'the Neverhood'. Unfortunately I have serious doubts if they will ever make it. Why? I liken it to the 'Flying High' movies produced by the Zucker brothers which everyone loves. When Zucker brothers split each one making their own production, each one tried to produce something of the same high calibre magic. Some were close, but ultimately they all failed. It seems the true magic of the production came from the whole spectacular group working together. Maybe thats going to be  the same case here. Certain creative people missing, and so this will never be of the same rich level of gaming treasure history.\n\nAm I exagerating how great 'Neverhood' was? Well let me put it this way. If you still own 'the Neverhood' in it's original box you can now sell it for around $150.00. I very much doubt in 20 years you would even be able to buy lunch with what you sell Armikrog for...\n\nClose guys, but no cigar...","November 25, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Taylor soundtrack and great voice acting.\n+ Deep and immersing story, especially if you read the in-game huge text-wall.\n+ Balanced not-too-hard puzzles that you can solve if you sit and think about them for a while.\n+ For a Kickstarter game that funded 950,000$, It's pretty long. If you know what you're doing in both games, I believe it's as long as The Neverhood is, although in The Neverhood the puzzles were much harder, so that would make the game much longer on a first playthrough.\n\n\nThe less good:\n\n- Some pixel hunting and tricky hot-spots.\n- Too much backtracking with no shortcuts.\n- Puzzles are easier than The Neverhood, and sometimes not as original.\n- Less animations compared to The Neverhood and smaller world. It FEELS like a Kickstarter game.\n- You can't view your inventory, so it's hard to keep track on items you have on you or not. I solved two puzzles by mistake before using an item that should've given me a hint about one of them, and although I didn't need to use it later, it really confused me to hold an item that I couldn't use.\n- Some repetitive puzzles that feel like an annoying mini-game you have to solve.\n- A little expensive for what you get in my opinion.\n\nAnd one last thing: you will need a paper and a pen when playing this, a LOT. I pressed the PrintScreen key and copied pictures to MSPaint every time there was some weird shape in the background, so I would remember small details for later puzzles. I enjoyed it, but you might not. It's that kind of puzzle game.\n\nIf you've enjoyed The Neverhood, it really is as close as you can get today, as long as the genre is dead. I felt at home.\n\n\nKickstarter games and expectations:\n\nI've bought The Neverhood when it was out, at the end of 1996, and played it for hours. I didn't have an internet connection back then, and finding out how to solve hard puzzles was freaking impossible. We had to ask gaming magazines for help, and I still remember how happy I was when I finally solved the BOBBY puzzle.\n\nKickstarter is a great platform that helps small companies "skip" big companies, but I was first disappointed with Broken Age - only 15 hours of gameplay (for both parts), for almost 3.5mil$. Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded, Dreamfall Chapters and who knows how many more games that I decided not to fund, and soon to be Mighty Number 9, were all the same. I knew they would be short, but not as bad as they were (Dreamfall Chapters is probably the worst of them all. Seriously, if you think Armikrog is a bad descendant to The Neverhood, you wouldn't BELIEVE how far The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapters are from one another).\n\nWhen I invested in Armikrog, I already knew it would not be The Neverhood. It barely scratched the 900k$ it needed, and you have to remember that not every coin goes to game development. 10% goes to Kickstarter, and who knows how many more to rewards, sometimes up to 30% (!).\n\nI knew that they would release a four hours game that would remind me of The Neverhood, and they did. Actually, Armikrog is FAR better than what I've expected. The Neverhood had so much more money, people, time and resources to work with, not to mention DreamWorks and Microsoft, who gave the development team everything they needed. you can't even imagine what great work they managed to pull off here with barely nothing.\n\nBugs are fixable, and they were fixed. Yes, it was wrong to release it like that. But would you rather them releasing it in 2-5 parts, like other Kickstarter project did? Broken Age was released, surprisingly, in two parts, because of money problems, and Dreamfall Chapters in FIVE! So yes, for the amount of money they had, I really am satisfied with what I got. I can only hope that a big company (like Daedalic Entertainment) would take these amazing people and fund a BIG project, like The Neverhood was at its time.\n\nArmikrog is not The Neverhood and it was never meant to be. It's a good game on its own, and I had fun playing it. It's the only game since The Neverhood that made me use a pen and a paper. It has beautiful clay art, good enough music for the amount of money they had to pay for it, and fun puzzles. It's not perfect. It's not The Neverhood.

It starts off with a wonderful animated intro sequence and good music, followed by an exciting and enjoyable claymation cinematic that kicks off the game. You are pumped to get started, and for the first few minutes, it's very promising.\n\nAfter that, though, the game starts to fall apart (gameplay wise).\n\nIgnoring the missing menu text that was fixed in a timely fashion, the game seems unpolished, and far from ready to release. I had to restart the game from nealy the beginning after discovering that you could not overwrite saved games. The game did not tell you this, because you get no feedback when you press save to know that you have actually saved it.\nBugs and frustrating moments leave you with the question "Is this supposed to be like this, or is this just another bug".\n\nSome buttons you can press, some buttons you can only press if all the conditions are met, and some buttons you can press, but the game won't let you unless you hit a sweet-spot with your mouse cursor, and so you might think that you have not met the conditions to press this button yet, so you move on to the next puzzle, and so the confusion begins.\n\nIt feels untested, even though it has gone through a beta. After almost year of delay, you'd think that it would be well tested. As of now, one puzzle can be skipped entirely by walking straight through a locked door. Everyone seem to have this problem. I can't imagine this would go by any sort of QA.\n\n\nArmikrog, again, is a beautiful game, and I want to recommend it. But I can't. Not now.\nIt's not about the price. That is something I'm willing to pay for this kind of beautiful claymation adventure. But the game is simply not DONE.\n\nThe voice quality of the dialogue is varying from bad to okay at best. The main characters start off the game talking to each other as you progress, but apart from cinematics, they barely speak past a few rooms, which enforce the 'not done' feeling permeate this game.\n\nI want to like you, Armikrog, but you got to take the few extra steps.\nBuy/play this game once the bugs have been fixed, and it might be enjoyable enough.","October 4, 2015","false","4.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I really love the claymation and how they mixed that up with other materials like cardboard or fabric to make the surroundings visually attractive.\n- The story is well-rounded and clear, you learn more about the background and purpose while playing and the end-scene wraps it all up nicely so you end the game with a feelgood experience.\n- The puzzles. If you're an experienced puzzle-game type you might feel different about this but as I generally suck at puzzles I really enjoyed these. Some were easy, others a bit more challenging but never frustrating. Having played the Neverhood ages ago, I knew I had to keep a notebook nearby to keep track of symbols and hints. Who knows, you might need them later on.\n- The humor. Sometimes a bit goofy but I had a smile on my face while playing and laughed at certain scenes when I expected something huge to happen and it actually turned out to be completely different.\n- The music. I'm going to be humming the name song for days.\n\nThe not-so-good (yet?):- Some of the graphic details have an unfinished feel, but there was only one room where I really felt annoyed by it. They 'stretched' an item in a really obvious and ugly way and the interaction with that item was sloppy as well (it got kinda seethrough when moving it). That might have been a time or budget-related thing but I hope they'll fix it.\n- The gameplay is mostly smooth but I got stuck during my first attempt of finishing the game and there was no other option but to start a new game. Also: I get the feeling some doors that are supposed to be closed, only to open after solving a puzzle can now be walked through without solving. (ofc. I still solved the puzzles...you never know what you might need it for later)\n- As much as I understand claymation takes ages to make, the game is on the short side. Right now, I don't know if there are enough easter-eggs and little details to make me want to explore the game again, especially since the puzzles don't change and once you discover how they all work it takes away some of the fun.\n\nMy conclusion:I really loved playing Armikrog even though there are still things they need to work on. It is a feelgood game, and I really enjoyed exploring, solving puzzles, discovering new things. The 'world' is limited but funny and quirky and leaves me wanting to see more. Right now, I wouldn't play the game again but finishing the game was a fun journey. I really hope Pencil Test fixes the issues reported (especially the gamebreaking ones but it couldn't hurt finishing some of the graphic/stretching issues) and when they do, I'll play the game again to see how it was intended to be. If you're willing to 'forgive' Pencil Test for releasing a game that still could use some work: go ahead and buy.\n\n\n\n\n","October 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

That's why it's such a disappointment to me that this game is bad.\n\nThe very very few parts of the game that are purely claymation look great, but most of the time it's a set cobbled together with sprite of individual claymation objects, which makes it look disjointed. The fake shadows and smoke are really noticeable and bad looking. It's apparent a lot of the time that objects were not made at the same "scale" but were just scaled when they were put into the game, so the level of detail is wildly different for two objects that are right next to each other and the same size. There was even one case were they needed a taller version of an object, so they just STRETCHED the sprite! It looked horrible, like some kind of joke.\n\nThe voice acting hurts the game and you gain nothing. The story is told well through just the actions of the charters, there's no reason for the bad voice acting. I wish it was like neverhood were only 1 or 2 characters speak understandable words. The feel of the game is also ruined by real life pop-culture references.\n\nThe game is full of bugs. It's like they didn't even beta test it. The audio cut out frequently, and the save function crashed my game many times before it actually worked. Based on the community hub, these are common problems.\n\nThe game is short.

It got released earlier today but I had stuff to do. So I downloaded it and went about my day. I got home today, made dinner and played through it all in one sitting. I have a lot of mixed emotions as an avid point and click fan, and for those who know me.. a die hard Doug TenNapel/Earthworm Jim/The Neverhood fan. On one hand, the game was absolutely stunning and a testament to how innovative and creative a team of developers can be even with limited time and resources. The game was very well designed and left little to be desired artistically. On the other hand, the game is still bug ridden which is to be expected considering its launch day. From a AAA publisher/dev team I would have expected more but seeing as it is an indie game I will cut it some slack. But by far the biggest issues I had was that the puzzles were way to easy and the story was barely there which in turn results in the game being extremely short. My first playthrough took about 3 hours. It feels like this was rushed. Altogether I did enjoy this game, but I wish it was a bit longer. Just my opinion if anyone is interested in purchasing it. 7/10","October 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

In a way, that is a good thing - you get to see amazing art, the clay motion and voice acting is rather amazing and certainly top of the genre.\n\nBut! The programming is very poor. My very first experience with the game was a menu without labels on buttons (fixed now) because I am on non-US system. It makes you wonder how (if at all) was it tested? Save/Load is on Options menu for whatever reason. Sometimes, subtitles don't match the speech sounds (I am not talking minor variations, I am talking totally different lines).\n\nAnd the playing time is rather short. I had completed it in about 3 to 4 hours.\n\nBottom line - if you liked The Neverhood, you are going to like the art. You are also going to like the story *SPOILER ALERT* but only after you progress very far in the game because until then, the storytelling elements are spoken in gibberish. *SPOILER ALERT END* However, the story feels less immersive, somehow you feel more like an outside observer than actual part of what is happening inside the game.","October 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It was good fun, nicely constructed, and has some fun music.\n\nI can't tell what a person who hadn't played The Neverhood would think of it, but from my perspective it comes across as an overly derivative sequel. Most of the plot was copied over, but without the justifications which made it interesting. Instead of walking around and appreciating a cute clay world, admiring it inbetween puzzles, you just spend half your time in a vehicle. It lacks The Neverhood's wacky humour which made the claymation so much fun.\n\nI was hoping for an adventure game with more complexity and depth, maybe something Monkey Island like. I also hoped it would be longer. And I find the price I backed it for to be fitting, but maybe not the one it's up for on Steam for how long it took to play. Each area has the same set of puzzles to repeat multiple times as you travel from one to the next, instead of an open exploration type thing. I did run into a couple of bugs as well.\n\nIt's possible that knowing the style it inherited from The Neverhood beforehand put a damper on the experience because it wasn't all new and quirky. Plus I basically already knew the plot. I still have to say I recommend it though - despite being a shallow version of its predecessor and everything else, it's still the type of game I want to see more of, and it was a cute, nostalgic, if bland, experience.","October 2, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Other than that one instant I never really felt stuck and finished it in about 3 game sessions clocking in around 5 hours.  The animations and cut scenes are top notch. although I do wish all of the cut scenes were in claymation, only some were.

The soundtrack varies from being atmospheric to playful. Unlike many other point-and-click games, Armikrog features NO dialogue trees. Much of the puzzles are based off of finding secret symbols and codes to use elsewhere. Be sure to take notes with a pen and paper while adventuring!\n\nAs a fan of point and click games from companies like Lucasarts and Telltale, Armikrog is a breath of fresh air, as its lack of dialogue trees and its use of symbol-focused puzzles give it a unique gameplay experience. You'll love to explore the mysterious tower and learn about its tragic history.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent. Michael J. Nelson and Rob Paulson deliver excellent performances as the two lead characters.\n\nUnfourtuanetly, there are a few bugs to be found within the game. I have experienced animation glitches whenever I grab onto a squid's tentacles, and there is one area where Beak Beak the dog needs to jump on a switch. It doesn't work properly, as no matter how many times I click on the switch, he simply WON'T sit on it. However, these bugs do not detract from the experience.\n\nIf you are a fan of point-and-click games and/or stop motion animation, Armikrog should be a no-brainer for you.

I was so happy to see that this team decided to make another game after all these years.\n\nIn a lot of the comments I saw that people were not pleased with Armikrog; that it wasn't like The Neverhood. I can't tell if these people are just bitter, or what.  Now I haven't actually beaten the game yet, but from what I've played, it DEFINITELY feels like The Neverhood.  Of course it's not going to be exactly the same, but it's got that spirit.\nI haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs (perhaps because of the patches?) but I do see some slip ups here and there programming-wise I suppose (for example, when climbing the tentacles or riding in the little buggy) but nothing that's made me want to stop playing.  The puzzles are a bit challenging, but you do end up going back and forth a lot and clicking a lot of stuff, but isn't that the point?\n\nThe only thing that really bothers me is the fact that sometimes when the characters are speaking in-game outside of cutscenes, their mouths don't move.  It's not a big deal, just a little off-putting to me I guess?\n\nPlease, if you're a fan, give this game a chance.

This game is just 2d point and click, you mostly just go from room to room. I understand that maybe they couldn't afford to make a large scale area of the planet. That was an element of their previous game that really brought you into the world they created. I think the people giving this negative reviews just wanted a larger world to explore, and more of a variety of items and puzzles. (in the game one thing that stands out to me is getting levers over and over) I think because of the length of the game, the repeated puzzles stand out as more of the same even more so than they usually wopuld in a much longer game. So it ends up seeming like lazy game elements to the players. I also thought there were too many parts with the little motorized wall car thing. It's the only way you travel from tower to tower, I think some variety was needed for this small game.\n\nAlso I felt disappointed with the soundtrack, but that may have been do to bugs not playing the sound... So we aren't sure on that... either way the sound bug is an issue that needs to be fixed asap.\n\nBut yeah interesting characters, world, story. It's not a bad game. It's just very short and is currently buggy. Many people wanted a return of the neverhood, but its a different game different characters different place. You can't go in expecting The Neverhood.\n\n\nALSO: SORT OF SPOILERS: They never really explain why the "bad guy" is bad. If that's in the WALL OF TEXT then I apologize, but some kind of clues or something about what happened to them would have been nice.","October 14, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

For starters, your movement is much faster than the plodding steps of the Neverhood, which makes backtracking relatively painless in this game. Inventory management is automatic, and you'll only be carrying three items at most at any time. The puzzles are pretty standard fare though, sticking to an approachable increasing difficulty structure, and they don't reach the esoteric variety that was present in Neverhood.\n\nPlaying with pen and paper is recommended. It's how Neverhood worked, and it adds a lot of fun to a playthrough to jot stuff down and reference your notes when doing puzzles. There are a number of pictographs scattered around the titular Armikrog so it's best to write them down.\n\nLike Neverhood Armikrog's story is fairy slim, the most exposition you'll get is in the cheesy opening song. Unfortunately the lack of a proper finale event left me a little wanting for one last puzzle. Thankfully there's voice acting to flesh out the wider cast, and Tommynaut and Beak Beak make a very charming duo.\n\nArmikrog works with a much wider range of materials than Neverhood's clay to shape it's enviornments, but unfortunately the difference in production value shows. There's no first person view segments, and the budget doesn't allow for a 6 minute long cutscene. This game was crowdfunded for just under a million dollars, but the cost of stop motion adds up, and the game cuts corners in a number of ways. That said finding an enviornmental detail that catches your eye or seeing one of the protagonist's numerous idle animations can bring a smile.\n\nTerry Scott Taylor return to do the soundtrack, and while the ingame audio isn't as in-your-face as the iconic tunes from the Neverhood, some like the aforementioned intro theme of the game have a lot of charm.\n\nUnfortunately this game had a troubled development. A number of delays and a not-great game design philosophy (hey, Earthworm Jim was panned for being a game developed by artists) hamper the initial release of the game. While my four hour playthrough was absent of any major issues, there were a number of minor visual flaws I noticed during my experience.\n\nIf you can justify paying the price tag for the stop motion visuals, Armikrog is a nice experience that stands in contrast to That Other Point and Click Revival Game.","October 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The surreal environments and the random obscure monsters and aliens were all excellent.  The puzzles were decently challenging.  The controls were odd at first but once I got a handle of switching characters the game was enjoyable.  Where most games follow in a linear fashion and then eventually open up for exploration, this game basically stayed linear.  You really only needed to backtrack if you didn't take careful notes.  I do feel that some of the puzzles were easier than they could have been, but if they were any harder I think the little kids out there would just gripe and complain.  I did not follow a guide or walkthrough to complete the game and I feel that the game itself was pretty straight foward.

There are tons and tons of games out there that are more immersive in the world they create that you can play for the same price as this.

I'm honestly not upset in the slightest that this game isn't as good as was hyped, because at least they weren't just giving us the same old, same old here.\n\nMost of the reviews you'll see compare this to one other game - the Neverhood.

As a big fan of The Neverhood game and puzzle/adventure games in the similar vein, I was ecstatic that the creators came out with Armikrog.  The surreal environments and the random obscure monsters and aliens were all excellent.  The puzzles were decently challenging.  The controls were odd at first but once I got a handle of switching characters the game was enjoyable.  Where most games follow in a linear fashion and then eventually open up for exploration, this game basically stayed linear.  You really only needed to backtrack if you didn't take careful notes.  I do feel that some of the puzzles were easier than they could have been, but if they were any harder I think the little kids out there would just gripe and complain.  I did not follow a guide or walkthrough to complete the game and I feel that the game itself was pretty straight foward.  This sounds negative but honestly it was so refreshing to enjoy this wacky world.  I am a big fan of the clay environments with the added flair of fuzz and fur.  I hope there more games coming and I do feel thirsty for more.","October 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Armikrog looks amazing, voice acting made me laugh, It definitly had a air of my childhood about it. I think thats what makes this game so enjoyable for me, I have fond memories of Neverhood and Skull Monkeys. With that being said - As Great as this game is, I'm a cheap dude when it comes to buying games so $27.99 seemed a bit steep for me, however its not too far off from what i would pay, and i understand why its this expensive. I haven't gotten too far but i did stream it for a hour or two the other day and it took me a LONG time to figure everything out, and the first few puzzles.\n\nYou NEED to think when you play this game, you need to examine everything, pay attention to symbols and work things out. It is fun, its worth it to support the Devs and their game. The Music is amazing, and the claymation just brings back memories from games from my childhood like Clayfighters.\n\nIf you want to see the beginning of this game, come take a look at this video - https://youtu.be/zOtnyWil6Yo OR just look for a review to get a better feel for the game.\n\nI Enjoy it, I will be playing more for sure.\n\nThere are more things i would like added to it - Specific Volume control and It would be pretty cool to see what i have in my "inventory"\n\nAnyways, I hope this review helped atleast someone - This game is fun, and even funner if you like puzzles and games where you need to think.

I was so excited when it got its Kickstarter goal! But I can’t really help but feel this is just a budget version of their Neverhood game. (Skullmonkeys was awesome but kind of a different beast)\n\nIt mostly felt lacking for me, because I had high expectations. It wasn’t really all that funny like the other games and it almost feels like it is a little rushed. There is a part of the track in the game where it leads to where you might be able to go if you came from the other way but there isn’t really a way to get over there that I have found, and it is not a part of the game as far as completing it goes.\n\nThere were a few glitches I came across like teleporting transportation and in one building I could just enter it without doing the key puzzle. (The door was visually closed but you could just walk through it.)\n\nThe game could have done with some beta testing or at least more if it had it.\n\nMy biggest hope is this does well enough that they are able to continue the story and hopefully do a better job in the next game, which I hope they are planning.\n\nI just felt the game lacked the polish of the games that came before it. It almost feels like a fan made tribute to said games. But that could simply be the difference of the amount of people involved and the lack of AAA title money.\nI don’t feel there was enough dialogue or really just enough game in general.\n\nTerry Scott Taylor was also rather underutilized… the only real song I felt was wonderful and up to snuff with the other games was the Kickstarter song with your name in it. This isn’t to say that the music is bad, it is still good and enjoyable, but like the rest of the game, it just isn’t enough.\n\nI almost feel like they spent too much time on animation and not enough time on fleshing out the humor or story. It was all just very linear.\n\nBUT, I want more. I want so much more of this game, from this game. The oddball humor and just weirdness of it all is sorely missed in today’s videogames. Please buy this and support these awesome people in hopes they can make another bigger and better game.\n","October 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Love its quirky world, its oddities, blah blah, so call me nostalgic if you want. Maybe I am blinded by that, if you want to accuse me of not being fair. I think I am being fair though, and Armikrog did a lot of things that rubbed me the wrong way that weren't technical, just bad decisions. This contains spoilers, so please do not proceed if you mind that.\n\nThe cursor thing. Everyone has talked about this. No need to elaborate, although the complete lack of feedback as to what is interactive/where you can go would have helped immensely (how many of you got stuck before you realized you could keep going up on the first octovater? Or that beak beak needed to talk to the octovater? Why not put a similar sonar effect on the octopuses while you are beak beak?) For that matter, Tommynaut has a "hnnnn" idle animation. Use that to show a puzzle/object that cannot be solved yet rather than giving the players... no feedback whatsoever. Heck, even the blue creatures puzzle has a "negative" sound effect when you can't move them, use that as well.\n\nThe graphical shortcuts like the stretched out orange creature (seriously, just put two ontop of each other if you need one to be twice as tall, that's way better looking and less jarring than the photoshop mess that it is), or the shrinking tommynaught when quickly re-entering a room in the background have been talked about.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple rooms you cannot re-enter really bugs me. One has the hall of records in it, so, if you were halfway through reading it or figured you could come back and check it out later, well, no. Start over.\n\nAnd here is the big sin: The clue to the one of the final puzzles in the game. The room with the 4 words. Didn't write them down? Figured you could come back and write them down when you understand what they are? NO. TOO BAD.\n\nPut the roller-parts of the path on a separate, lower path than the path to get to that area. Leave it solved when solved. That way you don't have to reset that path to allow the player to move between areas, and they can still access that room later in the game when they are undoubtedly making their rounds to listen to all the octopuses again.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't think the neverhood had ANYTHING like that. No crucial clues or absolutely necessary bits of information that were 1 time access. The worst was that place where you had to put in all the symbols with the weird sound, and only because the clue and the puzzle were a good long walk away from each other, but it's not like one just locked itself away forever after you had visited it.\n\n\nOther things that really bothered me were the "beak beak" or "tommynaut only" buttons, especially because there isn't even a sound effect to tell you the button isn't working before. So not only is it cryptically doing nothing earlier, but when it can do something, you need to assume only beak beak can use it? That's bad. There are animation files for both characters pushing buttons. Just have both of them be able to push it. Seriously, let them push it before the power machine is on, even, and just give an empty clicking sound. This also applies to the blue button and the creature wall puzzle. I clicked the button, nothing happened, so I wandered around for about 10 minutes until I accidentally clicked the symbol and the puzzle started. The puzzle should include the blue button in its initialization hotspot.\n\nThe repeating mobile puzzles were not great, and especially made worse by how they just appear with no context and then force the player to try and decipher fragmented measures of music that don't feel like a unified recording over the constant screams of an infant.\n\nThe final sliding block puzzle: there is no indication that it should be solved on the "top" slot, as every other one encourages you to solve via the "bottom" slot. Also these are tedious. The "H" block puzzle was the worst in the neverhood, these are just that... 3 times.\n\nOne of my favourite neverhood puzzles was the final one, which took the first puzzle of the game and remixed it in a clever, creative way. Nothing like that exists in this game. There are almost no puzzles that feel environmentally contextual.\n\nThe final puzzle of the game: was there a clue as to which "notch" you needed to be on to solve it? That would have helped immensely, because otherwise it felt like a brute force "try every combo, try another notch, try every combo" type affair.\n\nI'm not even going to touch the plot or the fact that the characters had... very little character at all. Or the fact that the world itself was pretty bereft of any of the kinds of stuff that made the neverhood memorable. The fact that the opening section of the game contains a lot of commenting and dialogue that quickly gets phased out tells me that more was probably recorded, but became irrelevant as the game went through redesigns.\n\nThe art and animation are gorgeous, but that's not nearly enough to save the mess the game actually is.\n\nThe music is great, when it decides it wants to be heard which is infrequently.\n\nThe voices sound like they've been recorded in a tin can at the bottom of the ocean, but mercifully disappear almost entirely after the first segment.\n\nI want to like Armikrog, I was so excited... but I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential with really obvious design problems. I appreciate the obvious love that went into it, but I feel like there were just some real problems I have a hard time overlooking.","October 3, 2015","false","7.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Is this the worthy successor that we've waited for all this time since then? Yes and no.\n\nIn the art department, Armikrog absolutely delivers. Gorgeous claymation environments and characters with all of the surreal atmosphere that we've come to expect from its predecessor, and in gloriously crisp HD resolution to boot. The new Terry Taylor soundtrack is nothing short of fantastic, with awe-inspiring themes and the composer's trademark quirkiness and eccentricity. The puzzles are challenging, but never unfair; there's plenty of clues to be found and even when I did get stuck, I found the solution no problem after taking a little break. The story is interesting as it develops, and full of wacky humor, with decent performances from Mike Nelson and Rob Paulsen to boot.\n\nOn the other hand, the game offers no real surprises for long-time Neverhood fans, as the overall set-up is basically the same. Several puzzles get repeated throughout, and although they steadily increase in difficulty, it feels like the designers were taking the easy way out. Some important elements can be tricky to spot, and even when clicking on something, the game won't always immediately respond or even give you any sort of helpful feedback, which makes things needlessly frustrating. Finally, the game is really short, though nevertheless doesn't outstay its welcome and ends on a satisfying note.\n\nIn conclusion, while this game isn't everything we may have hoped for, it's still a must-play for any Neverhood fans, and highly recommended to newcomers who aren't afraid to try something offbeat and wacky that won't take them long to beat. Thanks, Doug TenNapel. You made me feel young again.","October 2, 2015","true","7.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I also stated: “If the developers now focus their efforts on developing the gameplay and establish Armikrog as a title in its own right away from The Neverhood, we could potentially have something quite lovely on our hands.”\n\nSadly it doesn’t feel as if this happened. Despite a few delays, the game feels as if it would have benefitted from even more time and budget to polish up the clay-work so the quality at the end was the same standard as the beginning – as well as more testing to iron out the silly bugs. The gameplay is oversimplified, the characters have limited personalities, the puzzles are repetitive and have no drive, and the world of Spiro 5 and its fortress are flat and empty.\n\nIt’s the waste of potential that spoils it the most and I can imagine many of the Kickstarter backers coming away disappointed. Perhaps the developers were relying on fans of The Neverhood and their collective nostalgia to see them through and make the release a success, but this isn’t the spiritual successor they’re looking for.\n\nA full review of Armikrog can be found here:\nhttp://1001up.com/2015/12/07/review-armikrog/","December 14, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I just can't recommend it for its relatively high cost, and it's sort of sad because I think the high cost was caused by its art style. It's a claymation art style and it's used extremely effectively and it's very smooth, and that's probably where much of the budget went into instead of being towards the amount of substance. I think that this game's development is one of those rare examples where the quantity of the game ruines the quality of it. It's sad to say this, because I really wanted to like this game since it had so much potential, but it's simply not worth getting.

Unfortunately, that's not the case. Despite how beautiful the claymation aesthetic is (major kudos to the creators on that), I found this game to be very boring. It's quiet (as in, little-to-no sound for most of the game), the environments are very static (excepting the very few things you can pick up/use), and there's very little interaction between the characters. And even though the world seems rich in the trailers, in the game things are very devoid of life, and not in a well-done-lifeless-planet kind of way.\n\nI don't regret backing this game on kickstarter, because I think more games with a unique aesthetic need to hit the marketplace.

The overall concept is great, the character design is great, but the game feels like it was abandoned half-way through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/334120/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I need to preface this review with the fact that I didn’t finish this game, and it’s not because I hated it, far from it; it’s because there are a lot of puzzles in this game that take a while to figure out, and I only received the review copy a day before release. I have a lot of other reviews to write, so unfortunately, I just didn’t have time. I’ll say then, take this review with a huge freaking pinch of salt, and do not base your purchasing decision only on my review. That said, I see no reason to not give it some coverage, and maybe you’ll get a feel for the overall game.\n\nSo the unique, although not entirely unique, draw to the game is the fact it’s a stop-motion point and click adventure. I don’t think I’m wrong in saying it’s been done before, but it’s pretty sweet nonetheless. I liked the visuals in a creepy kind of way, and I think they captured the adventure theme that fits stop-motion so well, pretty nicely.\n\nAs a game it starts to get a little muddier. It’s a point and click adventure, and it’s pretty typical in that way with it really just being about solving puzzles. Though, unlike Broken Age part 1 and the pseudo-point-and-click adventures from Telltale, the puzzles are pretty tough. I never solved any of the more complicated ones, but I’m gonna guess  you’ll need your pen and paper.\n\nI was a little disappointed, honestly, by the voice acting from the main character; his side-kick is pretty good, but I found the voice on the main guy just didn’t really work. It’s also brought down even more by pretty uninteresting dialogue; it was hit and miss for me, there was pretty funny jokes in there, but I found myself groaning a lot too. It’ll really depend on your sense of humour. Aside from that the story seemed pretty unique and I was certainly intrigued as to what was going on. I mean, let’s be honest, the entire premise is bat ♥♥♥♥ insane. You’re like, an astronaut who crash landed and ended up in ruins? Eh, I guess if you boil it down it’s pretty simple.\n\nI also love the cinematics. I went in kinda thinking the whole game was gonna like that but it’s not really. The stop-motion feels relatively not-noticeable outside of the cutscenes, which is a shame. It doesn’t really feel like stop-motion when you're not in a cinematic. Like, a lot of the animations are done like a regular game, 60fps, usual stuff. It’s a shame more of the in-game stuff isn’t in stop-motion (Looking at the "making of" video now, it seems like the majority of the gameplay IS stop-motion, though there are a few animations here and there that just didn't look like it to me.).\n\nI’m not really well versed in point-and-click adventures, but I think hardcore fans will appreciate the real old-school approach to the difficulty of the game.\n\nNow, in terms of my recommendation, I’m not even going to give one. I don’t think I’m in a position to say whether this game is worth it or not due to not finishing it. Treat this review as more of a “focused” kind of first impressions. Though I will officially post it as “recommended” on Steam, because the experience I had was an all round positive one.\n\nIf you’d like to see this review in video form, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PeLUx82_GI","September 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","4"

The "puzzles" were fairly trivial seek & finds. The music was boring, and it lacked much of the character that one sees other claymation. The plot was fine, but more mundane than visuals would suggest.\nOn the plus side, I didn't see any of the bugs that many of the other reviewers experienced. Controls were (mostly) good.

I repeat... Does NOT crash on my PC !!! Yaaay! In fact, my computer is considered ancient and sub-par compared to today's machines, and Armikrog runs absolutely fantastic on the highest visual quality and does NOT skip one bit. However, until all patches are in, you may discover some issues if the game accidentally allows you to play through out of sequence.\n\nUntil game patches are complete, you might want to make sure you stay away from the Emerald Access Panel found in the Emerald Puzzle room (left side of a big glass dome over the final green bar) until Tommy is transported directly into that room on the pad (happens near the end of the game). Gaining access of the panel before you have the key to the panel can cause you to get stuck on that panel and you might have to shutdown the game and restart.\n\nThe characters are cute and funny. The puzzles are worthy of a good brain-tease. The audio and score is unique. The story line is interesting. It has action cutscenes. There's hidden easter-eggs in the game. Everything is great for a point-n-click adventure in clay.\n\nIt also has replay value, because some puzzle variables change with every new game. Plus you can challenge yourself and see how fast you can complete the game again. We use to do the same thing with The Neverhood too. Ha Ha.\n\nThere's only one thing I wish the game had, and that's feedback for the mouse cursor. Right now it's just a custom cursor and you have to click all over the screen to find something you should interact with. On the other hand, this would add an extra level of challenge to the game while NOT knowing exactly what is clickable. But still, it would be nice to see cursor feedback.\n\nArmikrog is awesome! I'm glad I backed it. I'm proud to be part of video game history on this project. The developers did not let me down and actually created something more than what I had in  mind. That in of itself means a lot to me.\n\nI finished it, I liked it, I'm going to play it again... and...

Armikrog is unfortunately similar to Neverhood though, with odd puzzles, mechanical annoyances, and limited content detracting from a unique style and a lighthearted story.\n\nAs with most point-and-click games, the key frustration (not challenge) of this game is context confusion. Despite the absence of the genres "combine inventory items" logic problems, the surreal style of Armikrog and utter absence of contextual dialogue exacerbates the issue of figuring out whether something is not working because you don't have the right thing or because the wrong character is interacting with it. For a specific example, low buttons can ONLY be opened by Beak-beak, rather than by Tommynaut bending over slightly. Combined with the long delays incurred by repeated backtracking and revisiting rooms as you look for potential pickups and clues that may have been overlooked, Armikrog is a perfect storm of point-and-click mechanics problems.\n\nStylistically, the game is innovative. There's no doubt that a lot of attention was paid to claymation and music, although the music often went silent for an oddly long time before starting again later. Still, I can't help but feel all the effort put into the claymation is undercut by the 2d point-and-click interactions, especially since it seems that is what most of the money was probably spent on.\n\nThe story is solid but not especially dramatic. I won't go into specifics, but here's how to make sense of the story for those who are playing (potential SPOILERS):\n- What you see at the start is just the setup to explain why Tommynaut and Beak-beak are there.\n- In the second building, in the room with the statues, is a literal wall of text. That's the deep backstory.\n- The gibberish the Octovators are saying when Beaky interacts with them throughout the game is the recent backstory, and becomes understandable to Tommynaut at the end of the game. You will have to visit each one again to finish the game anyway.\n\nUpon its conclusion, Armikrog left me feeling underwhelmed. Despite a decent story and creative visual style that borders on Seussian, the game is mechanically dull with few real challenges but several frustrations. Maybe if it had released within a few years of The Neverhood, it might have retained some of the same impact. After nearly two decades though, the disjointed logic and backtracking shared by Armikrog and the Neverhood have been largely abandoned by even point-and-click games in favor of deeper stories and relevant puzzles.\n\nBottom line: avoid it unless you REALLY love Doug TenNapel's work and/or point-and-click games.","October 10, 2015","false","7.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omrikon/recommended/334120/","Omrikon","[1n0] FinnSanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omrikon/","328 products in account","5/10: Surreal style and nostalgia can be fun, but with nearly two decades having passed since The Neverhood, the limited content, obtuse logic, and backtracking undermine the impact of this point-and-click game.\n\nAdmittedly I backed this due to the nostalgic memory of enjoying Earthworm Jim, and to a lesser extent the Neverhood. Armikrog is unfortunately similar to Neverhood though, with odd puzzles, mechanical annoyances, and limited content detracting from a unique style and a lighthearted story.\n\nAs with most point-and-click games, the key frustration (not challenge) of this game is context confusion. Despite the absence of the genres "combine inventory items" logic problems, the surreal style of Armikrog and utter absence of contextual dialogue exacerbates the issue of figuring out whether something is not working because you don't have the right thing or because the wrong character is interacting with it. For a specific example, low buttons can ONLY be opened by Beak-beak, rather than by Tommynaut bending over slightly. Combined with the long delays incurred by repeated backtracking and revisiting rooms as you look for potential pickups and clues that may have been overlooked, Armikrog is a perfect storm of point-and-click mechanics problems.\n\nStylistically, the game is innovative. There's no doubt that a lot of attention was paid to claymation and music, although the music often went silent for an oddly long time before starting again later. Still, I can't help but feel all the effort put into the claymation is undercut by the 2d point-and-click interactions, especially since it seems that is what most of the money was probably spent on.\n\nThe story is solid but not especially dramatic. I won't go into specifics, but here's how to make sense of the story for those who are playing (potential SPOILERS):\n- What you see at the start is just the setup to explain why Tommynaut and Beak-beak are there.\n- In the second building, in the room with the statues, is a literal wall of text. That's the deep backstory.\n- The gibberish the Octovators are saying when Beaky interacts with them throughout the game is the recent backstory, and becomes understandable to Tommynaut at the end of the game. You will have to visit each one again to finish the game anyway.\n\nUpon its conclusion, Armikrog left me feeling underwhelmed. Despite a decent story and creative visual style that borders on Seussian, the game is mechanically dull with few real challenges but several frustrations. Maybe if it had released within a few years of The Neverhood, it might have retained some of the same impact. After nearly two decades though, the disjointed logic and backtracking shared by Armikrog and the Neverhood have been largely abandoned by even point-and-click games in favor of deeper stories and relevant puzzles.\n\nBottom line: avoid it unless you REALLY love Doug TenNapel's work and/or point-and-click games.","October 10, 2015","false","7.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You will have to solve another kind of puzzle, which is navigating your way around game breaking bugs.\n\nSave often because you will load at least twice because you can and will get stuck with no way to continue. That is, if you aren't playing on a 4:3 screen because then it's impossible to pass some screens at all.\n\nYou will also have to ignore pre-alpha quality of the game engine: animations not working, dialogs not audible, subtitles appearing when no one is speaking, but not shown when there's speech, certain hot spots randomly not working so you need to leave a room and come back, stuff like that.\n\nThe game was released over a year past schedule, by putting together scraps and gluing them together. You will notice dialog was just test sounds sent in by various people and they never re-recorded in a studio. You will see a missing box monster being stretched. If you've watched trailers, you will notice several rooms didn't make it to the game, as well as at least two cutscenes.\n\nSo the game puts you in a whacky place but is never funny after intro+first room (which was done before kickstarter campaign, before actual team was assembled and killed the mood). So the puzzles are easy but recycled to the point of not just boring but irritating you. So the game takes 2 hours if you've played point-and-click adventures before.

The cursor doesn't change to show you where you can click and some of the puzzles have no ryhme or reason to them. I thought Armikrog could at least keep me occupied for ten or so hours, but it turned out to only last a mere 5 hours for my first playthrough, and apparently other people beat it even quicker.

Admittedly, the release is not without many glitches, some of which I can understand, some of which I cannot fathom how a programmer can miss; but if you're looking to scratch your head for a few hours, then Armikrog is worth the money.\n\nI do have a few criticisms for the developers:\n\nThe puzzles are repetitive and many lack ingenuity. For example, to enter one of the first doors in the game, you must solve a simple slider puzzle. Eventually, you encounter two more doors where the slider puzzle is the key, each one having some additional tricks to confuse you, but it's still the same concept. Similar with the baby mobile game - the audio and sequences to match get a bit tricky, but it's still the same puzzle over and over. And then there's the sliding block monster puzzles...\n\nThe puzzles are intuitive, but the exploration is not. There was no outstanding visual clue that I needed to speak to the Octopi while playing BeakBeak in order for me to progress - this in turn made me struggle to power the generator to activate the lift to find the final glyph for one of the first puzzles. It also took me longer than I'd like to admit to even realize that the first Octopus lift was multi-leveled. Later on, when you feed BeakBeak a bug that allows him to fly, it's not clear that you have to click above him to get him to sprout wings first. In the same area, there's no visual clue showing that you have to click on the background etching in the wall (and not the button next to it) for you to move forward.\n\nGlitches and frustrations galore - you can enter doors without solving the slider puzzles (again, a simple programming mistake). The railcars will always bounce on a switch, which makes traveling to another screen frustrating. Sometimes the audio will cut out after a cutscene. Sometimes you cannot pick up the octopus drop if you leave the screen and then come back for it.\n\nLastly, the character development could be improved immensely. When I played The Neverhood, I listened to snippets of Willy's story throughout the adventure and, although never interacting with him, I grew fond for the character. Klayman in the neverhood was a silent protagonist with childhood curiosity, which made him relatable when you're exploring a world you know nothing about. Tommynaut's and BeakBeak's personalities do not fit for an adventure-game, and their stoic behavior makes it difficult to feel a personal connection with the characters.\n\nRegardless of the negativity of the above comments, Armikrog is a place I enjoyed exploring, and definitely hope to see more from this studio in the future!","October 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some of them are straight-up annoying (I'm mainly referring to the lullaby puzzles) and just detract from the game's flow.\n\nI enjoyed the claymation animations, though during the sequences where you use the tentacles to move vertically, I hoped for an actual animation and not just a photoshop-like shift.\n\nFor a ~3 hour game (likely +1 hour if you decide to read the giant wall of history text), I felt like they could've simply used a modern save screen rather than the DOS-esque one. I understand that The Neverhood came out in the 90s, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't update your interface.\n(By "modern save screen" I mean a 3-save-slots type interface)\n\nFinally, there needs to be more information given to the player during the game. I don't mean clues or hints to puzzles, I mean something like changing the cursor icon when hovering over something with which can be interacted (ex. there is no indication that you can talk to the tentacle monster as Beak-Beak), nor an indicator for when you CAN interact something, but not YET (ex. the generators, it's clear that Tommynaut needs to do SOMETHING, but I know I'm not the only one who clicked all over the first one wondering if it was actually an object or just something in the background). A headscratch animation or similar could have been used to solve this problem.\n\nThe game has its roots in the 90s, and it's nice to see a throwback to those times. However, games have evolved and improved since then (not just in the technical sense, but in how information is given to the player through its interface). Unfortunately, a lack of this improvement, the bugs, and its short length make it very difficult to justify its $25 price tag.","October 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played the neverhood as a child and it was an amazing game and I am utterly disapointed by this huge let down. First of all, the gameplay is the most repetativ ♥♥♥♥ ever. You litterally do the same thing ovver 3 times and each time you think your game is broken because the cutscenes are in Freench. It is not only until the end where you will get a lever that will change it to english. However, if you miss this lever, like I had, the game will softlock itself. I spent more time fixing that bug than playing the game.\n\nWith this negative review I am not saying the puzzle genre is dead or even a claymation stop motion type game isn't going to be able to be sucessful.

Not only the game is half-baked, there hardly is any "game" there at all...\n\nThe product is very cheap-looking: tons of bugs, minimum of animations, minimum of voiceovers, minimum of characters... Well, really there is a bare minumum of everything except for the clay. Gosh, the didn't even bothered to come up with a game-themed cursor for the initial release. Yet I think the lowest point here is that some objects were obviously resized in the graphical editor without respect to their proportions. Knowing that this game has raised ~$1M on Kikctarter, this attitude of the development team towards the quality of their product is beyond explainable.\n\nWhat's worse is that the game that could be easily completed in 4 hours drowns in self-repetition. The game consists of the four towers offering the different flavors of the same run of the mill puzzles. Most of the time in the game you just push the boxes and ride the cable cars & giant tentacles. And also write down some symbols on the list of paper along the way.\n\nThe original Neverhood had some great humour, an amazing atmospere and was challenging to beat. The "spiritual successor" has none of this qualities. (Or have I gotten 20 years older?).\n\nI wish I could find something positive but I hardly can. Perhaps, the only cool thing in this game is the opening cutscene with the crash-landing that was shown during the Kickstarter campaign. The rest is just horrible.\n\nThis is a disappointing game. And the feeling of disappointment only gets sharper for a Kikcstarter backer who had to double up his pledge to make sure this game happens. Now I feel sorry for letting this mockery of the classic game see the light of day.","October 27, 2015","false","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Is this button something you can't interact with? A button that's locked for now to be unlocked later? Nope. You just need your dog to click it with his tail. Really? My dumb dog can press that button with his tail but I can't bend down and press it?\n\nMaking it so that both characters could press the button would have been more realistic and if there is a situation where one character has to press a button while the other manipulates something, let me figure out that by having the wrong person press it, seeing the change in the world and what needs to happen, and adjusting accordingly.\n\nIn the end, it feels like they massively underestimated the cost and time required to produce this game. I feel that they intended to release something much grander but ran out of time and money.\n\nIf you are an absolute claymation or point-and-click fan, pick it up when it is on sale. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.\n\nOne last comment: I didn't have any of the technical issues that some other users have reported, on the current version of the game.","January 4","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But I really, really can't forgive that they cheaped way out on visuals and feeling.\nOn itself it might have been fine, but sadly we were promised a game in the spirit of the Neverhood, which this so obviously is not. But even as a basic adventure time game it's pretty 'meh'.\nThe entire game is in the trailer (which is heartbreakingly deceiving).\n\nAt the start I felt excited to exlpore this new world. Sadly after literally 1 minute of intro, you'll be stuck with approx. 2 hours of walking around in half-animated, barely filled 1-colour rooms with no dialogue.  That's the game. Walking from the same room to the same room to do the exact same puzzles.\nOn top of that it seems that the only reason the main character(s) can talk is so they wouldn't have to animate their emotions. The characters have close to no personal traits (yet clayman did, without talking. Funny huh?), and the 'world' feel frustratingly small.\n\nDo you remember those "oh wow!" "haha" "that's cool!" feelings with the Neverhood? Or how sad you felt for robot bill? Or how well written the story on those tapes was? The excitement of finding a new one? You will find none of that in this game.\n\nI did still, in all fairness, enjoy the claymation and the art style a lot (although this is hard to find, considering 3/4 is regular animation or random plasic props). I read the bad reviews and I still bought it, and I don't regret buying it (though the price should have been 10 dollars).\n\nTo summarise: this is a 2/3 hour game that feels wáy too long to complete. That says all in my opinion.","March 8","false","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I will say that I am not as impressed as I thought I would be. There seem to be some elements of the game which feel unpolished and at times kind of stupid. Most of the story was good but they did a rather rough job telling the story of the game. Also having to go back through and re watch some of the videos because the seemed to be in a different language. I thought maybe I somehow defaulted the game sound to Dutch or something. Subtitles did not work at those times. Also almost after every video clip there would be issues with certain things not producing sound until I would exit out of the game and re enter it. I feel this game could have been a lot...and I mean a lot better if they in a sense gone over it a few more times. The robot at the end was extremely stupid and corny in the end. There are even elements to the story that were not explained. For example they brought in elements of the Neverhood "Life Seeds" sound effects to revive Beak Beak at the end but did not show the seed and he appeared as a ghost like figure. Over all I would say its a great start but far far far from the original Neverhood. It took me weeks to beat the Neverhood.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apierzch/recommended/334120/","apierzch","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apierzch/","88 products in account","It's hard for me to give negative review for this game, as I was really hyped for it and I'm a big fan of Neverhood. I even backed it up on Kickstarter, this is how I believed that it would be spiritual successor to the Neverhood. However, there is a big gap between them.\n\nTL;DR Game doesn't live up to modern game standards, it doesn't even live up to the Neverhood. It's buggy, shallow and short. When bugs are fixed and it's on sale 75%, buy it. It's good, just not for this money.\n\n1. Quality\nOn the release date there is a lot of bugs. I was lucky most of them didn't happened to me, but still I got some. I had sound turn off partially (I heard only background music) for no reason, which made me restart the game. I had small animation glitches here and there. Some areas (like big green button in first section of the game) had poorly made clickable area, I always have to try multiple times before game understands I want to click this button. Cursor is plain system cursor, if you played the Neverhood, you would expect something better than this.\n\nI've seen other people having more serious glitches, like character not being able to go to certain areas, or missing menu labels (seriously?!), or being able to get to area you should not be able to reach and getting stuck there. I still believe those bugs will be fixed in near future, but for now, you might get stuck because of that.\n\nSpeaking of quality - why on earth would you put save/load in "options" instead of main menu?\n\n2. Graphics\nWell, we have here a stop-motion game, so we don't have much control to graphics settings. However, I would expect characters to move their mouths when saying something in-game, they only do it in cutscenes. Speaking of cutscenes, they are in quite low resolution. I'm playing in 1080, and it looked like no more than 720.\n\n3. Music\nI've heard Terry S. Taylor (who wrote music for the Neverhood) was making music for it, they even released a sample of it during Kickstarter campain, and I loved it. The sad thing is that I never got to hear that sample in the game, and the music doesn't have the style and humour of it. And it's nowhere near the Neverhood style. I'm simply dissappointed.\n\n4. Plot & world\nI think it's the worst part of this game. The plot is very shallow. The villain's motives are not explained, his story of becoming evil is not as well. It just looks as if they didn't have enough time to think of his story. Also, if you expect level of humour of the Neverhood and as interesting plot, you will be dissapointed.\n\nThe world is small, and you never get to see it from bigger perspective. You see some rooms, sometimes bigger structures from distance, but you don't get to see the world you are in. There are creatures that tell you story of the world (*mini spoiler ahead*) , but you don't get to understand them until very end. The world is also very empty. There are birds, creatures on wheels and one big monster. That's it. And you don't get to see the monster once you get out of the very first room.\n\nBTW, for the Neverhood fans, I think the first room is the only one where you can look through window several times. It's so dissapointing - they created it for campain and never reused the concept that was so common in the Neverhood.\n\n5. Puzzles\nThey are hard. And in most cases, well-done-hard. I don't want to say more, no to spoil, but in most cases puzzles live up to the Neverhood standards. However, there are three puzzles that are very poorly designed (don't worry, no spoilers yet). One is a puzzle that basicly tells you:\n- you're not allowed to move anywhere, you have to solve me now\n- ok, let's save\n- no :). I won't let you even open menu\n- WHAT?!\nAnother one is just too cryptic. NOTHING in the game tells you what you should click, and I've seen many gameplays where they discovered it just by clicking literally everything on screen. I had to check that one on reddit after hour of being stuck.\nThe last one is a puzzle that requires hint/information from location that is no longer accessible. Why on earth would someone design it that way? You make people load earlier save game if they missed it, or if they didn't save, they have to start all over after buying new monitor, because they threw previous one through window. *SPOILER AHEAD* When you're in room where you hear 4 words, and after using lever they change to english, write english words down. You will need them.\n\nOverall, as I said in TL;DR: the game is good, and when bugs are fixed and it's on sale, it will be worth buying. But not now, not for this price. And don't expect second Neverhood. It's just... similar. But it's not successor.","October 1, 2015","false","7.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

So now after a few years after I backed this project on kickstarer it finally came out and I finally played it. Well, what can I say, I had a blast, some of the puzzles were a bit repetitive but the feel of nostalgia and the great soundtrack simply made my day, I beat the game in two sittings today and it was just great. Lately I haven't played much adventure games because they aren't that good nowadays, I enjoy simple adventures and armikrog. is an adventure game exactly for me, but don't be fooled some of the puzzles require quite a lot of thinking and a lot of backtracking if you aren't the type that takes notes of every little symbol and the area it was in. The game is great though, but I have to say it didn't surpass the neverhood for a few reasons, one of these reasons are the already mentioned repetitive puzzles and some of the bugs I came across, like some of the areas not unlocking if you solved the puzzle or the sound cutting off and so on. Overall I would say it was a decent bang for a buck, I backed the game for 20 dollars so I only got a digital copy but Iam satisfied, the developers delivered what they promised, the lenght is not an issue for me but I would like a little more of those sweet and funny cutscenes. Maybe next time. Thanks Ed, Mike and Doug for everything and mainly for the great games that are The Neverhood and Armikrog. !

However, this review has nothing to do with it. I want to reflect on how the actual game felt, what it was like and whether it was enjoyable (bugs aside). Here’s a brief summary:\n\nPros:\n- Beautifully crafted game with its unique style of animation and “clay feel”.\n\nCons:\n- The game is very linear and short;\n- “Adventuring” through the game follows a boring pattern;\n- Almost no puzzle variety;\n- Puzzles feel completely repetitive – same ones are being used over and over again with slightly increased difficulty.\n\nI am a Neverhood fan. When I stumbled on Armikrog by a complete accident – I can’t tell you how thrilled I was. Needless to say, I was watching the game as it was getting closer to release and grabbed a copy as soon as it was available. I never imagined myself to be in this position and say this – but I regret this purchase.\n\nAfter much wait, hype and anticipation – now that I finished it all I can say about this game is that it turned out to be a disappointment. As much as I wanted and mentally pushed myself to enjoy it (and it did make me smile and marvel at the fantastic style of the game a few times) – I just couldn’t.\n\nThe game simply felt boring. It’s very linear. Once you finish an area, you hop on a transport and move on to the next, where you are presented with an entry puzzle. Once you’re done with that and the area, you are presented with an exit puzzle – and you move on in the same fashion. Only to experience THE SAME challenges again (just a slightly more difficult versions) in the next zone. There are some puzzles that are unique and fun (as you need to gather and keep track of the clues), but overall you can’t help but feel let down.\n\nThe whole game you just follow a boring pattern and keep doing the same things over and over again, with the only highlight being an environment around you.\n\nI thank the artists for making the game as any Neverhood fan would expect it to be and look like, but the progression and puzzles complety ruin the whole experience. This game could've been much more in my opinion, and it saddens me to say that.\n\nDon’t want to sound negative and you should experience everything for yourself and form your own opinion, but I would not recommend this game.","October 2, 2015","false","6.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Save/load in the options menu? Who the hell designed this?  First and only Kickstarter disappointment so far. I would say I got, maybe, 5 dollars of enjoyment out of this, but that would be stretching it. The worst part is how clear it is that the potential for this to be a quality game is beneath the surface lacking the effort and polish necessary to make it something actually good.\n\nAnd the audio recordings, wtf is up with the voices, they sound like they were recorded in a metal barrel thats been chucked down a ravine, muddy and total trash, I do amateur recordings with <200 dollar setups which are higher quality, seriously low budget sounded.\n\nSo many ♥♥♥♥ poor decisions, no inventory you just pick up an item and mash around randomly, with no signifier to tell you what you can and can't click on, no dialogue or clue when you click on something you can, can't, or can't yet interact with, and no idea whether its a static object or an actual part of the game/puzzle.  Most puzzle games require you to figure out what goes where, not this one, you just shove objects into your invisible inventory and click on the surrounding enviroment until the character picks out the proper piece for the puzzle and shoves it in, hardly puzzling.  And the baby puzzle was enough to make me stop playing, seriously the only Puzzle that I found moderately challenging was challenging for no good reason, was poorly designed, and tedious as hell requiring you to listen to a slowly repeating loop while a baby's cries permeate the game's sounds boring into my soul until I exited as quickly as I could. Its the kind of puzzle I would put up as a prime example of what not to do in a puzzle game.  Everything is pitifully sparse, like they forgot to fill out the game with interesting and exciting details.  No observations provided by the characters of the surrounding enviroment either, the whole atmosphere creates the sensation that the character you are playing is flailing through a boring empty void with the occasional smattering of humor and badly designed puzzles.  Seriously tragic, would requestion a refund if I hadn't Kickstarted it.\n\nPeople should do themselves a favor and play one of the myriad adventure games that people made for a fraction of the money with many times the quality, check out Machinarium or The Dream Machine (for better quality claymation at a fraction of the budget.)\n\nedit: A few pro's are there, some moderately humorous moments, and creative animation/design every once in a while (seriously some of the design made me smile and made the tragic piece of trash this game is even more upsetting) as well as a really rockingly good intro leading that got me so hyped to get started on the adventure.","October 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

A spiritual successor to Neverhood, the game of my childhood? Hell yeah!

It's inferior to Neverhood in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.\nIn Neverhood you are exploring a world. In Armikrog, you're exploring a building...\nDid I say exploring? Not really, you're just solving a puzzle after puzzle so you can solve another puzzle.\nArmikrog is shorter and smaller, but recycles more assets than Neverhood (barnacles, the slider puzzle, those orange cube creatures, generator, then cart passage in each of the areas - you're basically doing the same thing 3 times)\nThe Neverhood protagonist doesn't speak, yet somehow manages to display more emotion than both protagonists with voices together...\nSomehow Armikrog manages to be inferior even from a technical standpoint, released with many bugs and oversights (after 2 delays for just bugfixing).\nLittle things like the cursor made from clay, or the amazing Neverhood intro animation are missing as well.\n\nThe puzzles (other than the one where you can't get back to the area where you're supposed to find solution - what's up with that?), claymation and music (when it works) are alrigh. That's about it. That's not enough to make me recommend something that had so much potential and wasted it. Buy it only if you've never played Neverhood  AND it's at least 50% off.","October 2, 2015","false","7.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The Game gives the illusion that it is going somewhere, and you even think, "Nah it's slow and repetitive because it is building up to something awesome, just like any good 90's game," then after an array of bugs, disappointed, receptiveness and poorly built gameplay, you get the most bland and anticlimactic ending ever, that doesn't even suit how the characters were being built up. The wall of text in the game similar to never hood gives you the feeling that the characters in the game could be much deeper than this, but neither the main character, his side kick, or the villain are properly explained in any way.\n\nThe ending of the game just left me frowning.. after I was willing to give it a 6/10 in my mind because I DID enjoy the process of solving the puzzles, the super annoying badly done ending that looks like it was done super-fast just to wrap up the game and put it in the market made me immediately want to give it 2/10\n\nI am very sad that this was the result of this kickstarter. I wish they postponed it for another year instead of release this.\n\nWhat makes me even more sad that the updates from the game development team are only about the bug fixes and they are not acknowledging that the game is broken. They keep saying "We are happy you are enjoying the game" Although the hard core fans of the game did not enjoy the game\n\nWould not recommend unless it is on sale for 2$\n\nTo be fair though.. Some of the music is stuck in my head and has been playing since yesterday, and I ended up making fan art inspired by the game right after finishing it.

I really enjoyed all the characters. The characters were very expressive, silly and lovable just like previous games (Neverhood and Earthworm Jim). Now I'm more or less going to recommend and defend this game. Puzzle point-and-click adventure games in general are not too long. It's just their make up. Personally, some of the puzzles were fun, and some were confusing (just overlooking some things which made me not understand the puzzle) This game's design is not without flaws of course, but the sheer heart and soul that went into this game is breath-taking!\n\nNow before people get all bent out of shape and start saying "Oh it's too short for how long we had to wait," feeling self-entitlted much? Do you have any idea how long stop-motion animation takes and with how small of a team Pencil Test Studios is? Some of those movie sequences could have taken MONTHS to make. The animation quality that Mike Dietz and Ed Schofield put into this game are incredible. Plus you guys are forgetting that like The Neverhood Chronicles, everything was hand-made with clay. Every room you stand in in the game was made with clay. In my opinion though, I'd say for the game's context, it wasn't too short, we had a good prologue, then a conflict, and then an ending. That's the basic principles for a good story, beginning, middle and end. Also you can read up on some of Armikrog's history on the wall if you don't understand the back-story for Armikrog, and thank God it isn't about 15 screens of writing this time!\n\nNow I'll talk a bit about the game's design and a bit about the plot:\nIn the game Armikrog, you play as two characters side-by-side; TommyNaut and Beak-Beak. TommyNaut is the main protagonist of the story that sort of has a hero-complex and wants to be like his older brothers. Beak-Beak is his best friend and is like a drinking buddy (if you guys have one of those, you'll understand his character). You're stuck in a fortress called Armikrog and have come to realize, a lot of events has happened in this place. I won't spoil the game, so you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nI'm sure you all have come to a cross-road where you are really stuck and have no earthly idea what to do. You've clicked everywhere on the screen, you've visited the hint statue more than once, and still no results. This game does not want to hold your hand while you play it. It wants to make you think and explore. Just like The Neverhood, only Neverhood gave you no auditory hints. If you wanted hints, you'd have to visit your mail box and see what Willie wrote you (Which I might add is at the very beginning of the game, that's a lot of backtracking)! I noticed as well that Pencil Test Stuidos designed the game in mind so that you didn't have to backtrack as much as The Neverhood (thank you)! I will agree that some hints didn't really help me, but after looking around the environment, I eventually figured it out. My advice, every symbol you see, screenshot it, it could come in handy. Some times the hints are too cryptic/ambiguous to understand, just look around the environment  to understand. Some things you may have missed might be right under your nose. Look dilligently through the rooms and use process of elimination when you aren't sure what to do!\n\nSo I guess my verdict, the game is definitely worth checking out! But if you want to wait till all the minor and major bugs are fixed, I wouldn't hold it against you. Just remember guys, minor and major bugs are already being resolved by Pencil Test Studios.","October 1, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I don't want to give Armikrog a negative review. Then again, I pretty much have to. Bear with me a moment, what follows are the ramblings of a very conflicted soul.\n\nI'll start by saying that I really enjoyed the game. It kept me entertained and brought back some lovely memories of a little tiny me trying to wrap my head around the Neverhood. The puzzles were challenging, and definitely of the "bizarre adventure game logic" variety, but that's exactly what I expected, and exactly what I wanted.\n\nWhy the negative review, then? Well, I did enjoy the game for its entire duration... all four hours of it. Given how much the game sells for, and how much it was hyped up to be during the Kickstarter campaign that brought it to life, that's quite a lot less than I expected. To be blunt, I would have been happy with 12 hours. The puzzle and room design feels much more repetitive than that of the Neverhood.\n\nIt kind of feels like a game that was dropped halfway through development. The storyline doesn't seem to really end, or at least it ends too abruptly to really sink in.\n\nIf you're a die-hard Neverhood fan who really wants some more, do buy this game. You'll enjoy it, much as I did. However, please bear in mind that you'll be buying something that may well leave you asking for more. And you're probably not getting that second helping anytime soon.","September 30, 2015","false","4.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The Neverhood was pretty boring to play, and I wasn't really into it.  However, I was interested in seeing what that original team could do with new game mechanics and graphics, so I wondered how this game would be.\n\nThis game is not very good.  The number one thing I was interested in was the story.  The story is thin and boring.  It's not conveyed very well, and it's not that interesting.  And this game is SHORT!  Granted a short cheap game is ok, but I didn't expect it to wrap up so quick.  Also, there's a significant amount of back tracking, and that involves you getting in a trolley system thing and manually going backwards which is really boring.\n\nWhen I played this game it was also pretty glitchy, though I don't know if they patched that.  Often the sound would unsynch from the game, or I would glitch through a door without solving the puzzle.\n\nThe graphics are ok but lame.  They're clay and I expected them to be more ornate, more complex, more beautiful even - I really expected the team to try to push the envelope on 'clay graphics' for lack of a better term.  They're the only ones doing it, so go big!  But they didn't.  They were pretty simple, very Neverhood looking - which I didn't think was that great either.\n\nFinally, a moment of slight spoilers - there is a room with a LONG written story on the wall.  I have no idea what that was about because I couldn't force myself to read it.  However, it's poor form to shoehorn a major story element into a game via a short novel length chunk of text.  Show, don't tell!\n\nSo in short, meh graphics, bad story, boring gameplay, overall a let down.","January 31","false","4.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Rather than challenging your mind these puzzles seek to waste your time by having no critical thinking, but instead just bases quite a few of these puzzles on chance or by making the player backtrack in order to see if some action affected the map at all. If you decide to still buy this game i would recommend keeping a camera handy due to the fact that quite a few of the puzzles I've encountered require constructing images with a huge UI in the way of the subject.\n\nIn addition to that I have seen a few pieces of the game that scream lazy such as a moving block that is enlarged, but rather than remodeling the block or giving it its own model they took the smaller variant and stretched it. Similar to taking a picture, putting it in microsoft paint, and stretching it vertically thus distorting the quality and making the image seem very blurry. Theres quite a few other bugs and in my opinion i wish the game were delayed slightly more so i could enjoy the feel of the game without the sound cutting out or bugs that required me to restart my client.\n\nThis is my first review of a game so i hope this helps some deciding whether or not to buy this.\n\nP.S.

The only bit that amused me in the end was that when you put in the crystals you could move them around anywhere and i just thought of tommynaut looking like a complete ♥♥♥♥up.\nThe only reason P. was in the game was to give those p-tonium pieces and to give you a pain in the ♥♥♥ during its puzzles.\nOverall im pretty dissapointed , the music is great but it probably could've been way better.","October 1, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hello! Me - Willy. Me - Willy Trombone...\n\nOr something along those lines.\nAfter reading all the negative reviews comparing Armikrog to The Neverhood I can't help but wonder - when did you guys last play The Neverhood? Because it seems to me that you people are not basing your comparisons on the actual game, but, rather, on your fond memory of the original game. I\'m not going to delve into subjective things like quality of atmosphere, immersiveness of story, originality of character design and such. Here is a hard cold fact - The Neverhood and Armikrog are about the same length. Just check the let\'s plays and see for yourself.\n\nDoes Armikrog still have bugs? Yeah. But they are not game-breaking.\nWas the voice-acting overhyped? Pretty much. But it does its job of conveying the story and shaping the characters.\nAre the puzzles redundant and repetetive? Kind of. But The Neverhood had a memory game and a sliding puzzle. And don\'t even get me started on that corridor.\n\nArmikrog is still an original, engaging and fun experience. It is not a second Neverhood, as it does some things differently, but, hey, who would want two identical games, right?","May 31","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
