"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/recommended/432380/","steric400","Ryan Dorkoski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/","767 products in account","Thank you to the developer for generously supplying me with a review key.\n---\n\nFor anyone who likes classic roguelike games with fresh new mechanics, Hydra Slayer is a must-have.\n\nThis game is highly addictive; while it is completely its own original thing, it has hints of the Desktop Dungeons playstyle/strategy mixed in there. With that being said, it isn't nearly as frustrating or pure-coffee-break game as Desktop Dungeons.\n\nEssentially, the game plays as a straightforward roguelike dungeon crawler with the interesting mechanic of how the combat plays out. A great majority of the enemies are hydras with varying number of heads. The weapons you wield can kill or stun a certain number of heads, therefore making it a bit of a math puzzle in how you go about taking down the hydras on every level. Once you kill all the hydras on a level, you progress. There are no shops. Items are found scattered throughout the levels in a mostly pre-determined fashion. It all works very well.\n\nOne thing I want to stress, is that while knowledge of elementary mathematics is a substantial part of solving the hydra puzzles, this isn't inherently some kind of educational math game. Once you learn the system and know where to look, the game does alot of the math for you. If you absolutely hate adding a few numbers in your head, I'd probably stay away, but otherwise don't let the 'math' portion of this scare you away.\n\nPros:\n+Brilliantly fresh new mechanic for a roguelike. It all works so well.\n+I love games (specifically roguelikes) that truly reward learning the system. The kind of thing where a newbie has < 5% chance to succeed, while a veteran who understands the nuances has >90%. This game truly does this, and does it well. As time goes on, I can easily get to higher/deeper levels. There are no meta-game unlocks either.\n+The playable classes are all brilliantly thought out, and vastly different. I could go on and on about this point, but simply explore that for yourself!\n+I play a lot of roguelikes, and the items in this game are far more functional and really fun to use compared with most other roguelikes. Nothing feels redundant or wasteful with the item functionality.\n+Keyboard controls are super smooth, as should be for any classic rougelike.\n+There is like three or so majorly different layouts you can choose from. Ranging from a hex-grid to isometric, and more.\n+The Steam achievements are very appropriate, and will have you coming back for dozens of hours, if not more.\n\nCons:\n-Music and sound could be better. I mean they are ok, but really what you are getting here is a hugely addictive gaming mechanic.\n-Artwork is ok as well, but I would love to see some wicked pixel art tiles!\n-As with ADOM, the engine can give some slowdown, but it is fairly manageable. There are alot of settings on NotEye, so maybe I just haven't found the sweet spot yet.\n-I'm hoping a community-backed Wiki pops up! Or at least some detailed Steam guides woud be great. Its not a 'con' of the game, but something I'm putting out there! I will try to make a guide after I have more hours under my belt (I am at about 15 total so far).\n\nThis is brilliantly done, and highly addictive. Y'know if you are on the fence you can try the game for free by downloading it from the developer's website, but I assure you it has earned its asking price. This is a no-brainer for any lover of the classic roguelike.\n","March 24","true","13.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","4"

Killing Hydras.  Hydras are large snake like creatures, killing them requires cutting off their heads..  The game has various weapons and magics, each weapon can remove a certain number of hydra heads, the task is to eventually widdle the head number down to zero, using math to figure out the correct weapon or magic to use.  It qualifies as a rogue like game but onw in your typical go into dungeon, slash up enemies, and collect up items.  This game has enemies, and items but the math aspect makes the game unique.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone, the math and different weapons aspect seems to be both cliche and unique.  I personally found the game to be rather exciting to play, it came across as a roguelike, but had some puzzle elements, and the added math problems made it challenging enough to last for numerous hours.\n\nThe graphics are kind of minimal, but they really aren't needed to enjoy the game.\n\npro's\nChallenging game play\ninteresting take on rogue like\nold school game play\nmany weapons to choose from\nmultiple races to pick from\n\ncon's\nmusic could be a bit better\nThe math aspect was ok, but really could have been ditched\n\nConclusion\nA fun retro old school game which will offer any rogue like fan quite a few hours of fun and adventure.  Can you become the hero and slay the hydra, save the princess, reap the gold and set yourself apart from all the pretenders..","April 9","true","4.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

If you are a mathematician, programmer, roguelike fan or just a nerd, most likely, this game is for you. Otherwise... Anyway, if you're not outright scared with the concept of killing ancient beasts with the power of math, you should give it a try.\n\nYou can start with the free version[www.roguetemple.com].  Keep in mind, though, that free version lacks some recent and/or steam-specific features.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my poor, google-powered English.\nP.P.S. This is my very first review. Yes, that game is awesome enough to make me do it.","April 8","true","77.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Different race options provide new interesting ways to play and there's a daily challenge mode. All in all there seems to be enough longevity here and the price is good.","March 24","true","2.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

While playing it you need to answer 2 questions: how to kill this hydra with your current weapon and which sword take with you further. It also has a lot of achievements (for those, who like achievements) and is a good training in arithmetic and strategy.\nMaybe if I have children I'll teach them maths with the help of this game =)","April 10","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
