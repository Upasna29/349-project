The overly simplistic HOMAM-like combat is the only additional thing this game has going for it, but it still has that rotten, annoying system where you have to constantly click to gather stuff to progress, and it gets tedious fast.\n\nUnlike other games from this genre, nothing gets collected when you're not playing, so it's required that you waste your time clicking a lot. It seems like the game has decent amount of content, but focus of the game is tedious clicking and micro-managing same things again and again, monotonous without any challenge or possibility to automate things. It's just not worth your time, let alone your money.\n\nBTW: The game is not a resource management simulator, because there would have to be some resource management to begin with. You just click, and numbers raise, you control everything. If you don't have enough resources, you just click some more. That's all there is to it. It has nothing to do with actual building strategies involving resource management like Anno or Caesar.","May 28","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even some of the music is the same! You do collect resources, but you get to choose things like how many huts, mines etc., to build, where to place them etc. There is no frantic clicking, as this game is very relaxed and you can play at your own pace. I wish there were more games like this available.","May 27","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
