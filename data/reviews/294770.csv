Just buy the cheap bundle and try it out!\n\nIf you are playing on windows 7, THERE WILL BE game crashing bugs. BUT there is a solution!\n\nDownload Hgm_Soundfix here:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/downloads/haegemonia-legions-of-iron-sound-system-fix\n\n-> Go to steam/steamapps/common/Haegemonia Legends of Iron, backup your hgm.exe and\npaste in the hgm.exe you downloaded\n\n-> Put compatibility for windows xp service pack 3 and administrator rights. (Rightclick on the new hgm.exe)\n\nDownload Haegemonia v1.10 [GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image from here: {LINK REMOVED}http://www.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.com/games/pc_haegemonia.shtml\n\nFor the next step, you need the program daemon tools. You can download it here :\nhttp://www.chip.de/downloads/c1_downloads_auswahl_37592209.html?t=1399294859&v=3600&s=cc2dfe68dc013a85111c74a3bbbc71fd\n\n-> Extract the files you downloaded and mount the Iso in daemon tools.\n\nThen just start the game, it works perfectly fine!\nP.s. Maybe the game asks for a key, just search one online, they are easy to find.","May 5, 2014","true","24.5"," 198 of 222 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","198","222","3","2"

I have loved it ever since it came out in 2002. Yes it's an older game. Yes it has bugs. But these can be worked around with a simple amount of research (like the sound error that some people get). And no it does not have widescreen support. You'll have to enjoy the game with either the black borders or a stretched image, depending on your computer's settings. Is it inconvenient? Yes. Is it game breaking? not in the slightest.\n\nFor a 2002 game, the game play is great, and the graphics are great (for a game of its era) and the explosions are great even for modern day games.\n\nIt's easy to get frustrated when you fail a mission, many people haven't quite gotten an understanding for the game yet and blame their mission failure on bugs. I've beaten the GOG version several times and I will surely play through the steam version just as many times. The replayability of this game is endless to me.\n\nThis is not a short game to play through, many missions will take hours to complete. You start out in the Earth-Mars war, you even get to choose who's side you want to fight for. These missions are introductory missions, teaching you how to play the game, planetary management, and research, and the levels get progressively harder as you go. In some missions, money management is absolutely CRUCIAL.\n\nBattles can be quite intense at times and definitely fun to watch.\n\nIf you enjoy Space RTS games, this is definitely the best. Yes it's old, but its fun, very fun and a must have. Just make sure if you get errors, you look for the fix before rageposting about how "bad" of a game it is.\n\nOh and, in the first missions, make sure to press the F1 key (it will inform you of this) as all the information for controls you need will be listed there","May 4, 2014","true","22.1"," 90 of 100 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","90","100","0","0"

It's such a Beautiful, and Amazing game I'm so glad I purchased it!","July 16, 2014","true","27.1"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

It was just as fun as when i originally bought it on disk, and that was almost ten years ago.  This is definitely one of the more refined games out there, and for not even being an RTS player, I found this very enjoyable.  Also, the graphics for this game were, at the time of its release, were ahead of curve.  Space is absolutely beautiful and the planets are very detailed.  I highly recommend this game to just about anyone, but specifically RTS and space-opera fans.","November 1, 2014","true","0.3"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

Sound errors and no widescreen support.\nI thought this deserves a new thread. The game's sound issues haven't been fixed and I get this problem continously on Win 7 x64 (about 4 or 5 missions in, when you first get access to wormholes). Play for a few minutes and bam, crash to the desktop.\n\nThere's no widescreen support, so enjoy playing at 1024x768 or 1280x960.\n\nI'd also like to add that I bought this game when it came out on disc back in 2002 or whenever it came out. It's a fantastic game and I love it to this day. I just wish there was a Haegemonia 2 onwards. This steam version just isn't worth your money until these 2 issues are fixed (the sound problem especially). I can play the game at 1280 with the nvidia settings (aa etc) set to max, so the lack of widescreen isn't a huge problem for me but the sound issue is.","May 2, 2014","false","3.6"," 158 of 278 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","158","278","3","9"

From the gameplay, graphics and sound the attention to detail is breathtaking; creating a solid, immersive gaming experience!\n\nWhether you're a seasoned RTS junkie, or even a casual gamer -- this is one game you don't want to pass up!\n\nIt's laid back, challenging, fun and rewarding -- all the at the same time.
