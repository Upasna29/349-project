The music is also a pleasure to listen to as well, while relaxing and doing the puzzles. If your going to play for a perfect 3 padlock score you will need to complete each puzzle with in a time frame and with no mistakes, you can use the potions in the top right hand corner which are "hints" to help you if needed, but you'll need to wait for them to recharge again for the next hint, or you can spend your gold from completing previous puzzles to help you through much faster, also you can buy more time as well when chasing the timed padlocks. You will earn the gold from completing the puzzles as you go, I have just been playing differant puzzles over and over to acumulate enough gold to progress.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642876580\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642877091\n\nThe store page shares a bigger picture of the game very well. So if you love jigsaw puzzles, then this is a really nice puzzle game, and well worth the price or you can wait for a nice discount.\n\nGame also has Achievements and Trading Cards.\n\nI give it a 10/10","March 11","true","35.7"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","3"

It reminds me of the wooden puzzles I enjoyed as a child. The pictures are colorful and pleasing, and it's easy to rack up the achievements (if that's a thing you're into). Overall, if you're looking for a few hours of fun that'll help you unwind, then try this game.","March 3","true","23.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The music is aswesome, the puzzles are numerous and clever and piecing together the picture until you finally see what it is always brought out the child in me.\n"Ohh it´s a treasure chest! So awesome!"\nSuch a feeling comes with every level and really keeps you going. I´ve solved most of the puzzles and never got tired.\n\nHowever, there were some points i disliked too, one being that the pictures are already revealed on the level selection screen which really kills the feeling of discovering what it is in the first place. I also didn´t like the time mechanic as i really don´t want to be stressed out by games that are supposed to be relaxing, but the game doesn´t foce you to do it in time, so i was fine with it, even though i could never shrug off that feeling of pressure until the time finally ran out.\nThe worst thing tho, is when the game only gives you pieces that don´t fit onto the ones you already have. It´s rare but it happens and as someone who wanted to play without the hint function, it really killed my mood.\n\nBut after all, i think the game does a great job of giving you pieces you can figure out where to put.\nAnd the level progression is also a thing to admire. You start off with basic mosaic pieces, then you go over to stitched pictures with rounder shapes to then go to pieces of paper, which mostly consist of even lines and edges, and so on.\n\nIf you´re looking for a relaxing game, i think you can´t go wrong with thisone...\n\nEdit: As i´m approaching the end of the game i keep running into levels that don´t give you pieces that fit to the once already on the board. If this is deliberate, i think it´s a reeeally stupid choice. I won´t finish the game because of it... I will keep this review as a recommendation as i had fun in the first 4 stages. However, if you are like me and want to atually finish games that you start, i can´t recommend this game to you...","March 11","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think any fan of jigsaw puzzles would agree that this is a very well-done puzzler.\n\nThe puzzles pictures have a beautiful quilt-like feel (hence the name of the game, of course).  Graphically it's very pretty and the music fits very nicely.\n\nThere are a number of completion achievements that aren't difficult to get if you play through all of the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves range from easy to extremely difficult; you aren't provided with a guide picture but the game does place a small number of pieces on the board already to give you a starting point.  Which pieces are placed appears to be random, as restarting the puzzle nets you a whole different starter set.  This is nice to keep in mind if you have bad luck with which pieces are given at the start; you can always restart the level in the hopes of getting a better arrangement of pieces.  There is also a handy hint button if you simply can't figure out what to do, although there is a recharge time.\n\nI got something like 30 hours of playtime out of this game by the time I finished all of the puzzles, and then went back to complete them all again with a perfect score (that is, no mistakes and within the time limit).  This feels like an immense amount of playtime for the price ($4.99) and well worth it, especially since jigsaw puzzles have (in my opinion) an inherent replayability.\n\n100% recommended for jigsaw puzzle fans!","June 3","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/recommended/444280/","hyperduel","Hyperduel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/","1981 products in account","Product received for free\n\nWe've likely all heard the mysteriously enigmatic fairy tale called Alice In Wonderland as children, but what would occur if this fantasy story and its many zany characters were seamlessly combined with patchwork puzzle mosaics? We'd then have quite a compelling game on our hands aptly titled Alice's Patchwork, a relatively new release published by 8Floor and developed by Creobit.\n\nThe premise of the game itself is that you join up with Alice and her cohorts (found from both Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land) as you journey through many enchanting locations while assembling together patchwork scenes which are breathtakingly gorgeous, visually colorful, and also highly imaginative. Meanwhile the pieces themselves showcase incredibly rich and varied textures which further gives this game a hallmark of quality since quite clearly, much care & attention went into its creation.\n\nThe kicker here is that you must solve all of these puzzles within a set time limit since there exists a countdown timer, whereby you'll collect gold coins (in-game purchases) and keys (unlocking new levels and bonuses) upon solving each which wonderfully infuses an element of both suspense and reward into this challenge. However it should be noted that there also exists a "relaxed mode" setting in the options menu which disables the timer completely if you wish to maximize its casual-style attributes to their fullest, or perhaps even if you wish to practice with it first for a little while. In any event, the more optimally you solve the mosaic (in terms of both speed and mistakes) the more keys you will earn, which is a rather nice touch in compelling the player to perform at their very best.\n\nThe feature set of the game itself is rather impressive indeed! Because you'll easily enjoy hours upon hours of fun with it (over 10), with its more than 120 unique puzzles to solve, 6 expansive worlds, special quests, player ranks, and even bonuses to unlock. This is neither a short nor sparse play-through whatsoever, and I can only admire this aspect of Alice's Patchwork since its visually impressive yet challenging puzzles are something which you will definitely wish to keep coming back to time & again for the next sit-down with it. And make no mistake about it, the artistic merits of these mosaics presented here are nothing less than spectacular, especially for those who are aficionados of such eye candy in their games.\n\nAnother nice perk to be found is the hints bubble located in the top right hand corner of the screen, which is designed to help you along if needed, while being  purchased with the gold coins you win & collect. And believe me, in the later more difficult stages you'll come to appreciate this assistance because while it starts out fairly casual and relaxed to help ease you in, it gradually ramps up its challenge throughout at a fairly steady rate until you are being pushed right to your limits later on. This is fantastic to see because it will tightly grip your interest and not let go until you have finally completed the entire game, and a satisfying experience it is to be sure.\n\nI must also say that the wide assortment of chosen background music is another glowing highlight to this game, because I felt it brilliantly captured the very essence of the fairy tale itself with its very classically themed arrangements and crisp/clear instrumentals, whereupon each individual instrument itself sounded very unique and charming...while also exuding a very relaxing and upbeat atmosphere as it should.\n\nOne final plus here, is that Alice's Patchwork has been fully Steamified with both achievements and trading cards included, and I might add here that even the cards themselves are rather impressive to behold when expanded to their full size glory.\n\nVerdict\nThe fusion of this particular fairy tale theme with such patchwork puzzle gameplay somehow works, and works fantastically. Furthermore, it felt very polished in all the right ways and is both very casual in character yet quite challenging at heart, meaning it will certainly have a wide audience appeal while also being accessible for just about all ages. I felt that its many positives far outnumbered its virtually non-existent negatives of which I didn't readily notice any glaring ones at all, thus I would easily recommend this masterpiece in a heartbeat for those with an affinity toward either Alice In Wonderland and/or those who simply enjoy casual puzzle type games. And while I still haven't finished every single puzzle within it yet, I surely plan to resume playing it much more so that I may finally solve them all in order to collect every single key to be acquired in the game. Because what they all unlock is a whole lot of magical fun in this truly hidden gem.\n\nI'll enthusiastically rate this one 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","May 18","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

What I find important to remember is that it IS a puzzle - more than a jigsaw.  Some one mentioned in the comments that often it gives you pieces that don't have an obvious fit. That is true - the only thing is, they probably DO fit somewhere it just isn't obvious. AND streight sides do NOT mean edge.  So the challange is to find where they do fit. Every edge is unique, and sometimes you need to be able to see where the lines should go to find the right perfect fit.\n\nThis is a beautiful unique well-thought out game with lots of small but polished features such as each set is made from an different material (wood, cloth, metals, etc. ) there are different sounds to when the peice goes in for each set, and perspective is sometimes important in working out the puzzles.  And very family friendly.\n\nAll in all a great little game.","May 10","true","62.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
