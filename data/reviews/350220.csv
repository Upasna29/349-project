I thought it sounded really cool. I saw that most of the reviews were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the game was cheap and looked like it had so much potential so I bought it. That was the worst mistake I could ever make. This game in its current state is completely unplayable and you can't do ANYTHING AT ALL. You can walk and look at the floor which only has patches of grass. the rest is purple/pink You can also play on two maps that have you suspended on a platform which  you can pick up, throw, and drop blocks. This is going to be one of those games that the devs abandon after a little bit of work on it because it requires a bit of work. Just to tell you how bad this game is, I'm going to compare this to Ark, an early access survival game that has done early access survival correctly. Ark had stuff to do when it came out. It had basically the entire game when it first popped up on steam. However, Dead Sea did not. It has nothing to do. No content, N O T H I N G. Save your 5 bucks and just ♥♥♥♥ing IGNORE THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. Don't do what I did and ignore the reviews. It has these ♥♥♥♥ reviews for a reason.  This is the worst game in my steam library. I'm getting a refund. Now, this may seem drastic but it honestly ♥♥♥♥ing deserves it. At Dead Sea's current state, it DESERVES a 0/10. There is not ONE redeeming quality about this game. Everything about it is terrible. There's not even a hud or pause menu! You can walk, pick up blocks, throw them, or drop them. The fact that this game is on steam is a disgrace to the gaming platform.\n\nHere is a petition to remove this game from the steam store:\nhttps://www.change.org/p/kiss-ltd-pheonix-studio-steam-to-remove-the-game-dead-sea-from-the-steam-store","June 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","79","94","5","2"

Non-working title. Game released to Early Access to the developers horror and to everyone that bought it. The mistake was according to Phoenix Studio, on Valves side in terms of its early early release. But remember very little confirmed infomation is given... and when I mean confirmed I mean none. Still many are taking what Phoenix Studio say as gospel. Either way customers have been purchasing the title regardness. To Phoenix Studio surprise no doubt, and much needed funds. Also its important to note that a demo v 1.5 on Youtube is nothing like the version you would have bought here, nor what is on display on Steam.\n\n27/03/15\nFair dos the guys fixed the game, by simply adding a Dead Sea map, still they forgot to remove the non-working cryengine test maps. There is still no Dead Sea menu, the keyboard/mouse controls display off screen. The Dead Sea game map at this date has you wandering in a desert to a count down of your HP in the style of a timer. Pre-Alpha would be generous at this point in Dead Sea's development. Looking at Dead Seas Kickstarter they did not meet their goal.\n\nCurrently there is 1% content of what makes a survival game so far. Its just the open world map although, its not even as pretty as their Steam still screenshots nor their youtube video would let you believe. Its just sand, rock and bush. But at the end of the day, at this point it shouldn't be on Early Access. Heard that its planned for full release at the end of the year (2015) They have work to do! I would question the level of polishing this title would get in that limited time.\n\nCurrently £3.99 is for the 'Dead Sea' concept, Thats it. 'Potential' does not give Dead Sea a free pass to a postive review, nor will any game I review on that bases. Especially when its nothing more than concept art from a unknown developer. It's a game that may never see completion, looks like its being funded as it goes along. Looking at EAs statement " This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development." Little reminder of its current state, its a empty map.\n\n28/03/15\nThe Dead Sea 0.0.2 map now has a goal to find a Golden Stone, with 1st aid kits laying about to combat this decreasing HP timer. Same map updated to 0.0.2, for now I'll forgive the fact that it seems to have turned from a survival game to a slenderman style hunt the pages game.\n\nWeirdly thou when I found the Stone which is more like a upright slab (if you think of the ten commandments). When I got closer to it, it has a picture of a spacecraft and text on the back of what appears to be for another game? (edit: it is from another game "nimbus project")\n\n\n29/03/15\nfantastic another update, seems to be another Dead Sea map! Called Excape! It gave me visions of running from something, or to get away from something life threating. The horror continues and my heart stops to see its now became a minecraft island in the sky block game. I see there is also a square island above me... I see controls! It says 'F' to pick up move, 'mouse wheel' to drop, and 'F1' to kill the game. Still no 'end game' menu.\n\nIt takes me a while to pick up whatever I was trying to pick up? In my confussion and luck I pick up a block of the green stuff I'm standing on. I now get what I must do! Stairs I must build stairs, I line myself up and drop the block to the one side of me, not the front of me. Did I say it was also to the side of you, it sure makes, making block stairs interesting thats for sure.\n\n29/03/15\nTreated to another non-survival update! Keep this up and we'll be playing bloodly portal 3 next.... Its called Excape 2 this time excape next to water, with sharks but I wasn't wanting to mention that! Cus that makes it sound fun.\n\n\nDevelopers where asking, what is the communities thoughts was on a change of game engine and should it go ahead? From Cry to Unreal 4. The choice to change was already taken by Phoenix Studio before any input, was possible. Still Unreal seems to be Phoenix Studio prefered engine, I largely think most will not care as long as the end result is an enjoyable one.\n\n04/04/15\nAll is quite quiet on the Eastern front, we have not heard much more from the Thai Developers. The game sits in 'Quarantine' in my steam library, hence it trys to infect my other games. Dead Sea's room mates are games of the same high caliber as 'Rekoil', 'Overcast' and 'Dementium  II'.\n\n10/04/15\nIt's been 29/03/15, since we have had a update. Not a very long time of course, still reassurance that work is continuing would at least help the Developer keep intouch with the community.\n\n30/04/15\nfull month with only very early progess screenshots on the facebook page for dead sea. I swear I got told that a up-date was due at the end of this month? A Mod of these forums has told me that in May a up-date will be coming with a crafting system in place. To the most unfinished EA game currently on steam. Avoid this game at all costs, until the devlopers can deliver. Keep a eye on it if you must and see how it develops.\n\n1/06/15\nStill no update\n\n20/06/15\nGames on sale but still has been no update.\n\n28/06/2015\nStill no update, coming close to reporting the title to steam as a scam.\n\n01/07/2015\nBig update has yet to come\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS!","March 27, 2015","false","2.9"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","2"

I do understand that early release games do come with it's bugs and glitches but not being able to launch the game itself is more frustrating and especially when you have to pay for the game even in its early release stage.\n\nThere has been no new updates from the Phoenix Studio team so fingers crossed they will very soon because we are all itching to play this game.\n\nUPDATE 28.03.2015\nI have now played the early access and I am in a position to fully review it. I will post an additional review with an accompanying video in the next hour or so.\n\nUPDATE 28.03.2015 - my full review of Dead Sea and video below! I recorded in 60fps so not sure what the game is running at. Watch the video minimum of 720p for best visual experience of the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAODnHiJC4\n\nMenu interface\nIt is uncluttered and smooth to use with simplistic options for the player to decide how to play based on their own PC's performance.\n\nThe map\nThe developer has suggested that it will be an open world game.\n\nGame graphics & performance\nI experienced minimal lag or frame drop. The graphics are smooth and the colours are vibrant which is to be expected from a game made on the Cryengine.\n\nIn-game characteristics\nThere is quite a bit of detail such as moving clouds and character footprint left behind in the sand and with the addition of being able to see the your characters legs (blue jeans and boots) clearly I did not think about my attire for my adventures in a hot place! The Oasis heat gives the landscapes the effect of distortion which is true of deserts IRL.\n\nSoundtrack\nPretty decent in-game background music and in-keeping with the mood of the desert.\n\nIn-game effects\nWhen your character is low on HP (health points) your screen accumulates blood which does actually move down the screen which is another good effect. Your character pants when running for a long period and heart beat are heard when you are dying.\n\nSummary\nYou pay £3.99 to play the early access and all it will give you in a feel of how the game will look once the developers roll out the alpha and beta releases. There are no missions as such but just exploration of the world you spawn in. I will watch this game develop over time and with what I've experienced of it so far I believe it has potential to be a very good game. If they produce a polished and interesting game then I will certainly pay for and play the full release.\n\nFINAL UPDATE REVIEW VIDEO BELOW - 30.03.2015\n\nNOTE: This is my last update video of Dead Sea so I hope you can take something away from it when deciding whether to invest in this developer at this early stage of the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVti66ctt7Q","March 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","19"

This title as stated, can be something good if not great. Just needs a lot of work. To the developers I say again, don't give up on this.

It runs smoothly, has a great concept, and seems like it would be fun. The down side is that it isn't really a game yet, meaning many bugs, control issues, and a few graphic issues. Simply put, this is an experiment and is not meant to really be played for the experience yet. I would love to have this game supported and be finished, hopefully soon, but it isn't meant to be played because it isn't really a game yet. This is a test for an idea, I hope it becomes a real game soon. I do reccomend this game but by that I mean I reccomend the game, not the test.
