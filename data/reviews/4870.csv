I've had populations of over 24,000 units (villagers in mines included) on my side alone on a huge skirmish map with 6 other computer controlled players.   You must farm or fish (food), chop wood, quarry stone, mine coal, Iron and gold to supply your army.   I love this game and will die playing this game.  Easily my favorite RTS of all time.   Its cheap no reason not to add it to your RTS library.   Give it a go!","November 27, 2013","true","933.6"," 97 of 99 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","97","99","9","0"

Its gameplay focus is well split into all the aspects that characterise an RTT game: game rhythm, upgrades, buildings, unit variety and relevance, population realism, battle simulation... One has got to admire the effort put into crafting the unit functioning and overall building management in this one. Superb.\n\nCossacks offers plenty of pleasurable elements. First, there's the outstanding number of nations, each with its own architectural identity (wonderfully done, by the way); as well as the outstanding number of unique units and their precise importance on the battlefield or in the development of one's domains. Second, there's the realistic representation of population growth, with civil infrastructure costing you more as your settlement expands, although there is no set limit for your population. Third, there's the artillery/infantry details, amazing to watch as they engage in battle. Fourth, there's the customisable gameplay, as the options for a skirmish match are reasonable (type of terrain, type of elevation, game speed, resources, etc.), gathering all the good and fair choices everybody should have when playing a free-build or skirmish game mode in any RTS/RTT. Last but not least, the naval conflicts: it's just too exciting to watch your territories and riches grow and have to formulate quick strategies with your coffers and coal reserves so you can build a solid, fearsome fleet that can outrun the enemy's.\n\nWhether you're playing the main campaigns or the 17th and 18th centuries battles in quick match mode, Cossacks: Art of War shall bring you strategy-ecstasy. The huge battles (details of hundreds of men can be formed), the realistic artillery ballistics, the exciting invasions on the enemy's settlement, the fast-paced management of your resources (wood, gold, food, iron and coal) and workers, and the extreme attention that one has to keep on the keeping up of improvements and specific upgrades, will determine who prevails in the hot war scenario of this game. Cossacks can give you this kind of thrill, if you're fond of the genre.\n\nBear in mind that, while I'm writing on the Art of War page, this goes for all its "sister" games (European Wars, Back to War).","June 7, 2014","true","39.4"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","2"

But this game is pretty difficult and its different than most RTS games and time is of the essence and you have to be on top of everything from mining to building troops to farming from beggining to end and if you don't quite simply your gonna lose. I sometimes find myself building up a huge army and getting ready to invade the enemy but forgetting to make sure my peasents are doing there jobs at the mills and nothing feels worse but scrambling to get food while watching your soldiers die from starvation. All that aside its a fun (and cheap) game and if you like RTS games you should try it out","September 5, 2013","true","28.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I always have plenty of fun playing this tidy little RTS, and it shows a bit of insight into the lives and ways of old, with decent animations, sound effects, technology tree and units. The game is based around resource gathering, technolgoy research, city development and large scale batles with guns, artillery and cavalry. It's a great little RTS and I'd love to see a new version with updated graphics. I recommend this.","April 25, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
