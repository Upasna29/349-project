"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukemaster/recommended/398670/","nukemaster","Nukemaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukemaster/","139 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a tug of war game and then some.\n\nWith fast paced game play(sometimes overwhelmingly fast on harder dificulty), you can get matches played pretty fast making this a game you can drop in and play for short(game or two) or long perioids of time. Because the AI picks rather random unit combinations you always have a different experience.\n\nI did get to play some pre steam versions of this game and the progress has been nothing but great. It started with only one commander(leading unit that hires all the others), minimal upgrades for units(more on this later) and some interesting gameplay.\n\nAt release this game has 3 commanders to start you out and a functional upgrade system.\n\nWhen you play the game and win, you get random upgrade items(clearly better for harder levels). These upgrades are used to make your units stronger in future games. You can combine them to make even higher level upgrades for future matches. The more you play, the better you get.\n\nThe game has 5 unreleased commanders and multiple battlefields so we are sure to get more diverse games with future updates. At current I have a preference for Vania's targeted lighting attack.\n\nAs with any pre-release game you are sure to run into some bugs(I have seen nothing game breaking). The team developing this game has been very fast to fix bugs(pre early access) and take sugestions for future updates.\n\n","May 21","true","10.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
