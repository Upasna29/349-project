I own and loved uplink and hacknet (hacknet being the best hacking sim I have played). I went into this with an open mind. This is more of a visual novel than an actual game. There are minigames that are either too easy or make no sense in the context of the game.\n\nPositive:+ Achievements\n+ Steam trading cards\n\nNegatives:- Price for what you are getting, worth $0.99\n- Minigames that make no sense, dream sequences\n- Unrealistic environment, most of your time is spent clicking next. The desktop environment is an area clickable region, meaning you can click away from a folder, but it still opens the folder.\n- You just click buttons like: download, fix virus, etc. Not much thought or gameplay involved.\n- Story? There really isn't one. It uses buzz words to sound hacker-ish like script kiddie, keylogging, etc\n- Extremely tedious and boring with unnecessary screen effects\n- Generic files, fix_it to fix a virus, let's hack a machine and send ourselves money, not realistic at all\n- Overall, poor execution on every front of a video game: gameplay, sound, graphics, etc\n\nBad Game: 2/10\n\nIf you are expecting anything close to real hacking or a game like hacknet, you will be disappointed. Not worth the price, and not even worth the sale unless its $0.99 or less and you are a huge fan of the genre","May 5","false","0.5"," 97 of 102 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","97","102","0","0"

Unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. The background is a bit obnoxious which made me want to quit. The background music wasn't great.  The story is rubbish. Doesn't really make sense.

It's not funny which unfortunately is the direction it's heading towards. This game is not a "Simulation", as per suggested. It's very boring.\n\nThe mini games that pop up now and again are very childish. Very simple and easy to complete.

This is not a hacking game.  It's not even a game at all, unless you consider pressing space to proceed to the next line of cringeworthy dialogue and occasionally clicking a button or navigating a crude minigame to be "gameplay".  When a game is advertised as having an interactive terminal and unique hacking tools, I expect to, you know, have to at some point USE these wonderful features.  Showing the ASCII equivalent of a cutscene of a command line being used in response to me pressing the spacebar doesn't quite fit the bill.\n\nI usually shrug off bad games as a learning experience if I feel that I at least got some value for money, but this was so poor that now for the first time ever in my library of almost 1,000 games I am about to proceed to the refund page as soon as I've posted this.","May 5","false","0.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Its not even a game at all.\n\nEdit:\n\nI was looking through the reviews and the games I already know (Hacknet, Uplink, etc). I retract myself. This game is not even worth 0.99c. It is not entertaining (I finished it while waiting to find a game in Dota), the story is more generic than a Michael Bay movie, and I've interacted more (and gotten more interested) with a chemistry textbook or Wolfram Alpha. It's like a visual story, without the visual part, or the actual story. The dumb silliness of Goat Simulator or Soda Drinker Pro is better than this.\n\nI know, it's called Hack It. But it's not about hacking. Its about clicking next, doing little puzzles and typing in a console with literally three commands, of which only one matters. The story is not bad, not the greatest either. All in all, the game is a lot more of a visual novel, skipping most of the visual part. If you're looking for a game like Uplink or Hacknet (which is what I was looking for), skip this. But if you're looking for a way to kill an idle afternoon, go for it. The only real downside is the price. $5 was a little too much for my pocket. Maybe if it was $3... Be it as it may, at its current price, and having in mind that it had advertised itself as an Uplink-esque game, I can't recommend it. It's not what I was looking for, and it's not my type of game, but that's up to you.","May 8","false","9.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game is lasts for around one and a half hour. For 5€ i'd say that's a bit short but the humour and overall quality of the game makes up for that. Between missions you go trough short minigames that get progressivly harder as you get further into the game, i like theese. they give you some more stuff to do than some of the dialog in the game does.\n\nThe only downside that i've found while playing trough this game is that the dialogue options don't seem to make that big of a difference, the story seems to progress in the same way and basically only takes your option into account by the dialog.\n\nOverall I'd say that it's a good game for the price and deserves a purchase if you're intrested in hacking or story based games. The game is aimed more towards the casual playerbase than the elitist playerbase.\n\nThe games achievments are really easy to get on the other hand which might make the game seem attractive towards achievment collectors as well.\n\nHope this helps you choose if you're going to buy the game or not!\n\nEdit 06-05-2016: Why all the downvotes? :P","May 5","true","6.3"," 20 of 50 people (40%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","40","20","50","5","2"
