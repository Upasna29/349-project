I was kept at the edge of my boat seat from the moment the SEGA logo lured me in, I was ready. My heart was on the line along with the monster bass that swallowed my jig whole as he failed under the dock as guitars seemingly from heaven itself pounded away as did the giant fish.\n\nI turned rod left\nIT'S COMING NEAR\nI turned rod right\nCOME ON ALMOST THERE\n\nIn a brief moment of glory the monsterous bass was lifted on to my boat, seemingly putting it on the edge of capsizing.\n\nTHIS ONE'S HUUUUUUUGE!\n\nI ranked in my tears and felt the bonus of time rush over me.\nThank you Sega, thank you.","May 18, 2014","true","6.8"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","68","77","16","2"

Has the tournament mode from the original Dreamcast Edition. This version of the game don't have any of the graphical glitches like the original SEGA PC release did back in the day.

A fishing game that no others can match on the comparison scale.\n\nThe gameplay offered by SEGA Bass fishing has serious buoyancy, and you will not mind sinking hours into it.  I had one hull of a great time learning all the mechanics inside it.  I really wish there were morray like it.\n\nThe amount of time I lost just getting so in-depth with this game was a bit crappie, but maybe my time control is just a fluke; and there really is no need to be steamed about that.  And I just failed to keep my head above water.\n\nI recommend you try this game, don't leave it up to salmon else.

I’ll have you know I am a SEGA certified Pro Bass Fisherman, and I’ve been on numerous secret fishing trips to Europe and the moon and ♥♥♥♥, and I have over 300 confirmed catches with a monster record of 500 lbs that I reeled in with 1 hand tied behind my back. I am trained in master bass fishery and I’m the top bass fisher in the entire universe. You are nothing to me but just another target, a trophy.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life in bass fishing. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing done, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can out cast you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my easy lure.

I played that demo for hours. Now i finally got a chance to play the full game and it didn't disappoint.\n\nCurrently frustrated with the tournament mode. I do very well in the lodge area, but the bridge is brutal. The water in the bridge area is very deep, so you have to use sinking lures, if you don't reel the lure will just go to the bottom, if you lure fast the fish won't bite. This makes it very hard to catch anything in this area and just ends up costing me the tournament.

But it's instantly clear that this game was made for arcades.\nThe timer adds a little challenge but since you can continue your game with the press of a button after the timer has run out there's no point in having it there to begin with. They should've removed it completely, or should've made a different mode for it for those people who do actually enjoy it.. Then again, console ports weren't treated the same as they are treated these days so I willjust forgive them ;)\nAnd besides, the port isn't really all that poor, it still holds up but the control scheme is also classic Sega and makes absolutely no sense. But, it's playable with a little practice.\nIf you're a fishing fan, you basically have no other choice. There aren't that many fishing games out there.

The controls are the only obstacle of this game. The gameplay is awesome because you can catch a fish every-time casting out. It has a single player campaign that lets you catch alot of fish for the Tournament standings. There are really big fish and little ones to be caught but all will be a challenge if you dont know how to handle the reel right. The graphics are great for this type of game. It puts you in control of everything and lets you see into the water to catch the fish you want. The music in game is old school and fun. The overall game is great and if your into fishing this is a must buy when seeing it on sale.

So basically, terrible." 5/10\n\nI imagine this game is a lot like fishing while sober. And that's not a good thing. I don't even want to go fishing when I'm drunk, let alone when I'm sober, so you can imagine how I feel about this gem. It's almost as if the creators of this old Dreamcast game wanted to see if they could actually make fishing less exciting than it already is. Well, if that was their goal then they succeeded with flying colors. At least with real fishing you have the satisfaction of wrestling and eventually catching a real live fish. But here? It's barely a challenge at all. And wrestling with a 360 controller or keyboard looks awfully stupid. And I'm not sure about any of you, but I've gone fishing a few times, and it sure as heck wasn't easy.\n\nI know a lot of people here have strong feelings for this game dating back to their formative years when the Sega Dreamcast was the best thing ever invented. And that's all fine and dandy. God knows I love a lot of terrible games simply because they bring back fond memories of days since forgotten. But I never played this game when I was a child, so I don't share the same feelings for this steaming pile of nostalgia. Pick your lure, cast your line, and catch a fish, that's really all there is to this game. And I know that's what it's supposed to be, being a fishing game and all, but I mean, come on, give me a little more of a challenge.\n\nOkay, well, I guess I could see this being somewhat fun in the arcade with a fake fishing pole and an artificial reel and whatnot. But on the Dreamcast or with a 360 controller or keyboard, this game is just terrible. You may get a glimmer of fun out of it when you reel in that first fish of yours, but shortly after that you'll be shutting it off for something more challenging. And I dare you to make it to the end of the 'regular mode', because it's painfully long and repetitive. The only redeeming quality about this game is when the announcer yells out 'Fish!' when you first catch one, much like the announcer in 'Mortal Kombat' yells 'Fight!' before every match.","January 6, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is no way to adjust the sound or mute the hokey Japanese accent voice over.  There are limited things which you can do.  These include: turn your rod left, turn your rod right, reel in slow, reel in normal, reel in fast, and of course, cast.  Maps are limited to four different areas on the same lake.  You can choose from a very limited number of lures; six to start with, a handful more later (which are simply different paint jobs on the originals), and as far as I can determine, you only have one rod to choose from.\n\nOh yes, and you can also determine which time of day you want to go fishing: morning, noon, or evening.  The time of day seems to make very little difference as far as I can tell.\n\nThis game would be far to expensive if it were free, but the $8.95 which this game costs is the equivalent of being skinned and gutted alive.  It's not even humane enough for a fish.  The only positive thing about this game is that your hands don't get stinky.

Players experience enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide unparalleled strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before, fundamentally changing the way gamers play SEGA Bass Fishing across all modes.","April 6, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game can be mildly addictive due to driving the player to want to do better.  Arcade mode is easy to clear, but the Tornament Series and bonus lures add to the replay value, as do the extra locations in practice mode.\n\nKeyboard controls are absolutely fine, once you remember what each button does. They cannot be altered, but are comfortable enough to master, so they may not need to be.  No crashing or issues with saving yet.\n\nOnly downside: imperial measurements cannot be altred to display in metric; get with the times, developers!\n\nAll in all, recommended, especially for players who like a challenge and who strive to do better. This is coming from someone who until now, has not taken an interest in real-life angling. Worth the discounted £2.79!\n","March 29, 2015","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How does one simply catch a fish? Why does the fish always swim away? Why does my rod always get tangled?\n\nDeep questions need deep answers, and this game answers them all. Now i can fish, and the fish can fish too. Now whenever i go fishing, i always bring my rod along.\n\nAs archangel Gabriel said to me in a dream, "the first step to elightenment is knowing how to fish".
