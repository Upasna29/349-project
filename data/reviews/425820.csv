I really enjoyed it!  I haven't played too far into it but I love the game's mechanics, controls, graphics, everything about it, almost.  Of course, there are a few hitches, like for example my loading screen's background didn't really cover the whole screen on my 16:9 monitor, but the game has only been in early access for a few days now and those are the easiest things to update.  The actual game's graphics are stunning and it has been made in such a way that it is playable "right now" out-of-the-box and is not a broken mess at all.  It has more polish than games that have been on early access for a year.  I loved finding loot, the experience loss upon death was fair and you could often regain it by the time you got back to where you were, and it is very satisfying to take down a tough enemy.  They seem to be coming up with patches on a very frequent basis as well which is another good sign.\n\nLoading screens are very basic right now since the game is so new onto Steam but you will see them often enough that you will wish there was something more than an image of a fish.\n\nAll in all, very promising.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3QqmC5vKZ0","December 20, 2015","true","5.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"

DP offers more fast paced action however. The downside of this game is how short it is. To charge more than 5 dollars for this is a crime. I beat the game in about less than 2 hours. And to top it off, there is no replay value in the game at the moment due to bugs. The enemies one shot you. And upon starting a game after beating it the first time, your character is just stuck in place. Pick this game up in a couple of months after it has been fixed. Right now its a waste of money.\n\nEdit: Most of the above issues seem to have been fixed. Theres a bit of a scaling issue at later levels. with 100+ lvl items, it becomes a cakewalk with damage reduced gear.
