Truthfully, I enjoyed the "sports" angle of using the skateboard to grind along certain pipes and obstacles, and greatly appreciate the hand drawn artwork. The whole thing reminded me of Comedy Central's series 'Ugly Americans' with backgrounds taken from one of the adult coloring books that are all the rage right now (and I own one of).\n\nWhat really killed it for me were the combat mechanics. Attacking on foot is absolutely useless so that leaves you only with the jump attack on your board, and it gets repetitive insanely quick. Even when you unlock additional attacks, which require you to grab some mr. yuck sticker pick-ups to use properly, their power even seems stinted and not as useful as you would hope until much later in the game.\n\nI'd also like to see the camera fixed to show more of the direction you're moving in, as I felt I had to stop sometimes and gauge certain obstacles instead of being able to flow smoothly from one to the next as I'm not entirely sure where I'm going. Maybe that's just me, but it'd be nice is all I'm saying.\n\nAll in all, I put about forty minutes in the game, and I have very little interest in revisiting it. Can't really recommend this title based on that, but if the developer works on it a little more and adds a secondary standard attack, then maybe I can.","April 22","false","0.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"
