When developers were discussing the game, that was pretty clear and I have no qualms with that.\n\nIn fact I was quite happy with the idea of a strategy game designed so I could play over an evening after work.\n\nThe 3 hour play time of this review was playing a game to completion on a "large" map.\n\nInitial impressions are poor. The game launching in a tiny window and into a bare, personality-less main menu that could have been ripped from any sci-fi title (it reminded me of the Sword of the Stars 2 menu). I sought out the settings menu and within that I found volume controls and "Windowed Full Screen mode".\n\nI'm sorry what?\n\nI know the game was being made for tablet as well, but this is Firaxis. I asked another friend playing it "Am I missing a settings menu somewhere?" bemusedly. "Nope" He replied "It really is that sparse"\n\nOh well. Not a great first impression, but not necessarily the end of the world. I setup a game.\n\nSetup lets you pick a faction and a leader. Each faction gets the same leaders, with slightly rejigged artwork. Which comes across as a bit lazy. The factions have a unique bonus with the leaders adding an additional bonus of their own. I was a little bemused at what the various bonuses meant as I only knew about one aspect of the game (crew morale) from previews nothing else made a lot of sense and there was nothing to explain the benefits of a choice, no tooltips, nothing.\n\nThe lack of tooltips persists throughout, with a general lack of accessible information.\n\nI setup my game, stabbing blindly in the dark at things that sounded useful\n\nThe galactic playing field looks alright and I wait for the useful tutorial to kick in and explain things to me over my first few turns. I get nothing. I understand there's an info button to click but I don't understand why there's a lack of tutorial and I fumble around the first few turns getting to grips with the games systems.\n\nAs the game is all about moving a fleet around space bringing disparate planets into a federation you'd expect load out/designing of the ships to be one of the most involved aspects of the game. Instead, you're presented with a list of things to click away at to upgrade or downgrade (removing components nets you some resources back to spend elsewhere) different aspects of each ship.\n\nMy fleet consisted of three ships throughout the course of the game, starting as corvette's, ending as battleships through upgrades and the games automatic ship classification. All 3 focused on speed, one was paticularly tough and loaded with close range weaponry. One was less tough, also had close range weaponry and could cloak. One had longer range weapons. The limitation to what you can actually do with ships meant all of them had max speed, and were stupidly tough by about mid way through. But this simple setup felt game breaking. I could defeat any mission or enemy fleet, outside of the missions where you have to defend an outpost that can only survive two hits with fast enemies that just head straight for it.\n\nThe empire building aspect of the game is no more involved. "Click this to make numbers go up, because numbers" about sums up this aspect of the game. There's no interesting trade off between balancing metal, food or energy. Get lots of whatever you can, click stuff to have more stuff.\n\nI actually beat my game accidentally. I was working my way from planet to planet, building one ludcriously over powered wonder after another because why not, then a conquered a planet which also had a wonder and triggered the wonder victory.\n\nWell victory nets you a much more rewarding end then it does in Beyond Earth at least. You get 10 seconds of video which is better then a text box. But does it really matter when the rest of the game is so unengaging?\n\nOverall, it's an ok game to have on a tablet, nothing stand out, even where there isn't much competition. But on the PC there's tons. Weird Worlds in Infinite space did something similar but better years ago and it's Early Access sequel likely will to. There is no reason to buy this game for the PC, and very little for a tablet.","March 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 1,375 of 1,558 people (88%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","88","375","1","64","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrNoesis/recommended/282210/","DrNoesis","DrNoesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrNoesis/","930 products in account","I decided to give this game a few hours of play, and a couple of days to judge if my opinions about it were sufficiently objective, and I've deliberately avoided reading other reviews so as not to colour my judgement.\n\nAt a very cursory glance, it's an ok, fun, civ: beyond earth themed mini game, that will provide a slightly different way to  sink a few hours in to a game for a little bit.\n\nI tend to think of games in terms of wether they "break even" for me or not - am I going to get sufficient gameplay out of a title that the cost per hour played is less than or equal to an arbitrary value.\n\nFor me, I tend to consider this value at a nice easy £1 per hour, pretty much the price of a cheap cup of coffee... if a game beats that, it's broken even or possibly even done a lot better. If it works out higher than that, the cost to own is too high and not worth the expense.\n\nOn those terms, this title doesn't even come close... as I doubt I'll play beyond the 3 hours or so I've put into it so far, leaving me at a cost to own of over £3 per hour...\n\nI'll try to embellish more below.\n\nDo you remember the free companion app for Mass Effect 3 that was released a few years ago? Called Mass Effect: Datapad, it allowed you to play a basic mini game on a tablet or mobile device that could influence events in the main game.\n\nSimply put, Starships is the "next gen" version of that.  There game is a little more complicated than Datapad, but in essence all there is to it is a vehicle for delivering unlockable content in Beyond Earth, which from the initial unlocks I was able to make, are pretty basic, and add a few slightly different starting options for civ's in any new game you start after the unlock (eg a "sponsor" option when setting up your civ to start with ultrasonic fences, instead of the vanilla options)  Unlike datapad though, it doesn't add the Beyond Earth equivalent of ME's codex, and does nothing else to really expand on the game or the overall experience.\n\nWhen you consider that, as mentioned, Datapad was free, albiet a little more basic, it brought a lot more to the game universe it represented than Starships accomplishes for £11/$14 - and that in itself, really draws the value of this title into stark contrast.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it is a fun little distraction, but there really isn't all that much to it beyond a distraction.  Every mission map is ostensibly the same... a randomly generated asteroid field with a couple of flavour target decorations in suitable locations.\n\nThe galaxy map, where you take part in all your diplomacy, upgrades and travel, is pretty miniscule, even when set to "extreme" size, (I counted approx 20 systems in my last extreme map, for example) which is pretty poor and clearly designed around rushed, dirty play.  Similarly unit limitations in missions (up to 15 whole units at once... wow) is a pretty clear indicator of the intended audience.... tablet users, with PC and Mac users obviously catered for purely as a bonus extra revenue stream.\n\nThe game, currently, has no tutorial, and requires users to integrate both Starships and Beyond Earth with a 3rd party accounts system (which isn't all that obvious to find) in order to benefit from any of the inter-title unlocks.\n\nThe advertised "starship customisation" feature is pretty poor, and is simply a case of pumping points into a specific attribute to beef it up a bit.\n\nThe ingame AI is pretty abysmal where scaling difficulty does nothing to changing AI tactics, and instead seems only to make them more able to soak up and dish out damage. As soon as you've worked out that it's possible to spam your way to success pretty easily, all the real challenge is lost, and it simply becomes an exercise in chosing the most economical way to collect all the ingame systems.\n\nSure I hold my hands up, I had different expectations of the game when I preordered it, and from the demo's and trailers I saw, I was kind of expecting a turn based 4x strategy title.  I was disappointed when I realised this wasn't the case, and I cannot say strenuously enough, this is not a 4x strategy game, but I tried to keep playing and experiencing the game regardless, and have tried to judge it on it's own merits rather than how it didn't match up to my expectations.\n\nIs it a fun little minigame? Yes, as I said at the start, it is an amusing distraction for an hour or two.\n\nHowever, I have played similar games in flash based web games, and I've downloaded far better, and more involved or complete, games than this for free on my mobile devices, and have had varying levels of satisfaction from them.\n\nI found the subject of "cross compatibility" a little bit of a misnomer too... Where Datapad could impact on how prepared the galaxy was to deal with an impending threat, or where Assassins Creed allowed you to affect the economy and environment in which you played, all Starships offers is the ability to unlock gameplay options that would previously just have been included as standard.\n\nSeen in that light, it's little more than a rebranded DLC pack for Beyond Earth, which demands not only your money but also your time in order to unlock the content you've paid for (and by all rights, should have had access to in the first place)\n\nIn light of all that, I simply cannot in good concious recommend the game to anyone at it's current retail price.\nTaken as a DLC, it's easily double the price it should be for the features it brings to your Beyond Earth experience.\nTaken as a stand alone mobile app, it's probably closer to triple the price of a title with similar depth.\nTaken as a stand alone PC/Mac game, to be honest, I've paid less than a 10th of the price for indie titles that were far more robust and deserving.\n\nAdd it to your wishlist, and wait for it to be added as a bonus game to a humble bundle or something.  Spend the £11/$14 buying lunch for a couple of homeless folks, you'll get far more satisfaction in the long run, and someone far more deserving than the developers behind this title, get to have you buy them a meal.","March 15, 2015","false","3.2"," 882 of 1,000 people (88%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","88","882","1","46","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/recommended/282210/","lexifox","Finding Namor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/","297 products in account","Starships is a game with a lot of potential, but falls short of what it could be. The game lacks a decent tutorial outside of standard tooltips, but the gameplay is fairly shallow without too much curve. Most of the non-combat gameplay is simply buying improvements/investments for better resources, which you can use to buy improvements and investments.\n\nThe battles themselves are largely a matter of flying in and out of cover, shooting targets from behind/the side and randomly crippling their abilities while they do the same to you. Torpedoes can be used to created delayed explosions, granting you a degree of control over enemy movement, and there's some shenanigans with cloaking and radar.\n\nThe maps are very similar, with the main features being shifting asteroids and portals that randomly teleport you to other portals. The former are very simple: red and green circles let you know that every turn, a path will be opened or closed. The latter is more of an annoyance than anything, due to the random aspect and the game's willingness to send your ship through one if you don't carefully plot your movement across individual hexes.\n\nThe game is connected to Beyond Earth, itself an iffy prospect at the time of writing. Completing tasks in BE will unlock bonuses in Starships, and vice versa. The BE unlocks are generally underwhelming, save for Pioneers. You can also choose to "continue" a BE save in Starships, playing as your chosen leader and maintaining the same diplomatic relations with AI leaders, though this is pointless with Starships being a step down from BE.\n\nUltimately, Starships isn't a particularly deep or intriguing game. The visuals and music aren't bad, and the missions have decent variety, but everything else is lackluster and the options are barebones. There's no multiplayer, no option to continue after winning, and no real depth.\n\nIt might be worth a look on Steam sale, particularly if you don't want to get a BE mod or mess with XML files to unlock the bonuses, but Starships can't break from the orbit of its iOS port origins.","September 3, 2015","false","19.1"," 208 of 229 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","208","229","10","0"

Which, if they had paid even half-attention to anything the developer said prior to release, they would have realised was never meant to be the case.\n\nThis game was never meant to be something like Endless Space, or Galactic Civilizations, or Master of Orion.  Firaxis was quite clear about that during the development process, in everything they said to their fans.\n\nWhat The Game ISStarships is a light/casual strategy game, suitable to playing when you have a few spare moments - during a lunch break, for example.  It's less about grand strategy than it is abut tactical combat with a small fleet.  And within that framework, it is a very, very good little game.  Just, lighter fare than most of my fellow strategy-game enthusiasts will be used to.\n\nMoral of the Story:Never buy a game just for the title, especially, just for whose name is on it.  Always take the time to at least learn what it's publisher claims the game is supposed to be.\n\nTo all of those people who bought this, expecting a dep and complicated 4X game requiring multiple hours, and hundreds of turns, just to complete a single playthrough, I say:  CAVEAT EMPTOR; the only person to blame for your poor experience, is yourself.\n\nNext time, do your homework, and at least learn what the game itself actually claims to be, before setting yourself up for disappointment when it turns out not to match your unfounded expectations.","March 14, 2015","true","24.2"," 1,096 of 1,366 people (80%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","80","096","1","82","48"

Unless they make some improvmens to the game, I have to say do not buy this unless it is on sale.\n\nYou can think of Sid Meier's Sarships as a 4x Light turn-based strategy game.  The best thing I can compair it to is a Simplified iOS version of Endless Space. Even the 4 resources look and sound like Endless Space.  You have Food, Science, Metal, and Engery. Each turn your planets give you all the resources that they have produced based on their population and improvment you built.  There are only 5 improvment to build, one each for production of each resource and a Planetary defence one for the fifth.\n\nYou move your fleet of ships from planet to plant completing quest they give you to get influince with them until they become one of your planets.  You only have one fleet and it starts with two ships. Each turn you can use your enerigy to improve your ships or build a new one to join your fleet.  You never seem to loose a ship, if it is destroyed in battel, it will be back in your fleet at the end of the battle.\n\nYou can also link this game with Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth using the My2K account. Playing this game will let you unlock some things in Beyond Earth.\n\nThere are parts of the game that I did enjoy.  The simplified version of the 4X game means the game move at a fast pace, focuing mainly on battles. My main problems with the game is that you can tell they put all their focus on the iOS version, and left out a lot of standard featurs you expect to have on a PC game, especially from a Firaxis and 2K game. These are not small Indie startups making their first Greenlight game.\n\nRight now the main problems I have with the game:\n\n-There are no resolution options and no Fullscreen. There is what they call Fullscreen Windowed\n-You can set victory conditions, but the AI ignors them and can win any way it want. So victory conditions are just a way to handycap yourself.\n-There is no way to rebind keys and there are no hot keys.  Right now they only keys that work are they arrow keys to move the map, and the ESC that lets you exit the game.\n-No multi-player.  I can tell this game is going to get old realy fast. multi-player was something they were going to put in, but decided not to for some reason. I hope they change their mind on this.\n\nHad I bought this on iOS, I would say it a great game and have a lot of fun with it, but as a pc game it feels off some how. Like we have a really good Beta, but you are just waiting for them to finish it now.","March 12, 2015","false","7.5"," 387 of 489 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","387","489","10","5"

Wait 2 or 3 months for 2K to either abandon support or actually finish testing this game.  This game is NOT in Early Access and should be a finished and tested product. However, most of the Early Access games I have played were far more stable.\n\nLonger version:\nI've never written a review on a Sid Meier game before and it's a shame that this has to be the first one. The bugs that are inherent in this game indicate that very little testing was done prior to launch. In an attempt to stem the tide of negative posts, one of the 2K devs sticky'd a thread to try to capture all technical issues. I don't think he's actually replying to anything there. This thread has been out since 3/12 (today is 3/16) and is up to 32 pages so far and growing.\n\nI entered a support ticket on the 2K page after reading their FAQ/Known Issues thread.  I'm suffering from two of the frequent issues. The game doesn't play fullscreen for me -- the Windows taskbar always shows up. The FAQ said that if I hide my taskbar in Windows, this would resolve it. Really?  Why the heck would I do that? Shouldn't they just write the game to overlap it fullscreen?  You know, just like every other game developer already does?  The other issue is far more irritating though. The game crashes after the second set of logos... just about 4 or 5 words into the intro. 100% of the time despite an uninstall/reinstall. So I've not watched the intro yet. The only way to get past this is to spam the Escape key as soon as the second set of logos comes up. I don't get the intro but I can play the game... for a while.  Yes, dear friends, the crash-to-desktop bug persists into the game itself.  Randomly, the game just shuts itself down with no error messages. Not so bad if you save frequently but later into the game when you have control of a bunch of worlds and a decent-sized fleet, it gets to be a real PITA to save just to go from one world to the next then save and move to the next... But you have to do this if you want to store your progression because you never know when you'll be dumped right out.  When you enter a ticket on this at the 2K support site (which I heartily recommend as they need a swift boot to the tail for this), you'll notice that if you select "crash" as an option, they even already have drop-downs for "crash after second logos" and "crash during gameplay."   This game should have never ever ever launched in this state. These aren't minor bugs to be worked around -- they are show-stoppers.\n\nNow on to the game itself... It feels more like a tablet game than a Windows game.  The price point is about right -- this isn't a deep simulation or world builder. You're not in-game to get invested and watch your planets grow (except for maybe your homeworld).  The combat is what the game is all about. It's relatively simple and straight-forward in the basic mode.  I haven't tried hard mode yet since I haven't been able to sustain the game long enough to complete a normal campaign. (see the paragraph about the perisistent crashing above)\n","March 16, 2015","false","7.8"," 233 of 283 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","233","283","6","8"

I can't imagine he had any interest in the project, and it feels like the producers simply pinned his arms to the desk until he signed over permission to use his name for a overly-glossed project that probably didn't take them very long to develop.\n\nThis game tries to 'feel' a bit like Master of Orion, but it fails to deliver in pretty much every category. I played it for two days and finished it on epic size. Every planet, faction and technology is the same, no random events happened, there are a short list of "missions" for every uncolonied planet which are all very much the same. It is to MoO what Empire At War was to Supremacy: take a good concept, cut it down to its most bare elements, and slap a price on it.\n\nThere's almost no diplomacy, not in the sense that you feel there is real politics taking place as happens with Sid Meier's civilisation games - the AI is neither bold to attack nor is scared of you when you're powerful. Alliances are empty. The game feels as though it has no soul to the purpose but to play through the simple rules, you are fully aware you're just clicking to interact with a simple ruleset, no immersion in actually "being a part" of a story, not even on sandbox level.\n\nThe graphics "are nice" but feels like pretty paint on something so simple and simply boring. The game forces you to watch ships explode in its terrible animation (which is, flashes here and there, while the camera shakes galore, focusing on the ship with no choice, then it disappears, this animation when repeated actually made me a bit ill) so, when you take out 5 ships with one torpedo (which is pretty necessary to get through the game without spending too long in the boring battles) you just check your phone while you wait for it to go all "oh look shaky screen in space, isn't space cool??" No. It's not cool.\n\nThis is the space-4X equivalent of Farmville. It's only worth getting if you need to keep your son quiet in the evenings, but even then, in my opinion, it's also a waste of his time.","August 29, 2015","false","11.7"," 112 of 132 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","112","132","11","0"

So, let me make an example: I hid my fleet behind a formation of really big asteroids, launched a few fighters, checked my LOS and every ship on the enemy team was untargetable. Clicked Next Turn. First thing I see is that an asteroid that was right in front of my fleet dissapeared and now 5 enemy ships are shooting me with 100% damage modifier. Now. If it is a system, there has to be some form of an indicator of which ones are moving(not necessary the location, but just an idea of which cover cannot be reliably used). If it was made for preventing people from defensive camping - good, but in this case you might remove all the asteroids as there is no way to predict your enemy's next turn(it is a strategy game , afterall). If it is a bug - GOD, this has to be fixed as soon as possible. I am EXTREMELY interested in the point of view of any developer\community manager on that topic.\n\nUI:\n+planetary management is simple enough and UI does it's job\n-No HP/Weapons/Modules indicators (that I've seen) on enemy ships aside from the info on a pre-mission briefing. How can I tell if the ship is going down soon? How can I tell if that ship is stronger at close combat? Which ship should I target?\n-Line of sight is really hard to manage, there is no visible indicator if the ship is in range of attack OR if the ship will be able to attack after the move (again, it is a strategy game not an aracde shooter). Defeats the idea of tactical movement, you just HOPE that your lasers will reach\n-No Indicator of which weapon will be used at the certain distance, Would be great to see a tri-colour targetting arrow that shows which weapon will you fire at what range. I think it is a simple to implement and yet very important feature(again, we are trying to make tactical decisions in a STRATEGY game)\n-Diplomacy screen is super-simple(also, very small for some reason) and a bit hard to understand from the first glance, and I am used to the complex screens of CIV and other 4x games\n+Global view gives just enough information to the player, very functional and not cluttered.\n\nGraphics:\n+- Functional, nothing to praise, nothing to complain about\n-No options. I want to skip\speed-up animation on a global view, same in the battle screen. Every CIV game has it...\n\n\nOverall:\nI REALLY want to like this game, I was excited from the moment I heard about it. I have done the pre-order and... I think it was a mistake. The game has potential, but it is buried behind tons of questionable decisions. In ideal world it is a fun, fast, strategy game, that can be finished within an hour. As it stands, I have very little desire to start a new playthough after I learned some of the flaws. I helped design\QA some UI for Network Software and I am genuinely surpised how most of the things I mentioned as a negative were missed\not mentioned during the development process.\n\nYou might have a different experience than I did, maybe it is just a matter of personality.\n\nRegards,\n\nDark Sun","March 12, 2015","false","4.3"," 165 of 216 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","165","216","3","4"

It is the strategorical equivalent of Monopoly.  Yes, it's light, it's simple, and the tactical battles can be a little fun.  But there is no real resource management or troop management or build management.  Everything you want to build, is built instantly on your turn.  New ships, ship upgrades, planetary upgrades, cities, even wonders.  If you have the resources, you could win by building a ton of cities or wonders in a handful of turns.  There are no tough decisions about building 5 small units or planetary upgrades instantly or building 1 large unit or wonder that will take a few turns to generate.  All of my turns devolved into - have energy, build/upgrade my fleet - DONE!  Have food?  Add cities.  Have science?  Research something - BOOM, added to all your ships or planets.  It is way way too simple.\n\nIf they ever add multiplayer, it might might give this some more potential.  As it is, skip it if you truly enjoy 4x games.

It somewhat resembles the Civ Series in that it involves growing star systems, managing resources, and has multiple victory conditions including tech, diplomancy, population, and so on, but all the parameters are either preset or simplified into "levels" rather than micro-management choices that delighted Civ fans. And rather than building as many units as you want, you have to make do with a single fleet (which can be a swarm of smaller ships, or a few uber powerful ones) that you must continually upgrade as needed. As a result, it's a bit of "neither fish nor fowl". It's not as complex as Civilization series (certainly not that this price point) yet it's deeper than most games at this price level.\n\nSMS limits you to a single fleet, which started at 2 corvettes, but as you continued to upgrade them they became larger, stronger, more heavily armed, more heavily shielded and armored, faster, better sensors and/or stealth, even more fighter bays. You can also add ships if you can afford to do so. Prices go up as component ratings go up. And given the various fields you can upgrade, you can customize the ships to fit almost any strategy. Enjoy hit and run? Long range torpedo attack under stealth? Long range laser bombardment? Sending fighters to pick apart the enemy? You can do it in this game.\n\nSMS starts you off with one world, and as you move your fleet you will discover more systems, each of which will have a mission for you. Could be as simple as fleet action (where you need to destroy the other fleet) to hold on for five turns, to escape in 5 turns, and so on. Each world also produce resources (energy, food, metal, science, etc.) which can then be spent on planet upgrades, ship upgrades, research, and so on. Each planet upgrade, much like the city structures in Civ, have tangible production benefits. Perform enough missions at a system and you can pull that planet into your sphere of influence.\n\nSMS lets you interact with other political entities as you find them, and they, much like civilizations in Civ, will greet, threaten, cajole, sign treaties, and more.\n\nSMS lets you setup various map conditions from tiny to huge in size, different starting positions and tech levels, and more. Even the win condition can vary, as you can go for domination, or get wonders, science, diplomacy, and other victories.\n\nYou can only have one fleet, whcih is why this game drew a comparison with the Heroes of Might and Magic (HOMM) series, where the hero with his stack of creatures move around the map, to various action points on the map to do combat with either defenders of a castle or other important locations. As one conquers each castle one also needs to spend $$$ on the castle as improvements, much like in SMS one must buy planetary population or planetary improvements.\n\nIf there's combat, then your units will do combat on a hex-map of the system where there are various wormholes, asteroids (small and large), planets, and other structures, as your ship(s) will fire lasers, plasma cannons, and/or torpedoes at the enemy ships, as well as send out fighter wings to conducting harassing or direct attacks. Whoever left standing is the winner, but depending on damage suffered it can be a pyrrhic victory. The idea generally is put yourself where your fleet can concentrate fire on one enemy ship while staying out of range or firing arc of others by hiding behind asteroids and/or planets.\n\nGraphics are "fine", as it's sci-fi-y look but quite clear and concise. The map scrolling takes a little getting useto as there is no free rotation (there is, but it snaps back into place as you release the mouse) and there is no edge scroll or keyboard scroll which surprised me somewhat. OTOH, the ships, the protagonist of the game, are interesting as everything you add has an immediate visual effect. Ships get longer, bulkier, with visible weapons and other modules added, and what was a wimpy corvette will eventually morph into a full battleship, and you'll visually see the differences.\n\nAll in all, SMS is NOT Civ-in-Space, though it has a similar feel, but it's far more related to HOMM or Infinite Space series than Civ. As long as you keep that in mind, enjoy the strategy-lite game.","August 15, 2015","true","14.2"," 98 of 119 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","98","119","7","0"

And therein might be the reason for most negative reviews: every feature is reduced to its bare essentials to provide a dense and fast strategy experience. It doesn't want to fill your evenings! It want's your small chunks of spare-time, entertaining for 30 to 90mins at a time. Your trip to work, your break, or that 40mins that you can steal away while your kids watch their favored show.\n\nUnusual Design Decisions(Things you should get accustomed to, to enjoy it)\n\nJust one Fleet\nStarships strategy core is to use your one fleet most efficient. Your effectiveness at the meta-gameplay is defined by accomplishing as much as possible with this one fleet each turn. No matter how big your empire, your turn has always the same amount of moves and actions. No uneventful early turns or tedious later turns.\nEvery turn counts!\n\nTactical Movement\nThe tactical combat is all about movement: range and angle for the shot but most of all cover, mixed with some divide&conquer. Unusual for a spaceship game, but it ensures that how you move is always more important than the strength of your fleet!\n\nSimplified Progression\nStarships has 4 paths of progression: The Fleet (invest energy), Research(invest science), more Planets(conquered), and Production(invest food and metal). where each part of progression isn't much more than a counter with increasing price for every point. But everything is well crafted into one big progression circle. The progression is simple and easy to comprehend, but exactly the right amount for a fast strategy game like this.\nClosing WordsI love strategy games, no longer hardcore, but "normal" ones like Civ. And yes, this game isn't for me, at least not for that part of me. It can't fuel a strategy addiction with dozens of hours, but Starships never wanted to! It tries to offer tactics&strategy to casual and short-time players; Or old ones, who can only relive the old days for one hour or two at a time.\nIt deserves a place on the gaming market, but right now it is drowned in negative reviews of players, who expected something else.\n\nPlease understand, that Starships weaknesses are a strength to a lot of gamers out there. Give them a chance to find it!","March 14, 2015","true","55.0"," 220 of 302 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","220","302","13","0"

The twist here is there are planets to join your galactic federation and turn based starship battles with your armada against an opponents.  Building your armada and competing in battles is by far the most fun of the game. I'd say it is the real game and everything else is just fluff. You can buy vessels, then upgrade engines, shields, armor, lasers, cannons, torpedoes, scanners, stealth and fighters.\n\nThe world is never enough and the universe is yours to conquer, purify or unify. There are several victory states such as domination, population, building wonders or scoring the top tier of a few science fields. While its nice to have all these ways to win, it feels like the game is geared toward conquering the galaxy. There's an entire space battle system in place and its silly to overlook it and play diplomatic. The only real way to ensure that I'll have a science or wonder victory is to make that the only type of victory allowed.\n\nBattles take place on a hexigrid map, which in a way is illogical since space has a Z axis, but whatever. You can make use of heavy asteroids, planets and moons as cover. In a way its laughable that planets are as wide as four vessels. Smaller asteroids give less cover, but you're still prone to attack, but take less damage.\n\nIf a vessel is hiding behind cover, you can fire a limited amount of torpedoes that will breach cover. The only catch is you need to detonate the torpedo one turn later, so that gives your foes a chance to move. You get to see your torpedo fly and then push the button to make it explode. Its a great dynamic to have. Even when I'm out of range, I'm firing torpedoes just to do something. Torpedoes are limited to the number you have upgraded on that star ship.\n\nEach ship gets a turn with a movement and an action in either order. During an action it depends what the vessel has upgraded. You can attack, impulse an extra move space, cloak hide, scan for cloaked vessels and release ships. If you chose to move, you can attack as you move you move between two cover points, but I never felt a need to get that complicated. Releasing ships adds a small cluster of fighters with long range movement, little health and no shields.\n\nVessels have shields, so if your weapon's attack power is less than the shield, its ineffective. Once shields are down, then you can do some big damage. The armor rating amounts to hit points. The more upgrades you have to a ship, the slower it moves, so you'll need to upgrade engines. Then there's stealth that conceals a ship unless an enemy is near it and upgraded scanners will compensate for finding stealth enemies. Its a good dichotomy.\n\nOther notable features on a map include anomalies that when you fly into them, you appear out of a different one. Its good for speeding things along if there's one ship left, but your comrades are across the map. Even if you pop out in a random location, its still closer and a chance to flank enemies.\n\nBattles have a victory condition, a map condition and a card. Most of the time you earn victory by annihilating the opposition. Other times its defend an outpost, escort a vessel to an outpost, guard warp gates, destroy a single vessel or get a ship of yours into a warp gate. The maps feel generated and the map conditions are things like enemy torpedoes are undetectable, more asteroids, less asteroids, shields are less effective. It adds some diversity to the battles. Then there are the cards which feel forgotten about. You get one or so cards during each battle and its a gamble when you use them. I wish I could say more, but in seven hours of playing, I never made use of them beyond a curiosity.\n\nThe idea of the game is that your entire armada flies from planet to planet. After these battles win or lose, you keep all your ships, but you need to repair them for the damage that they've taken. So a major loss requires you to repair everything. Well if your armada wrecks the armada of a competitor that leaves that same competitor open for more attacks on the same turn. Blood thirsty players like myself will keep pushing through, but to prevent the entire universal conquest on a single turn, your crew's efficiency goes down with each battle. Once its as low as it gets, you're forced to take a shore leave and end your turn.\n\nLike a lot of these hexigrid games, you're competing and aligning with other competitors. You start the game by visiting planets, gaining their support which seems rather easy. Just win a battle and you're halfway there! Take a shore leave on a planet that you have 50% devotion with and you can gain an extra 25%. Some planets end up contested where four competitors can have a stake in it.\n\nOnce you've taken quarter of a planet you can spend food to plant cities; I'm sure that's how it works. Cities increase workers I guess. I was never too sure. The game just told me to build cities, so I did.\n\nFrom there there are upgrades to a planet. Upgrades cost metal and give you more resources across various types that never felt of any consequence. Other planet upgrades include planetary defense craft, giving you a home field advantage with an extra vessel if an enemy ever attacks. Constructing a warp gate can bring your fleet to a planet under attack.\n\nSpend science points on technology upgrades that will boost armada stats by 25% of a single category. Plenty of planets will reward you with a technology of your choosing. Even if you are about to enter a battle with someone, you can negotiate and they will give you technology or food to leave the planet. If you agree, that's some sort of a peace treaty right there. Other times if you have a 95% chance of winning, the game lets you have the planet without a fight.\n\nIt feels like I managed the bare minimum of micromanagement and got away with it. Rather than clicking on each planet to build this or that, I just clicked on one and upgraded until I was broke. There is an information icon to click on that will advise you what you should do, but it should just be on the screen without me having to click something. Perhaps a hide button would be better for players that want to play it their own way. Even with no guide and little to no tutorials I still managed to get through it.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you select map size, up to six opponents, difficulty and victories. Enormous still felt small, but I suppose on normal took me four hours to conquer the galaxy while easy took only three. Easy mode is laughable. My first time playing, none of my vessels were ever damaged, let alone destroyed. Its a good way to get your feet wet, but about an hour in, there was no challenge. Normal felt like a good challenge, but there are still two difficulties.\n\nYou have a selection between twenty-four characters, eight within each of the three motivations for supremacy, harmony and purity. Each one has their own stat boost. One character has a 25% better this or that. Sometimes less cost, other times more of whatever. Some start with an extra vessel.\n\nI feel less stress and more joy playing this game than I do with Civilization games. Those other games feel like there's always a cold war and you need to prepare before the invaders come, while I feel like here I have my destiny in my own hands. I'm smart enough to win battles even when the game tells me that I have a 25% chance of winning. Its also a small game. When other publisher and developer are 4 GB large, this one fits on a CD at 650 MB. Must be all that blank space rather than terrain.","January 20","true","8.1"," 69 of 82 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","69","82","9","0"

The game seems very broken too. EPIC maps are fairly small and picking a victory condition seems to have no bearing on the ending at all. I've lost a number of games now where I picked domination as the victory and computer players have beaten me building wonders or having large populations despite not controlling most of the galaxy. Games rarely last 30 minutes or more. When you capture a number of planets, there is no central management screen, so you have to hop from planet to planet to build new cities or other improvements. It's really not what I expected.

It is a very short game. Personally I prefer the long drawn out building style or grand strategy games. This game can often be brought to conclusion (win or lose) in less than two hours, which for my personal taste is about two or three hundred hours too short ;) You are limited to one fleet which also makes it a bit too easy (no need to choose where precious resources are used)\nThe other problem that ties in with the above is that it then also tends to get quite redundant quite quickly (which does not mean it cannot still be fun! - I do have a lot of fun with it). There is a limited number of missions, which although randomized by the terrain do tend to be "always the same".  There is always a "Pirate Homeworld" and a "Marauder Homeworld". And since there tends to be very limited time you can't really get much into planing long detailed "reasearch paths", because the game will be over long before you reach your goal. Part of this can be alleviated by playing a domination game, but even then time will still be very limited.\nSo in conclusion:\nFun to play (thus the thumbs up).\nBut way too short.\n","April 16, 2015","true","44.5"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","35","38","2","1"

It seems like the start of a good game, but the gameplay mechanics are quite a bit mroe simple than what a couple of friends could come up with after playing Twilight Imperium for a weekend.  Tech trees are incredibly shallow, starships are not visually customizeable, and a few of the wonders are honestly a bit too wonderful. Dual Commands breaks pretty much everything, and the move-while-stealth one turns stealth into a gamebreakingly good mechanic.  I beat the game with untouched starships by just pumping my stealth up to the max and moving around plasma cannon-ing everything without any sort of retribution from the AI.\n\nIf you choose not to break the game, by ignoring the wonders, then the gameplay can actually be tactically rewarding.  Even so, while a board game like Twilight Imperium might have a dozen such space battles over the course of the game, literally every mission is a space battle and it gets very repetitive very quickly.  There are a few different types of space battle missions but there could be far more and, honestly, there could be more diplomacy as well.  Diplomacy in the game boils down to the other player giving a simple "take it or leave it" offer... no haggling, no asking for Planet X and I'll leave you alone, nothing.  What if they've got tons of metal that you need, but all they offer you to keep out is energy?  Well, guess you'll just have to go in and take it by force, because you can't even ask for it.\n\nThis is the first game I've played that I really felt had a "Sid Meier Markup".  If the game was just called "Starships", it'd be a $3-$5 tablet game.  Unfortunately, it's "Sid Meier's Starships" so it's a $13 game.  I almost felt the same way about Civilization: Beyond Earth, which feels very flat compared to normal Civilization games, but I stopped somewhat short because, honestly, a lot of that is a lack of "history" giving a real feel of advancement as a society rather than advancement as a tech-tree.  But with this game, I definitely feel it.  No strategic depth, no real incentive to pursue most of the technologies, and Wonders that make the rest of the game take a back seat in importance, and quickly push the tactical gameplay toward an undefeatable super fleet.  If you're looking for a good space empire sim, this isn't it.","March 22, 2015","false","25.6"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","35","40","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snowraven/recommended/282210/","Snowraven","Ravenblade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snowraven/","149 products in account","It's essentially a mobile game ported to PC and an offshoot of Civilization:Beyond Earth. From the settings, over the game setup down to the entire gameplay concept the game feels very light in terms of substance. You control a fleet and send it around the map to take over planets via tactical combat. You develop planets and do research. There is diplomacy, a market system and different victory conditions.\n\nYou may now think: This is wonderful! Exactly what I am expecting from a turnbased strategy game! Unfortunately, since it's a mobile port, the game lacks in all mentioned aspects.\n\nThe AI in tactical combat is not very clever and can be easily outmaneuvered, leading to repetitive combat making it, due to the lack of auto-combat, appearing like a chore after a while since scenarios differ very little. This cannot be offset at any time by the fact that you can customize your ships even though even that feels a little bland as it's more or less pushing weapons and speed to the maximum of level of 8 for each ship. Your ships also do not get destroyed per se but only suffer from repairable damage and based on random chance may also level up.\n\nPlanet development is based on four resources (metal, food, research and cash). Each resource has a resort function, food allows you to spam cities which in return allow higher production of all resources, metal allows you to build a select few different buildings up to an amount of 8. Research allows you to tech certain aspects of your ship up to a level of 6 while cash is solely used to upgrade different modules of your ships whereas ship class is almost meaningless as each ship has exact the same amount and type of modules.\n\nThe diplomacy system is as deep as billboard and the market system at some point a pain to use due to static and low exchange rates.\n\nEven though overall gameplay can be further tweaked through selection of affinities, victory types, difficulty level, map size and number of opponents I find its replayability degrading quickly. You are in fact better off playing a better space combat sim or just BE(RT).\n\nOverall the game can be quickly summarized and in terms of essentially being a mobile game: its gameplay depth and replayability is far lower than say Fallout Shelter is and that one, despite also being a different genre, is free.\n\nI don't expect much depth from a low-budget PC game but there are better choices for 14.99 €. I suggest not to buy it outside special sales events at a maximum of 7.49 €. If you are a hardcore TBS player I would skip it really unless you really feel the need to unlock those traits for BE(RT).\n\nFiraxis can do better but this game is really not adding anything positive to the genre, at least not on PC.","January 14","false","8.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","2"

After playing a few games, Starships fails to live up to either one of those titles; it is an unbalanced mess with very little replayability. The only reason to replay it is to unlock perks in Civ : BE. (Scroll to the end of the the review for info on this feature).\n\nAn iPad app at best, Starships is devoid of personality, customization and meaningful choices for the player.\n\nShip upgrades could have been this title's saving grace but after a certain point, all your ships will have impenetrable shields, lethal lasers and cannons and enough fighter squadrons to avoid combat almost entirely. For a game which is supposedly centered on tactical gameplay, this seems like a pretty major flaw.\n\nSadly, after a few rounds, brute force seems to be the only way to win the game. Once you have built a few key wonders and expanded your empire beyond 3-4 systems, the game becomes one of patience as the player waits to see his galaxy coverage slowly reach 51%.\n\nPros :\n\n- Great Art for mission summarys. Might not be your cup of tea but I really like it.\n\n- A full game session from start to finish can take from an hour to an hour and a half.\n\n- Playing Starships unlocks new perks/loadouts and maps in Civ : Beyond Earth.\n\nCons :\n\n- No option to play fullscreen. The settings menu makes it painfully clear that this is a port of a tablet game. For a company like 2k/Firaxis, this is inexcusable.\n\n- Most of the textual descriptions and "story elements" are nothing but flavor text.\n\n- Diplomacy only serves to artificially lenghten the game.\n\n- No customization; you cannot rename starships, planets or change the colors of your spaceships. Funny as this is one of the bullet points on the game's store page.\n\n- The end game often occurs without player input. More than once I've won the game because the AI did something which triggered something else which gave me victory. No way of knowing what exactly happened.\n\n- Sound guy annoyance : A capital ship explodes and the sound it emits is that of a single person screaming in agony. Rookie mistake.\n\nTo sum it up, the game feels unfinished, untested, unbalanced and unpolished. I have nothing against shorter games or games with more limited scopes (Ace Patrol was a great example of this) but this just feels rushed. There are many ways to better spend 15$.\n\n\nA note on My2K\nThe connectivity between  StarShips and Beyond Earth is one of the redeeming (I use the term verrrrry loosely) values of this game. Achieving certain things in either game will unlock content in the other. The downside is that there doesn't seem to be a way to know what the requirements are for unlocking content, forcing you to play blindly and hope that you eventually unlock something.\n\nNote that if you are currently playing a game of Civ : BE, a new option in the menu will allow you to <Continue Playing in Starships>. This saves the current factions, their affinities and alliances and allow you to start a new game of Starships with these parameters. Cool idea but it makes absolutely no sense in either game's narrative.","March 14, 2015","false","7.1"," 105 of 171 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","105","171","0","0"

This has got to be by far the dumbest-downed Sid Meier's game in history. Let me just list some things this game lacks that are just inexcusable in this age of gaming, no matter the price:\n\n1. Any form of Diplomacy or for that matter, interaction with other factions and AI players.\n2. The tutorial is hilariously lacking, even as a Civ 5/BE player with well over 1000 hours I struggled to understand what all I had to do and how to control the game both in battle and out of battle.\n3. Customization of your units by picking Harmony, Supremacy, or Purity at the beginning of the game ends there\n4. Basic information in tool tips is non existent\n5. Graphic Settings. Yes, that's right, there are absolutely no graphic settings. No resolution, no v-sync, heck you can't even change the brightness of the game. The only setting is full screen or not.\n6. Auto-Saves. Yep, there is no autosaves in the game, and no options to turn it on\nLoading from an In-Progress game. Made a mistake and want to reload? Sorry, exit to main menu and reload.\n7. Balancing is non-existent. On hard mode, factions will declare war with you within 5 turns of the game starting and will have ships that do ten times the damage yours are capable of. They will also take all of the planets possible, leaving you no resources to upgrade after your first turn.\n8. Settings in general are missing entirely. No key bindings, no controls explanation, no sound adjustments beyond volume level, no game customization beyond Race, Bonus, and opponents.\n\nHonestly, Beyond Earth stripped away dozens of features and I thought that this game was thier answer, that this would plug the gaping holes in thier most recent 4x Game. Unfortunately, they stripped it down even further to it's barest of bones, literally leaving you with a game so very simple that you can play with one hand on your mouse as you beat your head with a hammer held by the other hand for buying this game.\n\nDo not buy this game unless it's in the $2-$4 range, I'm not kidding, it's that terrible.\n","March 12, 2015","false","3.4"," 52 of 79 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","52","79","0","1"

Beyond Earth was hugely disappointing, so can the follow-up mend Sid's damaged appeal or is it time to hit end turn? Follow the link to find out.\n\nLets be upfront; Starships is a huge disappointment. Like a good PC gamer the first thing you'll want to do is hit the options button and change resolution and bindings and the like; good luck getting any of that. The game is simply full screen or windowed, though you can resize the window it has the feel of playing a tablet game on your PC - and I've looked favourably upon many a tablet/phone port in the past but Starships stinks of lazy.\nIt's not a bad looking game, resembling Civ 5 on medium settings but tough ♥♥♥♥ if your PC can't handle it because there's no graphical quality options to tinker with.\nWhile we're being upfront, there's no multiplayer either. If you're mainly a Civ multiplayer person then you'll probably want to skip right to the score and replace whatever number I pick with a big fat zero.\n\nThe most thrilling Starships ever gets.\n\nThat feeling doesn't subside with the actual gameplay either, you have one fleet of starships that you can upgrade and move around a randomly generated map. You can build more ships but they always go into this one fleet and no matter how much you upgrade them they're always one of a couple of classes and strategy is rather basic.\nLike Civilization combat takes place on a hexagonal grid, this time littered with asteroid fields of varying density that you can hide behind and which will lower the power of or block your shots entirely. Unlike Civilization 5 weapons have gigantic ranges of half a dozen tiles or more and more than one unit can occupy the same tile, eliminating what few tactical advantages the hex grid system had.\nThere's no point building a flimsy cruiser loaded down with torpedoes because the enemy can just shoot its long range lasers past your friendly units and take it down, for example.\nYour two main tactics come in the form of asteroids and stealth.\nAsteroids as previously mentioned will lower a shots power or block it entirely. It's not always a perfect solution but you can hide weaker ships behind partial asteroid fields and launch fast but flimsy fighters or torpedoes from safety.\nStealth meanwhile is a game breaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t button. Hitting the stealth button puts a ring around your ship, enemy ships have to get into this ring to detect your ship and fire upon it. It doesn't take many upgrades to bring this down to a one-hex or even half-hex size, making your ships almost entirely undetectable since the AI seems to forget sensors exist.\nCoupled with long range lasers, or even powerful short-range plasma weapons and you have a recipe for domination no matter what the odds. Throw in a wonder that allows you to enter stealth at no cost, activating it for free when you move which allows you to remain invisible and fire at the same time and you've got an instant win that'll allow as little as two or three moderately equipped ships to rampage across the galaxy freeing planets from your enemies influence often with no opposition as the AI attempts to preserve resources by not facing you for fear of being dominated.\n\nRemember that options screen from earlier?\n\nSome flavour is added to the combat via each encounter's random modifier, for example you might not be allowed to move directly right (referred to as "east" in game) or asteroid fields might disappear as the battle goes on, or shields might not work as well. They're minor, sometimes annoying and calling them flavour might have been a bit too generous because after four or five matches you'll stop reading them and just hit next.\nSecond on the flavour menu is battle cards, again random effects that buff your fleet for varying effects; perhaps adding an extra shield level or allowing you to move two spaces further or even repairing your ships or damaging the enemies. They're useful in the right situation but I've gone whole campaigns without even using one, mainly because my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stealth fleet was untouchable.\n\n\nOoh! Choices! Those are the default selections by the way.\n\nThe metagame is likewise light on stategy and content; you have crew morale/fatigue and that limits how many times you can move your fleet each turn. The idea being to jump between planets and secure influence to bring them into your empire in order to gain their resources and benefits.\nYou do this by taking part in randomly selected missions for rewards. Having them randomly selected is nice but the serious lack of them, I think there's only about 7 or 8 in total, makes for a lot of repetition even in a medium sized galaxy let alone over multiple games. The missions generally come in three flavours; blow something up, run away, or play king of the hill with an AI too stupid to capture more than one of the points.\nOne mission type I particularly hate, to the point that I let AIs actually take that planet and start a war to get it back later is the maze type. You either get limited sensor range or a limited number of turns and have to navigate a dense asteroid field set up like a maze, sometimes with enemies chasing you too. It's boring and stupid and if I wanted mazes I'd be playing a better game like Rogue, or Shining Force.\n\nGameplay: Still not that good.\n\nResources come in four flavours and have a single use each:\n\nEnergy allows you to upgrade your ships or add new ones to the fleet.\nMetals allow you to buy planetary upgrades and build wonders.\nFood allows you to build cities, improving the resource generation of planets.\nResearch allows you to research things (duh).\nCredits, lastly, are for buying the other resources via a Sins Of A Solar Empire style market.\nWhile I can't complain about the simplicity of the resource system, it does turn into a checklist of things to do every turn, since there's not much point holding onto anything because the diplomacy system might as well not exist so you may as well just dump everything into upgrading your own empire as soon as possible.\nThe only resource you'll really put any thought into is energy, because it's used for repairing damaged ships you'll want to hold a little back each turn in case of a disastrous defeat or, more likely, a ding in the paintwork.\n\nResearch is similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWonders make a return too, not every planet has one but many do and they're expensive to build but confer a powerful and ride ranging set of bonuses upon your fleet, and only your fleet.\nBonuses range from the almost useless Torpedo Boosters (extra torpedo move speed) to the must-have Cloaking (free and automatic stealth) or Fleet Tradition (fatigue doesn't lower your crew's performance), making your third battle per turn just as easy to win as the first.\nThe problem with wonders is that they're also a victory condition, having seven of them is an instant win so if you're late grabbing territory the AI can score an easy victory over you but this also backfires spectacularly as you can just let them build the wonders then go in and start stealing them out from under their noses.\nOf course, it wouldn't be Starships if they didn't manage to ♥♥♥♥ up the implementation somehow. Wonders aren't the only victory condition, but you'd be forgiven for thinking they are because it's so easy to accidentally win a wonder victory. For example, if you're going for a domination victory (holding 51% of all the planets) you'll have to grab enemy territory and their wonders along with it which leads to accidentally hoarding seven of the bloody things and winning via the condition you didn't want.\n\nToo long for Steam: Read the rest at http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk","March 22, 2015","false","4.2"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","4"

In reality, it's not even close. This isn't even Civ lite. The idea is cool. Instead of cities, you have planets. You send your eponymous starships on missions to help the residents of various planets in order to win them over to your side.\n\nThe glaring problems:\n\nYou get one fleet. The game is built around only having one fleet, so it kinda works. Just doesn't make any sense. Why would a space-faring civilization artificially limit themselves to a single fleet of eight warships? If this game didn't have Sid Meier's name on it, I wouldn't mention this. If it wasn't obviously meant to be viewed as "Civ in space," I wouldn't mention it. Want Civ in space? Go play the "Final Frontier" mod from Civ 4's Beyond the Sword expansion.\n\nDiplomacy is stupid. It's a ridiculously stripped-down version of the Diplomacy mechanics from Civ. You're always either at war or have a peace treaty with every other federation. If you're not at war, you can't move onto one of their planets. You must first declare war (using the diplomacy menue), then the move will be allowed. Here's the stupid part. Try this:\n\n1. Declare war.\n2. Conquer one planet belonging to enemy faction.\n3. Move to second planet belonging to same enemy.\n4. Accept bribe.\n5. War is over. "Enemy" will not attack you on their turn.\n6. Repeat.\n\nBattle AI is stupid. Enemy ships tend to stay in groups of at least two ships, making them very susceptible to torpedo attacks. Even if this wasn't the case, the AI hardly ever uses torpedos or stealth, making your opponents boringly easy to dominate.\n\nConquest is the entire game. There are apparently other victory conditions but I can't see why you'd pursue them, since this is a game about spaceships fighting each other for control of planets.\n\nBattle tactics quickly become about filling the map with as many torpedos as possible to make sure you take out enemy ships without having to get lucky. You could certainly swarm the enemy with fighters instead, or pump the crap out of your plasma cannons and stealth units, getting in close for the kill. The point is: any "tactic" you choose simply works. The AI provides no challenge whatsoever.\n\nI'll admit that some of these things might be the result of me only playing on "Normal" difficulty. I'm going to go try it again on hard but I'm not hopeful that I will meet a much greater challenge or that I won't be able to loop a war with one opposing faction at a time.","January 21","false","10.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

Diplomacy really didn't seem to add much and I completely skipped building cities and improvements on planets.   I played on normal and did not feel challenged at all; and beat it within about 90 minutes.  It might be a good game when it's on sale for like $7.50 but I wish I had saved my money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boonasaurus/recommended/282210/","boonasaurus","Boon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boonasaurus/","430 products in account","TLDR: A neat little game with some cool ideas, but mobile-game production values and a lack of long-term depth don't justify the $15 asking price. Worth picking up on sale or if you're desperate for some bite-sized light strategy, though.\n\nStore page description aside, Sid Meier's Starships is a turn-based strategy game wherein you try to conquer the galaxy. There are multiple ways to do this, but they all essentially boil down to building an unstoppable battle fleet and destroying your enemies.\n\nThe game is divided into two layers. On the greater strategic layer, you see the galaxy itself, taking your fleet from planet to planet and performing missions to convince the inhabitants to join your empire. The tactical layer puts you on a hex-based battlescape and maneuvering your individual ships to do whatever needs to be done (and almost always involves the destruction of enemy ships). Complete a mission to gain influence with the planet's population. Gather enough influence and the planet will join your empire wholesale. Of course, your rivals will be doing the same thing in their section of space.\n\nThe first half of Starships is basically a race for territory and resources, like in any classic 4X. Players will try to expand their empires, pulling in neutral planets and building infrastructure to fuel further conquest. Eventually, borders will start pressing up against each other, the galaxy will run out of neutral planets, and from there, it's a matter of the major players fighting it out to settle who will become space overlord of humanity. This is where things start to fall apart, as massive power swings can come out of nowhere and end a game without warning.\n\nThere are four victory conditions. Capturing all other players' homeworlds obviously wins you the game, as does maxing out three fields of technology, controlling seven wonders, or governing over half of the galaxy's total population. The big swings come out of the way homeworld battles work. When a player captures another player's homeworld, the losing player's empire is immediately turned over to the conqueror in its entirety. A player with 15% of the galaxy's population can shoot up to 40% or more in a single battle, or zoom past the seven-wonder victory threshold before anyone knows what's going on.\n\nThe actual starship combat is simple and easy to learn. Lasers have long effective ranges, while plasma cannons boast superior firepower once you can bring them to bear. Firing one means not being able to fire the other that turn. Torpedoes have a delay before they can be detonated, but are effective at area denial. Cloaking technology can make ships untargetable if there's no sensor-equipped enemy nearby to reveal them. Strike craft are weak, but they're fast and they can be replaced and repaired for free. Attacking a ship from the sides or rear generally provides hefty increases in damage done, and doing more damage increases the chance of scoring a critical hit and damaging the effectiveness of a ship's systems. Controlling various wonders, as usual, allows a player to break some of these rules.\n\nThe economy side of the game exists purely to support the combat side of the game. You will not be building fantastic monuments and converting heathens to your banner using the power of your culture. You will not unlock the mysteries of the universe that bring your people to a new stage of enlightenment. You will research bigger guns, heavier armor, and more efficient engines for the ships. You will build ships, or you will build factories that build ships, or you will build factories that build factories that build ships. All roads lead to ship. The ship is love, the ship is life.\n\nSpeaking of the ships, customization here is kind of weak. Rather than picking and choosing modules that change the way the ships function, you simply pick a category, choose a rating from 0-8, spend the requisite amount of ship-specific currency, and move on to the next. There's a certain amount of technique involved in weighing tradeoffs between speed and armor, or pure firepower versus stealth capabilities, or fighters versus torpedoes, but if you're looking for omnidirectional shields, stealth torpedoes, point defense cannons or any kind of customization that's any more complex than making one number larger than the others, you'll have to hope that there's a wonder that'll serve your purposes.\n\nSid Meier's Starships was released simultaneously on PC and iOS, and it really shows. The UI is clearly designed for a mobile crowd, and it values clean visuals and uncluttered space above all else (including, at times, functionality). The ingame options menu is a joke, consisting of volume sliders and the options to turn tutorials and fullscreen mode on or off. There are no resolution or detail settings, which might be for the best because there's not a whole lot of detail to be had in the first place.\n\nInstalling modules on a ship changes the model itself, but those changes don't exactly carry into the battles themselves. A battleship bristling with weaponry won't show off all of its guns firing with separate particle and lighting effects, just a slightly-larger salvo of lasers inexplicably curving in space as they approach their target. The backdrops and leader portraits have a painted look that washes them clean of finer details. All leader audio has been lifted from Civilization: Beyond Earth, and the only other voicework ingame consists of short combat barks along the lines of "critical damage" or "nice shot." Completing the game, regardless of method, affinity, or faction, yields the same unskippable victory cutscene (yes, a PC-centric developer released a game with unskippable cutscenes). If another player wins, their victory is announced with a quiet pop-up before the game unceremoniously dumps you back to the title screen--a title screen that lacks a proper exit button.\n\nSid Meier's Starships boasts connectivity with Civilization: Beyond Earth, but you have to sign up for a My2K account to take advantage of that connectivity, and I'm not interested in juggling yet another set of login data. I doubt that it's a game-changer for either game, but I could be wrong. Either way, it's the cherry on top of the Bad Mobile Port sundae. As a proof-of-concept, Starships is great, boasting several ideas that I hope can be refined and make their way into future games (flanking-based damage, one randomly-determined wonder per city-equivalent, mission-based diplomacy), but it's all buried under a huge pile of the stereotypical money grab (content gated behind company-specific login, subpar production values, halfhearted PC port, gameplay that bottoms out within three hours). It really feels like an iOS game that got ported to the PC as an afterthought, and for $15, you might as well catch a good movie instead. Starships is a decent guilty pleasure, but I'd only recommend it if you can catch it on sale.","March 13, 2015","false","5.6"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","0"

If you are looking for a game with spreadsheets and lists, this is not that game. If you're looking for a game where you command hundreds of ships divided into multiple fleets, this is not that game. If however you're looking for a lite 4x space strategy game that includes tactical combat and can be played start to finish in a few hours, then this might be worth consideration.\n\nThe unique element of this game is how it's focused around your single fleet of ships. In the beginning of the game, the fleet is not very strong. However given enough resources it can grow in size (up to 8 ships) and strength to become a formidable force in the galaxy. You'll be faced with the decision of choosing between engines, shields, armor, and different weapons. Do you continue to upgrade your existing ships or buy more ships to add to the fleet? Do you choose speed over armor? Do you build out your ships for specific roles? What tech do you research to compliment your upgrade strategy? Then there are wonders which further enhance your fleet and can provide huge advantages. You'll also find battle cards which provide bonuses during missions.\n\nAnother fun element of the game are the missions. When you visit other planets you'll be faced with missions that range from escorting transport ships while protecting them from pirates, escaping with sympathizers aboard your flagship, defeating waves of attacking ships, and so on. Successfully completing missions will provide influence or other rewards.\n\nAs for the complaints about this being a tablet or mobile game, it is true that the options screen is missing some common options available on PC games, the game isn't a true full screen in that the taskbar isn't hidden, and the screen doesn't scroll automagically when the mouse hits the edge. However none of these things have prevented me from playing the game. The map can be moved with either the arrow keys or the left mouse button. The taskbar can be set to auto-hide if it's that distracting (or just deal with it). In regards to price, I do think that PC gamers unfortunately do end up paying a premium over the mobile platforms. This isn't the first game and it won't be the last.\n\nFinally, in regards to expectations, I think people saw Sid Meier's name along with this being set in space and left their expectations unchecked. First, the low price point should have been a major indicator that this wasn't going to be anywhere near the scale of a Civilization game. Second, a Sid Meier games doesn't automatically infer an epic game. The past few years 2K/Firaxis have had smaller Sid Meier titles such as Ace Patrol, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies, and Civilization Revolutions which were on the mobile platform.","March 13, 2015","true","8.3"," 97 of 166 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","97","166","3","7"

They ARE basically what I look for in a PC game and have brought me years of enjoyment. Now we have Sid Meier's Starships, which I'd been waiting for excitedly after the surprisingly great jump to space in Beyond Earth. Unfortunately this game is absolutely horrible. The game lacks that compelling desire its predecessors have to play and defeat it in all ways possible, or even explore the game or the world(s) within, because the interface is awful and the "story" throws you into space to do unexplained busy work.

For the price, I would be happy with it as is, if the few gameplay settings they provide actually did anything to change the game.  I set Victory Conditions to "Domination" only, changing it from the default, 'All' setting.  I expect to be able to play until I completely conquer the AI players.  Why then, does it tell me that I lost the game, with 74% of all planets, to an AI Player who achieved a 'Science Victory' with only about 12% of the planets.  It happens that way no matter how you try to set up the game.  There's never a warning of any kind, just suddenly, BOOM, game over.  I don't want to say I wasted $15, but until they correct this, playing the game is pointless.  Without being able to set it up how you want to play, there just isn't enough here to justify it.

I *do* find the game enjoyable as a general time-waster, but the game is basically unfinished.  I really, really, really wanted to be able to recommend this game....  I honestly did, but as it stands right now the game is far too buggy, its rules too simplistic, its tactical combat far too imbalanced, and that results in an experience that is frustrating and extremely shallow.\n\nI've been playing on easy and, as expected, the AI hasn't really surprised me.  In 10 hours I haven't lost a single battle.  However, I've also lost every single game.  How can this be possible?!?  Well, it's because the victory condition system is horribly broken for the type of game this is (similar to how it's horribly broken in Beyond Earth, only worse).\n\nIn every single case, I've been defeated by a Wonder victory.\n\n"Disable Wonder victories and just allow a Domination victory then!  Problem solved!"\n\nYeah... that's what I've been doing, and it doesn't work.  So I decided to shift my tactics and aggressively go after building wonders... which worked until I got 65% of the galaxy and the rest of the enemies all spontaneously decided to join up together, resulting in a collective Wonder victory.\n\nI am literally cleaning the floor with the computer AI and it just declares victory with ... math.\n\nAnd that's possible because at its' heart, all this game is ... is a linear resource race.  Every. Single. Aspect of this game is a linear resource race... and victory would be entirely guaranteed if the Victory system wasn't totally broken.\n\nI really wanted to like this game.  I had really high hopes upon reading it and, like I said at the beginning, it's a fantastic time-waster... but the game needs more than bug fixes to solve its' issues.  It needs a rules and mechanics redesign, so I really can't recommend it.\n\n\nI guess at least I don't feel cheated.  I got almost 10 hours out of a $15 game and something should be said for that.  I think the people who worked on this game honestly cared about it, and I think the same is true for Beyond Earth... but ultimately I feel like I just keep dumping money into this franchise because Civ 5 was so darn amazing.  Unfortunately, Firaxis has been basically unable to live up to that triumph with both offerings.\n\nI hope that both Beyond Earth and Starships go through an overhaul to fix these massive issues... if that happens, I'll happily return and rewrite this review.\n\nUntil that happens, I can't recommend Starships.  It's far too broken right now to do so.\n","March 17, 2015","false","27.6"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

Sid. You're better than this mate.\n\nDon't have an immense amount of time to write a review. But I will say this. When Civ V came out, many people (myself included) saw it as a dumbed down and lesser version of Civ IV. Then they largely fixed this by the time of the last DLC. When Beyond Earth came out it was and is a dumbed down reskin of Civ V with no relation to Alpha Centauri like we were all hoping. Only time will tell if they fix that.\n\nThis...I can't even draw a comparison to previous games. Its an insult to Beyond Earth that it is in any way tied to that game just as much as Beyond Earth was an insult to Alpha and Civ V.\n\nTerrible, terrible game. Glad I got it at a reduced rate but I still feel like I have been ripped off at £8. Please do avoid this.

You will find at some point you're either going to have to betray your allies or make peace agreements with them which completely block you from travelling into or through their territory to reach new unclaimed planets, this can lead to you getting completely isolated and unable to progress.\n\nThe game needs a lot of work, it has the workings of a great game, but it feels as if it hasn't been worked on enough yet, the UI needs to be more engaging and helpful, think back to Civ 4 and 5, while Civ 5 did not offer as much as Civ 4 did in terms of the advanced customization of how you can play the game, both titles gave you enough to build yourself an engaging and immersive experience. It seems the developers have been limiting that customizable freedom which has been such a defining feature of the Sid Meiers Franchise, starting with Civ: Beyond Earth and now with Starships, I hope the devs are able to look back to the past and remember what made their games so successful and work on keeping their reputation alive.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of this game right now is that it feels more like a mobile app which is what it has also been released for, and right now it seems as if it has been limited more for the mobile app platform, rather than developed as a fully functioning game that can stand the test of time on both platforms. While smart to break into the booming market of mobile applications and mobile gaming, I feel they should of perhaps decided on either releasing a standalone mobile app, a desktop exclusive release, or simply put more effort into developing the game mechanics and elements further.\n\nAt the moment I cannot recommend it, for the very simple reasons that I don't believe you will get much enjoyment out of it for too long in it's current state, and is certainly not worth it's current price in what it offers.\n\nI look forward to following where this game goes next, and what the supposed cross-game functionality with Beyond Earth will offer (it seems to me that whatever that feature is has not yet been released), but for now I'll be letting this one sit in my library.","March 13, 2015","false","1.4"," 47 of 80 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","47","80","0","3"

Most people have had a beef with this Sid Meier spinoff game because it doesn't look or feel like any of his similar 4X games. This one is built for speed and playability, but still has depth if you want to go deeper on the building and resource explotation aspects. Most fans of the regular Sid Meier games who expect something like it in Starships aren't going to find it here. However, if  you take the game for what it is, a 4X lite game where you can jump in and finish a game in under a half-hour when you just want to jump in but don't want to play something that's going to suck you in for hours, it's quite satisfying.  It does have some downsides, the integration to Beyond Earth is kind of a throw away feature that seems like a a good idea never brought to fruition. In any case, I would still give this one ups if you want a "Sid Meier's Light" game in your collection you can play with a non-gamer cousin.","December 9, 2015","true","28.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Unfortunately, it is not worth $15.00. I would pay maybe $5 for this.\n\nI'm just including the negatives, I had a good time play/learning but I don't think I'll be investing too much more time into this as it doesn't have the "Yes I've won" satisfaction of other strategy games I've played even though it has a really fun combat concept (execution was a bit off but you'll read why below). The "grand strategy" portion was very mobile-y which is okay since it never claimed to be anything more but a man can dream...\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nThe game features only 8 leaders. The affinities from Beyond Earth are there but I didn't really notice a worthwhile impact of including them when it comes to gameplay.\n\nNo tutorial, just "this how things do" page before the start of a game.\n\nCustomizability of the ships is awesome but not reflected in gameplay (lack of clarity of weapons/shields, vision not really helpful).\n\nThe wonders offer diverse spread of gameplay modifiers, however some are way more powerful than others and the planets determine what wonder is available so there is a luck factor involved (not bad, but annoying).\n\nPrice scaling on techs/wonders didn't seem logical at all to me.\n\nIn terms of combat gameplay, there are a few graphical glitches that were distracting but not hindering.\n\nNo obvious tell of what weapon I would use in what situation, so I kinda just upgraded both (lasers and plasma cannons).\n\nScanners and stealth didn't seem that relevant in combat unless the always active stealth wonder was owned.\n\nThe lack of pre-battle deployment was the biggest negative of the combat. Sometimes my "carrier" type ship would be spawned on the frontlines with my "corvette" type ships in the back.

Im not being sarcastic but thats how long my game lasted. I accidentally went to war, won a battle or 2 but was not quick enough to pull a "suddent-death" population victory. It was that quick. Certainly not worth 14.99. I would have liked and expected something more indepth- social engineering, ship design options, a Federation-esque council, an interface that reflects my affinity, maybe even a full screen presentation. Yeah, the Civ series was never one to show awesome graphics in units. The tradition still carries on with Starships. The ship designs look more like sprites from an old 2000s or late 90s game. Eitherway, its not detrimental. Its just I would have expected to see more in that arena of a game with the title "Starships".\n\nLike other Civ games, opponents are placed way too close to me. Most interesting was that I was placed in a corner in Starships. Where is the buffer- the exapnse of space/planets that allow me some peaceful expansionturns? I know this is a civ simulator, war is going to happen but I always wonder why the AIs are spaced out but I am placed right nextdoor to an AI.\n\nDiplomacy and/or War Room screens, like BE, are paintings. Nice to look at but offer nothing in terms of universe immersion. I can overlook the short game, the bland UI or cartoony ship models. But I am tired of seeing paintings. Give me a reason to care about my people, show me videos for Wonders (What is the Dadaleus Ladder?), show me more background on the faction leaders- do something! Please!

Crashes often on start or when winning. There's really just a hand full of different unit types, and realistically you ever have access to three of them. The integration with Beyond Earth is a neat idea, but it really adds nothing of real gameplay value. Some buffs, etc, but it doesn't make the game any more interesting, just easier, which it doesn't really need help being.\n\nDiplomacy is limited, as is what you can do with planets, so there isn't really a diplomacy "win". Most planets have a wonder, which makes the "culture" win objective really easy. Most of the objectives are rather easy now with how extremely streamlined this game is, with population being at 51% (you can pump up the population of your planets infinitely with city upgrades) and conquest being the regular old "kill everyone", which is now by far the hardest objective to aim for what with population boosts from taking over enemy federations.\n\nA lot of AI behaviors are locked off behind difficulty walls, so if you play normal or whatever you'll usually never see AI get aggressive enough to invade your homeworld. I kept digging looking for some sort of "rare" encounter, planet, etc, but it seems like no matter the difficulty or size you'll probably see most of everything.\n\nI've definitely played worse strategy games, but I feel like the Sid Meier name gets affixed to titles that tend to have some depth. I came in thinking this would be something like a "Civ lite", but it's more like "Civ barebones" with just the most basic of gameplay elements left to the Sid Meier name, almost to the point where it looks like a halfassed attempt to clone the Civ franchise.","April 11, 2015","false","11.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

One of them spawned on either side of me, and both of them took influence away from me on the first planet I visited and gained influence.  Then I took a mission where you had to escort a colony ship to a jump gate, and every move took 2 HP away from every ship.  There was no way to heal, and there were too many spaces between the ship and the gate for it to survive.\n\nI cannot believe how dumb this game is.  I was expecting a 4x game, like a Civilization in space.  Instead, I got an epic failure of a game.  I was very excited to play it, and now I'm completely turned off.  This all happened in about 10 minutes of gameplay.  I don't even want to give it another chance, because it's not even the right type of game.  It looks like a 4x, but wow does it fail.\n\nAlso I want to add that the user interface blows.  I expected to be able to interact with and rotate planets when I was zoomed into them, but no.  However, you can slide the top of one of the lists up and down in a klunky, unnecessary and superfluous way.\n\nSid Meier made one of the most brilliant games ever in Civilization.

Also, there is no Quit Game button so you must hit escape of Alt+F4. The gameplay is very one dimensional, you have 1 fleet that goes around to different planets to accquire them by completing a mission. The missions are tedious as your ships have to slowly move around to destroy the enemies. There's almost no strategy involved and with no auto-complete option it's a chore. At the macro level, all you do is level up your planets and fleet - that's essentially the game in a nut shell so it's a very slimmed down version of any Civilization game.","March 19","false","4.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's pretty basic.   In fact it feels like it was designed for the Commodore Amiga  30 years ago... If I had played this game 30 years ago I probably would have thought it was brilliant.\n\nIt's missing many of the things that we take for granted in PC games, like fully adjustable graphics options and the ability to run in full screen.  The mouse controls are clumsy and you can't scroll by moving to the edge of the screen like in other Sid Meier games.\n\nAt least if it had been a DLC it would have been able to use the in-game display settings of the base game.\n\nSadly I cannot recommend this game. It's the first Sid Meier game that I'v ever been disappointed with...\n\n----\n\nA quick addition for people who think this game could never have been done as DLC:\n\nIt wouldn't have been hard to get this to work as a DLC.\n\nThe game may look different, but it uses the same basic engine (albeit greatly slimmed down). All they've really done is replace the flat terrain maps of Civ with a star field and planets and replaced the normal ground and water based units with space ships. It's basically CIv trying to give the impression of space when it's actually just a 2D hex based RTS like all the other games in the series. Basically the ships aren't flying through space, they're moving along an invisible ground plane, or the equivalent of, with a star background replacing the terrain we normally see. With all that in mind, it wouldn't have been all that difficult to add the maps, units and other features to the main game. There's nothing in Starships that couldn't have been accomplished in the base game.\n\nIt could have been an add-on for the base game, and added new gameplay features, in the same way that The Sims add-ons often add in new features that weren't built into the base game, but expand upon the original game mechnics.","March 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","20","33","2","3"

NO ITS... a bunch of space hippies in green ships planing on stealing my planets... darn...\n\nat first glance this game is something to be admired. It takes Civ BE, and expands the story into space and allows you to unite planets colonized by humanity during our exodus into the stars into your federation. So i thought "WOW COOL ITS LIKE CIV... BUT IN SPACE!!!" i was quickly given the idea of galactic Civ games, with a touch of that good old Sid meier's magic. and who wouldnt want some of that magic!?! Those damn space hippies thats who!\n\nThen i was hit with a game i can only describe as a briliant and stunning idea... that was hastily designed with the sole intent of making a quick buck based off the name brand...  this game would be perfect... if it were for Iphone IOS or the like. The only justice it does to the sid meiers name... is that it has the name "sid meiers" in the title. while visually decent, the animations for combat (I.E. explosions, weapon firing, movement, missiles and ship destruction and what not) are just... no... to call them bad is giving them too much credit. The voice acting for the combat senarios are just as bad. Every civ leader from BE who has been "expanded" in this game all share the same dialog with their predecessor. and the game just tosses you into the map with a horrible "tutorial" if it can even be called that, with an equally bad user interface... the tech tree is very strange at first, the way you gather resources and spend them was confusing, and from my very small amount of play time all i have seen are the same ships with different extentions on them, nothing different or new, just different shiny objects on your already similar body ship.\n\nit makes me sad writing this review... i want to give it a thumbs up... because i have never thought bad of any sid meiers game... I want to like this game... i really do... I am a huge fan of the sid meier's brand and absolutely loved Civ V and even BE, to an extent (personally i feel like they need to add more DLC's for BE creating religion and a united nations like body like the expansions for Civ V did), but this... this just made me a little sad. maybe in time with some patches and tender love and care, this game can truly blossom into something beautiful like it should have been. but it seems sid meiers has fallen into the "lets dish out as many "games" as we can and profit from them because our fans will pay anything for our "products"" pit just like ubisoft with Assassins creed, and the publishers for Call of duty. I hope this was just a test run for an idea, and that they will expand this game... or at least expand BE... because ive been waiting for that for a long time and it doesnt seem to be going anywhere.\n\nAll i can say is that if you want to put forth the money for this, go ahead. Maybe you will enjoy it? and i hope you do because that is what i wanted for myself. however, as of now i have to say im truly dissapointed in this game in its current state. maybe in a month or two il come back and see a picture of what it should have been, and i will change it to a thumbs up... but for now i just see something that could have been the greatest thing ever, and fell so far short of its potential.\n\nlike when god gave me a llama farm, and yet i cant ride one as my trusted steed to school. life can be so cruel at times :/","March 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

However, after about 4 hours, the fun is starting to wear off for me. There's more cons than pros for this game. I'm really on the fence about recommending this or simply saying skip it. On the one hand, it's fun for a few hours, on the other it gets repetative and isnt very immersive. I'll only recommend it if you want a change of pace and have the $15 to blow.\n\nPros:\n\nStrategy-based gameplay is fun at first. You have to plan your moves around asteroids, debris fields, etc. You have to pay attention to which way your ship is facing, manage your weapons systems and keep track of enemy movements. Once you get past the initial learning curve (there's really no tutorial aside from some "advice" boxes) it's easy to play through. Upgrading your fleet and managing your systems is easy (perhaps too easy).\n\nEarly on the game is challenging. Go into the wrong system and you might run into a fleet of carriers while you only have three cruisers. However, there is no shortage of "easier" battles to build up your fleet.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's repetative. After you expand your fleet and upgrade your ships, every battle becomes repetative and very one-sided (in the player's favor). I was pretty much destroying every fleet I encountered with little resistance (this was on the medium difficulty setting). I have a feeling regardless of the difficulty, once you reach a certain level of upgrades and fleet size, every battle turns into move ship, destroy enemy, repeat.\n\nSystem management. You can upgrade each planetary system by building cities, and resource generators (food, energy, etc) but again, as the game progresses it becomes unbalanced. Every time I won a battle, I had enough resources to pretty much build out each system with every module (food, energy, metal production). At that point there's no challenge to resource management.\n\nEnemy AI is not aggresive. I dont think I ever saw an enemy attack one of my systems. Again, this makes the whole game too easy and too one-sided. Since the AI never takes over my systems, I just continue to expand and build my fleet.\n\nShip upgrades are confusing at first and too simplified. You basically increase the number of lasers, cannons, torpedoes and fighters. This isn't clear at first and I was left wondering if upgrading my weapons increased damage output or range or some other spec. Lasers or cannons are automatically chosen based on range - which I guess is ok but not very immservie. Increasing fighters gives you more fighter groups to launch. As you upgrade your ships, they also automatically change class (frigate, cruiser, battleship, etc.)\n\nTorpedoes are way overpowered. Put a torpedo in the right place and you can destroy any number of ships within the blast radius in one shot.\n\nVery little in the way of a tutorial. Some basic advice like "upgrade your fleet" or "research this technology". Aside from that, there are no real details on how weapons systems work, etc. Even the in game info section is lacking.\n\n","March 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxvector/recommended/282210/","maxvector","MaxVector","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxvector/","152 products in account","I think this best way to sum up this game would be to simply called it "pocket/mini sized strategy."\n\nStarships comes at a weird time Firaxis and 2K games.  Beyond Earth left many consumers wanting more and genuinely confused.  Why did they charge for a full price game that amounted to nothing more than an expansion pack for Civ 5?   SO what do they do?  They make a game even smaller in scale than BE and charge much less for it.  I assume the strategy now is: "the price should match the experience" and what you get with Starships pretty much feels like a $15 game.\n\nI'll get this out of the way immediately: this is a mobile game that happens to playable on the PC.  What does that mean?  Well, it means that a lot of the complexity of the Civ series is stripped out and the player is left to make spot decisions and map movement choices.  The interface was clearly designed for tablet touchscreen.  The buttons are in weird places and the menus/screens are stripped to the bar bones essentials.  That said, there is an enjoyable strategy game to be played here.  Let's take a moment to talk about it...\n\nThe gameplay:\nPlayers familiar with Civ 5 will immediately recognize the hex grid format.  The player starts on the grid with a small fleet of starships and a planet.  Each "turn" basically boils down to this pattern:\n- Spend Resources on starships, planets and various upgrades\n- Move your war fleet to a new planet\n- Complete the mission on that planet (aka combat, more on this in a moment), thus gaining influence over that planet\n- MAYBE move again and do a new mission on a different planet\n- End Turn (aka Shore Leave)\n\nLet me touch on the combat scenarios (missions) on each planet:\nWhen the players arrives on a new planet that isn't already in their empire, the citizens of the planet will request help in the form of some type of starship mission.  This is where the real strategy of the game comes into play and the theme of "starships" really plays out.  Whatever war fleet the player has assembled is now used in a turn based mini strategy game.  It is important to note that SOMETIMES the mission doesn't use the player's war fleet but instead presents some type of puzzle.  But most (>70%) of the time the player must use his/her forces to defeat a squadron of NPC starships.\n\nThe battle scenarios are most similar to "war" in Civ 5.  Each mission is played on its own hex map (separate from the overworld map) where the player manuevers their starships and fires various weapons to destroy the enemy NPCs.    Each starship is its own character on the map so if the player has five starships in their fleet, they now can battle with five ships on the combat map. This is defintely the BEST part of the game.  This is where all the time spent buying new ships and upgrading them pays off.  The player can choose to stay back and use long range weapons to try and get up close and personal with fighters or close range weapons.  If the player is successful, they "win" influence over the planet and eventually it folds into their empire.\n\nThe players wins the entire game when they control most of the overworld map (or lose if they fail to do so).  I *think* its 70%. (Update: There are several victory conditions present but in my play time, so far, I have usually won by accidentally acquiriing 70% of the map.)  When playing on easy mode it is very easy.  Medium and Hard present much better challenges.\n\nThe truth is that the game isn't very deep.  Upgrading planets and ships usually involves just buying everything.  There aren't really any penalties or drawbacks.  Even if the player concentrates on, for example, energy production, eventually it all evens out.  And that's where Starships is arguably very weak.  This is not a deep game.  The best part of the game is the combat and the starships.  Everything else is nothing much more than a big map the player simply uses to move and drive the game.\n\nI found the $15 is worth it.  The strategy of the starship combat is fun albeit not engaging.  The game does retain the "one more turn" type gameplay but that's where it ends.  The overall, 4x strategy simply isn't present.\n\nBottom line?\n\nThis is a $15 strategy game and I recommend it based on the starship combat.  If you want a bigger strategy, with more depth, look somewhere else.\n\nFinal Score: C","March 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 36 of 66 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","36","66","0","0"

You and I have been doing business for many a year now, but Starships made me sad.\n\nMaybe it was the lack of options when choosing a leader (It seemed pretty redundent). Perhaps it was that I was able to win in less then 30 minutes and then instead of being to just roam and explore (as your other games allow) I am forced to start all over again.\n\nTo the Development Staff, The game is awesome looking. You did make sure that the game is smooth and very eye catching. Thank you for that. But maybe if you don't feel the need, you could maybe let this game open up so we can have the people step in and add to the game, open it up for more possiblilties.

I guess my expectations were too high for a $15 game. It plays like a game you download for free on your cellphone and then quickly tire of when it starts shaking you down for money. Everything about the game feels cheap, nothing screams AAA title, then again, I did not pay a AAA price. The game fails to deliver, in my opinion, or live up the Sid Meier seal of approval. I'm somewhat shocked that this would be the follow-up to what many people would consider a disappointment in Beyond Earth (which I happen to quite enjoy).

I really liked Civ V and the idea of a less complex, faster to play strategy game made me very curious. Eventually I got the game and have spent 14 hours with it. They really did strip down a lot of complex features. In theory, removing unnecessary stuff is a good thing to make the experience smoother and in this case less time-consuming. But for me, they also stripped down the fun part of the game. You have one fleet of ships that you can progressively upgrade. The upgrades don't really allow for specialization.

But it's a lesson called "How you can ruin the mixture of these games".\n\nHonestly BE has many flaws but it's a fun game overall. The fun facts are; 3 tendencies have a meaning, the story is cool,  science means a lot, logistics mean a lot, and it's a challenging game.\n\nFTL on the other hand is a small budget, short game with bad graphics. The adventure concept and clever micro control (over crew, weapons and economy) are what make it shine.\n\nNow first off take FTL - substract choices. Substract micro control. Substract clever battles. Substract any interesting encounters you may follow. Add stupid, meaningless battles. You move from system to system as in FTL but all you do is to click yes and blow stuff up. Add huge amount of resources that breaks ship development.\n\nSecondly take BE. Substract any meaning of factions (bonus wise and storywise). Substract meaning of leaders. Substract challenge. Substract story. Substract science (there is science in this game but it's the same thing with ship development, nothing new comes out of science except "your shields work 25% better). Substract logistics - cities are only additional source of income, they don't mean anything at all.\n\nImagine a Sid Meier game that anything, including tech, wonders and  buildings are done instantly with a single click - no planning is needed.\n\nEven worse, imagine a Sid Meier game that looks ugly.

The resource management is rudimentary. The story is nonexistent. The language is belittling (I feel it's condescending and dumbed down). There is ultimately no difference between choosing any of the affinities as the leaders all give the same rewards no matter which affinity one selects. This is a sad, sad iOS port to PC.  It's a vapid shell.   The starbattles are tactically childish.  I might have some challenge with the game if I were 10 years old and suffering from some kind of brain trauma.  Starships is a poor title as a few minutes of playing the game is sufficient to eliminate any exclamation the player might have expected.

The combat is kinda fun, and the simplistic universal overview is easy to pick up. That's about as far as it goes.\n\nIt is reminscent of other tactical space-combat games like Star Wars: Empire at War. Despite space being 3D, your ships can only move in 2D. The objectives are always some variation of "destroy target, get ship from A to B, or survive for x turns". Ship combat is sometimes satisfying, but otherwise plain and unoriginal.\n\nEmpire expansion has no real downside. You have a number of different resources which are used for different things. Energy customises your fleet, food lets you expand the population of a planet, etc. You gain resources at the start of every turn. You only have 1 fleet, and it's actions are limited by "morale". Morale is one of the only limiting factors in the game; once you're out of morale, your fleet cannot take any more actions this turn. Morale is consumed by moving or by instigating combat, and is fully replenished each turn. Lower morale makes your crew less effective in combat. Empire expansion is done planet by planet, and there is no downside to expanding your empire.\n\nThe key interesting feature of Starships is the fleet customisation. Ship classes are solely dependent on what customisations they are given, and every ship is 100% customisable witht the same base stats. You can experiment with what works and what doesn't, and come up with some interesting combinations. Ship size is dependent on it's maximum HP. For all intents and purposes, there is no cosmetic customisation options. What your ship looks like is determined by what your starting affinity is, and the stats you give your ship. I've enjoyed making different roles for my ships, from slower and tankier carrriers to fast, hard-hitting stealth assassins.\n\nAll in all, there are some interesting elements, but nothing that hasn't been done better in other games. If you're looking for a tactical space game, buy it when it's at least 50% off.\n\n---------------\n\nThe other review:\n\nSid Meier's Starships is, for all intents and purposes, an overpriced standalone DLC for Beyond Earth. It's main purpose is to unlock content in BE, and likewise BE can unlock extra content for Starships.\n\nIt's an interesting take on an expanded BE game, and people who enjoy roleplay and immersion might enjoy continuing games of BE in Starships (yes, you can do this). The unlockable content for BE might even be worth it.\n\nIf you're looking for a breath of fresh air for BE, you might want to look into this game (treating it as a DLC). However, I would recommend getting it at a discount.","March 13, 2015","false","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's relatively easy to learn how to play\n2. The controls are straight forward\n3. It's a quest like, planet upgrade system based, sci-fi starship combat game\n4. You can customise your ships with a range of weapons and/or defenses\n5. Turn-based tactical combat\n\nThings I hate:\n\n1. Ship upgrades have absolutely the bare minimum of information attached to them.  Want to know how much damage an extra point of "lasers" will do on your ship - sorry, that's just too much information for you to handle, so no.  Want to know how much damage a point of shields can handle - "you want to know the truth? well you can't handle the truth!"\n\nShield upgrade information says "damaged shields regenerate each turn", but during combat you have no idea what the strengths of the shields are or  by how much they've been damaged.\n\nThe truth is that there is about as much information on things like shield strength and weapon strengths that they may as well have said that this weapon upgrade will improve your firepower by three bananas and a pineapple and that would still have been more information than you're currently given!\n\n2. The tech tree is very simplistic, and every time you buy a tech, every other tech goes up in cost - there's of course no information that this is going to happen or by how much, because information is a dangerous thing in the wrong hands!\n\n3. Ship combat - well, suffice to say that I have found the path to victory is fighters - upgrade them to the max and equip a couple of fighters on each ship - by tech level 6, they're deadly and you can literally spam them out in sufficient quantities to overwhelm your foes without ever really risking your capital ships to any damage.  Of course YMMV...\n\n4. Wonders...they range from meh to OMGWTFBBQ!  And the great/sad news is they all cost similar amounts.  So if you're lucky enough to get the "two actions" wonder early on - congrats, you've probably just won the space race!\n\n5. The diplomatic options are so underwhelming, it's like some kids from kindergarden got together to try and form the UN and then realised that politics is just way too complicated for them and decided to go back to just playing cops & robbers.\n\n6. No multiplayer options :(\n\nOverall I rate this game about 6 out of 10 for the style more than the substance.  If you're looking for something deep, this isn't the game for you.","February 4","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's also some lightweight empire management in the shape of upgrading planets and making your ships shootier/faster/have invisible torpedoes, but 90% of your gametime is going to consist of: going to a planet, kicking in the teeth of anyone who looks at you funny, repeat until there are no more people who need to be kicked this turn.\n\nIt's definitely not a very complex space game—it's an iOS port, what were you expecting?—but it's pretty fun as a hex-based Battlefleet Gothic.

Don't go into this game expecting a 40-hour campaign and hours of careful planning, because that's not what this game is made for.\n\nStarships feels and plays like a very casual game-in fact, everything from the UI to the simplistic controls and systems screams that this game was built for a tablet or phone rather than a full blown PC. This isn't exactly a bad thing as the UI is clean and easy to navigate, with oversized text and icons.\n\nCombat is on a 2d hex grid, with various objects(asteroids, planets, etc.) either blocking vision and fire, or reducing the damage dealt when firing through them. Positioning, shields, and weapon types all factor in as well, giving just enough depth to combat to keep it from getting too stale.\n\nThere's not really any alien species, just different flavors of humans. All the ships have similar looks and feel, though you can upgrade their weapons and systems in anyway you want, which is neat. I'd have liked more variety but what you get is servicable.You can only have one 'fleet' on the campaign map though, which is a bit annoying.\n\nReally my biggest gripe with this game is in the achievements, as you need Beyond Earth (or at least a save game from it) to perfect it.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nDecent buy, especially on sale. Scratches that strategy itch without needing 40+ free hours.","November 19, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game looked, to me, like XCOM, but in space!\n\nAnd it is. Sort of. When you're in combat, anyway, and most of the time you will be. Your starships exchange fire with enemies while darting in-between asteroids and moons, effectively using them as directional "cover". Space, it seems, is simply packed with asteroids (which I will admit is a little unrealistic), but nevertheless these debris-strewn starfields provide you with dynamic (and occasionally, changing) battlefields to fight upon.\n\nAside from that, combat mechanics themselves are quite simple. Mostly you will be attacking enemy vessels, and there are four ways to do it: With lasers (long range), plasma cannons (short range), torpedoes (area-of-effect), and fighter jets. For defense and utility, you have cloaking devices and sensor sweeps. That's it! These six mechanics provide the primary functions of your ships. While this may be too simplistic for some, they nevertheless provide enough complexity to allow for emergent tactics.\n\nThe only other way to change how your ships work is to build "wonders" for your civilization, and each one will grant your fleet additional powers. Usually this is fun, as the powers are interesting and vary widely, but unfortunately, it is entirely random as to which planets can build each type, and if a civilization gets lucky and acquires the best wonders early on, you will find that they have a distinct advantage over everyone else.\n\nI was a little disappointed that there weren't any customization options for the starships. Your ships will change shape when you add new modules to them, but there are no purely cosmetic options whatsoever (like paint jobs, etc). While that should be a minor gripe, it can actually become problematic when you are fighting against enemies that have ships that look almost identical to yours, and this happens a lot because there are only three types of ship construction, and a proper game has eight players.\n\nThe other main thing you do in this game, aside from fighting battles and building your ships, is manage your colonies. This part of the game is reasonably fun, but it mostly just boils down to looking at menus and spending your accumulated resources. There isn't a lot of depth here, and it seems to just serve as a bookend to the combat missions.\n\nThe diplomacy system isn't all that deep, either. Aside from declaring war and making peace, there isn't much else you can do - there are no trade agreements, no cease-fires or non-aggression pacts, really no minutae to speak of. This area of the game is sorely lacking, and in some ways does not even feel finished.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point. Polish! This game sorely needs it! I found plenty of spelling errors in the text, and the clunky animations in combat (particularly when ships explode) left something to be desired. It almost feels like the game was released too early, or perhaps the project was prematurely abandoned.\n\nThere's also a marked lack of features. For instance, there is no multiplayer! Why? This game would be a lot of fun against a friend, but instead you're stuck playing against the lackluster AI.\n\nOn that note, I think I should mention that this game is REALLY, REALLY EASY. Even on "impossible" difficulty, I found the game to be ridiculously easy regardless of the chosen win condition. The enemies are simply too easy to outsmart. Occasionally they will even take stupid actions on their own, like firing a torpedo point-blank into a planet or moon, causing area-of-effect damage to themselves and their allies. The AI seriously needs work in order to feel complete.\n\nFinally, this game is short. You're looking at only a few hours per playthrough, even with eight players and an "epic" sized galaxy. Certain win conditions can extend it, but the basic win conditions of "all" or "population" victories will end in extremely short order. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that this game is a more casual experience than you may be used to, especially if you're a Civilization fan.\n\nI know what you're thinking. I've trashed the game quite a bit, so why am I recommending it? The answer is simple. It's fun. The combat is solid and the empire-building is too, even if it's a little on the simplistic side. It's a great game to play when you've got a few hours spare and, perhaps, don't want to commit to starting a huge, long game of Civilization or Beyond Earth.\n\nI enjoyed this game, and I hope it will continue to receive support and updates so it can become the great game that it should be. For now, though, all I can say is that it's worth the money - If you get it on sale.","October 14, 2015","true","33.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My first game ended after 90 Game minutes, 90 ! Just because one Bot controled 51% of the Map, i found this extremly short, my first Civ 5 campain took me 3 days (with breaks don´t be afraid), i found this REALLY shortly for a Sd Meier´s Serie Game, so thats the first "bad" point the duration.\nSecondly I found it kinda bad that you can just and only have 1 Fleet with Max 8 ships, I mean their are pretty strong at the end, but it makes the battle during some very long  time witch is borring at all because the ennemy just make himself Invisible, and ten you can have some fun for Catching him !\nFor the fleet i guess that it would be kinda usefull to be able to make a second and third one, so, 1 for Missions , 1 for Defence or something like that, or i also dont like that if 1 of your ship get destroyed in battle, that after it it "comes"  back to your fleet and just need reparations, i mean it´s usefull at the begining when u only got 2 ships, but at the end, i had to fight and take like 10 planets and all the ships (mine and the one of the bot) were all max level, and it was very boring at all to do 10 times the exactly the same thing .!\nAnother Bad point which i guess is gonna be the last one, is the THAT THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER !!!! I mean for the sid meier´s Series it´s somehow a very shameful Ending !\n\nSo now the few good things;\n-Graphics\n-Missions (they dont repeat to much and are not similar at all)\n-Ship design which make the ships look like pretty cool !\n\nSo guys that was it from me,\nI hope you enjoyed it!\nPs: I´m just gonna like it because I like alot the Sid Meier´s Serie !","August 17, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Steam's returns policy makes it well-worth trying out and returning if you don't like it.\n\nI am not a huge 4X fan; but I enjoy Starships because while it provides a light introduction to the genre it also, IMO, provides a satisfying degree of strategy at the map level and tactics at the system levels of the game. Some people don't like the game because they claim it lacks depth, but I believe they haven't tried to play on tough enough difficulty levels. One of the things I've noticed about several 4X games is that there are a lot of turns where you don't do anything, you simply press the End Turn button and let things develop. There is NONE of that in Starships; every move and action count.\n\nThe game requires you to balance your ship capabilities with your play style. Do you like to use lasers at long distance? Or do you build ships and armor and Plasma cannons to mix it up in close? Fighters and Torpedoes can be cannon fodder and simple barriers to your opponents movement or, properly built, can be decisive scouts and salvo weapons that can devastate your enemies. The hex grid at the system combat level makes it look like a board game, but that is a refreshing change IMO.\n\nBalancing resources appears simple, but at higher difficulty, you have to build the right improvements on the proper planets to get maximum resource benefits. You should also connect your planets with Warp Nexus' to allow movement with no morale point penalties.\n\nStrategically, you can assault your opponent's planets to take Wonders away or deprive them of resources; or you can drive accross their empire, cutting off their fleet and allowing you to defeat the AI in detail.\n\nIn all, this is a simple introduction to the 4X genre, and on the Mac, where options are a bit limited, it is a good start.\n","January 1","true","186.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's not a lot of nuance to the game but then, I think, that's the best time. It allows you to pick up and play without spending lots of hours figuring out research trees or particular bonuses. Sure each planet has a wonder you can build and a resource they'll produce more of but, if I'm honest, you don't need to pay that too much attention. The battles are the fun part and whilst the maps in which they take place are a bit repetitive they're fun, engaging and the part of the game I look forward to the most.\n\nIn the end Starships is a game for a quick session. If you set the difficulty level down you can thrash out a game in around an hour or so and moving up the scale, obviously, makes things harder. Either way if you're expecting some kind of 4X competitor to the likes of Sins of a Solar Empire you'll be disappointed.

Starships is a small 4X game, which I guess you could say is like a Mini Stellaris. It takes 1 - 2 hours per game, but doesn't feel like a slog neither a really rushed experience. It is quite balanced in that matter.  It is a nice game to play if for example your internet is having a rough patch and you want something to pass the time thats quick, and isn't like a full blown game like Civ V is.\n\nThere are obvious problems though. The first is a lack of workshop, dlc or any further updates to the game. What you buy is what you will forever play in Starships, which is a massive shame as it could really work.\n\nIt also lacks a tutorial, but it is easy to pick up, graphics settings (though it is pretty lightweight) and biggest one: Multiplayer. Now for some this is fine, but they did miss a chance to build a decent multiplayer, that doesn't go on like Civ  ones to.\n\nIn conclusion, I do reccomend this game. It is pretty fun to play, but does lack certain things. If you hate 4X/Turn Based Strategy Games, this isn't for you.

But the lure of Firaxis is not so easily resisted.\n\nSadly, in this case it should've been. The sirens have once again lured us all onto the rocks.\n\nNow, full disclosure, I am writing this review with less than an hour of play time on this game under my belt. It honestly doesn't take all that long to get a feel for the game, I'm afraid. The entire thing was obviously designed for the mobile platform release first, and then reverse-engineered for the PC relese as an afterthought. It was bad enough when this was being done with console games...\n\nThe interface is a joke. The game starts off windowed, has no graphical settings to change other than setting it to "full-windowed" (And when IN "full-windowed" mode has no way to exit the game other than reverting to windowed mode or alt-f4... seriously, there is no "exit game" option on the menu.), and everything inside of the game was designed with a touchscreen in mind. And then there's the gameplay...\n\nIf you ever wanted a "simplified" version of a civ game, this is it. Tech tree? Nope. There's a set list of technologies, and you just level them up from one to six. If you get three of them to six, then you win a Science victory. Because you're smart. But what about unlocking buildings? Nope, there are set buildings ("Improvements") that you can make on planets. You build them, you upgrade them, they make more of resources as they're upgraded. You can build Wonders, if you stockpile a ton of Metal over a lot of turns, and then if you have enough of those you can win. You can win by standard Domination, but if you're playing against the AI be prepared for it to be its standard cheating self-- don't bother using cloaking devices. It will go straight for your position every single time even though it supposedly can't see you. (...why no, I'm not bitter.)\n\nPlanets have cities, cities produce metal, food, energy, science. You spend science to research tech. You spend metal to build improvements. You spend food to build new cities. You spend energy to build and upgrade ships. And... that's it. Everything else is going from planet to planet and fulfilling "missions" with your ships.\n\nOh, and they even managed to put one more annoying mobile thing in-- a limited amount of stamina! Yes, your fleet has a "morale" limit. It goes down each time you do missions, or travel. When it goes down, your crew becomes less effective. This keeps you from taking your potentially awesome ships of awesomeness from mission to mission, getting every planet to join your federation, all in the same turn.\n\nOh, wait, it's not really a turn. You don't hit "end turn", you hit "shore leave" in order to end your turn. It refills your morale. That's not made entirely clear, but that's what it does.\n\nThere's more I could bring up, but really I think you get the gist of it by this point. This is not a game worth spending $14.99 on. This is a mobile device time-waster that should be on an app store for $5 or so.\n\nI suppose we can at least be glad that they didn't put the name "Civilization" anywhere near it.","March 13, 2015","false","16.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Bad decision.\n\nI suppose this game performs quite good as a mobile game on iOS devices, but as a PC game it disappoints. A lot.\nThe game is just too simple, too small and too easy. After 2-3 hours of playing I've seen everything, been everywhere. There is just too little variety of ships, planets, towns, upgrades - in just one game scenario you can see and try everything. There is no "one more turn" syndrome - because every turn looks exactly the same.  And that's a shame, if only the game were bigger and more complex, I'd really like it.

However, it is still an excellent game in its own right, much faster moving and with better depth than Sid's Pirates, which is also a game I enjoyed.\n\nThis game is really quite reminiscent of a tabletop miniatures game combined with an extensive campaign system.  There really are three parts to the game:  resource development, resource allocation, and tactical starship combat.  The first two are accomplished during those times when you grant your crew "shore leave" -- a fancier way of pressing the standard Civ turn button -- and watching the enemy players go through their turns.  You have to upgrade planets, develop galactic wonders, repair damaged ships, conduct diplomacy, and research newer and higher levels of technological advancement.  At any point during or after this process, you can send your fleet into combat by attacking another system.\n\nThis, to me, is the most engaging part of the game.  The tactical combat has a distinctly tabletop feel.  If you've ever played Starmada, Full Thrust, Star Fleet Battles, Battlefleet Gothic, etc., this will be very comfortable territory for you.  The tactical play is straightforward but engaging, with you maneuvering your ships through asteroid fields and around planets trying to both find a clear shot while trying to hide your ships from return fire by using those same obstacles to your advantage.  The maps with asteroids aren't static, either;  the asteroids float about between turns, so you are constantly having to keep an eye on how the tactical situation is changing.  The graphics are absolutely stunning.\n\nThere are only three weapon types -- a short-range plasma gun, long-range laser, and slow but extremely powerful torpedoes (which can often kill a large ship in one shot).  I find that to be a little disappointing, as I think it would be great fun to design your own weapon systems, as can be done in Starmada.  Still, it gives enough variety to require you to think carefully and plan ahead as to how you will upgrade, employ, and protect your ships based on your resources and intended style of play (charge in, stand off and snipe, torpedo volleys...?).\n\nA few other things I wish were different:\n\n-- You can only have one fleet.  I'm not sure why this is, as I would far prefer the more realistic model of having fleets assigned to various sectors to reduce reaction times or enable pincer strategies and whatnot.\n\n-- It's easy, if you don't stay up on diplomacy and allow the AI players to gang up on you, to become quickly overwhelmed, as your planets are captured faster than you can recover and repair your fleet between combats.\n\n-- The diplomacy options could use some fleshing out, and I would love to see some espionage incorporated in the game.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 on my own ludicrously non-scientific grading scale.","March 15, 2015","true","124.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I do NOT recommend, even at a discount (I got it about $5 cheaper than its current list price).  Sometimes I wonder if Sid Meier even has anything to do with the things that bear his name anymore....

In addition to the fact that the game is quite limited in scope, it doesn't particularly add quite the connectivity to BE as expected and it falls short in the enjoyment arena too. For instance, the largest map available in this game is call EPIC, but should have been named EPIC FAIL. The time that it takes you to get through the game itself is short and that was a disappointment as well considering the amounts of time that you would spend on prior Civ games.\n\nIf you're a fan of Sid Meier or want to add on to your library, then go for it.

I didn't come to this game looking for the depth that VI and V offer--or an experience which would redeem BE (I disliked it in fact). Instead I looking for something that can scratch that X-COMy, Pirates!-y, and straightforward Civ Rev itch which this game handily satisfies.\n\nBonust points: Really reminds me of the 4x tabletop game, Eclipse--gathering resources, upgrading planets--extending your influence. Also a simiilar 'rubberband'  (escalating cost worker placement) mechanic keeps you from expanding too far too fast in the form of your crew's fatigue level. If you undertake too many missions, or travel too far your combat effectiveness plummets. There are ways to extend your crew's fatigue, but at the cost of resources which could be better spent improving the planets you control.\n\nThe game also does a fine job during missions as well. The battles are fast paced and satisfying, even addictive. I often find myself absentmindedly going on another mission when I already decided that the last one was the last one.\n\nPenalties:\nThey drop the ball in many places. To start, graphically, there's an appreciable difference between stylized and cartoony, and this game veers toward the latter. There's also ample room for imagination in the implemetation of weapon effects, and many missed opportunities to really differentiate the ship classes between affinities. The affinites are basically skin deep, and only add a starting bonus to the civ that chooses it. Another missed opportunity for depth is laying out the actual armament and defenses of your ships, ala Eclipse. There's no 'energy' cost however, for upgrading aside from the resource itself. Hence, with enough resources your could put every upgrade on one ship since there's no energy cap. Even FTL figured out a good balance in this regard.\n\nThis game isn't for eveyone but if you found anything I said forgivable or intriguing--for $15 dollars--this game is worth it.","March 22, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The unit is used in missions, which give influence with the various planets you visit; and when 4 points of influence are accrued, the planet in question will join your federation, giving you access to all it's resources.\n\nThere are several ways to win the game:  domination, population (controlling 51% of the population of the galaxy), science, wonder (building 6 wonders).  You can choose to have them all available, or just one.\n\nThere are a good number of leaders available, each with different skills, and with three different versions of each leader to choose from, allowing yet more customisation.\n\nDespite all this the game feels a little unfinished and clunky, and is frankly in need of a decent tutorial level - as it can be a little confusing to start with.  There's also no real warning when the AI's about to win, which would be nice - so something could be done about it, like in Civ 5.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game 7/10 as once you get to grips with things it's a fun game.  I'd like it to be longer, but you can't have everything.  I consider it worth the money.  Took me about 25 hours to complete it on the hardest difficulty, which made it about 50p an hour.","March 28, 2015","true","26.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Other then that, stay away from this game unless they make it more meaty in content.\n\nRecap:\n- Games too short\n- Focuses on too little\n- you cant even control more then one fleet\n+ you do get to import your civ game\n+ has some dam good tactis mechanics (even if you can see if you will kill them or not)  Only wish I could undo a move if I didnt get what I thought I would (like how sometimes you dont see what blocking you, or think it wouldn't have yielded that low of damage)\n\nwell enjoy for those that get it, and stay away if you dont like quick in your face battle games","March 13, 2015","false","7.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Simply put this is an extremely simplistic, mobile game, with the desire to be something more. Truely this game falls on its face once you start, you will immeditly notice how much of BE/Civ 6 has been recycled. I would have prefered an expantion to BE than this. it a nice concept but it lack almost everything to do with CIv, other than idea of having similar names. If this had multy, i may have been swayed towards enjoying out chessing my friends.\n\nThis is a single only game with very predictable AI, making the torpedos broken as ♥♥♥♥. many of the wonders in this are useless because they provide benifits that would only fool a human and not the computer. The wonder victory is too easy to win as well, I inadvertantly won just by building 5 wonders on the impossible difficulty. needless to say it is an easy game too.\n\nOut of all the people to select, there are all the sponsors from BE with the addition of one more person, many of them are pointless as there are some that are just simply more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than others. The afinity system is back, but only as a shadow. Unlike in BE the afinity system is a passive mechanic that something that does nothing to change how you play.\n\n........TL:DR.........\n\nWorth $2-$5 MAYBE......\nAt $15 i feel like i wasted money.\nMobile game quality.\nSingle only.\nStupidly simplistic.\nEASY\nWorth about 3h of play before you forget this exists.","March 13, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I loved it!\n\nA damn good little game...As a huge fan of the Ace Patrol games, Starships was right up my alley. Quick, brutal, and lightweight, it hits all the right notes for hex based combat with none of the clutter, something far too few developers seem capable of. What it lacks in the aerial flourish of Ace Patrol's dogfights, it makes up for with strategic depth, provided by the galactic map on which the player completes missions, sways planetary systems under his or her influence, and chooses either war or peace (war, let's be honest) with his or her neighbors. All of that, though, is contained in an easy to learn, easy to come back to little package of simple game mechanics we all know and love.\n\nStill, some things feel missing...The game promises modular shipbuilding and doesn't really deliver. What you get is a simple fleet of ships (of which you can only have one) with a handful of stats to be individually raised. Ship look is determined entirely by your choice of the Harmony/Purity/Supremacy triad of Beyond Earth. As stats are raised, the relevant modules on the ship will beef up and become more characteristic. That's pretty much it for modularity. I played around with specialization of particular ships (destroyers, carriers, etc), but as long as the empire is stable and able to produce resources, all your ships will end up a little same-y.\nAdditionally, the lack of any kind of story or scenario mode isn't glaring, but it would be welcome. Ace Patrol had real wars to draw from, granted, but this sets up like a Civ game without being as deep or engaging in the long term. Even just more control over the rules or map generation would go a long way.\n\nWhy it's for you...->You've been itching to play a lightweight hex based game\n->You played both Ace Patrols instead of doing real work until you ran out of game\n->Starships are cool\n\nWhy it's NOT for you...->You're looking for another 4X\n->You'd like to spend the next 10 hours glued to your desk chair\n->You, for some reason, think starships are not cool.

Or a step backwards ?\n\nWhen I think of Sid Meier Games, I think of complexity, good balancing,  time investment. If I think about the first day I saw Starships announced, I was very enthusiastic about a space game made by the creators of Civilization. I couldn't wait until the day it comes out on Steam, checking every day the time left.\n\nAnd then the time came, and I made the leap of faith to buy it and play it. What happened next not only puzzled me, it saddened me quite a bit.\n\nThe first time I launch a new game I always check the options menu to set up my audio and video settings. This time I couldn't find ANY graphic options and I started thinking of Starships like I would an unfinished/unpolished game. It felt like an Alpha version of a future game.\n\nNevertheless, I still wanted to see the game mechanics and what was in this game content wise.\n\nA couple of clicks and choices later I was in a brand new universe managing a planet and 2 starships.\n\n5 hours later and a few restarts I already finished the game on domination and I slapped my face because of the lack of a challenge behind the game.

It had potential and it was a very, very, very bad failure!\n\nOverall feeling for a PC game : 8 year old mentality\n\nI think this game is much more suited for tablets or phones.

I grew up on RPGs and turn based strategies, but I would play everything given the time and money.  That being said, I mostly stick to strategy, rpgs, fps, arcade, rhythm, ccgs, lcgs, board games, fighting games, etc\n\nI am going to tell you how I boiled the game down, and win relatively easily.  I don't have a sample size of 100 games, but I am 3 for 3 on easy, moderate, and hard, with max players, small and epic sizes, all 3 affinities, etc.  Impossible is the only mode i have yet to touch.\n\n#1 strat:  Fighters.  The names may not be exact, but here is what you need:\n\nDual Command Wonder -- allows ships to perform 2 actions per turn (but cannot Fire twice)\nHyperlauncher Wonder -- allows your fighters full movement when launched\n\nUpgrade as you normally would, engines, armor, shields, primary weapon.  Get more ships, 5 or 6 is a good strong fleet.  Then, get 2 or more fighters on every ship.\n\nHere is why 1 starfight is not good --> If you turn is to move ships up, and launch a fighter from each, opponent can move up, and destroy them easily.  So nothing is gained, your fighters are dead, effectively a waste of your energy on that upgrade, right?\n\nHowever, with the Dual Command Wonder, you can launch two fighters.  So even if half of them are destroyed, you are now up the other half on the enemy. If you have 4 fighters per ship, you can do that again next turn.  The Swarm is an achievement, and its a very real thing.  Make sure to science upgrade fighters 2 or 3 times for the random modules on them.  Even on hard, I had Fighters that could take 2 or 3 hits from enemy ships.  You can also use the Hyperlaunch to get a full move out of the fighters, and hit them, before they are destroyed, even if you dont have the dual command wonder.  Dual Command Wonder also applies to your Fighters, though all they can do is double impulse, or fire+impulse.\n\nThe rest of "how to win" is upgrade sensibly from the bottom up, find the cheapest thing, upgrade it first.  Get the most for your money.  BE SURE to get every planet a WARP NEXUS.  This will allow you to be able to protect all of your planets from any of your other planets.  You will be able to move between them without crew exhaustion.\n\nA note on torpedoes, use them to Zone the enemy fleet.  You can see where they will be in 2 turns, so aim for places you dont want the AI to move into.  If they do, boom they die, if they dont, fine they are in worse position and you get to move in.  Just watch out for their torpedoes, especially if they have stealth torpedo wonder.\n\nSo what will happen is, you do your turn, the AI does theirs, and if you have a strong fleet of Fighters and Warp Nexus upgardes everywhere, you can defend everything successfully, taking little to no fleet damage, meaning you dont need to repair or worry about attrition from battle to battle.  New turn, go dominate someone.  Survive the counterattack, and this continues until you finally win.\n\nI will say that on Hard, the AI fleets were better upgraded significantly.  They are more dangerous early on, so be a little wary.\n\nAll in all, a 1 thing beats all strategy means its not good gameplay balance.  But... its just comp stomp i guess.  So nobody can be too mad.  For $15 you will get your value out of it, but it doesn't offer any super great planning or depth of thought.  I was hoping there would be more to it, I thought you would be making separate fleets, possibly an actual tech tree, so on.  I don't hate what is there, I just think it could have been a little better.","March 14, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is already a guide available how to bypass/workaround the most issues, but some of this won't work for me. For example:\n\n1. Borderless Fullscreen\nThe game offers a borderless fullscreen mode to play. When you activate it, you still have your Windows taskbar visible. You can workaround this issue by using the tool "Borderless Gaming". This really works good.\n\n2. Not able to save the game\nIn some circumstances you won't be able to save the game: special character in steam user name, not running in admin mode, running the wrong executable (i.e. 32bit on 64bit). Most of this is not working for me. I really don't want to change my user name to be able to save in a game. That is weird. They should be able to fix this, other games (also Beyond Earth) works fine with saving. Also in Steam Cloud, so why?\n\n3. Game is crashing in the intro\nThe workaround described in the link below is not working for me. I need to just bypass the intro by clicking left mouse. If you forget to click, game over.\n\nFor me it seems the game had absolutely no testing at all. That would explain the price. My recommendation is currently to wait for a major patch that addresses the most issues. If you still decide to buy this game, then make yourself aware of the workarounds:\nhttp://segmentnext.com/2015/03/13/sid-meiers-starships-errors-bugs-crashes-full-screen-save-game-and-fixes/\n\nI will update this review once a patch is available and the game would maybe playable for me.

It has a similar feel and dynamic as Beyond Earth but I do feel....an almost...emptiness while playing it.  It's a fun quick game but I guess I wish it was a little more expansive.\n\nI like the fact that it is a Civ game with a relatively short turn around as sometimes it's nice to just play a quick game and be done with it rather than spending insane amounts of time saving and reloading the same game to infinity.  The lack of multiplayer/co-op is either a massive oversight or a shrewd strategy to market it to the tablet crowd (Android capability please and thank you).\n\nOverall if you like the Civ games, like Beyond Earth, and want something that is not going to take 5 days then this is your game.","March 22, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I grew up on RPGs and turn based strategies, but I would play everything given the time and money.  That being said, I mostly stick to strategy, rpgs, fps, arcade, rhythm, ccgs, lcgs, board games, fighting games, etc\n\nI am going to tell you how I boiled the game down, and win relatively easily.  I don't have a sample size of 100 games, but I am 3 for 3 on easy, moderate, and hard, with max players, small and epic sizes, all 3 affinities, etc.  Impossible is the only mode i have yet to touch.\n\n#1 strat:  Fighters.  The names may not be exact, but here is what you need:\n\nDual Command Wonder -- allows ships to perform 2 actions per turn (but cannot Fire twice)\nHyperlauncher Wonder -- allows your fighters full movement when launched\n\nUpgrade as you normally would, engines, armor, shields, primary weapon.  Get more ships, 5 or 6 is a good strong fleet.  Then, get 2 or more fighters on every ship.\n\nHere is why 1 starfight is not good --> If you turn is to move ships up, and launch a fighter from each, opponent can move up, and destroy them easily.  So nothing is gained, your fighters are dead, effectively a waste of your energy on that upgrade, right?\n\nHowever, with the Dual Command Wonder, you can launch two fighters.  So even if half of them are destroyed, you are now up the other half on the enemy. If you have 4 fighters per ship, you can do that again next turn.  The Swarm is an achievement, and its a very real thing.  Make sure to science upgrade fighters 2 or 3 times for the random modules on them.  Even on hard, I had Fighters that could take 2 or 3 hits from enemy ships.  You can also use the Hyperlaunch to get a full move out of the fighters, and hit them, before they are destroyed, even if you dont have the dual command wonder.  Dual Command Wonder also applies to your Fighters, though all they can do is double impulse, or fire+impulse.\n\nThe rest of "how to win" is upgrade sensibly from the bottom up, find the cheapest thing, upgrade it first.  Get the most for your money.  BE SURE to get every planet a WARP NEXUS.  This will allow you to be able to protect all of your planets from any of your other planets.  You will be able to move between them without crew exhaustion.\n\nA note on torpedoes, use them to Zone the enemy fleet.  You can see where they will be in 2 turns, so aim for places you dont want the AI to move into.  If they do, boom they die, if they dont, fine they are in worse position and you get to move in.  Just watch out for their torpedoes, especially if they have stealth torpedo wonder.\n\nSo what will happen is, you do your turn, the AI does theirs, and if you have a strong fleet of Fighters and Warp Nexus upgardes everywhere, you can defend everything successfully, taking little to no fleet damage, meaning you dont need to repair or worry about attrition from battle to battle.  New turn, go dominate someone.  Survive the counterattack, and this continues until you finally win.\n\nI will say that on Hard, the AI fleets were better upgraded significantly.  They are more dangerous early on, so be a little wary.\n\nAll in all, a 1 thing beats all strategy means its not good gameplay balance.  But... its just comp stomp i guess.  So nobody can be too mad.  For $15 you will get your value out of it, but it doesn't offer any super great planning or depth of thought.  I was hoping there would be more to it, I thought you would be making separate fleets, possibly an actual tech tree, so on.  I don't hate what is there, I just think it could have been a little better.","March 14, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes, technically you have to click a button that makes the ships get "built". There is 0, zero, nada, zilch, NOTHING that you do to influence this process otherwise.

No, the maps are the size of ... well let me give you an analogy: If space were the size of say the Pacific Ocean than this game is the size of a drop of coffee spilled on the table this morning.\n4.) Build - You already said build dipwads and saying it more wont make it any less of a disappointment.\n5.) Negotiate.... ummm are you friggin kidding me. The "diplomacy" function in this game is about as in depth as a teenager's world view. Let's break down the options: I like you/I hate you - Let's fight/let's hug.\n6.) Fight...

I beat the game within 2 hours on the hardest difficulty. It blended the Battles of Xcom with a hybrid and to be honest really crappy version of Civilization managment into one whole hot mess. While the battles were fun, they were incredibly easy and unsatisfying for a long lasting Civilization fan like myself. For a few dollars this game would be worth it, but sadly that would be charging a high price for it. The 22$ I paid for the pre order was a complete rip off.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeymadness/recommended/282210/","monkeymadness","Jimbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeymadness/","187 products in account","Sid Meier's Starships is a classic 4x strategy game, that plays very cleanly, and is very well thought out.  The first thing this game reminds me of is the old Master of Orion series.  It's planetary checkers with a touch of management thrown in.  With starships there is also tactical combat, which is where the player spends the majority of time.  That's fine because this phase of the game is also well balanced.\n\nI sometimes shy away from starting up a Civilization game (been a fan of the series since it's inception) just because I don't always have 3 days to spend to play through my own space epic opera.  Starships has just the right amount of story, drama, combat and fluff to keep me hooked, but I can finish a game in a couple of hours.\n\nBy fluff I mean this game has components that draw you into the story.  Each planet has a personality, and each empire mirrors what it's planets produce.  Because you are limited to a single fleet, you become very familiar with which ship has which capabilities, and they become a team you care about.  I find that the intro, the voice acting throughout, and the score really add to the immersion.\n\nWhile this game does remind me of MOO, I think many improvements in gameplay have been included, such that instead of making this the most complex simulation possible, its actually the most balanced and fun to play one that I've seen.  A single fleet at first seemed like a limitation, but it really only limits how long your turn can last, which means the game progresses quickly and smoothly.  Tehcnology tree is very streamlines, but it just makes it very clear that you need to spend your research points wisely.  Planet management includes one wonder option for some planets, and a standard set of upgrades for everyone.  You choose very quickly how to customize each planet, which for me, means you speed up gameplay.\n\nTactical combat benefits from slick, randomly generated systems, almost always with a plethora of asteroids to hide behind and navigate through.  Along with each combat, you are usually running a mission of sometype for the local planet, which helps give a purpose to the battle.  There is almost a rock paper scissors between beefy slow dreadnaughts, fast fighters, long range lasers, etc. that combined with random terrain and mission objectives works really well to deliver a unique and changing play environment, while still keeping it familiar with your fleet.  You can customze your ships entirely (at a resource cost of course) so you can build out what you need to defeat a particular foe, or try to hold the upper hand with your technology and wonder advantages.\n\nOverall I'd say Sid Meier's Starships is a great, fast paced, space epic that you don't need a whole weekend to get through.","March 22, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is NOT something you would expect from a Sid Meier's game.\nI do enjoy playing it, but I also see the short playability of it. Other games from Sid Meier's I can waste many days worth of hours playing. However, after playing this for only a handful of hours, it is already becoming a bit stale.\nThe technical and tutorial issues expressed in other reviews are (as of this writing) are true and in many ways annoying. They do not greatly effect the overall experience though. That is, to me, probably the saddest part of the whole thing. The game is so shallow that even though there are some fairly glaring issues, they do not greatly affect the game. Were they all fixed this instant, it would hardly be noticable in the end. For example, the victory conditions only affecting the player and not the AI. It cuts the game a bit short unexpectedly, but the game play for the most part would be the same.\nSo yes I recomend Starships as it is. The price was reflective of its small stature of a game so it was worth it in my opinion. Try to suspend your disbelief in reguards to its being a Sid Meier's game, or try your best to completely forget it. If you can do either of those thigs you should be fine. Otherwise I suggest seeking professional help from either a psychologist or your local micro brewery.\nIt is at this point I would like to direct my words at Sid Meier and Faraxis ... please, oh please, redo this game in the grand history and style of every other Sid Meier's game made. It has potential and good ideas backing it in story and hope. Please do those things justice and meet the high bar you set for yourselves. Price it as you did Beyond Earth and Civ 5 and if it be as they are in grand stature and bredth, I would happily give my coin in trade.","March 13, 2015","true","23.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm very hopeful that cross connectivity takes off in a big way, well done to Firaxis, 2K, and everyone involved for taking the plunge with it here.\nIt feels like a mobile/tablet game that's also been released on the PC, and so some will find the price a little steep - but if it's a mobile game, it's a HUGE and complex one with a surprising amount of depth and diverse viable strategies to experiment with.\nIt does have some technical issues, for me it crashes sometimes if I try to move the camera below the plane of the map, but has thus far always reloaded without losing any progress.\nI recommend it for fans of Beyond Earth, and I think it's worth picking up on sale for anyone else who likes the concept.","March 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Simple and fun turn based strategy gameplay in space.  Game works fine for me, no technical issues.  So, based upon those criteria, it's a good little game!\nOnly down side is that it is NOT worth more than $5-10 at most.  Works fine as a stand alone, but probably would have been better recieved as a lower cost DLC for Civ Beyond Earth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeymadness/recommended/282210/","monkeymadness","Jimbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeymadness/","187 products in account","Sid Meier's Starships is a classic 4x strategy game, that plays very cleanly, and is very well thought out.  The first thing this game reminds me of is the old Master of Orion series.  It's planetary checkers with a touch of management thrown in.  With starships there is also tactical combat, which is where the player spends the majority of time.  That's fine because this phase of the game is also well balanced.\n\nI sometimes shy away from starting up a Civilization game (been a fan of the series since it's inception) just because I don't always have 3 days to spend to play through my own space epic opera.  Starships has just the right amount of story, drama, combat and fluff to keep me hooked, but I can finish a game in a couple of hours.\n\nBy fluff I mean this game has components that draw you into the story.  Each planet has a personality, and each empire mirrors what it's planets produce.  Because you are limited to a single fleet, you become very familiar with which ship has which capabilities, and they become a team you care about.  I find that the intro, the voice acting throughout, and the score really add to the immersion.\n\nWhile this game does remind me of MOO, I think many improvements in gameplay have been included, such that instead of making this the most complex simulation possible, its actually the most balanced and fun to play one that I've seen.  A single fleet at first seemed like a limitation, but it really only limits how long your turn can last, which means the game progresses quickly and smoothly.  Tehcnology tree is very streamlines, but it just makes it very clear that you need to spend your research points wisely.  Planet management includes one wonder option for some planets, and a standard set of upgrades for everyone.  You choose very quickly how to customize each planet, which for me, means you speed up gameplay.\n\nTactical combat benefits from slick, randomly generated systems, almost always with a plethora of asteroids to hide behind and navigate through.  Along with each combat, you are usually running a mission of sometype for the local planet, which helps give a purpose to the battle.  There is almost a rock paper scissors between beefy slow dreadnaughts, fast fighters, long range lasers, etc. that combined with random terrain and mission objectives works really well to deliver a unique and changing play environment, while still keeping it familiar with your fleet.  You can customze your ships entirely (at a resource cost of course) so you can build out what you need to defeat a particular foe, or try to hold the upper hand with your technology and wonder advantages.\n\nOverall I'd say Sid Meier's Starships is a great, fast paced, space epic that you don't need a whole weekend to get through.","March 22, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its based on an extremely simple mechanic with a few randomly shifting variables that try to introduce some variety (things like: environmental effects, mission types, etc) that can alter the gameplay on a per-mission basis. Its based on the Beyond Earth universe, and will actually read characters out of your Beyond Earth savegames. The whole game is squarely focused around Starships (hence the name), and everything else is built around giving starships modifiers and abilities to make them more effective. Its a turn based game, with the only reflect mecahnic being the "push button detonation" ability on the torpedos.\n\nThe Good Fun, smooth, addictive gameplay ("one more turn!")\nGood pure-strategy game (no dice rolls! Whoooo!)\n2D representation of 3D space much more useful than attempts to cobble together 3D UIs (I've never seen this work in a way that was felt native and intuitive)\nExtends Beyond Earth for those of us who wanted a bit more\nInteresting and new dynamic that we've never seen before (TBS with one "fleet", the torpedo mechanic, and others). Could spawn new genres\nGame length is good for the size of the concept\nThe elephant in the room: THE PRICE\nThe Bad Graphics are lackluster. Its clear that this was made being co-developed for mobile.\nDespite attempts to add variety to the core game mechanic via environmental changes, the game gets very monotonous and repetitive during long games\nThe 2D playfield does feel a bit like a cop-out. While 3D strategy UI has never been intuitive and elegant, maybe they could have tried to make it work, rather than just defaulting to the 2D maps they're so comfortable-with. (makes me think of KHHAAAAAANNNN)\nWhile its a good GAME, its only a mediocre VIDEO GAME. It feels a bit like it was designed by tabletop players\nNever explained why the leaders of the nations of the world you just conquered would suddenly become the leaders of interstellar empires\nVaunted unit customization is limited to "you have N of a thing"\nNumerous non-game-breaking bugs. Defeated fleets hang out in the corner of the game map. In diplomacy, leaders still worry about players that have been defeated.\nNo multiplayer (While strategic multiplayer wouldn't have been fun (very long turns), I think tactical multiplayer would have made sense)\nThe enemy AI is pretty easy late-game. It doesn't adapt well to lots of modifiers like Wonders.\nGame breaking balance issues: Once you have the stealth wonder, you're pretty much invincible at long range. Build that wonder, make lots of laser-heavy fast ships, win.\nVery symmetric. Aside from initial bonuses and alliances (and ship model) affinities don't seem to matter.\nIn ConclusionGood game, but a very small game without much variety. There's a lot that could be done better. But considering the price-tag, its about what I would expect for that price. No this is not another Civ or Civ-sized game. Plays differently, looks differently, feels different, price is different.","March 14, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead, many readers use it only to indicate whether they agree/disagree with the review. What that means is if a reader likes the game but dislikes a negative review of the game, they will downvote the review for that reason alone. People do this to make it harder for reviews they disagree with to appear on Steam and therefore harder for you to make an informed decision.\n\nSo a wise person will seek out both positive and negative reviews not based on upvote/downvote status.\n\n================================================================\n\nUnlike some other reviewers, I didn't come into this game with any expectations and assumptions - I like to limit the potential for dissapointment.\n\nPros: a simple galactic civ game for people like me who want to like the big 4x turn-based games but hate all the micromanagement and awkward UIs. Combat is fun. Easy to learn. Perfect for short gaming sessions.\n\nCons: cartoonish artwork. Little to no control over what your ships look like. Too simple.\n\nAll in all, a very fun little game and well worth the small price tag.\n\nIf you want to see some late game action, go here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLqZfvZy9xo","March 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics and interface are much more basic than I was expecting, and not in a good way. It's not particularly challenging, even on the higher difficulty settings, there's not really much scope for changing your strategy, and the fact that you can't continue the game once another player has achieved a victory, the way you can in Civ5, is really irritating. Could be a good game but it feels much more like one made specifically for tablets or even smartphones than for PC gamers, or possibly a beta for a much bigger and more immersive game.

Its out of combat screen however is a simplified 4x map.\n\nYou get one fleet, it travels between planets and does missions to gain trade routes (similar to Spore) if the planet is owned by someone else you go to combat with their fleet, simple enough.  The planets can have their facilities upgraded and more cities added, each choice gives you more resources per turn.\n\nYour fleet can be upgraded, better weapons, shields, armor or change to new tactics like cloaking, torpedos, and launced fighters.  You will be able to do all of these eventually, you wont lock yourself out of any design, though you do have to balance your ships components with speed.\n\nThe tech tree is tiny unfortunatly, the prices scale quickly so you will be sitting there a while if you're trying for a tech victory, its small but not short.\n\nThe victories are done poorly, instead of a civ style advanced setup option you get to pick between all the victories (Population, Science, Domination, and Wonders) and any single one of them.  In practice the All games tend to end in domination or population quickly, wonder victories can come out of no where and science takes too long.\n\nThe starting options are a bit generic as well, each civilization has a unique bonus and each captain has a bonus, the captains are the same reguardless of race however their portrait gets a slight change.  Some say that its lazy I think its cute.\n\nIt has a pretty cool integration with Beyond Earth, you can earn starting choices for Starships and Beyond Earth by playing the other game.  For example because of some Starships gameplay I get a new starting option in Beyond Earth as well as a map for an achievement and for playing Beyond Earth I can choose hybrid civs with double the bonus abilities in Starships.\n\nOver all I hope it gets polished because it does have short falls.  Its not a bad game, its pretty fun in fact, and the cross integration with BE is something I can't support enough I love it.","March 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Really everything is about your ships, you fly around and do missions for other planets. There are a few different missions you can do, each giving a differnt reward, money, research etc... you have to do a few missions per planet to gain enough influence for them to join your empire. It gets a little old fast doing the missions, depending on what the mission is you may need to outfit your ship(s) diffently. Some missions you only get to use one of your ships, and in others you need to avoid combat more than provoke it. Once a planet has been claimed by an opponent the battles become slightly more interesting and it becomes more about the ship battling and tactics than the missions, which felt like playing minigames. In youre planets you are able to build cities and planet upgrades, the cities boost overall income and the upgrades range in different things like planetary defences and the like. you're crew will allow you to travel a certain distance per turn, limiting how much you can do, without certain upgrades traveling between your cities can eat up you're turns. I did not find much use in the missle weapons, though they seem interesting they are fairly useless, atleast in my experience. The missles travel a certain distance per turn, you may choose to detonate them at any time during their travel but i didnt find the range to be worth it, i rarely used them but when i did i used them to cut the enemy off. The combat zones are riddled with space debris and asteroids, both allowing cover and hindering or dissalowing fire comletely. they are filled with narrow passages between asteroids that open and close (for some reason) between turns. Overall, due to its lower price tag i will recomend it, but it would be best to get it on sale if at all. The game gets old fast but it should be fun to go back to every now and again. I give it a 5/10 and hope that they update it and dont charge for micro-expansions.","March 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

This game is pretty brilliant for what it is, a 15 dollar game. It is sorta simple on many levels. That being said, there are enough variables to keep it fresh as long as you want it to be. I have about 9 full play throughs so far, and am still playing.\n\nSome of the achievements seem a bit difficult to trigger. The pirate one for example. I have taken the Pirate home world multiple times in games and still no cheevo. I see people have it though, so I am sure the game isn't broken. I am doing something wrong is all. I did manage to get my home world attacked on the second round of the game and lost, so that cheevo didn't happen. :D\n\nI have to say, it delivers exactly what Sid promised. Nothing more, nothing less.  I am hoping that as time goes on, more content, multiplayer options and such are added. With the 15 dollar price point, I would gladly purchase DLC to keep Sid employed. He has kept me entertained since 1982 after all. Only seems fair.\n\nTL;DR - Buy it. It is 15 bucks that will be well spent.","March 15, 2015","true","201.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

You control star systems and move a fleet of upgradable ships around while competing with the AI doing the same. There are four victory conditions (wonders, population, domination, science). Once two fleets meet or you attack an enemy planet the game switches to 2D hex-based, turn-based tactical combat.  You can attack enemy ships with lasers, torpedoes, plasma guns and fighters. There is a simple stealth option and there are obstacles on each map that can be used as a cover for ships.\nOn the strategy map you can also upgrade your ships, buy new ships (but you can only have one fleet at a time) upgrade your planets, build cities and wonders and improve your tech level (there are different resources for each task).\n\nNow before I start on listing my personal pros and cons I'd like to get this out of the way first: The game is in no way comparable to great 4X games like Master of Orion, Endless Legends and so on. It's a simply game, designed for tablets much like Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. If you want a large, complex 4X-game then don't buy Sid Meier's Starships. Starships is much more of a "let's play something for 20 minutes" game than anything else.\n\nThat said, here are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Good Interface\n- Fast paced combat and strategy map\n- Fames don't take long to complete (I finished an epic game on normal in 2 hours)\n- Enjoyable if simple turn based combat\n- I really, really like the artwork in the game.\n\nCons:\n- Diplomacy is useless.\n- The options are a joke (for example: Fullscreen mode only works on my system if I hide the task bar. If the task bar is   not hidden it's always visible and the game doesn't go fullscreen)\n- The different factions really don't play all that different. And choosing an affinity is mostly about what color you like\n- The turn based combat is simple. It's really easy to find a strategy that works for you (I enjoy mass torpedo spam for example) and stick with it. Once you have upgraded the first two ships to the max level there is almost nothing that can stop you)\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend buying the game if you look for something to just play for a couple of minutes and if you enjoy simple turn based combat.\n\nI do not recommend buying the game if you look for something complex or challenging.","March 14, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The addition of "wonders" and battle cards makes a lot of difference on the hexagonal battlefield riddled with environmental obstacles and effects that are a lot more significant than in any other 4x games.\n\nHowever, people hoping to find complexity of a $40+ title are going to be dissapointed.

I like how you dont "build" ships that then become obsolete.  Every ship can be upgraded indivitually and once you own the frame of the ship even if it dies in battle it will respawn.  The assumption is that when its reduced to 0hp it just leaves the battle or something.  Going dark is plausable in a space game.\n\nUpgrades and reserch is instant so you can focus on racing around the galaxy brining planets under your federation.\n\nRecommend if you like new ideas and fun tactial space battles.

Sid Meier's Starships has a incredible unique mix of elements which come together to create exciting suspenseful battles where fast skillful maneuvering to get in just the right sweet strategic position to fire hull shattering hits upon enemy ships then take off engines blasting behind a planetoid or some asteroids before the enemy can counter attack with devastating effect.\n\nSid Meier's Starships is the first turn based strategy game i may have ever played which felt fast and furious giving a fps shooter adrenaline rush in of all things a turn based strategy game. It was like playing a table top game with friends but against the ai instead.\n\nGraphics have an old school style to them with a great hex map setup with many environmental variables which can mean the difference between life and death depending on how the player utilizes them to their advantage. Weapons have varying ranges and levels of damage with lasers delivering heavy damage from long range while missile weapons like torpedoes are usually slower with a chance of being avoided if one keeps their attacks fluid and mobile. Stay still and you are probably dead like a sitting duck.\n\nYou can buy and upgrade ships to become lethal space faring dreadnoughts of unstoppable destruction. In my first game as i was learning my way around i built two heavily armored ships which were able to take on a group of five enemy ships and fighters for awhile letting loosing terrifying barrages of laser fire into their midst before eventually being defeated with blood curdling audio and visuals during their horrific demise. Talk about getting lost in fun abandonment as if watching a starship battle in a episode of STAR TREK.\n\nPlanets you rule are used to get resources and do research to improve your battle prowess and keep your empire going. You will come across other leaders which you form alliances with or who will form alliances against you as everyone does their best to thrive and survive in the infinite vastness of the universe.\n\nAudio and music is excellent bringing home those peaceful space traveling moments only to be shattered by battle inspiring man your weapons music. Voice acting is quite good and am glad to say the female robotic voice of the computer is quite informative and comforting :)\n\nCons-\nOuch that user interface is not intuitive to put it mildly. During my first game session i couldnt even figure out how to move my ships until i watched a Youtube video by AngryJoe who was doing a first impressions playthrough. Also i have to hover my mouse pointer above my selection when giving a command otherwise i will choose the command below it or none at all.\n\nIf your into fast paced turn based combat with plenty of thrilling tension while not expecting a CIVILIZATION BEYOND EARTH experiance then Sid Meier's STARSHIPS is the game for you. Just enjoy it for what it is and you will find its more then worth the few credits you have paid to enter the star ship bridge for.","March 13, 2015","true","12.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

The game has really good graphics which is what I have come to expect from Sid Meier's games.  The loading time into the game is a lot quicker than the standard civilization games which I also liked.   To me it was like a board game based in space using the basics from the civilization games. Their is some micro managing you can do in Starships but its not overwhelming like it is in other civ games.  I also like that the planetary jump gates allow you to keep moving your fleet without adding fatigue.  I played a game on the easy  level and had the largest map. I still finished it in under 6 hours, which is kind of cool considering their is no multiplayer option for starfighter.\nI do feel their is a few drawbacks that I feel could have been improved upon.  The game seems to randomly shut itself down, which isnt that huge of deal considering it has the continue option when loading back into the game. The saves could use some work. I dont know where it saves it, I am assuming it is in some kind of cloud. I was unable to locate the save file directory on my computer for starships. I prefere to be able to manually delete my own save files without having to fire the game up first to do it. So if Starships is updated I would like to see a save file directory on my pc.  The in game maps do not seem to be that big in my opinion. The tool tips could use improving, it kept wanting me to develop my ion  engines even after i increased the tech and took ship engines to 5.  Finally their is no multiplayer option with starships. I think starships would be a lot more funner if i could have the option to play with my friends against the Ai's or each other.\n\nThe one thing I dont understand is why only 1 fleet? Im guessing that is because the fleet is used for visiting the planets and attacking while the planetary defence's are for when you get attacked.\n\nSo over all the game is fun to play if you dont mind playing it by yourself against the computer.  For the price of $15 I paid for it, I feel it was worth it and recomend it to play.","March 14, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's a light game with some 4x elements and some exploration elements.  There's a little colonial management, a decent tactical simulator (if you don't mind turn/hex based), and a variety of victory conditions.\n\nAnd that's really it.  It's true there is no tutorial, but there are a few help screens and that's all you need.  This is simple, light fare...and it does what it sets out to do.  In my first game I was one turn ('mission') away from a science victory, when one of my opponents conquered another one and was slightly over 50% population.  It takes 51 to win however and I managed to eke it out.  For all the lightness of the game, it was  a fun and entertaining game that took about 4 hours start to finish.","March 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

In most, if not all, of my Civilization games I end up being the passive diplomat whether in history or Beyond Earth but because of focus on battles and fighting in this game I can enjoy the otherside of conquest that I fail to meet under the white dove or neutrality.\n\nHowever the game does come with a few flaws to those expecting a huge 'triple-A' title. Each game is short and missons do get repetative if you replay each game on the same difficulty. I believe there are a few minor bugs in the diplomacy and which leaders relaliate too who owns what planet (which is not fully governed by a single 'Empire')\n\nHowever if you are looking for a quick Hex-based spaceship battle game you are in luck!\nOtherwise just give this one a pass; There is no reason to moan at the developers for creating a game that some people like and some people just want to cry about like two year olds with tantrums.","March 16, 2015","true","18.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

A lot of the criticism is that it's not as in depth as civ, or other great 4x titles for that matter. But the fact is, this game isn't trying to be complex. Let's not forget that "Sid Meier's" games are not confined to complex strategy games. I've had just as much in my time playing Sid Meier's Pirates as I have playing Civ, and the difficulty gap between those games is enourmous. Just because this game is light on strategy doesn't mean it should be a let down. Also, this game was barely mentioned at all until a few months before its release; clearly this game isn't supposed to be a big deal.\nWhat's more, it really shouldn't matter if it's a mobile game, because it's still a good game. The only reason mobile games are a bad thing is that they are frequenty riddled with poor design and are little more than money-making schemes for their developers. I think it's good that Starships is a mobile game. You know why? It sets a good example. More mobile games should be like this. It's relatively simple, has a low learning curve, and yet still manages to be engaging and entertaining.\n\nIt's easy to enjoy this game as long as you don't go into it expecting to play a 12 hour long game.

Tactics I've tried:\nA fast fleet with powerful short range weapons\nA fleet with lots of torpedoes and long range lasers\nA slow carrier fleet\nA small fleet with super ships (basically putting all your money in to 1 or 2 ships) think Mega Battleships\nA fleet with 2 'tanks' and the remainder light long range ships\nA fleet with 2 'tanks' and several carriersThese are just the ones I've tried so far... there are many possibilities, and you will have to responded the enemy fleet composition.\n\nIn general you'll be spending your time:\nPlacing facilities on planets to improve output for a single resource or getting a fleet bonus (via wonders)\nPlacing cities that will increase output for all resource types on that planet\nAcquiring technology for your ships\nCustomisng ships (they change appearance based on your choices)\nExpanding your empire, by doing favours for planets or attacking other players\nAnd a lot of fighting (the game is all about fleet combat)\nEverything in the game is purchased, so there is no building or researching, you simply decide what you want and buy it with the correct resource.

Now it's here and while it's not socks from Grandma at Christmas, it's not quite the game you were hoping for either. Good but not great, worth the price but perhaps unworthy of the legend that is Sid Meier.\n\nThis is not a 4x game nor was it ever advertised as such. It's more Ace Patrol than Civ, something fun that won't require huge chunks of your life to complete but something you can come back and jump right in to. While lacking in chrome, this game retains Sid's famous "one more turn" quality. The game is fun to play and the deeper you get into it the more strategies become apparent. I started it, played a few turns and stopped to do something else several times, then fired it up again after dinner and played it straight thru to midnight, surprised at how much time had passed.\n\nThe lack of chrome, i.e. the ability to rename your starships and planets, the lack of any leaders, not nearly enough starship models, etc..... is disappointing but not a show stopper. Hopefully, given the track record of Meier products, this will be addressed in future updates. I hope to see steam workshop support added as well to let Sid's passionate fanbase come up with their own ideas. This is the kind of game that cries out for a Star Trek/Star Wars/BSG mod from some basement genius and I can't wait to see that happen.\n\nOver the years I've bought and played every single game Sid has ever made. This game won't add to the legend that is Sid Meier, but it won't detract from it either. You'll get more than enough gameplay from Starships to justify the cost, you just won't be sitting around 15 years from now saying "remember Sid Meier's Starships?!?!

The background is a basic two-dimensional map as in, say, Galciv 2 or even Moo2. You have one space fleet, which you can add ships to. You can also upgrade the ships both by adding components and improving your technology (the 'science tree'). Wiith your fleet you take on missions with Star-Trekky names, to gain influence over other star systems and eventually add them to your empire. You can also attack the AI players, who are the same cast that appeared in Civ:BE.\n\nYou receive resources ech turn from your controlled systems; the systems can be upgraded by spending food to increase population, or metals to upgrade production. You can also build nexuses to get around more conveniently, and megabots to defend your systems. So there is an element of 'empire management', too.\n\nVictory can come through: science, population, domination, wonders; however, you cannot force the AI players to select a particular choice, so you need to keep an eye on their progress as well as your own.\n\nGame length is short; even spinning it out, you can finish a game with top-level ships (say, 6 levels of whatever components you like best) in 2-3 hours, and that would be a game you could have won much sooner if you'd chosen to do so.\n\nThe main focus of the game is on starship combat, for at least two reasons: first, because that is the only way to expand, and second, because every player/AI battle at a home planet is sudden death for the empire being attacked; if it loses, all its systems immediately join the winner.\n\nSo, how good is combat? Well, between equally balanced fleets (ignore what the game tells you about your 'prospects of victory) the AI will give you a challenge. Of course, if you have much better (fast, stealthed) ships, then the AI can be made to look foolish. But then, if the tables were turned, the reverse would probably be true also.\n\nPrice: there are a number of good older games for the same price or less, but for a brand-new game, this didn't strike me as unreasonably expensive.\n\nReservations\n\n1.	The game can end suddenly and unexpectedly if you or another player acquires seven wonders -  a number that is not scalable. So you can find yourself tactically NOT building wonders or capturing planets that have them. The same happens if two AI opponents decide to combine forces, and it turns out they have 7 wonders between them. It's not obvious to me why '7 wonders' should even be a victory condition, and particularly not such an arbitrary one.\n\n2.	There is the ability to link Starships and Civ:BE via My2k. It is quite fiddly to do (you need to open a My2k account and log on in both games). The reward is that you can take your Civ:BE persona into Starships against the same opponents and play on there. Also, you can obtain rewards (extra missions, more planet types and affinity choices). Having played 214 hours of Civ:BE and obtained nearly all achievements,it does seem like a bit of an imposition to have to jump through the hoops again on the off-chance I may get an Earth-type world, say, in Starships. At least there could be some indication of how to unlock the extras! More seriously, logging onto My2k while playing Civ:BE caused gameplay lag, and also a screen crash of my computer on restart. I believe you should get the bonuses automatically if you already have the achievements in Civ:BE.\n\nConclusions.\n\nMostly harmless. This is a perfectly acceptable, 'play over lunch' type of game. It isn't great, and it isn't terrible. It isn't hugely expensive, and it certainly isn't  cheap. It needs more content in terms of missions, and there are a couple of gameplay issues to sort out.\n\nOverall, it's good fun and is a welcome change of pace from those labour-intensive 4x type games that go on for days. Thumbs up.\n\nP.S. Thereis now a guide to the unlockables: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=406708978","March 16, 2015","true","42.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Something that expands Civ:BE allowing it to reach the glory it aimed at? Unfortunately, no. Sid M.'s Starships goes in the same direction XCom, franchise revived by Firaxis, did. And it goes much, much further. For those who may not know, the new XCom is an extremely simplified, tainted with tacky graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the original game. Although, unlike Starships, it's still very enjoyable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nWhat do we get buying SM Starships? Pitifully little. It's a typical tablet/phone game that could be distributed for free if the devs cut down on graphics, basic as it already is.\nTech tree does not exist. Instead, we get several options to improve cerain aspects by a % bonus. Boring.\nPretty much the same can be said about development of planets. Player is just adding numbers and %.\nCombat looks like in XCom but is much less intuitive. Will I be able to hit my enemy if i move a little to the right? Will have to see. It's a guessing game, especially when distance grows. Torpedoes and their delayed explosions are a nice touch, even though AI can't handle them a bit. BTW, "lasers" in this game act like tomahawk missiles. Curved lasers... Priceless.\nMissions are simply boring. All are played on almost identical maps. Only details vary. Special missions, ie. hunt a ship or flee, only pretend to be different.\n\nAnother thing is pacing of the game. I've seen and done everything in 2 hours. Nothing left to explore. After half a dozen turns you've already been everywhere and done everything. What's worse, you've also upgraded everything worth upgrading and bought everything worth buying. The biggest killjoy comes from fleet upgrades. Cheap upgrades make you invincible. Spend one turn's income on lasers and bang! You are dealing 1000% more damage!\n\nAll in all, if you have nothing to do while taking a shhhhh..., buy it and play it for a moment. Just make sure you have no problems with moving your bowels because if that's the case, you may get bored with the game before you succeed on the other field.\n\nI really hope this game makes a lot of money because after Civ:BE the name Sid Meier became much cheaper, and after Starships, it may be forgotten, or even shunned, by everyone besides older Civ players. After all, money is the only conceivable incentive that could have given life to this little title.","March 15, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game itself is made as a companion game but can be played on it's own and is still a bunch of fun.  It's short enough that you can fit in a quick game (an impossibility with other Sid Meier titles), and still leave satisfied.\n\nYou choose a different "leader" which gives you a different boost during the game, but overall I didn't find they made too much of a difference.  Then you really just expand, fight off some ships through an asteroid field, and repeat.  There's a few "varieties" of missions, but it's generally just clear out the other fleet, get your ship to a "warp hole", or escort a colony ship.

This game is Beyond Earth episode II to be precise. The gameplay switches between Civ V like  tile system of gameplay  and tactical war perspective on the space map combat zone - it adds new transcedental level of fun; and there is a third perspective - controlling each individual torpedos- Sid gives you choice of when to detonate your space torpedos (it's nice but takes too long, you usually try to predict where your enemmy will move, its all game of probabilitie); however, I prefere maximizing mouvements of my sacecraft, lunhing two smaller fleets from my individual ships to expand my army) and then mele attack lunch from close range for most damage in game, point final. very quick. and did I tell you - the look of your fleet changes depending on upgrades you did each time.\n\nFor Sid Meier\n\nPlease add turn base multiplayer option, lack of multiplayer is depressing, I can assure you- you can make it 'turn based' mutiplayer  instead of simultaneous, with rank system, and giveaway for top rank players. You can make this game into multi billionaire gem by adding it to android .apk mobile device, specially tablet with rank system, auto matchmaking, I am very sure you can compress the graphique.

While BE was more focused on 4x empire management, Starships shifts gear to commanding a fleet of interstellar vessels as you run around completing missions in turn-based strategy fashion. In-depth customization of your ships' systems is the center of the game as lasers tear through your hull because you thought having maximum sensors was the smartest idea.\n\nWhile the tactical map is where you'll be battling, the galactic map is ultimately where you win the war. Here, you'll be competing for influence on various systems against your rivals from BE as you seek to rid the universe of their annoying one-liners. Victory is achieved by eliminating all of your rivals, controlling over half of the galaxy, researching enough technologies to the maximum tier, or spending enough industry to own seven wonders.\n\n"Yes Commander"\n---------------------------\n(+) Well thought out tactical gameplay - Do I stealth this turn? Fire my weapons? Launch torpedoes?  "Oooh let's hide behind this planet and when the enemy comes, charge guns blazing"\n\n(+) Great ship customization - With your fleet of ships, you'll be able to craft each ship to fit your battle plans. You could make a fleet of ships with many engines and long range weapons and kite the enemy or brawlers that hide behind a planet and charge out when the enemy nears. Maybe you'd like to have a stealth carrier that pops out, launches some fighters, and goes back into the void or a sensor ship to detect an enemy fleet that relies on stealth fighters. The options are vast. A bonus kudo goes to the fact the game auto-classes your ship based on its setup. A ship teethed with guns and armor will be labelled as a battleship while a fast ship with high damage would be an assault corvette. It just provides an additional, nice immersion feature.\n\n(+) Simplicity - While it can be argued that this is a negative as some people perhaps expected a complex 4x game reminisicent of MOO or Galciv, Starships is a game focused on ...Starships. The focus isn't on managing a large empire but instead on controlling your fleet and completing missions with that said fleet in order to build your empire.\n\n(+) Missions - There's a decent variety of missions so you won't get too bored until a few playthroughs. While the mission types get similar, the map and the ships in each mission can change.\n\n(+) Price - $15 (in the US) is a great price for a game like this. You'll definitely get hours of gameplay and like most Sid Meier's games, once you figure out the controls, it's hard to pay attention to real-life.\n\n(+) Bridge Visuals - Each bridge depending on which faction (harmony, purity, supremacy) you picked gets it's own unique bridge. It's a really small thing but it's something that definitely stands out.\n\n\n"We'll get them next time..."\n---------------------------\n(-) No Multiplayer - One of the things I was hoping to do was get a nice game going with some friends. The game definitely has unexploited MP potential. A decent size map can be finished with some friends in a day. It's not going to be like playing a MP match of Crusader Kings or EUIV which can last weekends on ends. The AIs only going to be able to be so unique on designing fleets.\n\n(-) One Fleet - Having only one fleet really limits strategic gameplay on the galactic map. There's not going to be any strategy where I can defend one location and fight in another on AI turns. I won't be able to create a fleet for defense and another for attack or specialize one fleet for certain types of missions.\n\n(-) Squishiness of Ships - Hopefully this gets sorted out but ships seem like they are glass cannons no matter how you build them at the moment. Unless you're literally building all armor / shields (which makes that ship pretty useless since it has no weapons), most ships die in a few hits. Fighters die in one shot from basically anything short of a maximum range pea shooter. This makes the tactical gameplay more arcadey and will hopefully be improved upon in later patches.\n\n(-) Lack of 'One More Turn' - A fundamental Sid Meier's feature. Sometimes you just want to continue but you win, victory, that's it. This was an easy feature that was just simply and unfortunately overlooked.\n\n(-) Modding Tools - There's a lot of potential for modding a game like this. It's not a stretch to imagine someone trying to recreate a Starfleet or Star Wars based mod if the tools are provided. Some of the best additions that enhance the value of old Civ games were fan-made maps and mods.\n\n"Close Victory"\n---------------------------\nOverall I'd give this game a 6.5/10. The gameplay is addictive and the tactical battles are in-depth. Ship customization and fleet design is well-developed and serves as the main anchor for this game. Nontheless some pitfalls exists, mainly in the fact that there's no multiplayer in a game that would obviously benefit from having the ability to play a match against your friends. If you're expecting a big 4x game then you might want to stay away but if you want a quick game and you have a love of starships and fleet command then you should definitely pick it up. It's only the price of a dinner and you won't be eating tonight anyways when you're too addiced from playing.\n\nFor future reference, this review was released on game release date and may be updated in the future.\n\nFor those interested in a preview, I recorded some gameplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNXM_VpDX_Q\n\nChannel if you want more: https://www.youtube.com/user/xBr0wnBear","March 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 88 of 182 people (48%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","48","88","182","7","7"

It's a total surprise how great it is, i didn't believe someone could pull it off.\n\nMy last game almost felt like playing a board game.

It is a small and fast game, perfect to play after work for an hour or two and have fun. Not very deep but funny! Don't expect too much, if you want to play deep and long games go to Civilization. If you want to relax after work for an hour or two this game could be for you.\n\nWhat is Sid Meier's Starships? You have an intergalactic empire and the goal is nothing less than to rule the galaxy. You can build some basic industry on planets which produce resources like food, metal and so on. With those resources you build your fleet and travel to other planets where you can do missions to gather influence. If you have enough influence the sytem joins your empire. Very simple.\n\nThere are several mission types like "kill all enemies", "protect a convoy" or "escape from a asteroid field". You can customize your ships, which means you can add long range lasers, short range plasma weapons, torpedos, shields, hull, fighters etc. The fights are the fun part, with the different weapon types one can develop different tactics which makes really fun. The torpedos e.g. are good for a crowd of slow ships. Once fired they can't change direction but you decide when they explode. If the timing is perfect one explosion hits several ships and can even destroy them. Asteroids give you cover and the back of your ships are the most sensitiv part. I managed to destroy a big ship with two or three hits from my fighters in the back of the enemy.\n\nThe research is very basic, 9 (if I'm not wrong) different techs which can be upgraded some levels. The results are weapons with more damage, faster engines and so on. No new weapons or other ships.\n\nYou can build wonders, like in Civilization or Beyond Earth, but they do not cust so much. As far as I could see those wonders are powerful, one e.g. gives you clocked torpedos so the enemies don't see them anymore, which makes them even more powerful.\n\nSooner or later you meet the AI players, they want to rule the galaxy too. The diplomacy is very basic (not that its counterparts in Civilization or Beyond Earth are better in my opinion, but...) and is like "hey, how are you, what have you done in the past, lets compare our genitals (fleet strengths, plantes, etc), do you want peace or war?". Sooner or later one AI will declare war on you and you must try to conquer their planets. Or go straight to their home world and end their suffering.\n\nThe integration with Beyond Earth was promoted as a special feature. You need an extra 2K account for this (not sure if this hasn't been possible with Steam, but anyway). Then you are able to "continue" a save game from Beyond Earth in Starships. Not sure what this means in detail. I managed to unlock some kind of bonus in Beyond Earth, but haven't played this again. I'm sure they extend this feature over time and it might add some replay bonus to both games. We'll see.\n\nAs I said at the top, don't expect too much. It costs only 15 bucks, I got it for 11 on GMG which is ok for the game.

I've read alot of the negative reviews and they focus on how they were expecting the game to be different in various ways. More or less related to Beyond Earth, more like a full game, more polished etc...\n\nFor my part I purposefully didn't learn alot about the game, I have enough faith in Firaxis to get their products without copious research, X-COM and Civ being the standup gems that they are. For my ignorance I was rewarded with a surprisingly enjoyable experience. The game isn't deep but it has emergent complexities in play. It isn't as customisable or strategic as Civ but that's what Civ is for, this is something different. In a way it brings the fresher innovations in game play some of us hoped Beyond Earth might bring.\n\nIf you wanted something different you can't help but be dissapointed, and I get that, but I guess my advice is to be open minded, go in with a clear head and experience the game for what it is, an interesting little adventure that won't require the hundreds of hours to master that Civ does.\n\nIf you're interested I'm doing a Let's Play on youtube: https://youtu.be/_ggv6so0sGk?list=UUVAUBrmofKasUbNIm0E2ktw Check out what the game is like!","March 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 30 of 64 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","30","64","5","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealreezus/recommended/282210/","therealreezus","reezus.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealreezus/","35 products in account","This is a good game if you know what you are expecting. First, you need to put two things in mind: one, it's only $15, so don't expect some huge game like Civilization V or Beyond Earth; two it's not a Civilization game.\n\nNow with that out of the way, Starships to me, is a unique game that takes the gameplay from many other types of strategy and space faring games. I stated before it isn't a Civilization game, but it still borrows some of the game mechanics from Beyond Earth. It's still mainly just a turn based clicking game, with many different options to start your new game with to spice it up a little bit and to offer some diversity, such as the affinity system from Beyond Earth and the same leaders from it, too. I also like the new feature where you can interact between the two games.\nNow, to the pros. I've played a lot of Beyond Earth, and this game was still quite confusing when I started. It seems like it's very complex, but once you play the game for about fifteen minutes, you get the hang of it quite easily. Planets are like cities, and you can apply upgrades to your planets to increase science, metal (production), energy (money), and food. You also use the food to increase the population of your planet, which increases the production of all materials slightly, the only thing that's different in this aspect from Beyond Earth is it doesn't take time. The game is turn based, yes, but it mainly only applies to the battles. This game goes by much faster than a traditional Civilization game, which is good if you just want to kill a couple hours. The customization/upgrade system is pretty alright, too. You can use your materials to apply certain upgrades to certain ships which all have their own effect, you can upgrade the planet as said before, and you can instantly upgrade technology with your science points. There are also four ways to win: population, wonders, science, and domination. Also, another thing I liked is the map, I love the variety of planets and all the planets have their own special aspects to them that alter what they exactly do for you when you control them. And the missions you do for the uncontrolled planets are also pretty unique and fun. The game has no lag or glitches in it at all as long as you have a good enough computer to play.\n\nCons, I'll make this short. I don't like that you can't trade with the other factions, you can't go through their territory at all unless you are at war which is hard if you don't like having war all the time, and the interactions with leaders are just pretty limited in general, all you can do is wage war, be at peace, see their progress, and very rarely do they offer you a technology if you fight someone for them. Unless you consider the uncontrolled planets as secondary factions, there are no secondary factions to interact with. You can't name the planets or ships if you're into that, either. Most of the wonders are very limited in their use, and you can only build one per planet and it depends on the planet you control.\n\nConclusion, Starships is a pretty good game to play if you got a few hours to kill or are up at night and can't sleep and it's relatively easy to pick up and learn as well. While it has it's good things, it also has it's flaws, but in Starships, the good outweighs the bad for this one. For $15, you can't really expect a perfect game especially when Firaxis only put a few months into it, but they put good work into this game. While it serves somewhat as an expansion to Beyond Earth, it is it's own game entirely, and it's very fun and time consuming. Remember though before you buy, just because it has Sid Meier's name on the game does not mean it is a Civilization game, it is it's own game with it's own likeness. For $15, it completely worth it to me, and if you can catch this game on sale, I would definately get it.","March 14, 2015","true","7.2"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

So the interface is simpler than PC gamers will be used to, and annoyingly (at launch) it doesn't have true full screen or full graphics/interface options.\n\nIf you want a more casual stratagy experience you can play in the background between other things then this is a cool little title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfa1979/recommended/282210/","dfa1979","Bob Ross the Mob Boss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfa1979/","616 products in account","Ever since Civilization 5, the Firaxis team has been focused on a casual, arcade-like feel for their games. Civ V never had the intensity that Civ IV and before had, yet it was very agreeable to the eyes and had decent replayability. Moving onwards, we got Civilization: Beyond Earth. A pale comparison to Alpha Centauri, but still a fun game if you were in that arcade mentality. Firaxis continues the trend with Starships, a very simple and pretty game that is practically a tablet app game.\n\nPros:\n\n- The visuals are stunning as usual, and seamless graphics for the most part\n- Very interesting use of tactics, looks like they took a page from their X-Com game\n- Once you get rolling, the game is straightforward and can bring that "one more turn... one more turn..." feeling that every Civ player has come to love and hate.\n- the variety of planet missions are great and makes every encounter different.\n- the save-link between Beyond Earth and Starships is a nice touch\n\nCons:\n\n- If you hoped for a intense space domination game, this might not be the best bet for you\n- It is really casual oriented, and that does give the feeling of emptiness and being unfulfilled after playing a game (which could last up to 3 hours)\n- space combat  does get monotonous, and once you fire torpedoes enjoy watching the AI scarmble right into your lasers.\n- Controlling only one massive fleet takes a lot of tactical potential away, especially on the large/epic maps if your fleet is on the other side of your federation and your planets get attacked.\n\nverdict:\n\nIn the end, I did enjoy this game more then I hated it, and I hope with some modest mods the game can really shine, just like how the mods for Civ V have made it a new game entirely. If you go in with a asual, arcadey attitude, you will not be disappointed and will find this game enticing and refreshing. Just don't expect any long epic campaigns.","March 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sythric/recommended/282210/","Sythric","Sythric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sythric/","93 products in account","I want to start by saying that I clearly put some time into this game, and I do believe that it is on the VERY EDGE of recieving a recommendation.  The bugs and obvious mission features need to be worked out.\nThe Decent Parts   Tactical Combat - Although it still isn't perfect, the combat sections of the game are actually very entertaining.  Ships can be outfitted with various modules and upgraded to your liking.  Whether your ships are damage sponges with devastating firepower, carriers that can launch numerous fighters at the enemy, or insanely fast scout ships with cloaking abilities to get behind enemy lines, you're going to need to use some strategy and use your surroundings to your advantage.  If caught in the open, you can withstand critical hits, which need a turn to be repaired and leave you vunerable to attack.\nWonders - On each planet that you capture for your federation, you will recieve the option to create a wonder, such as stealth torpedos, 360 degree shielding, and systems that can withstand critical hits.  These can open new strategies and may influence how you build your ships.\nMission Variety - Missions aren't always simply "Kill the baddies before they pimp slap you to death".  While travelling to different planets to increase your federation's influence, you will often encounter missions that require you to escort civilian ships, maintain control of bases, and destroy stealth fighters that conceal themselves in the shadows.  While the missions to gain influence may often seem boring and pointless, it is often made up for by the epic battles between two warring federations.  These final battles as you attempt to capture homeworlds (or defend yours from an assault) often made me feel like I was actually doing something halfway important.  Instead of a 30 second mission where I blow up a fighter squadron, I was spending 30-40 minutes thinking about where to put my ships, which enemy ships to take out first, and how to evade my own destruction as masses of enemy battleships closed in on my carriers.\nThe Not-So-Decent Parts   The UI/Graphics - The UI... isn't great.  At all. On top of the UI size being suited for an iPad and not a monitor, the graphics are just.. ugly.  This game looks like something I would've had on my phone two or three years ago.\nVictory Conditions - I don't know what 2K was thinking by letting this slide.  At the start of the game you are given five settings for victory conditions. You can enable Domination, Population, Wonder, Science, or all of these.  Now you would think that enabling one of these would make it so that it is the only possible winning condition.  The sad part is that the condition you set only applies to yourself.  You can set the condition to domination, and after 3 or 4 hours of playing (the normal time for an epic sized map with a lot of opponents) a random opponent will win with a wonder victory out of nowhere.  This leads in to my next point...\nEndgame - Nothing.  Unlike most other Sid Meier games I've played, and hell, any strategy game I've played (which is a lot, don't be fooled by my Steam library), you are not allowed to proceed with the game after there is a victor.  Instead you are presented a population chart (no other options) that lacks any type of accurate scale.  I could have 100mil population, and an opponent with 9mil is above me for some odd reason.  If you happen to win, you'll have the pleasure of watching a generic video about how you're some fabulous leader and now there's a thousand years of peace.  Clearly lacks any effort.\nThe Potential / What I Expected Going into Starships,  I was expecting almost a complete reskin of Sid Meier's Pirates!, which, in my honest opinion is a FANTASTIC game.  I expected being able to customize my ships with my own names, specialized guns, and maybe even some visuals.  I also expected to be able to play the game after a victory.  I wanted to feel like I was actually the captain of a fleet, but sadly I didn't get that feeling.  Although I didn't get what I expected out of Starships, I do believe that it was worth the $15 that I purchased it for.  With a few updates and various tweaks, I honestly think that this could be a fantastic game.  Now I'm clearly not expecting an overhaul of the entire combat system or the graphics, but at least add "one more turn", a more varied diplomacy system, and work out some of the minor bugs.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n5/10 - Average","March 17, 2015","true","23.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

If you're big on in depth strategy and resource management this isn't it. Managing planets doesn't have much depth. Build cities to up al resource output by a bit or build individual improvments to highly increase specific resource outputs. The game is mainly about building up your fleet and running combat missions.\n\n\nOne thing I really enjoy is the fleet building. You start off with two ships and some energy to upgrade them. The fun thing is that all ships start with roughly the same base stats, and depending on where you put upgrades it not only does it alter that ships apperance but also what role you're looking to use the ship in. As I said, the gameplay is fast paced, not a whole lot of depth but I still really enjoy playing it!

If you don't have those expectations upfront, then the game can be interesting in it's own way. At it's most basic level, Starships is actually "Ace Patrol" set in space with themes from Beyond Earth thrown in. The battle hex board layout is exactly the same as Ace Patrol, but the mechanics of how weapons play out is now space themed. There is definiely more detail here than in Ace Patrol when you look at all aspects of the game. There is a simplified research system, planets that are "upgradeable" to harvest more resources for upgrading your ships. All of this is simplified to a point where each aspect of the game could be thought of as an upgrade system, less discovery, and faster. The mission system is also simple and can get a little repetitive, but by mid-game it becomes only battles against other empires. This is a mobile game for the most part, but I don't mind playing a quick game on the PC when I have a moment. Some might say it's not worth $15, but that's actually cheap compared to the $50 epic game. For a fast playing strategy game with more depth than an "Ace Patrol", Starships is definitely worth it. The expectations around this game were poorly set up, so watch a gameplay video to decide if it's right for you.","March 14, 2015","true","26.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Do not expect deep or complex gameplay here. What you CAN expect is a turn-based strategy game that delivers a "pick-up-and-play" experience, tied into the "Beyond Earth" story.\n\nThe game is simple to get into, easy to learn and master, and perhaps not that challenging. This does however not stop it from being fun, but sadly there are some sides to the game that is, well, not shoddy. But perhaps not entirely well-thought out. There is little difference between the plasma cannons and the lasers (the two main types of weapons) in terms of visuals and mechanics, and you have no control over what your ships use. Close up? Plasma. Long range? Lasers. More depth would have been welcome. The maps do offer some nice mechanics (asteroids that block shots, "corridors" that open and close, wormholes that will teleport you and so on), but I still think they could have included gas clouds to hide in, rather than the (somewhat pointless) stealth system.\n\nOne area where I've always felt that the Firaxis games has excelled, is in the "feel" of different factions. I may have missed something here, but it seems that your opponents are generic in the extreme in "Starships". You can fight them, or not fight them, but you probably won't care much about them whichever way you decide to go. And they won't really care about you and what you do, unless you fight someone they don't like (they'll give you something or other as an incentive) or you pass through one of their starsystems (which results in an immediate declaration of war).\n\n\nPro:\n-"Pick-up-and-play" turn-based strategy.\n-Simple and fun in its own way.\n-Some pretty good ideas.\n\nCon:\n-Not very polished.\n-No real depth.\n-Abrupt ending.\n-Oversimplified game mechanics.\n-Not really great graphics.\n-Ship explosions are extremely lackluster.\n\n\nSummary:\nSid Meier's Starships is a turn-based strategy that offers quick "pick-up-and-play", wrapped in a plain package and with mechanics that falls short of what they could have been. This is not deep strategy, but rather "Ace Patrol in space". Keep that in mind, and be ready to forgive the game its simplified graphics and gameplay, and you will likely find a fun little game underneath it all. You may want to wait for a sale before picking it up though, as it seems to me that it is a bit overpriced relative to what you get.\n\n5/10 -Recommended, if on sale.\n\nFor more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation","March 13, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

I expected a polished simple single player experience and that is exactly what I got.\n\nAt first I was slightly disappointed in the introduction video. It should at the very least scale up to 1080p, but it is a minor aestethic complaint. Next I was confounded by the "Settings". Basically you can only choose between windowed or fullscreen, and you can adjust various volume levels. Thats it. Further on it becomes obvious that you will not need any advanced settings for this game.\n\nVisually the game delivers a polished, clean and smooth experience. Various icons and symbols ties nicely in with Beyond Earth. Aduio effects are also very BEish.\n\nStrategically you manage planets and one fleet of spaceships through resources produced by said planets and rewards from missions. You have to choose missions wisely because you can only complete so many each turn and those you ignore will be completed by your neighbours.\n\nTactically you move around and attack enemies on various "maps" generated for each battle and there are a handful of random elements thrown in for each battle.  You configure your ships offense based on preferred range and utility, and you have a few defensive options as well.\n\nThe whole thing ties together nicely and offer a relaxed, balanced single player experience. I can easily recommend this game.","March 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

But what I got is a game that is quite enjoyable.  Whilst the game borrows from the lore of Civilization Beyond Earth the game itself doesn't hold much in common.\n\nThe game works by having you perform missions at each planet you stop at.  Complete the mission and your influence on that planet rises till you control it.  When you control it you can improve it, gain resources and wonders, and generally have access to more "stuff".\n\nThe strategy comes in utilising your fleet (you only have one) to your benefit.  You only have a certain number of actions per turn so make sure you choose well.  Do you do a mission on a nearby planet?  Make a run for an emey's home world?  Or spend a turn to repair and make new ships in your fleet?\n\nOverall a really good game that ties "tried and true" Sid Meier concepts into the one game.","March 13, 2015","true","13.5"," 18 of 41 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","18","41","2","0"

It definitely has the portential to be a game like that. Now if only they combined civ 5 civBE and starships, let the game be civilization 5 and have civBE and starships be expansions to the game. Just add the techs of both games, satelites, and the planetary warfare, but no major changes to the way civ 5 runs  have it be nothing more but a large expansion to Civ 5. I would find it to be really cool to get to future in civ 5 have several stages that would reach you to the late game victories, for example when you complete space victory it would be a world wonder instead and you would get an advantage for ship tech or new future technology, or a say a diplomatic victory would give a bonus to how much influence you would have over a new world when you assist them in getting rid of marauders, and the dom victory would determine how powerful you were before when you jumped to the space section of the future and give you a bonus ship or give extra bounses to your ship, (unless you conquered everyone, then you would win an early victory). Another thing that could make combat very interesting would be, for one have more than one fleet and once you won the space combat you get to siege the actually planet and have to fight through the inter planetary defenses and show if you have what it takes to truely take over the world, instead of just beating their fleet and you have the world. The only other things that should be added could be the aliens and health which could be in place with having to deal with happiness from civ 5 at the same time, and make you have to deal advanced aliens whom are just advanced as you. And keep how the spy system works in Civ 5 althrough out the game, and keep the intrigue nosense from CivBE out of the game.","March 12, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

This plays like a board game you'd pull out with friends over beer and pizza. It is quick, fun, and has just a touch of strategy to make it interesting.\n\nSo is it worth the $15? I think so.

Whether or not I can recommend the game is dependent upon what you seek, and what your expectations are.\n\nThe biggest problem, from what I have inferred from reading reviews, is from disapointed expectations.  Civilization V and earlier Firaxis/Sid Meier games are nothing short of brilliant.  The entire Civilization series (and I have been there since its inception) could arguably be labeled the greatest PC games ever produced, from every which way you might want to analyze it: quality, depth, re-playablility, customization, fun, and strategy.\n\nIf you are looking for Starships to have the depth, and strategy (long-term planning and maneuvering) to achieve the final victory, you won't find that here.  This is a simple game, almost more like an arcade game with some choice elements to be determined by your preference, such as do you want firepower or stealth?  But not the intricies of long-term grand scale strategy that Civ is famous for.  If you are anticipating even a scaled-down version of Civ, you will be disappoineted.  This is not a game of watching your grand design come to frutuion.   After having played several games of Civilization V, marathons that lasted more than 800 turns and a week of playing per game, I welcome being able to play a quick in-and-out game like this.  This is more complicated than Solitaire or Minesweeper, and can be similarly addicitve.  Starships is NOT trying to be Civ.  Perhaps Firaxis went too far away from strategy on this one, but I had fun with it.    Simple fun.\n\nHowever, I was really disappointed the way ship design and outfitting work.  When I first heard about this release , I thought back to one of my all-time favortie games, Master of Orion II, and shrilled at the prospect of a Sid Meier version of this.  In MOO2, you selected a ship class, which was an empty shell, and you chose how to outfit it, based upon the research you had done.  And even if you were capable of adding your Class X shields to your ship, you could have instead installed Class V shields, allowing more space for other modules (such as another array of lasers) and reducing its cost.   And there were several choices of laser technology to add, based on research and function.   In Starships, there are only lasers (long-range) and plasma cannons (short range), with only a nebulous upgrade by incrementing a level.  I was looking forward to specialized intricate ship design.  There is none of that, as this is the simplest system.  For me, the ship designing  in MOO2 was the most exciting part of any Space 4X game I have ever played, and what I was hoping  Starships would be.  Based upon my expectation, my desire, this game fails.\n\nDoes this game have depth?  No.  Is the strategy a deep-thinking man's game like Civ?  No.  Was it fun?   Yes.    What you want from a game, the level of complexity and granularity you enjoy,  together with your expectation of Starships, will determine whether you think it is worth it ot not.    For some easy, casual and quick fun, Starships delivers.  But if you want this to be a CIv-like game, or somewhat like MOO2, complicated and full of strategic and tactical choices, it will not satisfy.","March 13, 2015","true","27.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Reminds me of MoO2, only less depth, and alot shorter.\n\nIt's the most basic of 4X games I've ever seen, and because, good. It polished its core very well, you need to explore to expand, and you need to exterminate your rivals to make sure you end up with a controlling majority of the galaxy. You explore other player by playing off know rivals, for boost in you tech or resources.\n\nI've only complete the one play through, and it took me roughly an hour. The controls took me about 15min to learn.\n\nComparing it to MoO2, combat is hex-bases rather than square based, and you take on the role of fleet commander. Very similar to each other, and it was nice.\n\nThe game is really basic, focusing on the core of what makes a 4X game, well, a 4X game, you can gain tech/recourses from fighting for a rival of a allied faction.\n\nI think we need to seem more games like this, games that focus on what makes a good 4X game, before we see another MoO3, or Galactic Civ game.

You just see the planets, but you can only see the appropriate suns are only visible in the ultra-cool space combat mode.\n\nAnd SAiIS delivers the general feeling!

It's purpose is to spread its light over all other planets in the galaxy. Unlike SAiS you have up to six opponents, who try to do the same things like you.\n\nIn "Starships" you always control exactly one fleet, consisting of a handfull of ships. You're heading from one quest to the next with these ships, until - after a while - it hopefully turns out, that you've been better than your opponents.\n\nI can raise my thumb for "Starships", for I like the immersion (that means: "atmosphere") of the game and because - being a 35-year old Gamer - I worship Sid Meier as a God!

You just see the planets, but you can only see the appropriate suns are only visible in the ultra-cool space combat mode.\n\nAnd SAiIS delivers the general feeling! You are put into the role of a Fleet Commander, assigned to a spacefaring civilization. Your civilization is always called "United Federation". It's purpose is to spread its light over all other planets in the galaxy. Unlike SAiS you have up to six opponents, who try to do the same things like you.\n\nIn "Starships" you always control exactly one fleet, consisting of a handfull of ships. You're heading from one quest to the next with these ships, until - after a while - it hopefully turns out, that you've been better than your opponents.\n\nI can raise my thumb for "Starships", for I like the immersion (that means: "atmosphere") of the game and because - being a 35-year old Gamer - I worship Sid Meier as a God!

I'll probably edit this again)\n\nIt's all about enjoying a digital board game set in space and chilling out. This is a lite-tactical hexagonal space mission game. As captain of a federation, you are charged with bouncing the fleet between planets completing various types of missions and winning over the galaxy that resulted in the wake of Beyond Earth. From the rewards from victories and accumulated resources, you're able to upgrade your ships in a few different ways from increasing their basic health and strength to providing abilities like stealth, torpedo salvos and carrier-borne interceptors. Strategic diplomacy is extremely basic, and amounts to whether you want to deal with the AI directly opposing you or not.\n\nThe game is very simple, and I recommend watching a "Let's Play" on YouTube before buying as it's a large departure from Firaxis' other games. The game feels like it'd be at home on a tablet or phone due to it's simplicity.\nThe gameplay pacing is well suited for short stints for people that want to relax with a small space tactical game. I think it's great to do a full voyage (about 4 missions) and then put the game down for a bit. It's not for great hour long marathons, but a full game might take anywhere from 1-2 hours.\nSo does it reflect Firaxis' Civ "just one more turn" philosophy? Probably not. But is that really a bad thing? It depends on what you were looking for. It's great for those times when one is juggling other tasks.\n\nThere are very few areas where I'd nit-pick it, especially as a single player game. There are many player strategies which are very unbalanced, such as cloaking mixed with some of the Wonders. I would say that the most fun I have is when I pick it up with a particular house-rule for my gameplay that restricts a particular technology or strategy that I'd used prior.\n\nI would love to see the ability to mod in and out various aspects, such as to revamp the resources in a drawn out game, and more of the missions reminicent of the exploration phase.\nFrom a technical perspective, if this was done in Ruby, I'm impressed and hopeful.\nI think it'd be a great project for even a scripter or programmer to step in and change things to suit their own tastes.","March 13, 2015","true","54.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Please don't let the "5-seconds after launch Negative Reviews" cloud your judgement of the title. They're the people spiteful about Beyond Earth feeling like a lesser Civ V and want to take it out on the developers they're suppose to love. This game is a cheap $15 for one, and what you get more than justifies the price as it's still complex and well-put together, like other 4X games, but revolves more on space combat while the resources Civ players are familiar with, gained through missions to other worlds and expanding your federation/empire are managed for the purpose of upgrading your soon-to-be armada that deserves "Empiral March" playing as they jump from hyperspace. That tight focus may honestly turn off hardcore Civ players but it's also a great middle ground for 4X fans that still might have trouble with the overwhelming concepts traditonal 4X throw at them off the bat and can become better aqauinted in this game. This game's connectivity with Beyond Earth makes that purpose seem almost intintional. So if you're looking for a game where you can simulate feeling like Tarkin commanding marine warfare from a Star Destroyer and being diplomatic with foreign worlds, and don't have a childish beef with Firaxis because one of the many godly games they made wasn't exactly they way YOU wanted it to be, this game is for you. And if you're still skeptical and have some chump change sitting, you can extend your library by 1 and try it for yourself. And once your comfortable with the mechanics, send me a game invite because I'm always down to play and my friends and I would love to fight for the galaxy with you until one Civ's left standing. Fight for your Civ and Empire!

This game is awesome! I don't get people who are complaining that this game isn't enough like the civ games...seriously...one of the biggest criticisms of critics regarding beyond earth was its supposed overly similar interface and gameplay (to civ 5). So sid releases a game that is only loosely based on beyond earth (factions, faction bonuses) and all of a sudden this game doesn't play the same as beyond earth or civ 5? wow..talk about hard to please....\n\nAnyways back to my review:\n\nThe good\n\n-This game is very tactical (the battlefield has asteroids/planets you can use as cover (to hide behind) and blocking players shots (some weapons can shoot through minimal asteroid fields but then the dmg you take is reduced (it feels good when the comp tells you you have only a 35% chance to complete a mission given your current situation (*ships/upgrades etc) and you still manage to pull it off!\n\n-upgrades on planets provide good strategic options (as planet wonders affect your economy, ships, battle, income, repair costs etc the list goes on...)\n\n-The ai is pretty sneaky and will come by and try to undermine your influence on planets that haven't been won over to your side yet\n\n-upgrading your ships even has some strategy too it (do you upgrade existing ships to have more movement points, higher shield, better weapons, cloaking, sensor range etc) vs buying a completely new ship and thus increasing your overall fleet size\n\n-fleet sizes don't seem to get too big, so its easy to manage, and the combat is really fun. of course you have to like turn based hex based combat to enjoy this (but what are you doing buying a sid meier game if you dont'? lol)\n\n-the ai will ally with other players against you (but its still not impossible to win...just hard) - so the challenge is there if you want it (as i only played on normal and i found it challenging)\n\n-the graphics are pretty good, and the animations look cool (lol its like  startrek but without familiar ship designs)\n\n-various parts of your economy to manage (balancing metal (to improve defenses/planets, food (to increase city sizes (and thus increase resource generation), energy (to upgrade your ship) and science points (to provide general upgrades to your entire fleet\n\n- all of the crap is pared away with this game..no random stats or updates on your planet populations mood/ or any of that garbage..this has been replaced with the morale of your starships troops (they fight less effectively until you give them shore leave (effectively this is the end turn button)..enemy does its turns and then you receive your planet income and start your new turn (with all morale restored). There is a wonder you can build on your planets so that your starship crew fights at max level no matter the level of fatigue (this is def something to research.).\n\n-the defense of your planets is handled well (you buy planet defense upgrade (its called a megabot or something) and they are basically extra ships that will assistn you in defense of a planet (good thing to upgrade...lol).\n\n\nthe bad\n\n-it would be nice if i could adjust the graphics options (even though it does look really good lol i like the ability to make it even better..thats why i bought an expensive pc....\n\n-the trainer (i.e. tutorial) is ok...but doesn't tell you everything you need to know...(tutorial is only a few popups and ends with telling you to click the info button (and it then gives you a suggestion of what to do). Some things i had to figure out for myself (most of it is intuitive so you will figure it out just by playing a game or two) but a little more help would have improved the experience for people who don't want to waste any time figuring out little details (for instance i didn't know i could improve defenses...build cities etc until i started clicking buttons to see what did what), i also didn't realize i could buy a new ship (instead of just improving the ones i had), i didn't know if i could have more than one fleet (it doesn't seem like you can) and it wasn't super obvious to me if i had to manually change weapons in combat (lasers for long range, photon something for close range and torpedoes for really far) lasers/photons activate when you go to attack the enemy by themselves (i.e. if its too far for photons you shoot lasers and vice versa). Torpedoes are weird in that you do activate it manually but when you shoot them (at first they dont' do anything...you have to wait until your next turn to manually detonate it or move it forward more) you have 2 turns to either move it forward a bit more or detonate it (after 2 turns it detonates by itself). generally people see them coming but you can move out of the way...unless you get the planet wonder that makes them perma stealthed (which is awesome). (ok this was long but basically as you can see..woulda been nice if the game just told me some of that stuff..but you figure it out pretty easy.\n\n- not much story here...at all (if you care about story this may irritate you)\n\n\nOverall, this game is pretty awesome...its fun to play, different enough from normal sid meier games that its refreshing, but familiar enough that you won't be completely lost if you have played a 4x strat game before. Definitely recommend this game! just buy it already!...at 17 bucks its less than half of what i paid for beyond earth and is just as fun so its a great price point for a game that has a surprising amount of depth at a price thats cheaper than going to a movie at the theater.","March 12, 2015","true","14.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Kind of a mix between Master of Orion and a tactical board game. Not a normal Sid Meier game where you can sink 100s of hours into, takes 1-2 hours to win and worth multiple replays. Not bad for 15 dollars. 8/10\n\n===More In Depth Review===\n\nSimple Space 4x where you have to get enough of the galaxy fighting for Team Player Character to win the galaxy super election.\n\nYou start off with one planet, and venture out to other planets to win their allegiance (either through doing quests, buying influence, destroying their factions fleet or simply ending your turn there). On each planet you can make upgrades that will either increase their resource output or add a warp gate (giving you free movement to the planet) or constructing a defensive fleet. Each planet rolls 1-2 random strategic attributes that give it an advantage (such as +50% energy output or 1/2 cost on resource buildings). Each planet also rolls a random tactical attribute such as torpedos being undetectable or more powerful cover from asteroids. A planet also has a chance of having the ability to have a wonder being built on it. All of this is somewhat simple, but there is a real swing factor in gaining or losing a planet with a great combination of attribute that adds a lot of fun to it.\n\nCombat is great and where most of the enjoyment is. It's hex based TBS that has a heavy emphasis on cover and positioning.  Ships have three weapons at their disposal- Lasers (long range light damage), Plasma (short range medium damage) and Torpedos (Long Range Massive damage, but very predictable). Ships can also activate stealth (can't be hit with targeted weapons, enemy has to use sensor to find you) activate sensors (for finding stealthed units) or activate impulse drive (trade an action for a single movement in any direction without turning). Effectively, how combat goes is you use asteroids for cover while denying cover to enemies with your torpedoes.\n\nUnlike plasma or lasers, torpedoes don't lose damage when fired through an asteroid field. They can't explode the first turn they are fired and continue moving in a straight line for up to three turns. As they automove on the second and third turn you are allowed to make them explode remotely as they move in "real time". Being near the center of a torpedo explosion is usually a one shot kill. The explosions also clear asteroids. Torpedos almost never directly get kills against you so long as you move out of their path. The AI doesn't seem to respect them enough though - in the last battle of the game I played I got a triple kill with a torpedo as three ships maneuvered close together to take pot shots at one of my fighters.\n\nYour army is a persistent fleet of ships that you purchase upgrades for. Upgrades are pretty predictable (engines give you more moves per turn, lasers do more damage) and there's no real incentive to specialize other then you can't afford all the upgrades at once. There's also a fairly mild experienced mechanic tied to a ship's performance in battle. Science ties into all of this as well, but it's just more simple upgrades to laser damage paid for with a separate currency that effects your whole fleet at once.\n\nWonder balance seems a bit wonky, there are some extremely cheesy wonders like the one that gives you an extra action in combat. It is somewhat limited in that you can't use it on firing lasers or plasma twice in a single turn... but you can fire two torpedos, or release twice as many fighter fleets or attack and then immediately cloak to avoid reprisals.\n\n===Overall===\n+Interesting, Fun Combat\n+Understandable UI\n+Powerful feeling planets attributes\n\n-Somewhat Questionable AI\n-Economy and Diplomacy seem simple even by the low standards of economy and diplomacy in Space 4X\n-A lot of uninteresting upgrades\n\nI'd love if it were multiplayer because the combat seems like it'd be more fun if there were living human beings on the other end but for $15 I won't pitch a fit over it. It's an entirely fun single player 4X that doesn't overstay it's welcome and is simple enough for people who don't normally play 4Xs.\n\nSidenote: There's also a lot of mutual unlocks with Civ: Beyond Earth but I haven't explored any of that yet so I'm ignoring it.","March 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","15","36","2","0"

If you're looking for Alpha Centauri 2 or a rehabilitation of Beyond Earth that isn't a weak Civ5 mod, you're in the wrong place.\n\nIf you want a board game to play on your computer, then this is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nStarships is a compact game probably designed primarily for mobile devices. And you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. Where Starships excels is in its vision and execution of making a game that recreates the board game experience.\n\nWhat's so elegant about Starships is that it takes common board game mechanics and takes advantage of the fact that since the game is being run on a computer, it can develop those mechanics to new heights. Developing planets as your resource generators very much mirrors how a board game might have a chart where you move tokens around to determine how much you get per turn. Special abilities function like cards drawn out of a deck, and the map looks like a game board. Even the victory condition, "Control 51% of the map" sounds like something out of a board game.\n\nThe combat is simple but deep. You get full customization of your units, and you move around on a hex grid shooting at each other with stuff like line of sight, distance, and cover to calculate. It would be unmanageable as a tabletop game (unless everyone playing is a total Warhammer junkie), but as a video game it's very easy to let the computer do all the calculations for you.\n\nLike any game worth its weight, the rules are very simple to understand after a turn or two, but there's enough nuance to them that you'll be spending quite a few hours understanding how to optimize everything and adjust on the fly.\n\nMajor strikes against the game: Missing a lot of basic computer game functions (come on, let me up the resolution!) and no multiplayer. The latter is pretty bad, but then again, it takes a very special group of people to have the patience to sit through a multiplayer 4X game.\n\nIn short: It's a board game. Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise. But it is a great board game that takes advantage of not forcing the players to calculate anything on the fly, and blossoms because of that. If you even enjoy the occassional game of Settlers of Catan, this is probably a game you'll enjoy.\n","March 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","15","36","0","0"

It's a hex based strategy game focused around fleets of starships. Don't expect the moon, but what's here is pure and well developed. The mechanics are clear and intuitive, as with any Sid Meier creation. You use your fleet to garner influence with planets by either performing missions or taking shore leave there. The planets provide resources and can be upgraded in a few ways. Combat is turn based. Your ship's shields are weak in the back and strong in the front. Asteroid fields either block sight completely or reduce it. Weapons vary with long range lasers, short range cannons and torpedoes that cover a finite amount of space per turn. Researchable technologies are tied to specific ship systems and planetary wonders affect a given gameplay mechanic. It's streamlined down to a fault, but it's a fault they're not trying to hide from you. This is a $15 game made with tablets in mind as much as a PC. The games are quick in comparison to the ‘oh it’s dawn now’ syndrom that’s inherent to the Civilization franchise which is refreshing.\n\nI’ve only played two games with harmony so I haven’t played around with the other two affinities. The easy difficulty is extremely easy, so I’d recommend going hard or in the least normal. Though easy is a safe way to get a feel for the game. I’ve also only used a couple of the commanders, but their special bonuses seem balanced enough tied to the right playstyles.\n\nThis is a good and purposely small game. It’s fun and quick and I really can’t say anything too negative about it. There’s no deception by Firaxis trying to build it up into something more than it is. But it’s inevitable that the game’s disinterest with being bigger than it is will bother a number of people. Thankfully it’s interested in what it is beyond the backlash.","March 12, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Because I didn't have undue expecations, so I think this game is fun! Yes, its simple.. its meant to be. Thats a good thing to me (and I play a lot of very complex deep games). The menu is sparse? Well.. its meant to be simple, so why would a simple game have a complex menu? You can easily playthrough a whole game in one night.. and again, thats not a bad thing! Its a quick and simple setup "boardgame" style and thats what makes it great! What more could you want for just $15?\n\nI have played every. single. sid meier. game. ever. And this game is not bad. Is it alpha centauri in space? No. Its not meant to be. No its not perfect, no game is anymore, not at launch anyway (devs need real feedback from players first, they can't read out minds). I think this game has a lot of potential down the road, especially with integration into civ: beyond earth.\n\nA few things I would like to see is a bit more information for the missions before I send my fleet there... some of those missions are brutal! Also, more than one fleet would be especially nice. The game is playable with only one fleet of ships though.\n\nBottom line: if you want a fun, simple, quick and easy(ish) game for cheap that ties into civ: be that can be played in an evening than this is good game for that. If you enjoy tactical turn-based battles and some micromanagment thats not overly complicated this game is good for you.

Why they link it to Pirates is unknown to me, it is more like Civ meets Air Patrol. The civ part requires very little management and the fleet system is so much fun to customize. By customize I don't mean the look of the ships, rather how tough, fast, how many hangars, etc. And if you want to reduce points you spent from say stealth to engine, you can in no time flat.\n\nIt does lack fullscreen mode at this point. But I've played worse games in fullscreen and some awesome games in windowed mode. I'd like to see it added, but I am not gonna whine and say it ruins the whole game. That's extremely petty when the game has much to offer to keep you busy.\n\nI think some folks are getting a bad impression of this game because of the lack of micro-management. To me that gets you in to the action that much faster, which is the point of this game. I've already spent hours conquering the galaxy. The maps aren't very huge, in this type of game they don't need to be. You don't have to exhaust yourself building 40 structures from the ground up like you do in Civ, that's a major plus for me. Although I love Civ, I didn't need another one so soon.\n\nFor the current cost of the game, it is great. It can use some polish, what game can't use some 5 years after it's launched?\n\nUpdate: I expected to get some down votes, can't expect children to understand simple logic with out getting their panties in a bunch I guess.

So the Game experience is what you get from a $10 game.. nothing more nothing less =). Even thou it have a Sid Meier's name on it.. it still a $10 game.

Each faction have a different ability and Each faction have 8 hero with different Hero skill. Not bad for a $10 game =)\n\nPros:\n* Fun tactical game. Simple but engaging enough. You want to be stealth shot from a far.. or.. you want to be a Tanker close up and personal. All up to you =)\n* Simple and Great Ship customization. The ship will reflect your build.. Add armor for more HP.. your ship will look buffy and Tanky\n* Simplicity done right. It does not feel overwhelming.

There are some features that could be better, no doubt, but for what it is, and the short time that I played it at the time of writing this review, I do recommend it.\n\nCompared to other Civ games, it's light, but the features that are in it make it pretty fun (even though they could do with some touching up). It seems like most people don't like the game very much, but for it's price, if your a fan of Civ games and other space games as well, I'd say give it a shot. It's not the greatest by any means, but still worth a look. I'm sure with future patches, the game will get better (hopefully).\n\nPros:\n-The ships for each affiliation (Supremacy, Harmony, Purity) look pretty good and when upgrading them, their look changes with each corresponding upgrade.\n-The way you get control of different planets is pretty cool (in my opinion)\n-A decent amount of leaders to choose from each with different bonuses\n-The battle and movement animations look nice and fairly smooth\n-Tactical battles are pretty fun, but may get boring quickly depending on who you face. (Pirates are a constant thing when it comes to the quests)\n-Easy to learn and understand the mechanics.\n\nCons:\n-The camera control is pretty awful. I get it was made for mobile as well as PC, but really? You can only move the camera with the arrow keys and it's pretty bad, especially in battles.\n-Quests to control planets can get repetitive; most of the time it's just beating up pirates of some sort, though since I've only just started playing, it may change as you go along (doubtful though).\n-There are no graphical options at all, and the fullscreen mode (at least for me) shows my taskbar still at the bottom of my screen. Minor, but can be annoying.\n-The affiliations are cool, but I wish there was a little more variety with them. The only real difference I've noticed so far are different looking ships and a different starting bonus.\n-The research "tree" is...lackluster to say the least.\n\nThat's about all for now. I'll update this review further as I play and as they patch the game in the future.\nPersonally, I do recommend it, but don't expect a huge amount, cause it's not Civ, but nevertheless, it's still pretty fun to play.\n\nThanks for reading, guys!\n-AwesomeOne","March 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 24 of 55 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","24","55","2","0"

It is not a Civ game and will not have that level of cmplexity. I think it has potential to be very moddable if they make that an option.\n\nNow with that said there are some things people need to know:\nThe tech tree is very imited and has no appreciable effect outside of combat\nThe game centers around space combat and gathering territory\nYou can only have 8 ships and they always travel as a group\nIt can feel a little rinse and repeat in the late game on Epic stick to shorter games\n\nNone of those things surprise me this is not a $50.00 game. What it does not have is any bugs I have found, it performs perfectly, and I have had fun playing it. I like space games, I like to unwind, I do not like to feel like I am managing an empire when I get off work during the week. This is exactly what I expected when I bought it, I watched a lot of game play videos from the creators before buying.\n\nI suggest if you like science fiction and want something to play thats simple and fun. Give it a try, watch a few videos first if you are unsure.\n\nIf however, you are expecting the next Orions, Civ in Space, Galactic Civ or what have you then you will be dissapointed.

You are playing a Sid Meir game, you are not here for the textures or graphics but rather the gameplay, and oh boy the gameplay does deliver. In a short quick game session you can finish a type of victory (I use type because if you go all dominiton and alliance the game can be won in about 3hrs). However, replayability is high.\n\nWhere it fails to livy what Beyond Earth failed to do, it does however stay  true to it's true purpose. Being Admiral Adama and fighting the Cylon in a race for time to stay alive...Well it's not about BSG but you get the feel of it. Every time you are in a battle, you get the tense feeling. Constantly studying the battle field and thinking 4 moves ahead. Should you place your fighters there in hopes they get the brunt force and not your destroyer, or maybe yet use the torpedo you launch 3 moves ago to wipe out a hub of enemy. When not in battle, you get to grow your Planets with cities, buildings, improvments, money/science making improvment, buying influence in order to gain control of the galaxy vastness of population.\n\nYou want a quick fun game that has core Civ gameplay with additional Starship Admiral Fleet battle, this is the game. If you are somewhat left with a "MEH" after Beyond Earth and think this game will make you love it, look no further then outside.\n\n22 german goat/29 falafel","March 12, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Which i feel make it a good addition to the CiV franchise for those day you dont want  to spend hours or days to play a CiV campaing. Building and maintaining your fleet is easy and quick, upgrading cities and building improvements are easier then ever.  I find it alot of fun.\n\nThe Bad\n\nJust like Beyond Earth the different faction personalities lack character, and arent that interesting, unlike its more historical predecessor,BE and Starships dont have humanitys rich history to draw upon in the players imagination and give us instead a barebones universe. I love sci-fi but there is so little lore in this game that can draw you in it quickly becomes a very sterile experience.\n\nStarships also lack true fullscreen and a decent options menu.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThe graphics are functional and colorful, but i cant say the game is especially pretty.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nSid Merier´s Starship is a lightweight mobile game that aimd in providing a on the fly fast CiV experience. I think the game achives it goals. It lacks the strategic depth and richness of the other civ games, but it has fairly enjoyable in shortbursts. Its the Sid Meier´s game you choose to play on  the train, before you go to school, a late friday night before a date or a party, If you dont like that idea and want something more substantial, i would not buy this game. However if you want affordable, fast paced tactics game Sid Meier`s starship provides that.\n\n\n","March 13, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

So go into it thinking that it's an ipad game.\n\nSo yea it's missing some key things for a pc title, namely resolution settings and a borderless full screen mode.  It also currently doesn't have multiplayer, it's biggest flaw i feel and one i hope they patch asap.\n\nSo gameplay:\n\nYou control a fleet and click on planets completeing neutral missions to try and convince the planet to join your empire, the harder the mission the more influence you get.  2 influence and they start trading with you, 4 influence and they join your empire.   The reason you want these planets is they produce 4 resources and you can upgrade these planets, build wondes, and increase their population as you see fit to get more resources to buy more things.   In addition you can completely customize your fleet.  Do you want 10 capital ships or 4 super beefy ones, long range guns or short, speed or stealth.  All can be customized indivdually.  And it's really nice.\n\nLike civ there are other players doing the same thing, and you can be peaceful with them or you can fight them. The neutral planets are actually kinda cool in this aspect because you might have went did a quest and got 2 influence but the other players are going to get another quest to go there and might take it from you or knock down your influence.\n\nAgain like civ you all repeat this process with better and better things until a victory condition is met either by population, galactic domination, or science.  First person to one of those wins.\n\nAll in all it's fast paced you only get 1 fleet so at most you can only do a couple things on your turn and planets can change hands quite quickly if you don't build up defenses.  The ai isn't amazing but it does ok i haven't tried the harder difficulties yet so perhaps they get a lot better there.\n\nThis game would be amazing if it had multiplayer.  This game is made for pass and play on an ipad or online multiplayer for pc.  Why they didn't include this in the game is anyones guess.  If a firaxis person is reading this please please give us multiplayer!\n\nIf you're looking for a quick paced game that you can pick up and put down after 10-30 min and a full campaign takes about 3 hours then this game is a lot of fun.  Could it be better?  Yes, but it's solid and plays well.    Most of the negative hate on this game seems to be centered around the fact that this is a mediocre port of an ipad game. But if you can get over that you'll have fun with it.","March 13, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

That being said, despite not playing this game for very long (and I will updated this review at that point in time), I don't have much time to play games anyway so thought I would share my thoughts thus far.\n\nThis game is amazing.  It so far reminds me of a space version of Pirates! which is fun in and of itself.  The object of the game is to control over half of the galaxy.  This can be accomplished, by spreading your influence, completing missions, etc.  You get to choose both your faction (for lack of a better word since I don't recall what each group is called) as well as your hero (much like nations and skills in Pirates!).  I'm really looking forward to playing more of this, but I am definitely recommending this for now.  :)","March 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","2","9","2","0"

Why? Because a number of people had expectations which were completely out of line with the game that Firaxis promoted repeatedly on their YouTube channel.\n\nSid Meier's Starships was announced as a tablet game with a PC version from the get-go, but a certain segment of gamers saw the name Sid Meier and convinced themselves that this game was going to be Civilization In Space (a.k.a. Sid Meier's Master Of Orion) despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nHere's what it is: a simplified tactical space game with colorful graphics and impressive music. It has some depth -- it might be worth reading the in-game rules section to understand the game's strategic layer -- but it's basically a tactical starship battle game.\n\nDoes the game have problems? Yup. The lack of a true fullscreen on PC, for example, really annoys me (you have to manually set your taskbar to auto-hide) but there's nothing wrong here on day one that a few, inevitable post-launch patches won't fix.\n\nSo, if you're undecided, wait for the patching. Some people report not being able to start the game at all, but I've seen none of that here. (If it won't start, I've heard that skipping the opening cutscene may be a work-around)\n\nDay One Verdict? The things I like about Sid Meier's Starships outweigh the things I don't, by a fairly wide margin. I expect a number of issues to be corrected with patches, going forward. This isn't the next great strategy game -- it's a "play it for fast, fun starship battles" tablet game.\n\nYou won't devote days and weeks of your life to this game, but I think Sid Meier's Starships does what it set out to do very well.","March 13, 2015","true","8.6"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","11","28","2","0"

With a not-too-complex playstyle, Starships is a fun short-game alternative to the Civ:BE universe akin to Ace Patrol (only with a bit more simplistic battle mechanics). Also, there's the added bonus of cross-game rewards between Civ:BE and Starhips, although I've yet to figure out how that system works precisely. Some bonuses are straightforward, and other pop-ups I've gotten saying I've unlocked something left me a bit perplexed.\n\nI've found that in order to have a worthwhile run of a game lasting more than an hour I have to restrict myself to Domination victory, at which point one can accrue a rather sizable fleet which on harder difficulties can make for interesting battles with the AI. So, bearing in mind the $15 price tag, understand what you're getting into if you're on the fence about this one.

It does have some strange errors, but I think it has something to do with the fact that it is made for many platforms and they have forgotten to focus on each of them. As the game is now, it feels more like a game for tablet in design. For eksample: there is no exit option, I simply think they forgot it. There is only borderless window for fullscreen, you can always see you desktop info bar. Theese things a sloppy design, but forgiveable.\n\nThere could have been a better tutorial. The one in the game is more or less worthless, but when you figure it out, it is pretty straightforward. I think we will see some patches comming pretty soon.\n\nI like the game, and unlike many civ games it is over pretty fast. Some may like it (I actually do and i'm a big fan of the civ games) It is something you can do, when you have some time to spare. It has that boardgame / casual game feeling to it.\n\nIt feels like they wanted it to be a DLC for "Beyond Earth" and decided, that it would not work. If that was the original plan, then I think it was a good idea to make it a standalone game.","March 12, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

If your looking for a Civ in space thats not this game. More a guilty pleasure game with great graphics and some stratedgy working the battle field. I played on the second easiest level and once I figured out how to play it wasn't much of a challenge so far. I love how you can customize the ships to what battle style you like but was a little peeved you can only have one fleet. Or did I miss something? The options for the planets seem daunting at first but on the level I played at you really didn't need to upgrade them much. Why upgrade them when you can just as easily and with a lot more fun take over a new planet? On my level, it seems that if you make peace with everyone but the people your fighting, you are good to go. I am currently third in ranking as far as the percentage I need to win but all I need to do is attack the ones ahead of me to correct that. I seem to have the strongest fleet quit by accident as I built it before I knew what I was doing. LOL.\n\nI give it two thumbs up if you accept the game for what it is.

The game is tightly focused on the tactical missions, which is the whole point. The strategic layer is intentionally light to keep most of the playtime in the battles, where it belongs.\n\nThe missions and ship configurations are varied enough to keep the game interesting through many iterations.\n\nStarships is short.  A standard map game can be finished in a few hours, even a huge map game will take a tiny fraction of the time needed to play Civilization. Short is good. I love Civilization, but I can count one hand the number of games of Civ5 I've actually been able to finish in the last two years. And more often than not  Civilization ends with a grinding game of attrition or acumulation of culture points that is simply not that much fun. The strategic game in Starships does a good job of avoiding this kind of slog. The action in Starships builds steadily throughout the game until a satisfying climax in a decisive big fleet battle (at least in my games so far.)\n\nThere is no multiplayer. This is also a good thing. If you really want a multiplayer online TBS game with both a strategic/political level and a tactical battleboard, then IMHO you really, really have way to much time on your hands and need to get a life.\n\nI strongly recommend Starships.\n\nI do have two minor quibbles.\nFirst, players cannot rename their ships (or I haven't yet figured out how.)\nSecond, the game could use an empire management screen/table to make it easier to find and develop your planets on the larger maps.","March 12, 2015","true","34.0"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

I am a fan.  I am a Civilization Fan as well.   I am also a turn based fan in general.  That said I haven't been near the fan of Civ: BE as prior Civ games, and was a disappointed with it.  That said when I heard about Starships I was interested though I didn't jump on it like I would normally have done.  That said when GMG offered a great sale on the game for just over $10 prior to release I went ahead and figured what the heck and picked the game up.\n\nFirst off I do believe that Starships was going to be an expansion or even part of Beyond Earth.  Does it feel like a AAA game?  No, but then again it is not selling at AAA prices.   Does the fact that it is tablet friendly make it less of a fun game? No I don't think so.   Is the game complex?  No, but it is fun for when you want to kick back and just have a relaxed turn based game.\n\nI know that the game is getting mixed reviews, however I haven't seen any bugs in the game, and have enjoyed it for the small amount of time I have been playing it so far.  Is it ground breaking?  Not  in the least.  But for even the asking price I have hundreds of games that I paid double the price for and found far less entertaining.\n\nThe game isn't something I see myself playing every day.  To me it is going to be one of those games that I turn to when I am watching TV and have other distractions yet want something to do when I don't feel like forwarding through commericals.

That's very important but only to me.\n\n-The user interface and options as a whole are downright terrible. If I hadn't been told in countless videos that this was developed for PC first, I would have thought it was an IPad game first. No fullscreen, no WASD panning, no edge-scrolling, no remappable keys, and I could go on and on. Also the "turn ship" system is wonky.\n\nAs it sits RIGHT NOW, I rate the game a "good" out of "ADOM-levels of awesome!"\n\nIf the UI issues get fixed, this looks to be upgraded to a solid "great." If there are new features added (more quests, longer gameplay options, etc.) alongside the UI fixes, this game could go all the way to "Played Once A Day."","March 12, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

The combat has a surprising amount of nuance for the simplicity of the rules, and the visual effects, while being light enough for older systems, are nicely pretty.\n\nThe range of starting options also means that there's a lot of different approaches in the game, different starting conditions that you can control - as well as all the random variation that you can't control.\n\nIt's not a civ game, it's not MOO-like (or GalCiv-like, or SotS-like) - it's all about the adventure and tactical combat, with some light 4X-like elements to tie it all together.\n\nAnd I'm having a lot of fun with it. There are some rough edges, like the lack of an 'exit game' control on the main menu, and no true-fullscreen (only fullscreen window, and that isn'r borderless), but then it's not a game to play for hours and hours on end, but 20-60 minutes here and there.\n\nBut I'm also going to have to go back to BE to get as much as I can out of it - some minor content elements are locked until you do something in BE to unlock them.","March 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","5","28","0","0"

You can dive into a game fairly quickly, and you'll pick up on what ship and planet upgrades work for you as you move through your first game.\n\nCombat is simple, quick, and aggressive. Most engagements throw you into the fray or require you to act quickly to complete your objective.\n\nThere's not much more than peace or war for negotiations in Starships. You can usually aim for the opponent's home world to capture their empire in one go, which makes the game rather easy at some points.\n\nI personally don't see how people thought this game would be a full on Civilization game at a $15 pricepoint. If you're looking for a game to tie you over for a few hours at a time, then this might be what you're looking for. If you're looking for a $15 Civ game then you're obviously on the wrong page because this isn't even an entry in the Civ franchise. Wait for Civ 5 to go on sale or what have you.\n\nOverall, it's a solid game that makes for a good couple of hours of play, much like Faster Than Light.","March 14, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is much simplier than we are used to from Firaxis however it does have a certain quality about it. That quality however is not in the UI or the graphics. They are clearly there for a tablet to run and that alone.\n\nI have enjoyed the games I have played so far and while I wasn't expecting Masters of Orion or Galactic Civilizations I was sad to see the empire aspect so dumbed down. I had it on normal my first game and didn't even have to upgrade my planets. I just did it because I could. The wonders however are where it is at. Take the Reactive Armor wonder it makes you immune to torpedo damage, another great wonder is Hyperlaunch which allows your figthers to use their full movement after launch. These are where the planets really shine, it sadly it would be better if there was a multiplayer because then the usefulness of these planets would create natural battlegrounds.\n\nThat is if you had muliple fleets, but you don't, you get one, one that will ALWAYS be there to defend if you get attacked. Making flanking your enemies, or catching them out of position completely useless. You also don't actually destory your enemies fleet, they just get knocked for a time, as do yours.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it for what it is, if I could do it again I would wait for a steam sale.\n\nOh one last thing, as you play this and Beyond Earth you unlock little perks in the other game.

Since BE runs $25 during a normal Steam sale, I ended up paying $2 for Starships - for $2, this game is AMAZING.  It's light...nothing at all like Civ or BE.\n\nTo me, to give a perspective/description to what the game feels like or what you should expect, you have to start with a baseline - for me, that's Civ 5 with all the DLCs/expansion packs.  If you start there, Civ 5 gives you tons of options and playstyles...then you simplify when you move to BE where you have a fairly young game with fewer options that still feels more or less like Civ 5 without any of the major DLC packs...then you move to something like "Pandora: First Contact" - a Civ-style 4x game that almost completely focuses on battles, and as such, has a lot of upgrade options for units, lots of unit variety, lots of fun attack graphics, but offers little in the way of multiple play styles...then finally, you get to Starships - a game that is *JUST* fighting.  Think of it as "Risk - Beyond Earth" or "Axis and Allies: year 3400AD Edition".  It's totally not a 4x game - it's just about claiming land, kicking spaceship ♥♥♥, and buying new upgrades.  I think the game normally runs around $10, and by my math, I figure that I'm willing to spend roughly $0.50-$1/hour for a good game.  Well, since I spent $2 and have played for about 50 hours, I spent about a nickel per hour on this game.  I can live with that.  Even at $10, that'd still be less than a quater/hour.\n\nSynopsis - if you want to shoot things in space, go for it.  If you want to play Civ 5, go do that instead.  If you want Civ 5 super space edition, wait another 2 years for Firaxis to release 2-3 BE DLC's and then buy it on a Steam sale.","April 3, 2015","true","126.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since BE runs $25 during a normal Steam sale, I ended up paying $2 for Starships - for $2, this game is AMAZING.  It's light...nothing at all like Civ or BE.\n\nTo me, to give a perspective/description to what the game feels like or what you should expect, you have to start with a baseline - for me, that's Civ 5 with all the DLCs/expansion packs.  If you start there, Civ 5 gives you tons of options and playstyles...then you simplify when you move to BE where you have a fairly young game with fewer options that still feels more or less like Civ 5 without any of the major DLC packs...then you move to something like "Pandora: First Contact" - a Civ-style 4x game that almost completely focuses on battles, and as such, has a lot of upgrade options for units, lots of unit variety, lots of fun attack graphics, but offers little in the way of multiple play styles...then finally, you get to Starships - a game that is *JUST* fighting.  Think of it as "Risk - Beyond Earth" or "Axis and Allies: year 3400AD Edition".  It's totally not a 4x game - it's just about claiming land, kicking spaceship ♥♥♥, and buying new upgrades.  I think the game normally runs around $10, and by my math, I figure that I'm willing to spend roughly $0.50-$1/hour for a good game.  Well, since I spent $2 and have played for about 50 hours, I spent about a nickel per hour on this game.  I can live with that.  Even at $10, that'd still be less than a quater/hour.\n\nSynopsis - if you want to shoot things in space, go for it.  If you want to play Civ 5, go do that instead.  If you want Civ 5 super space edition, wait another 2 years for Firaxis to release 2-3 BE DLC's and then buy it on a Steam sale.","April 3, 2015","true","126.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can dive into a game fairly quickly, and you'll pick up on what ship and planet upgrades work for you as you move through your first game.\n\nCombat is simple, quick, and aggressive. Most engagements throw you into the fray or require you to act quickly to complete your objective.\n\nThere's not much more than peace or war for negotiations in Starships. You can usually aim for the opponent's home world to capture their empire in one go, which makes the game rather easy at some points.\n\nI personally don't see how people thought this game would be a full on Civilization game at a $15 pricepoint. If you're looking for a game to tie you over for a few hours at a time, then this might be what you're looking for. If you're looking for a $15 Civ game then you're obviously on the wrong page because this isn't even an entry in the Civ franchise. Wait for Civ 5 to go on sale or what have you.\n\nOverall, it's a solid game that makes for a good couple of hours of play, much like Faster Than Light.","March 14, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was hoping this game would be more like "Pirate". The game plays similar to civ but construction on planets is instant aswell as research. You are only allowed one fleet of starships and the computer is easier that i could have imagined. once you complete a play through there really isnt much replayablility unless you're a complitionist.

It is much simplier than we are used to from Firaxis however it does have a certain quality about it. That quality however is not in the UI or the graphics. They are clearly there for a tablet to run and that alone.\n\nI have enjoyed the games I have played so far and while I wasn't expecting Masters of Orion or Galactic Civilizations I was sad to see the empire aspect so dumbed down. I had it on normal my first game and didn't even have to upgrade my planets. I just did it because I could. The wonders however are where it is at. Take the Reactive Armor wonder it makes you immune to torpedo damage, another great wonder is Hyperlaunch which allows your figthers to use their full movement after launch. These are where the planets really shine, it sadly it would be better if there was a multiplayer because then the usefulness of these planets would create natural battlegrounds.\n\nThat is if you had muliple fleets, but you don't, you get one, one that will ALWAYS be there to defend if you get attacked. Making flanking your enemies, or catching them out of position completely useless. You also don't actually destory your enemies fleet, they just get knocked for a time, as do yours.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it for what it is, if I could do it again I would wait for a steam sale.\n\nOh one last thing, as you play this and Beyond Earth you unlock little perks in the other game. This is a nice little extra however I have no idea what I am unlocking for Beyond Earth as that game doesn't tell me what I have unlocked.","March 12, 2015","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You might enjoy Galactic Civilizations if that is what you're looking for. This game is based in the same universe as Sid Meier's Civilizations but the mechanics are much simpler.\n\nStory:\nIt's based upon a future almost immediately proceeding Civilizations: Beyond Earth. You are just beginning to foray into the galaxy with the ability to travel faster than light, thus enabling interstellar commerce. Your goal is to win via military might, cultural or diplomatic prowess, economic finesse, population sustainance, or scientific transcendence.\n\nMechanics:\nBasically you build up a fleet of ships and upgrade them to fill roles you want them to fill. You then use this fleet to win the loyalty of other planets in the galaxy. It's turned based, so once your fleet has exhausted it's resources you will pass the turn to the other players or AI's. The combat is very reminiscent of civilization, but more tactical. It throws in objectives and obstacles and environment hazards. Your ships will have certain abilities based on the upgrades you outfit them with. They can range from Carriers, Battleships, Destroyers, or Corvettes. You start with a corvette, then outfit it with heavier weapons, better sensors, faster engines, stealth, or fighter bays.\n\nWhen you have influence on a planet, they contribute resources to your pool and you may build improvements on them, such as increased metal production, or science, energy, or even building a wonder to boost your fleet.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a fun game! Not quite as in depth as Civ 5 or BE, but Sid Meier did well with providing us a new game for the universe. I recommend it.","May 23, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Colonizing planets, building fleets, etc.\n\nWhat this game has is far too simplistic. As far as I can tell you only get one fleet, and it's mostly doing "missions" at stars which are already colonized and winning their influence over to your federation. The combat might turn out to be interesting... but that's the most interesting thing the game has to offer. When they called it "Starships", they meant it - Starships, and just that. Maybe they should've called it "Starship Combat".\n\nThe plot is interesting, and there's a skeleton that could hold up a nice, robust game, but it's just not here. I've read reviews that indicate it seems like a tablet game that was just stuck onto PC, and I have to agree. We need more in a PC game, especially from a brand with the playability-and-depth we've come to expect from Sid Meier and Firaxis.\n\nI still hold out hope that maybe an expansion - or a sequel? - will add some depth to this game. I only paid about $25 for both Beyond Earth and this game in a sale bundle, so I suppose I got my money's worth, but it doesn't feel like it.\n\nI guess if I want my space-based empire-simulator, I should just fire up Master of Orion 2 from 1996; nobody has really done it that well since.

Sadly the finished product feels like a rushed attempt at trying to create something that could have been great but falls short in so many way and ultimately feels like a Civilization: Beyond Earth mini-game.\n\nThe game revolves around conquering planets with a single fleet of starships & engaging in repetitive battles that feature an uninspiring AI that can be easily defeated once you (quickly) discover a simple formulae for defeating opponents (You can quite easily hide your ships in cover and cripple the enemy with waves of torpedoes & fighters).\n\nI don’t explicitly dislike Starships, however, there is very little replay value and almost no scope for variety in terms of how you play the game, due to the almost identical factions and simplistic victory conditions (I’ve found myself winning a population victory by accident on several occasions).\n\nAlthough the game isn’t anywhere near as engaging as I hoped, it does have good touch support and is a pleasant enough game to play on a tablet when on the move or sitting in bed. As much as I hate taking the price into consideration, as I would have much rather paid three times as much for a far deeper experience, I do think that it’s a decent enough arcade game for killing time in short bursts.\n\nIn summary I’m going to (only just) recommend Starships based purely on the fact that it’s a cheap and cheerful game to pass an hour or so here-and-there, just don’t expect the same engaging experience that you might expect from other games in the franchise.","April 1, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also makes itself perfectly clear in that it was developed for a tablet, be that an ipad or a windows tablet it matters little.  The only reason this is on steam is because there are windows tablets out there.  Making this painfully obvious is the lack of any graphics settings at all other than windowed or windowed full screen.  Clearly this game is aiming at the lowest common denominator and calling that good enough.  Don't get me wrong the graphics in this game look fine over all, but if they were really making this for a regular pc there would be at least a option to change the resolution and play at full screen.\n\nWhat also stands out is the size of the maps.  Mind you I have just played an 'epic' sized map and cannot comment on any smaller size maps, but if I were to put a label on the size of this 'epic' map I would maybe put it at medium in a range of tiny small medium large epic.\n\nOne interesting change from normal 4x games is that all upgrades, ships, wonders, or really anything you have to buy is all made instantly.  No having to wait for several turns for tech to research or a new city to build.  The only nod in that direction is the amount of turns it takes to gain control of a 'system'.  Which even that can be bypassed biased upon the level of difficulty rating of the mission at the planet.\n\nThe fights were somewhat interesting in how they were done on the grid like final fantasy tactics.  The only real issue I had here was the computer gives you a rating on what it 'thinks' is your chance of winning.  This possibly is correct on your first few battles, but after that its totally useless.  I had fights that it was telling me I had a 25% chance of winning where I totally steamrolled the enemy, or never even encountered the enemy because of random placement on the map and the mission type.\n\nOverall the game matched up well with what I would think of as a mobile game, but there is a lot left lacking for a game that would be designed for the pc.  Note however, that does not make this a bad game even on the pc, as there have been much worse ones made.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game comes down to its cost.  This is not a game worth 15 bucks, not even on mobile.  I would expect a bit more work, and replay ability for that.  Knock 10 bucks off however, and this game would probably be in a pretty good place cost wise for both pc and mobile.\n\nI would say I'm fairly neutral on the game itself, its neither good nor bad, however it is outside of its price point should be by quite a bit for what it offers.\n","March 24, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some part of the game were created little overly simple but the game play had a good flow. The parts that make the game are the easy of use for the fleets but pretty cool ship upgrade system. The ally part doesn't make a whole lot of sense in this game as pretty much everyone is the enemy it appears but I may just provoke them. The game ended surprising early for a small game which was nice for those without alot of time. I waited a week or two before getting the game but it appears to not be really buggy.

Sadly the finished product feels like a rushed attempt at trying to create something that could have been great but falls short in so many way and ultimately feels like a Civilization: Beyond Earth mini-game.\n\nThe game revolves around conquering planets with a single fleet of starships & engaging in repetitive battles that feature an uninspiring AI that can be easily defeated once you (quickly) discover a simple formulae for defeating opponents (You can quite easily hide your ships in cover and cripple the enemy with waves of torpedoes & fighters).\n\nI don’t explicitly dislike Starships, however, there is very little replay value and almost no scope for variety in terms of how you play the game, due to the almost identical factions and simplistic victory conditions (I’ve found myself winning a population victory by accident on several occasions).\n\nAlthough the game isn’t anywhere near as engaging as I hoped, it does have good touch support and is a pleasant enough game to play on a tablet when on the move or sitting in bed. As much as I hate taking the price into consideration, as I would have much rather paid three times as much for a far deeper experience, I do think that it’s a decent enough arcade game for killing time in short bursts.\n\nIn summary I’m going to (only just) recommend Starships based purely on the fact that it’s a cheap and cheerful game to pass an hour or so here-and-there, just don’t expect the same engaging experience that you might expect from other games in the franchise.","April 1, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall I'm pretty pleased, I think it fills it's niche very well. Most of the critics seem to expect a full AAA $60 game experience for $15 and that just isn't fair. I think this game would be better thought of, and later expanded upon, the way so many great tabletop games have a core module with a ton of add ons. Catan does it, Dominion does it, Arkham does it, Warhammer sure as ♥♥♥♥ does the hell out of it.\n\nIf possible, a little more depth and diversity would be nice, but I'd be perfectly happy with this becoming a platform for DLC or open it up for modders on the PC. Adding an endgame alien invasion mechanic would be awesome; you've united the galaxy under your banner, now lead it! Or add a ground combat miniscenario in a DLC pack. Rig one of your capital ships as a troop carrying drop ship they way you currently can have a fighter centered carrier. Maybe they can launch boarding parties to capture vessels? Bringing in something like the crew specialists from Pirates! is something I think would be really cool, too.\n\nI'm sure almost all of this is just wishful thinking, but I think it is a testament to a really great game that it inspires all kinds of ways it could (realistically) expand and be even better.","April 2, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since BE runs $25 during a normal Steam sale, I ended up paying $2 for Starships - for $2, this game is AMAZING.  It's light...nothing at all like Civ or BE.\n\nTo me, to give a perspective/description to what the game feels like or what you should expect, you have to start with a baseline - for me, that's Civ 5 with all the DLCs/expansion packs.  If you start there, Civ 5 gives you tons of options and playstyles...then you simplify when you move to BE where you have a fairly young game with fewer options that still feels more or less like Civ 5 without any of the major DLC packs...then you move to something like "Pandora: First Contact" - a Civ-style 4x game that almost completely focuses on battles, and as such, has a lot of upgrade options for units, lots of unit variety, lots of fun attack graphics, but offers little in the way of multiple play styles...then finally, you get to Starships - a game that is *JUST* fighting.  Think of it as "Risk - Beyond Earth" or "Axis and Allies: year 3400AD Edition".  It's totally not a 4x game - it's just about claiming land, kicking spaceship ♥♥♥, and buying new upgrades.  I think the game normally runs around $10, and by my math, I figure that I'm willing to spend roughly $0.50-$1/hour for a good game.  Well, since I spent $2 and have played for about 50 hours, I spent about a nickel per hour on this game.  I can live with that.  Even at $10, that'd still be less than a quater/hour.\n\nSynopsis - if you want to shoot things in space, go for it.  If you want to play Civ 5, go do that instead.  If you want Civ 5 super space edition, wait another 2 years for Firaxis to release 2-3 BE DLC's and then buy it on a Steam sale.","April 3, 2015","true","126.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some planets have 'wonders' . And you have a fleet (that you can also upgrade) to fly around exploring and capturing. So far so good.

Sadly, my first game ended with me building enough wonders to get a wonder victory, one move away from an absolutely devastating battle between myself (strongest faction) and the second strongest  CPU.  Unfortunately, I'll never get to play that battle because "Just One More Turn" is now an extinct part of Sid Meier's repertoire.\n\nThe game itself is entertaining and enjoyable, if not incredibly dumbed down.  I absolutely love the torpedo mechanic of ship combat, it is something unique and adds a bit of dimension to the otherwise fairly basic combat game play.  However, because of the aforementioned, lack of multiplayer, and other features stripped from the franchise, I cannot whole-heartedly recommend this game.  If it goes on sale for 50% off, it'd be something fun to buy and play for a day or two, but I do not see this game having much long-lasting appeal.  It's more dumbed down that Civ V or Beyond Earth (though the price should be an indicator of that), which I think for some people is a good thing.  However, for people like me, who grew up with Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Civ II, the old, "proper" Civ games, this just feels like a massive steps backward from already several previous step backwards (Civ V, and Beyond Earth).\n\nYou decide for yourself if this is the type of game you are looking for.

The visuals of the game are ok but that is not why people play strategy games. Customising your ships is easy and can lend it self to creating different specilisations of your ships.\n\nThis game is lacking in depth for a real strategy fan. The battle system is similar to XCOM (turn based) however there now real sense of cover. You can use asteroids to bottleneck your opponent into a sort of kill box but then you might end up being shot through the asteroids anyway. The random environment effects that disable certain features of the ships can be annoying but do not really factor into any kind of strategy.\n\nLack of information when mousing over various aspects of the game is very annoying. You have no way of knowing what exactly is happening when you are spending energy upgrading your ships. What does upgrading fighters do? Make them stronger? More fighters? There is no way to tell easily unless you commit to it. Upgrading fighters just gives more fighters to that can be deployed by your starship.\n\nThe world map portion of the game is another feature lacking any real depth. You can control planets for more resources and wonders but that is all they are good for, you can specialise them for more of a certain resource but that is it.\n\nThe map sizes are very tiny and are meant for quick games nothing long and drawn out like the Civ games. I was hoping for a massive epic length battle like in civ but sadly, that is not the case.\n\nVictory condition restrictions only apply to the player. If you wanted a massive conquest style game that allows you to get your starships to the end game you will not see it. The AI can easily win with a wonder victory or science before you have any real chance to see the full glory of your starships. Would really love those victory conditions to be applied to the AI as well.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to any strategy or civ fan.","March 21, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hopefully by then the major bugs will have been fixed.  And don't buy it for over $10.\n\nIt runs for me, but apparently not for many.  One bug I did run into was achievements not unlocking when they should.  (Granted, I fulfilled the requirements for a couple by conquest, when apparently normaly building was the intended way.  But still, these things should be checked for.)\n\nIt's generic science fiction that tries to be 4x, but really is all about your single steadily growing fleet rolling over the galaxy.  Upgrading your planets is almost inconsequential compared to upgrading your fleet.  Energy constraints heavily favor optimizing for just one form of attack; in particular, lasers 4+ and 0 cannons, torpedoes, et cetera mean you can destroy most targets from a long distance, often times even through asteroids.  (Just make sure you are strong enough before attacking homeworlds: the defense ships that any homeworld starts with will maul a starting fleet, but they don't upgrade over time.)\n\nAs of this writing, the non-military victory conditions are only feasible if you disable the military victory conditions.  (The UI lets you enable all victory conditions, or only one specific condition, with no option to, say, only disable Population.)  Otherwise, someone's probably going to win a Population victory first.  Even the Domination victory is usually preceeded by a Population victory, unless someone (probably you) launches an early attack on the other empires, to score a Domination victory before enough of the galaxy has been claimed that reducing the galaxy to 2 empires (a necessary prelude to reducing it to 1 for Domination) triggers a Population victory.\n\nI do not recommend this game at this time, but if you are reading months or years later - after the bugs have been fixed - and you can get it for under $10, it might be a cheap diversion for a weekend or two.","March 21, 2015","false","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an expensive version of a free Facebook game... read more to find out why.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this game. From the pre-order description, and the fact that Sid Meier does an amazing job with about 95% of the games that they produce, this had a ton of potential.\n\nBranded as a 4x game that related to Beyond Earth, I was a bit hopeful to see something that played like Master of Orion 2 and had the space-ground gameplay of Star Commander. Alas, I got my hopes up too high.\n\nAlso, before you go too much farther with this, just know that I haven't read the other reviews. This is my own take on this game.\n\nEverything from the tech, to the resources, (lack of) diplomacy, (generic) space combat, and AI feels flat.\n\nTECH: The tech "tree" is just a menu of upgrade. There are no new capabilities to introduce and no real choices that force you to examine tradeoffs and benefits. After playing BE, you'll likely be especially let down because NONE of that innovation exists in this game.\n\nRESOURCES: Four resources, and four very narrow things to do with them. Like most campy Facebook games, using your resources requires no more thought than a button click.\n\nDIPLOMACY: My main complaint with most Civ games is that you have options that the AI will not accept... in this case, you don't even have those options. Your two basic negotiating stances are a) war, or b) peace. Given the combat, neither has any particular advantages.\n\nCOMBAT: This is probably the only (slightly) redeeming part of this game. For about the first 20 turns, the combat and the missions are challenging. Once you've pumped enough resources into your ships, you can pretty well steamroll the AI with impunity.\nOh yes, the ship customization (and the reason why I was excited about this game)... yawn. Again, like the tech tree, the characteristics of each of your ships can be leveled up to attain greater advantage. There is no researching of new ship hulls, engines, weapons, or shields; just leveling. Facebook flash games have more options than this... such as Battle Pirates.\nFinal thing that I'll say on combat is this: one fleet? If SM was trying a new twist on 4x games to limit player to one fleet and up the challenge, this was a terrible choice. Any potential challenge is wasted because they let you construct warp gates so that you do not use up movement points while moving between your own worlds.\n\nAI: Now for the AI. Like the rest of the game, the AI is stale and offers no challenge. In three different play throughs of the game (each at increasing difficulty), I have as yet to have an AI player declare war on me or attack me. I can roam the galaxy with my large armada of heavily armed ships and tear through pretty much every other empire with little effort.\n\nWhat could have been a stellar game (see what I did there?) is really just a black hole for your wallet (even at $13 - as of this writing).\n\nSave your money. Save your time. Don't save this galaxy (or SM's bottom line).","March 22, 2015","false","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe they should've called it "Starship Combat".\n\nThe plot is interesting, and there's a skeleton that could hold up a nice, robust game, but it's just not here.

I expected it to be a 'lite' Civ game, but even as such it is woefully inadequate. Even largest sized galaxy is tiny, you only get 1 fleet to move around, quests disappear only after a few turns once all the systems are explored, and what remains is a tedious mopup operation where you fight the exact same battle from system to system. This game does absolutely nothing to address the age old problem of steamrolling the enemy once you become powerful enough (or get steamrolled by), which means every map ends up playing the exact same way. Sieze a good chunk of territory, make peace with everyone, declare war on the weakest and conquer them, and repeat.\n\nIn the end, Starships is nothing more than a tech demo or proof of concept with the actual gameplay almost nonexistant.","April 26, 2015","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an expensive version of a free Facebook game... read more to find out why.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this game. From the pre-order description, and the fact that Sid Meier does an amazing job with about 95% of the games that they produce, this had a ton of potential.\n\nBranded as a 4x game that related to Beyond Earth, I was a bit hopeful to see something that played like Master of Orion 2 and had the space-ground gameplay of Star Commander. Alas, I got my hopes up too high.\n\nAlso, before you go too much farther with this, just know that I haven't read the other reviews. This is my own take on this game.\n\nEverything from the tech, to the resources, (lack of) diplomacy, (generic) space combat, and AI feels flat.\n\nTECH: The tech "tree" is just a menu of upgrade. There are no new capabilities to introduce and no real choices that force you to examine tradeoffs and benefits. After playing BE, you'll likely be especially let down because NONE of that innovation exists in this game.\n\nRESOURCES: Four resources, and four very narrow things to do with them. Like most campy Facebook games, using your resources requires no more thought than a button click.\n\nDIPLOMACY: My main complaint with most Civ games is that you have options that the AI will not accept... in this case, you don't even have those options. Your two basic negotiating stances are a) war, or b) peace. Given the combat, neither has any particular advantages.\n\nCOMBAT: This is probably the only (slightly) redeeming part of this game. For about the first 20 turns, the combat and the missions are challenging. Once you've pumped enough resources into your ships, you can pretty well steamroll the AI with impunity.\nOh yes, the ship customization (and the reason why I was excited about this game)... yawn. Again, like the tech tree, the characteristics of each of your ships can be leveled up to attain greater advantage. There is no researching of new ship hulls, engines, weapons, or shields; just leveling. Facebook flash games have more options than this... such as Battle Pirates.\nFinal thing that I'll say on combat is this: one fleet? If SM was trying a new twist on 4x games to limit player to one fleet and up the challenge, this was a terrible choice. Any potential challenge is wasted because they let you construct warp gates so that you do not use up movement points while moving between your own worlds.\n\nAI: Now for the AI. Like the rest of the game, the AI is stale and offers no challenge. In three different play throughs of the game (each at increasing difficulty), I have as yet to have an AI player declare war on me or attack me. I can roam the galaxy with my large armada of heavily armed ships and tear through pretty much every other empire with little effort.\n\nWhat could have been a stellar game (see what I did there?) is really just a black hole for your wallet (even at $13 - as of this writing).\n\nSave your money. Save your time. Don't save this galaxy (or SM's bottom line).","March 22, 2015","false","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can dive into a game fairly quickly, and you'll pick up on what ship and planet upgrades work for you as you move through your first game.\n\nCombat is simple, quick, and aggressive. Most engagements throw you into the fray or require you to act quickly to complete your objective.\n\nThere's not much more than peace or war for negotiations in Starships. You can usually aim for the opponent's home world to capture their empire in one go, which makes the game rather easy at some points.\n\nI personally don't see how people thought this game would be a full on Civilization game at a $15 pricepoint. If you're looking for a game to tie you over for a few hours at a time, then this might be what you're looking for. If you're looking for a $15 Civ game then you're obviously on the wrong page because this isn't even an entry in the Civ franchise.

It's fun, easy to learn, relatively short to play, has multiple win conditions, and the graphics are nice to watch. Being turn based makes it pleasantly casual and easy(ish) to come back to over a few play sessions.","March 25, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would call it a turn based tactical/strategy game. It's a good game, although several things about it just don't make sense. First, you only have 1 fleet of ships. Second, every planet's combat environment is filled with asteroids. Third, lasers and cannons are graphically homing missiles, not lasers and cannons.\n\nThe flaws don't really matter though, it is a good game.

So, the game is going to be a race to get to 7 wonders nearly every time.  You can set the game up to the largest, most epic map that settings will allow,.. and if you don't rush and build 7 wonders, one of the AI will.  This causes the game to be over far too quickly.\n\nSome other issues:\n\nLack of customization/variety in your available ships.  You have one type of ship available, and you can alter the appearance a bit based on the loadout you select,.. but they all still look basically the same.\n\nSome of the Wonders are a bit over the top.  Stealth torpedos, permenant stealth ships, and a wonder that gives you two actions instead of one,.....battle over.\n\nI don't regret buying this game for the price,.. but it falls painfully short in my opinion.  The game seems over simplified.  Not sure if this was because they wanted to pander to the tablet crowd, but I'm not looking to buy a tablet game to play on my PC.\n\nMaybe if there are future updates/addons that add more to the game I will adjust my review,... but for now, the game comes up way short for what I expect from a Sid Meier game.","March 27, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It simplifies the technology and resource managing aspect so that the player may focus on their fleet and the missions that they go on. If you are expecting a 4x game then you will be disappointed because this game was not designed around resources but around space tactical combat and does a good job with it. In the galaxy you do get some resource management but all of those including the techs are strictly focused around building and maintaining the fleet. Then there are the missions the player sends their fleet on, they play out like a good game of chess involving a few varied sets of moves and abilities for each ship. With the longer games taking around 2-3 hours this is far more casual then the Civilization franchise it spawned from which makes it easy to pick up and play on a random day as opposed to a civilization game which takes a little bit of commitment to get through.\nNow for the ugly. The game does have some balancing issues at the moment of release but nothing game shattering. The only 2 victories that you ever go for are population and wonder victories as science victory takes forever to get and when you go for a domination victory you will inevitably conquer over half the galaxy (population victory) before you wipe out the last player. There is also a very sad lack of multiplayer which could have done very well especially if Firaxis set up a single mission game (kind of like what they did with X-Com Enemy Unknown). I am hoping they eventually give us a multiplayer because that would drastically increase the value of the game but even without multiplayer this is a fun game and for $15 ($10 if you wait for a sale) it is not a bad buy.","March 26, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a standlone INDIE tactical space strategy it might have worked, if not all the bugs. But as a continuation of the Sid Meier's title line it doesnt. There is prectically no tie-in with BE, as was promised, the affinities are meaningless and provide very little diversity, there are no unique fleet options and even the leader choice offers extremely little variety. The UI offers too much basic info and very little in depth data where it is needed. Victory conditions are modelled in a very weird way, I ended up getting the Wonder victory by accident many a time when trying other options.\nIt is not worth the asking price, which clearly is based on the "Sid Meier's" being a part of the title.\n\nAlso bugs.

Its set in space. Theres a load of planets that you can capture and develop (like Civ cities) . There are other races trying to capture those planets before you, and you can ally with them or attack them. Fleet battles are simple, reasonably quick,  hex baseed wargames. Some planets have 'wonders' . And you have a fleet (that you can also upgrade) to fly around exploring and capturing. So far so good. Only issue I have is that you only get one fleet - so its a bit like playing Civ with just one army (and the bigger the map you set the sillier it gets). An update  that allows multiple fleets (plus an option to 'auto fight' fleet battles.) could make this good game great.

Sadly, my first game ended with me building enough wonders to get a wonder victory, one move away from an absolutely devastating battle between myself (strongest faction) and the second strongest  CPU.  Unfortunately, I'll never get to play that battle because "Just One More Turn" is now an extinct part of Sid Meier's repertoire.\n\nThe game itself is entertaining and enjoyable, if not incredibly dumbed down.  I absolutely love the torpedo mechanic of ship combat, it is something unique and adds a bit of dimension to the otherwise fairly basic combat game play.  However, because of the aforementioned, lack of multiplayer, and other features stripped from the franchise, I cannot whole-heartedly recommend this game.  If it goes on sale for 50% off, it'd be something fun to buy and play for a day or two, but I do not see this game having much long-lasting appeal.  It's more dumbed down that Civ V or Beyond Earth (though the price should be an indicator of that), which I think for some people is a good thing.  However, for people like me, who grew up with Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Civ II, the old, "proper" Civ games, this just feels like a massive steps backward from already several previous step backwards (Civ V, and Beyond Earth).\n\nYou decide for yourself if this is the type of game you are looking for.  For me, it's a far cry from the kind of game I could recommend to anyone.","March 21, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
