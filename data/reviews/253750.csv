She is a love you cannot conquer, she is a complex beauty who demands perfection. Your best will never truly please her, she will make you feel inadequate at every moment, and yet you cannot stop trying to win her heart. When you are with her, any mistake you make will sting a thousand times worse. And she will make you furious, she will make you cry, she will drive you crazy, but you cannot stop loving her, because there is nothing else in the world that can compare to what she is.\n\nPros:\n- She is perfection.\n\nCons:\n- You are not.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- achievements are not broken down to different game play modes (easy/normal/hard/prototype mode). Also, Dot Eater is not linked to any level, you can get it in any mode.\n- extra "double play" game modes not found in the console version.\n- almost every combination of screen rotations are supported, which is great. It looks incredible on a pivot monitor.\n- the game select at the start does not show the player character anymore (it uses the high score screen background instead)\n- no training mode options to restart a level (you will need this a lot), or to start mid-level (GCN version had this I believe).\n- to unlock a level on any difficulty, you just have to credit feed the game on easy mode. This also gets you the achievements for beating a boss. On the Dreamcast, you could only use training on levels you managed to reach with 1 credit, on the specific difficulty you reached it with.\n- you cannot define analog axes as buttons, so on a non-xbox pad you may not be able to configure a trigger for the laser release. But the game supports just about any non-xinput pad other than this, which is great.\n- when using level select to play the Final stage, the Stone-Like sequence is omitted! Boo!\n- Downloaded replays tend to desync more often than not, what is up with that?\n- tip: some levels are easier to get S++ score on with prototype mode.\n- where's Radiant Silvergun?","September 5, 2015","true","70.9"," 199 of 219 people (91%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","91","199","219","92","0"

I still feel like nobody ever quite explained it as well as Greg Kasavin did, so here's his review.  Notice this is the GameCube version he's reviewing, and all versions have very slight differences, but the XBLA version added the most "features" so to speak, and that's mainly what we got with this version.  It fixed a lot of things the XBLA port got wrong from the arcade and DC/GC versions.  My only nitpick is, they didn't include online co-op which the 360 version had, which hopefully they'll patch in at a later date.  And there are people who have latency issues with the game at the moment so hopefully that's fixed fast.  I also really hope Treasure VAC protects the game at some point as well.  Another sad thing I guess is, the previously announced Trading Cards are now no longer happening, apparantly, the store page isn't even listing them anymore even though Treasure themselves confirmed them...\n\nSo, best review of the game ever - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4fzFvQzWtw\n\nGo buy it!","February 18, 2014","true","25.5"," 193 of 224 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","193","224","0","5"

In this one, you are able to freely change the polarity of your ship between light and dark. Doing so allows you to absorb enemy attacks of the same color as you, and do additional damage to enemies of the opposite color. Destroying an enemy of the same color as you will produce suicide bullets (which you will either need to avoid or absorb). Absorbing shots charges a special attack, which once activated, sends a volley of polarized missiles across the screen.\nThis polarity mechanic takes a shooter that would have been excellent on its own, and makes it so much more.\nIf you're at all a fan of this particular genre of shooter, and haven't played Ikaruga, this is an excellent version of the game to play it for the first time. It lacks the online multiplayer which was found in the Xbox Live Arcade version, but is 5 bucks cheaper (and seeing how the XBL coop was a laggy mess, it isn't a huge deal for it to be missing here.)\nWhat's added in this version is the ability to solo man two ships (if you think the game is a cakewalk as it is or something), local multiplayer support, as well as numerous screen rotation options.\nIt's a great version of what is quite possibly one of the best video games ever made!

I'm the type of guy who bumps up the difficulty on a game I've never played before because it wont be fun otherwise, who tries for 100% completion on the harder difficulty and the most backbreaking tasks. If there's on thing that you have to know, is that this game is hard. I'm sorry, I'm understating it. It is difficult. Unyielding. Strenuous. It is harder than trying to teach your mother how to use a computer (or mine at least). When I first started this game, I was placed balls deep in the most hectic and brvtal experience of my whole gaming career, even more so than Dark Souls. There are five levels in this game, and in the four years that I've owned this game, I have never beat level three. On easy.\n\nI don't mean to deter you by talking about how difficult this is. If you don't like difficult games, then this is definitely not the game for you. But the thing is, I enjoy twitching my thumbs and smashing my keyboard while I play this. It's not difficult in the sense that it's cheating, but that the game mechanics are so cleverly put that you need to gain an ultimate mastery of it. In the screenshots you see of the game, it may seem like all hell is breaking loose and you'll have no idea what's going on, but in reality you do. This is an easy to learn hard to master game, and game that is on the top of my wishlist now that it's been ported to PC.\n\nSo how does the game work? You pilot a ship, and the whole game is built around it's ability to change 'polarities'. It can be either negative or positive, red and blue correspondingly. When you're negative, you fire negative bullets, and so forth. The enemies also work like this, with the grunts being locked in one polarity and the bosses being able to switch. Now at practically all times, the screen is full of red and blue bullets, lasers, missiles, anything. There's no way you can avoid them all, and that's where polarities come in. When you are in a negative polarity, you're immune to negative fire, and vice versa. This idea, this game mechanic opens up for one of the most creative gaming experiences I've ever played.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

If you like oldschool games and ever owned a Dreamcast, Gamecube, or Xbox 360, than you've probably heard of this one.\n\nIkaruga's main twist is the polarity system, in which all bullets come in two colors, and your ship can switch between the two colors at will. You die from opposite colored bullets and power up from same colored bullets, as well as deal extra damage to enemies of the opposite color. It's very simple but is a really cool system that adds a lot of depth to the game.\n\nThe other thing of note about Ikaruga, is that it's a very methodical "puzzle shooter" type game. It's very static, and enemies and patterns are often arranged in such a way as to seem like a puzzle to "figure out" and deal with correctly. For this reason Ikaruga very much prioritizes pure execution over reflexes.\n\nHowever, even if you're the type of person who prefers games that force reaction and improvisation over static paths and execution (as I count myself), you should still be able to enjoy Ikaruga because...well, it's a damn fun game. The level designs and enemies are varied and creative, the bosses are epic, the pacing is tight, the scoring is deep, and the presentation and music would be worth playing the game for alone.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a must play for fans of shmups and 2d games in general. It might not be your favorite shmup ever depending on your tastes and preferences in gameplay design, but it's an excellent game that's well worth experiencing.","March 9, 2014","true","32.0"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","42","42","0","0"

The unique gameplay mechanics, where you can change polarities and be immune to like-colored bullets and deal more damage to opposite-color enemies (and in turn, you can die from opposite-color bullets), help it stand out. Easy to understand, difficult to master; with hundreds of bullets on screen at once, it can be easy to mess up. Not to mention the challenging gameplay, as is fitting for a bullet-hell shooter. Oh, and it's by Treasure, the same people who brought us Gunstar Heroes and Radiant Silvergun, so you KNOW it's gotta be good.

You can absorb bullets that are the same polarity as your ship and do double damage to enemies that are of the opposite polarity. This game is not for the faint of heart - the volume of bullets rivals that of CAVE's shooters or even Fraxy or Touhou Danmakufu (the latter two being shmups built around player-made bosses).\n\nGraphics: Beautiful but dated. The game was original made for arcade units back in 2001, as well as the SEGA dreamcast, and while the polygon count and texture resolution has increased with subsequent releases the lighting quality has not. Also, this game is hard.\n\nSoundtrack: One of the best. Epic and driving at the same time. Also, this game is hard.\n\nGameplay: Simplicity is a good thing when it comes to shmups - you want to make the game mechanics as easy to memorize as possible so the player can concentrate on what's on screen. Ikaruga definately delivers in this category. Also, this game is hard.\n\nStory: Kinda hard to describe. Think of it as a semi-sequel of Radient Silvergun, in a time loop that deviated from previous loops. Also, this game is hard.\n\nNotes: This game has had reports of crashing on startup, however in most cases simply restarting Steam fixes the problem. This game has been previously released on multiple platforms. Also, this game is hard.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSoundtrack: 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nStory: 6/10\n\nRecommended for: People who enjoy very hard games, fans of bullethell games.\nNot recommended for: People who can't handle losing.\n\nBottom line: An iconic game that is a must-have for any shmup fan.

We last danced on the Dreamcast, you and I. I was younger then, my reactions were better, but my mind was less sharp, I had a less refined palette, and so I was not quite able to grasp precisely what you were trying to teach me, in between the chaos and the madness and the screams of ENERGY MAX ringing in my ears every other second.\n\nMy review, such that it is, is based on a quick loadup to see how it runs and if the port is good, and my experiences based on the game on the original Dreamcast, I doubt there's much else to say given Treasure has done an absolutely stunning job with the port so my opinion needs little modification. Ikaruga is perhaps one of the best known bullet hells among Western Audiences (Cave shooters perhaps more known among the eastern crowd, go look some of them up, particularly Bug Princess 2 if you want to really melt your mind).\n\nIkaruga's selling point was the concept of polarity, in so much as that your ship could flip between "White" and "black" polarity at any given point, and whatever colour it was, not only was it immune to the respective coloured swarm, it gained energy from it, allowing it to store up, and unleash a mini nuke from the incomming fire.\n\nSheer genius.\n\nThis game enshrined risk and reward in ways so subtle that months and years later people would sink hundreds, if not thousands of hours dissecting the mechanics and perfecting them, youtube runs of mythical S+++ runs showing scary levels of precision and mind meltingly quick reactions can be unearthed for the brave to boggle at.\n\nThe level design was pitch perfect both in pacing and in graphical spectacle, constantly keeping you both entertained and at the very edge of your abilities, regardless of your overall skill level, and the sound, whilst hardly far outside the standard fare for such games, has remained very much as atmospheric now as it was then, giving a real tension and emotional background as you plunge further into the realms of the Horai.\n\nIt runs perfectly and at a rock solid 60fps on the PC, and this port does the game absolute justice, Ikaruga has come home, at last, to the PC.

At first I treated it like any other shooter before I even started learning how to chain combos properly. The combo system is where this game really shines, it turns from a "shut your brain off and shoot enemies", to a fast paced twitch puzzle game. I've spent countless hours on the GameCube version of the game and the PC port holds up well. When you get into the groove of the polarity switching and memorize enemy patterns there really is no limit to what you can do next to improve your score.\n\nWhat kept me playing is i never felt like I’ve hit a plateau in what kind of score i could achieve, there is always positive reinforcement to keep playing because you can see what the guy ahead of you on the leaderboard has done... don't go way above your means and watch the number 1 player and think I’ll never be able to do that... watch the guy who's only 2 million points ahead of you and mimic the style he's using... you'll quickly learn that the game that's touted as "impossibly hard", is actually very doable to get a high score.\n\nI recommend giving it a fair chance turn the BGM off and play some of your own chillout tunes and enter the meditation that is Ikaruga.\n\nPros\n-very forgiving hitbox often times you feel like "how did i just survive that?!", rather than "oh man how did i die there!?"\n-mesmerizingly intelligent level scripting.\n-addictive\n-intuitive design\n-perfect integration of the Microsoft controller,  and also very good response when linking a ps3 controller via 3rd party apps.\n\nCons\n-no longer has slow mo, and training that was included in the GameCube release.\n","June 20, 2014","true","165.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The graphics are gorgeous, though I don't see much of a difference between the PC/console and dreamcast/gamecube versions, but they are amazing nontheless. The music is also exeptionally good.\n\nThe gameplay is unique for a bullet-hell shooter. You have two types of polarities to swap between, white and black. White polarity absorbs white bullets, black polarity absorbs black bullets. Simplez. Deciding when to switch is crucial for survival. This game is more of a memory test, because you only have 3 lives and no continues (unless you change them in the options). You also have a charge shot you can unleash when you absorb enough shots. An easy way to get this is to wait for an enemy that shoots those gigantic bursts of energy. The bosses are unique and challenging.

The game achieves the rare feat of appealing to both die-hard shmup fans, as well as those new to the genre.  Although it's not exclusive to Steam, this is easily the best game on the service.\n\nThe PC port is done exceptionally well.  There are plenty of options to tweak the visuals, controls, sound, and various other settings.  Even on an unoptimal setup, I did not experience any lag.  The only downside is that it seems that only Xbox 360 controllers are supported, but there's plenty of workarounds to make your arcade stick, PS3 controller, or whatever else you have lying around work for this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, for those unfamiliar, Ikaruga has a unique "polarity-shifting" mechanic.  Bullets are either white or black.  You can change your ship to be white or black with a button-press.  Depending on the color of your ship, you can absorb bullets of the same color, and deal more damage to enemies of the opposite color.  The difficulty options only make minor tweaks, but it changes the game immensely.  On hard, all enemies drop "suicide-bullets" when they die.  On normal, only enemies that match your color will drop these suicide-bullets.  And on easy, no enemies drop suicide bullets.  Even easy mode is relatively challenging.  However, with enough dedication, any player should be able to complete this game.\n\nAnd what would a shmup be without a fun scoring system?  While Ikaruga may not have my favorite scoring system out there, it's definitely unique and elegant.  Killing three enemies of the same color in a row will add to your chain.  Break this chain anywhere, and you have to start from zero again.  Figuring out the best way to chain through an entire level almost makes this feel like a puzzle game at times.  And even once you've figured out how to chain every enemy together, there's still a few more things to do to boost your score.  Absorbing enemy bullets increases your score, as does defeating bosses quickly.  Sometimes absorbing ONE more bullet or beating a boss ONE second quicker can make just a slight enough difference to push you up in the leaderboards.\n\nIf you haven't played this game before, please do yourself a favor and purchase it as soon as possible.  Don't wait for a Steam sale.  $10 is a more than reasonable price for what you get out of this game.  Hopefully if enough people vote with their wallets, we'll see Treasure focus their development efforts on PC.  I'd love to see a release of Radiant Silvergun, or better yet: a brand new game from Treasure made exclusively for PC.","February 18, 2014","true","34.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M_W/recommended/253750/","M_W","M_W","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M_W/","487 products in account","The arcade shoot 'em up (or shmup, as it is called by fans of the genre), has long been known for its generally high level of difficulty and, in a similar manner to two-dimensional fighting games, a less than graceful aging. Shmups have rarely been known to display a great degree of inventivness; even some of the genre's best offerings adhere to the tried-and-true forumula of "dodge bullets, shoot ships." While there are a number of exceptions to the rule, few have kicked the trend harder, and in a more finely crafted fashion, than the beloved Ikaruga, the product of Japanese Developer, Treasure.\n\nOriginally released to Japanese arcades in late 2001, Ikaruga places the player in the role of the titular aircraft, capable of switching at will between two "polarities," black and white, to enable it to absorb bullets of like color, which will be one of the two previously mentioned. As well, enemy craft will be vulnurable to any of the Ikaruga's bullets which do not match their own. One final addition to the Ikaruga's aresenal is the homing attack, the meter for which is charged by absorbing bullets, and releases a powerful salvo of seeking projectiles proportionally powerful to how full the charge meter is.\n\nThese mechanics alone would make for an interesting game even if the level design was relatively straightforward; however, each level is designed with an attention to detail and care rarely seen in games of any genre. Each stage, progressively harder than the next, plays as much like a puzzle game as it does a shoot 'em up, and watching replays of some of the world's top players will quickly inform you that there is definitely more than one way to win.\n\nBut no high-quality shmup would be complete without a fun and robust scoring system, and Ikaruga has one which not only changes the way you play, but can actually make gameplay more fun while doing it. Skilled players can "chain" enemies together, by destroying three consecutive ships of the same color, each chain in addition to the first offering a massive bonus in points, getting you closer to your desired score, and the additional lives at each extend point.\n\nThis game is pretty easy on the eyes, too. All of the mechanical designs present in Ikaruga have a uniquely Japanese, mythic, fantasy/science fiction look to them, all of which come together to make the game feel epic and larger-than-life, with much help from it's memorable sythesized orchestral soundtrack.\n\nIn Ikaruga's long history, Treasure have released the game for a number of platforms, and in each iteration, all the way up to the port for Xbox Live Arcade, provided additional options to improve the overall experience, and the Steam release is no exception. Inlucuded in this already smooth port of the original are leaderboards, acheivements, multiplayer, stage select, prototype mode (which is available from the start, unlike in previous releases), and even the ability to play two-player mode solo, using each of the thumsticks to control each ship.\n\nOh, yeah, the best part? All runs in beautiful 60 frames per second, just like we're used to.\n\nIf there is one thing in Ikaruga that plays to it's detriment, it would be the same thing that has drawn so many hardcore fans to it in the first place: the difficulty. Ikaruga is by no means an easy game; even on the lowest difficulty, it will provide an almost insurmountable challenge for many newcomers, with the remaining settings, and the inclusion of prototype mode, only getting harder from there. Those looking for a relaxing experience will want to look elsewhere. That being said, overcoming the many obstacles ahead of the player prove to be incredibly rewarding, and repeat playthroughs offer more ways to play with improving skill.\n\nTreasure have hit it out of the park with this release. If you already own Ikaruga on XBLA, the additional features may not be enough to justify a re-purchase (unless you're crazy in love with Treasure like I am), but if you're looking to get those online leaderboards, replays, and flexibility absent from previous releases, or you are new to the game and want to see what all the fuss is about, you could certainly do worse than picking it up on Steam.","February 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No matter how many times I re-buy the damn game, it's always so good!\n\nIkaruga is simply the bullet hell shm'up that every gamer needs to own. But now it's on the PC, with vertical screen support! Now sure the console versions before the PC version had this option too; but I dare you to rotate a 20" CRT screen, or a 38" LCD HDTV! Being on the PC now, there are monitors out there on the market with a stand to rotate your monitor into a vertical portrait position. Not only that, but if your LCD monitor doesn't come with a rotating stand on it, you can hop onto Amazon and purchase a stand or arm with a rotating VESA mount on it! Now playing this game in it's intended vertical screen mode is now easier than ever now it's on the PC!\n\nThe only downside that I found with this game is that there's no quick reset or online co-op as seen in the XBox 360 version of the game. Quick Reset is a must for me, online co-op isn't... But the lack of quick reset in this game doesn't make it bad in the slightest.

This game will have you playing and raging for hours if you are new to bullet hell shooters. But even an experienced player might have it hard to dodge bullets while remmebering to change polarity, because believe me, this game has those impossible moments where getting hit is your only option.\nIkaruga is known to be a rare gem for it's original Dreamcast release, and also for it's Gamecube port. It has since then been available in the Xbox Live Arcade store, but many people, such as me, don't have XBox, and I have been trying to obtain the Gamecube version for a while now, but paying 30-50 dollars for a rare gem is still pricy for me.\nThanks To Treasure you have now have this beatiful masterpiece for 10 dollars.\n\nI highly recommend the game, it is fully epic and will keep you on your toes. The level descriptions have you wondering what purpose you have in Ikaruga, but for sure it will keep you trying until you succeed. While looking for a chance to buy this game on Gamecube, I have been playing it for a few months now on a Dreamcast Emulator that ran at around 40 frames a second, the game would lag behind the music, but it was still playable. As soon as I heard about it going on Steam, I quickly got a hold of it.\n<strikethrough>My only disappointment is that this game NEEDS internet connection for the leaderboards and for it to boot. I spend most of my time offline, and well, the game can not work without an internet connection. So if you really love this game (like I do), I suggest getting a emulator at least for Dreamcast and having that as a backup ^-^. This is the main reason why I want to buy the game for Gamecube, but bidders keep stealing >.> - Haha!</strikethrough>\n\nTHIS GAME NOW SUPPOTS OFFLINE MODE, Thanks to Treasure! Fully worth it's price!\n\nWell worth the price here on Steam, check the game out, get irritated, and HAVE SO MUCH FUN!","February 24, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Using a polarity mechanic, Ikaruga allows you to switch the color of your ship and absorb fire of the same color thus breaking the formula of "bullet hell" shooters where you simply avoid all fire. Ikaruga brings with it a sort of challenge that beckons the player to keep trying because while the game is incredibly difficult, it is also fair and always follows its own rules. It is a pleasure to play.\n\nSince its original arcade debut, Ikaruga has seen release on the Dreamcast in Japan, Gamecube worldwide (which still commands a high price today), and XBLA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yart/recommended/253750/","yart","Pomme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yart/","217 products in account","I've played many arcade scrolling shooters in my lifetime. In fact, it's my main genre of choice when talking favourites. After a while shmups all start to look and feel the same, and they become very predictable as you can often carry over tactics from one shmup to the next. Ikaruga, however, caught me by surprise.\n\nIn this shooter, not only are your reflexes put to the test, but so is your brain. Ikaruga is a genius mix of puzzle and action, where touching bullets is ok, in fact, encouraged in order to score high.\n\nEnemies fire black and white bullets, and your ship can change between black and white. If your ship is white, touching a white bullet will absorb it and store its energy in a reserve which you may expend on a large blast that eliminates a large number of enemies on the screen at once. Same goes for when your ship is black and you touch a black bullet. However, touching a bullet of the opposite colour means the destruction of your ship and a loss of a life. Scoring is done by shooting enemies of the same colour in threes, so three whites or three blacks in a row will earn you a point on your chain counter. Breaking the combo with an enemy of the opposite colour destroys your chain and will hinder your score greatly, making the player carefully pick their targets and the best path through the stages, balancing risk and reward.\n\nNow, take that concept and imagine it in one of the craziest bullet hell shooters you've seen. You get a frantic puzzle action game that will confuse your brain so hard and push your mental capacity to its limits!! It's pretty much one of the greatest game concepts of all time, and its execution is absolutely spot on! With its three difficulty settings, even players new to the genre can appreciate this one given some time to learn the mechanics, while the veterans to the genre will appreciate the higher difficulty settings and get plenty of hours worth of game time before they get to see the ending.\n\nIf great gameplay isn't enough, then just know that the game's aethestics are absolutely top tier. Even my friends who generally dislike arcade games are in awe at this title. This game is ridiculously artistic, featuring poetry in between stages, a musical score that while not upbeat, fits PERFECTLY to the mood the game is trying to convey, and some of the most creative stages and bosses I've ever seen in a game. The colour changing mechanic doesn't only apply to the gameplay, but the entire game itself embraces it. Ikaruga oozes with style, and has a way to make you feel emotions while playing. After completing the game for my first time I remember staring at the screen in awe, reflecting on everything that just happened and thinking about all the events that occured all throughout the game. I even shed a tear or two...\n\nPeople argue that video games are art. This game is the perfect rebuttal to any doubts.\n\nBuy it.\n\nNow.","July 4, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike Radiant Silvergun, there are only two weapons (standard shot, and a series of lasers), and enemies have two color schemes (black and white) as suppose to three (red, blue, and yellow). Ikaruga has several improvements over Silvergun: The game is more fast-paced than its predecessor, as well as greatly reducing the clutter on the controls (you no longer need to press multiple buttons Simultaneously to initiate a special move). It does have its flaws: the game is rather short and can be beaten within 25 to 50 minutes, the visibility between enemies and obstacles can be hard to tell at times, as well as the lack of proper power-ups (as enemy chains only effect the score and rank). Nonetheless, Ikaruga is a fantastic title in its own right and if you're a fan of bullet hell games, or various Treasure games like Dynamite Headdy or Mischief Makers, this game is for you!","May 3","true","32.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I will probably never beat it but even attempting the first 2 levels over and over again has been more fun than you'd expect.\n\nIt's a bullet hell (meaning there is a ton of bullets on screen and you're expected to dodge them all) but mixed with a polarity-swapping technique. Enemies are of 2 colors, and you have the ability to be 1 of the 2 colors at a time. You absorb bullets of the same polarity and die to bullets of the opposite. You shoot the same color as your polarity, and shooting enemies with matching polarity does double damage. Shooting the correct polarity across multiple enemies rewards you with a chain, which leads to a higher score (which is the point of this game).\n\nIt's one of the hardest games I've played, and this is supposedly not even nearly as hard as other games in the genre. If you like a challenge you will certainly find it in this game. I don't think anyone with any amount of gaming experience can just pick up this game and get to level 5 even within a few days. It takes lots of practice and memorization and on top of all that perfect execution to proceed through the entirety of the game.\n\nThe level design is basically art. It's amazing how they've used the polarity technique to actually generate level obstacles that, in tandem with the spawning enemies, create an entire level that you're expected to dodge and blow up while maintaining a combo and getting the highest score possible. You can tell a lot of work went into the precise timings and enemy types of enemy spawns. The bosses are very unique and well designed as well. You almost never feel like they've repeated anything in the game. Every 5 seconds you're facing something new.\n\nThis game is easily a 9/10, more or less depending on your individual taste for bullet hells.","June 28, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're looking for a review about Ikaruga as a game, look elsewhere, there are mountains of praise and critique written about this game throughout the 13 years it has existed on this planet.\n\nThe Steam version is essentially the X360 (and NESiCAxLIVE) version with a few tweaks. You get HD graphics, online leaderboards, downloadable replays, etc. Some of the timing issues that the X360 version had have been fixed here, making this version a LOT more accurate to the NAOMI/Dreamcast verion. In the DC version, I listen to musical cues to know when to burst, change, etc. Couldn't do that in the X360 version.\n\nTreasure decided to enhance the HUD a little bit here. Now, you have a counter showing you how much burst energy you have, and the score is divided with commas. Both of these enhancements are quite welcome, I've found myself using the burst energy counter quite a few times, and commas plus big numbers are never a bad thing.\n\nOne thing I'm quite angry about that Treasure could've easily added here, is the lack of a quick restart option. Just like the X360 version, if you're practicing a stage and want to restart because you messed up, you have to quit the stage, go back to the main menu, and reselect the stage all over again. It doesn't help that the game mode select screen uses these "cinematic" transitions which only adds more unnecessary time to a practice session. It would be nice if Treasure could add a restart option to the pause menu. Or better yet, bring back the Conquest mode from the Gamecube version!\n\nAlso, like the X360 version, you can't practice the very last boss, wherein you have to dodge some very complex patterns for 60 seconds. Way to alienate the new generations of players who might want to become masters at this game, Treasure.\n\nThese practice-related complaints aside, overall this version is a very nice packaging of a wonderful game. I applaud Yasushi Suzuki for coming back after 13+ years and adding some brand-new artwork for the main menu. The presentation far outdoes the X360 version (if you can't tell, I quite detest the X360 version).\n\nAs a player who has a lot of experience with the older versions, should you buy this version of Ikaruga? Even though I've memorized basically every pixel movement with the Dreamcast version, I certainly don't regret buying this version. It's been fun seeing how high I can get on the global leaderboard (I'm a bit rusty, yet I'm already in the top 80), plus I kinda like the idea that my Steam friends can see my achievements and know what an ELITE SHMUP PLAYER I am. =P Also, I only have the stock controllers for my Dreamcast, so this is the first time I've been able to use an arcade stick with this game. Now, I can feel extra confident about kicking this game's butt in a real Japanese arcade.\n\nAs for new players? Just try out the demo, or read one of the thousands of reviews that are out there. Just know that there are very strong, opposing opinions about this game, inside and outside of the shmup community. You will either love or hate Ikaruga.","May 11, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While a basic playthrough isn't very difficult, particularly if you use continues, the real meat of the game is in score chasing, especially in exploiting the chaining mechanic. It isn't merely enough to just survive in the game, but in order to score VERY well you need to shoot the right things in the right order in order to maintain your chain through the level.\n\nIkaruga isn't for the faint hearted, but players searching for an intense challenge, in a shoot 'em up that moonlights as an intense puzzle game requiring both strategy and dexterity, look no further.\n\nIt also has a phenomenal soundtrack.","February 19, 2014","true","49.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The newbie's goal will be survival through bullet hell, but the expert's goal will be an almost puzzle game-esque attempt to score as many points through chaining combos, and it is when one gets to that point that they realize the level of perfection this game is. It was perfectly crafted to be played a specific way. What you thought was chaos is actually perfectly arranged. What you thought you could never do has become so obvious it's like second nature.\n\nHowever, you will not get that far unless you're willing to lose and lose and lose and lose. Ikaruga rewards determination and practice with complete satisfaction. Some people aren't willing to try like that for any game. They won't know the feeling of accomplishment from becoming skillful at this game.\n\nI owned the Gamecube version for years and I have never beaten this game.

Mastering a level could be compared, at least superficially, to learning a song – at the very least, the game’s constant forward crawl and emphasis on perfect timing on a succession of coloured marks shares a lot with the typical rhythm game.\n\nBut this only really explains the long tail of the experience. For all the zen-like, dot-eating mastery that you’ll strive for in the long term, Ikaruga’s early appeal is sustained remarkably effectively by the base elements of gaming that we’re often so quick to dismiss. Developed for the now antique hardware shared by the Dreamcast and Naomi arcade board, Ikaruga isn’t exactly pumping polygons, but it still looks fantastic.\n\nThis world of elaborate black and white mecha – always accented by reds and blues respectively – is an alluring invention. The art design gives us a unique science fiction world that is more inventive and arresting than the worlds spun out of a long list of triple-A miscellany. The music is rousing, building to some strangely affecting moments near the tail end of the game. The sound effects are pitch perfect, whether digitally screaming at you on a boss approach or punctuating your deft control with explosions and that impossibly unrepetitious chorus of ‘MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN’.\n\n[...]\n\nDon’t disqualify yourself from playing this game. You’re probably never going to be someone who can complete the entire game on a single credit playing as both ships, but there’s so much more fun to be had at the shallow end of play than you’d think at first glance. 50 to 5,000 hours of fun, in fact.","February 27, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game allows you to change the prolarity of your ship to light and dark. If you chose the wrong polarity for the ship, you're basically screwed.\n\nIkarugua is really known for the challenge. Try playing it in hard mode, and you'll know why this game is seriously difficult. Ikarugua may be known for its difficulty, but it's also really addictive. The levels are really well-made and the music is really amazing in my opinion. The graphics are really good for this year. The Steam port of Ikarugua has gamepad support. I tested this game with a Xbox One controller, and it works pretty well. I'm not sure if this works with any gamepad other than a Xbox One controller, so can anyone please confirm it? The controls were very reponsive and stiff.\n\nJust because this game is really good, that doesn't mean it has its flaws. One of the issues I have about this game is the story seems non-existent. The another issues is because of its difficulty, this game can possibly make someone throw a controller (or keyboard) to the wall. Ikaruga doesn't have many levels, and the levels are short if you mastered the game.\n\nPros	Unique Design\nAmazing Soundtrack\nVery Addictive\nChallenging\nExtremely Fun\nVery Nice Gameplay\nAmazing Graphics\nGamepad Support\nResponsive Controls\nCons 	Can take you a long time to beat the game\nI know added the difficulty as a pro, but it also can be a con to others\nDoesn't have many levels\nLevels are short if you mastered the game\nNon-existent Story\nI recommend you to buy this game. It's one of the best shooters (Not counting FPS) in steam.\n\nReviewer's Notes	This is my first review, so please give me some feedback. I have low hours in this game, but I encourage you to try this game.\n\nEDIT 5/15/16: Fixed some of grammatical errors.","March 27","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The first cursory play of the game served to do two things:\n\n1.) Confirm the quality of the port, Ikaruga is a simple game without complex scripting and complex console-controls that'd bring about catastrophic disaster in a port job.\n\n2.) Confirm that this game is balls to the walls and that I am a little nancy that needs to harden the ♥♥♥♥ up and git gud, again.\n\nThe bad ♥♥♥ soundtrack, the stylized visuals, the imaginative polarity switching, the no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t action? It's all intact in Ikaruga.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with Ikaruga, follow me, my people, into a wonderful world. Ikaruga is a simple game. It has no frills, no fancy scripted cutscenes, just pure action. Ikaruga is a great example of a shoot'em up, or shmup, for most people. It isn't bullet-hell ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but it isn't easy just as a shmup should be. Its difficulty is pretty high but isn't a false difficulty erected by unfair mechanics and super AI. The game's gimmick is the polarity switch; by changing colors from dark to light, your ship will not only become immune to the similarly colored attacks, but also absorb them for your super homing attack. You utilize the polarity switch to jump into the safety of the correctly colored enemy fire, absorb their attacks, then unleash hell.\n\nThis game is awesome. It will grow you chest hair and deepen your voice.\n\nEven if you are a woman.","April 24, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

During the game the player will encounter enemies of either one of these polarities, and will soon notice that they may inflict more damage upon enemies if they are of the opposite polarity. Likewise if players are shot by a projectile of the opposite polarity they will die.\n\nAs you can imagine things get a little tougher as you progress through the game, however it's here that the many intricacies of Ikaruga's combination of style and gameplay become apparent. For instance one should bear in mind that it can actually become more difficult to play on Easy difficulty than it is to play on Normal, for on Easy the enemies do not fire any bullets for the player to absorb. Absorbtion of bullets not only add more points to the player's total, but also allows for a super attack that can clear a set number of enemies (depending on the level of the superbar prior to its unleashing and on the polarity of the player and enemies).\n\nLeading on from this one of the most important parts of the game is its 'chain' system which might sound simple enough, but which offers a great deal of challenge from the offset should the player choose. This core aspect centers on shooting down three enemies of the same polarity to create a chain, which adds a multiplier depending on how long the player can keep it up. This invariably leads to players frantically switching during the course of play in order to accumulate points, to not get hit and to maintain that all important multiplier.\n\nWith experience the player can calculate the exact number of enemies that may be dispatched with their super move depending on the level of their superbar, and this is important so that players who are striving for higher points do not accidentally destroy more enemies with the super move than they intend to - thereby possibly ruining the chain multiplier. It gets a lot more intricate than that, but this is where the amazing fun and challenge derives.\n\nA typical Treasure trait is to also incorporate epic boss fights and while it may not be on the same awe-inspiring level as those found in Radiant Silvergun, they do offer a worthy and interesting challenge. As an intersting sidenote, Blizzard later incoporated Ikaruga's polarity mechanic in their Twin Val'kyr boss encounter (which was part of the Trial of The Crusader raid instance), and I feel this is testament to the type of challenges that can be offered by a relatively simple gameplay mechanic.\n\nIn conclusion then Ikaruga is a truly amazing game because it introduces a relatively simple idea for any player to easily pick up, but which at the same time offers many intricacies and challenges for those willing to delve a little further.","July 10, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, I just dont feel as drawn into the game as I did with silvergun. You shoot, you get hit by same colored bullets and release a wave of lasers at your enemies to retaliate. Silvergun had a lot more variety though with it's weapons, plus the soundtrack in that game was amazing and memorable, plus it actually had a story, and the story was good too.

I won't give up even if my Ideal isn't fulfilled.\nMy will, just as my regrets, won't ever end.\nMy comrades... it is time.\n\nIkaruga, developed by a core team of five people at Treasure with some outside help from G.rev, took the setting and foundations of Radiant Silvergun and mixed in the polarity mechanic from Silhouette Mirage thus creating one of the most marvelous shooters in recent times. Words simply cannot express why this game is such a masterpiece, but I guess I can try.\n\nIkaruga is a bullet hell shoot 'em up coloquially known as "danmaku", you may be familiar with the genre by other popular series like Touhou but this is more among the lines of CAVE's DoDonPachi or Mushihimesama. Your ship has two polarities and can switch at will, only bullets of the opposite polarity can kill you while same polarity bullets can be absorbed to charge up your homing laser. This simple polarity mechanic adds a whole new layer of depth to a game where you would usually shoot everything and try not to die as the "Dot Eater" strategy becomes viable in where you just absorb same polarity bullets and retaliate with your homing laser. Not only that but stages make deliberate use of this mechanic in their design adding a puzzle element to it, where switching polarities according to the hazards becomes a necessity. There's also the chaining mechanic in which killing three enemies of the same polarity awards a "Chain" and keeping the chain up nets you BIG scores. Shmuppers and 1CCers will have a grand old time looking how to score high in here while some may pull their hairs hearing "1 CHAIN, 2 CHAIN, 3 CH- 1 CHAIN, 1 CHAIN". Reminder: this IS a Treasure game after all so expect the difficulty to be close to masochist levels at times, mostly seen in later stages. The Steam version follows the NESICAxLive version so it's up to date and fixed most of the bugs present in the XBLA version, not to mention that Treasure has been doing a good job in keeping the game updated so far with a Gallery Mode having been recently added at the time of this edit.\n\nGraphically, the game isn't all that impressive but it looks damn good despite it's low technical level of graphic quality. The artwork, on the other hand looks absolutely fantastic with illustrations by Yasushi Suzuki's beautiful choice of coloring and hand painted style. These illustrations are ones I'd love to have hanging as posters on my wall. The real winner here is the soundtrack though, although with limited instrumentation and reusing the same melody motif in most songs composer and director Hiroshi Iuchi has managed to make each song convey a different feeling that is coreographed to match the situation of every stage and it's absolutely glorious. You might already be familiar with "Butsutekkai", the boss theme if you've played I Wanna Be The Guy.\n\nOh yeah, there IS a rather cryptic plot explained in manuals and extra material. It's a bit good but mostly nonsensical and has strong ties with Radiant Silvergun's plot since the final enemy is the same as it is heavily implied that Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun universes are one and the same.\n\nIn the end, Ikaruga is simply a MUST PLAY for anyone. Even if you're not a fan of the genre it should become pretty clear that this game is truly one of the best games ever conceived. I eagerly await more Treasure games in Steam (so how about that PC-exclusive sidescroller you mentioned Treasure?)\n\nUntil the day water droplets bore the stone... our path will be fraught with perils...","June 29, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game-play is incredibly unique just as it is challenging, and to master this game requires tons of practice and skill.\n\nIn Ikaruga, you pilot your ship which has the ability to swap between two polarities of energy.  There are also enemies that can be either of the two types (or both), that you must kill and avoid their bullets and path.  Within a polarity, you are able to collect (eat) bullets of the same polarity/energy type from a matching enemy, and use that gathered energy to unleash homing missiles.  Keep in mind though, that to shoot an enemy with an opposing energy/polarity color does Twice as much damage to them, but will often leave you having to dodge heavier fire as the sacrifice.\n\nAside from purely awesome gamplay both the graphics and the soundtrack are gorgeous as well, and will definitely leave you remembering the visuals, animations and experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a shooter that will push you to your limits.. this is for sure the game to get!

This is something I call an amazing PC port.\n\nIn this version, everything about the game is customizable.\nThere are all kinds of options for the monitors, such as having the screen sideways if your monitor has the right resolution, something I've never seen in a PC game. Also, you have the choice of how your status info is laid out and how it appears.\nIt's a title that is interesting to play with a flight stick, like I've been with my Logitech Extreme 3d Pro which to me feels meant for this game. That is to say that this game is universally good with all kinds of gamepads.\n\nThe game itself runs and looks awesome. It's got story telling like no other, It's infinitly fun, and it's so psychotically tough that it takes Bullet Hell to Bullet BITING Hell.\nThe only little tiny thing that keeps this from being 100% perfect is how the coop is not online, but it is exciting enough that it contains local muliplayer.\n\nAs someone who studys Japanese, I'm really happy they added Japanese support to this, unlike most (Not all) of the other japanese titles on Steam.\n\nThank you, Treasure for bringing Ikaruga to Steam!!! You've done a great job on this port! I hope there will be Steam releases of other Treasure classics such as Radiant Silvergun in the future.","March 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said, you need to use a 360 controller emulator in order to make the game even recognize a different type of controller as the mouse and keyboard approach is odd for this type of game.

Games period. Not just arcade games or shooters.\n\nThis is a really unique, artistically powerful and surreal experience to look at and play, and ranks up there easily with your Zeldas, your Final Fantasies and your ICOs in terms of impactful Japanese videogame art.\n\nIt also represents, if not the first, one of the first fully functional, recognisable polarity switching bullet systems in shooters. Personally I feel that the system does render the game marmite-style, in that it adds an extra layer of stuff to think about in a genre where you've normally got 240 different 'things to think about' coming at you at breakneck speed and that'll straight up drive some people insane, but back at it's original release, this game pioneered that mechanic.\n\nFundamentally, I think this game has been surpassed historically now, certainly in terms of fun and playability. This is a game designed to be gradually learned, not picked up and played, and the developer Treasure are notorious for difficulty and awkward complexities within simple genres (beaten Alien Soldier or Gunstar Future Heroes? No? Me neither...), and Ikaruga is no different. To me, you can feel that this game is nearly 15 or so years old not in it's look which is still remarkably fresh and unique, but in the feel of the gameplay. Newer shooters are faster, more responsive and universally easier to actually play well.\n\nIkaruga will punish you mercilessly for getting things wrong. Pick the wrong polarity at any given moment and you will die instantly, respawning in the wrong colour straight into the same bullet curtain that just killed you. Press the swap polarity button a fraction of a second too late and you'll be torn to shreds during the agonisingly 'just. too. slow.' polarity swap animation.\n\nIt also won't let you record any kind of highscore, local or global, unless you play with only 3 lives and no continues. Download the demo and you'll see how utterly cruel a yardstick that is.\n\nFundamentally, if you're looking for any kind of easy ride, or a soft entry point into the genre, buy something else.\n\nThis is a game that entices you in with stunning artwork, amazing sound and a genuinely atmospheric world, and then tackles you to the floor and beats the living daylights out of you. It demands respect, and it is sometimes the complete polar opposite of fun to play because of it's insanely steep learning curve.\n\nBecause of that, I really recommend firmly downloading the demo and playing it over and over until you're sure you enjoy the game. At it's core, this is a mean, vicious, downright insane game that will troll you at every turn, BUT, it is, much like all the best difficult games, very rewarding when you do start to get the hang of it.\n\nAnd dear god, it's gorgeous. Absolutely stunning.\n\n","February 6, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unless you enable Free Play, of course. I first played this game on the Gamecube back in the day and I still haven't beaten it.\n\nThis port bears more similarity to the not-so-recent XBLA port, as it contains many of the same trappings, albeit with a few more options, such as the aforementioned Free Play option. However, as with the XBLA version, any deviation from the game's default settings renders high scores invalid, although unlike the XBLA port, achievements can still be earned. As someone who is a fan of bullet-hell but by no means a god, this is a little frustrating as it would have been nice if the game had local hi-scores independent of the game settings and online leaderboards.\n\nAs for the game itself, it remains unchanged. Dodge the opposite-coloured bullets while absorbing the same-coloured ones. This adds a real element of strategy to the game and makes for some truly daunting bullet patterns. Add in the chaining mechanic, where destroying only enemies of a single colour result in massive points bonuses and you'll find yourself dying a lot - partly because of the mind-bending difficulty and partly because of human greed, but crucially, you'll always blame yourself, not the game.\n\nIf you like your scrolling shooters with a bit of thought to them, you can't go far wrong with this. Now all we need is a port of Radiant Silvergun.","December 26, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a beautiful game that was previously on the gamecube and later ported to other systems. It's often cited as being one of the hardest shmups (and games in general) of all time. That's not a joke or an exaggeration. If you think you're going to walk into this game and beat it easily (without unlimited continues) you're wrong. It's very tough but also very rewarding with its dual phase mechanic. If your ship is black, you absorb black bullets and die in one hit. If you're white, it's the opposite. You have to use this mechanic to survive as the enemies will be blanketing the screen in bullets and lasers trying to kill you with alternating colors. I very much recommend this game but be aware that if you don't like hard games, this one may not be for you.","May 24","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maneuver your ship to avoid bullet spreads, while cutting through wave after wave of grunts, to eventually make your way to the boss. Pretty cut and dry, as far as concept goes, right? Wrong.\n\nAlthough it definitely sticks to the mechanics laid down by its predecessors, Ikaruga lays down its own twist, through the bullets themselves. There are two differently colored ships shooting correspondingly colored bullets at you in the game, black and white, and this is where it gets interesting. The color of your ship can be changed from black to white on the fly with the press of a button, to match either of the incoming bullets, and as long as your ship matches the color of the bullet hitting you, you will absorb it into an energy meter to release later as an energy blast upon your unsuspecting enemies. Touch the opposite color bullet of yourself, and you die. Shooting chains of the same colored enemy helps build up your score faster. On top of this, shooting an enemy with a bullet that is the opposite color of them, does more damage, and thereby allows you to plow through them faster.\n\nEasy enough, right? Well it would be if this wasn't a bullet hell.\n\nEven on the easiest setting, this game provides a challenge, having you dodge varying patterns of enemy waves, the occasional obstacle thrown in your path, and of course the ever present swarms of multicolored bullets being peppered at you from all over.\n\nThe game includes a replay system, and leaderboards (I'm not sure if they're only local or across the internet, haven't checked it yet), and is currently here on steam for $9.99.\n\nExpectations aside, I would give this game an 8/10","March 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A truly awesome mechanic that has never been used before wasted for a puzzle game.\n\nThe boss fights give a glimpse of what could have been, if Treasure had designed the game around survival play and surprise, surprise, they are the best parts of the game. (the first boss excluded, which is quite boring).\n\nI simply can't be bothered to learn to chain since it's just not much fun. I tried it on the first stage, since it's quite easy there, but on stage 2 it's already way harder — and not just to properly chain while staying alive, but even more so to just figure out a route.\n\nThat really is the heart of Ikaruga: figuring out the best route to chain all the enemies and then of course also pull it off. I don't really care for that tough and especially not when I'm playing a shooting game.\n\nCompared to other games with bad scoring systems like Dodonpachi, Ikaruga is way more designed around its scoring system — to such a point really that when you play for survival, the flow of the game (and the logic of the game world) is totally ♥♥♥♥ed up. There are long parts where all you do is change polarity every couple seconds and that's it. Enemies that don't even shoot at you are commonplace in Ikaruga, sections where you don't have to do almost anything in order to survive, plentiful.\n\nDodonpachi is at least still fun to play when you ignore scoring, Ikaruga is just depressing when you play it that way.","December 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If Ikaruga is your only exposure to the shooting genre, please seek out others.\n\nA leisurely puzzle game cloaked in the trappings of a vertical shooter, Ikaruga is decent fun. It is supposedly the successor to Treasure's earlier Radiant Silvergun, but that was an exciting and colorful boss-heavy shooter with a dubious scoring system. Ikaruga is monochrome and cerebral. It's worth a playthrough (don't credit feed), but don't use it to judge the shooting genre. It is not a typical game.\n\nAs for the port, it's almost great, but doesn't have gamepad support, just Xinput. X360CE is required. Proper rotation options and everything are present, though.","February 18, 2014","true","1.4"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","5"

It's got a lot of problems; some of them are subjective and some people may consider them to actually be strengths, but there are others that no-one in their right mind would think to be good unless they are a blind fanboy.\n\nObviously, this is going to be a negative review, so let's start out with the positives. The graphics look pretty nice. Controller support is (mostly) very good. The polarity switching mechanic is... interesting... for the first five minutes of the game.\n\nTo start off the negatives, let's expand on some of the positives. When I say controller support is mostly good, I mean that it's excellent, save for one thing. Like in most bullet hell games, you have the ability to move at a slower speed, if you desire to. The problem is, the only way to activate this slow speed is to only tilt the analog stick slightly, rather than holding a button and inputting a direction, like most bullet hell games. This wouldn't be a problem, except it's very difficult to even get the slower speed to activate; the analog stick must be tilted just so for it to work. In a very intense game that is a bullet hell game, monkeying with the analog stick and trying to get it to behave a certain way is an obvious no-no. So, if you use a controller, you will never be moving at the optional slower speed; it simply doesn't work well enough.\n\nThis brings me to my next issue with the controls. The keyboard controls have issues. Usually I prefer to use a controller when I play video games, but for bullet hell games I prefer to use a keyboard. This doesn't really work with this game. There is no button you can hold to move at a slow speed with a keyboard, so while the option is too poorly implemented on the controller to work well, it doesn't even exist on the keyboard. However, that's small beans compared to a start button not existing on the keyboard. That's right, if you play using a keyboard, you won't be able to use continues. I hope you enjoy 1CCing bullet hell games on your first try if you don't own a controller!\n\nThis brings me to my next point. The buttons can be remapped to basically whatever you want; if you have a working controller or keyboard, Xinput or no, you can remap the controls. However, as said before, there is no option to remap the start button on the keyboard; it does not exist. I've tried pressing every key on my keyboard to continue when the counter appears, and nothing works. Again, it does not exist. Being able to remap the buttons that DO work is very nice, and the customization is appreciated. Another nice thing is that if you use a controller with Xinput, the button prompts change. It seems weird to me that the control options for this game would be so fleshed out, but that something is vital as a start button is completely missing from the keyboard controls. In conclusion, the control options for the game are mostly really nice but some deep errors were made concerning specific aspects of them, as well.\n\nSo, you have to use a controller and the slow speed doesn't work well for the controller, big deal, what about the actual game?\n\nLet's address that by expanding on another positive; the polarity-switching mechanic is interesting... for a bit. Ikaruga features the ability to change your "polarity"; being light/blue/whatever-you-want-to-call-it allows you to absorb blue bullets, and being red allows you to absorb red bullets. Absorbing bullets lets you charge up a powerful special attack. Also, shooting bullets at an enemy that is not the same polarity as you will deal significantly more damage.\n\nAs said before, it's interesting for the first 5 minutes. It's really not a big deal. I could only really see someone that was very starved for creativity enjoying it significantly.\n\nThe first stage is pretty easy and allows the player to get used to the concept of changing their polarity. I enjoyed it. I noticed at the beginning of each stage, there will be some text that will tell you what stage you are on and say something edgy about overcoming an ordeal. It's completely unnecessary, makes no sense, and is not germane to any story (not that most bullet hell games even have those). Not a huge deal, though. There wasn't really anything special about the boss, but when he explodes, there's gratuitous slowdown; the explosion couldn't possibly cause lag when the rest of the game didn't. While I frown upon that, it's also not a huge deal.\n\nThe second stage is where I really became disappointed with this game. This is where the subjectivity comes in, and is also my major reason for disliking this game.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ing detest environmental hazards in bullet hell games. Walls, giant rocks, things that serve no purpose but to get in the way. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate them.\n\nSo obviously, the second stage is where the environmental hazards start to come into play. Probably about half of the stage (maybe a bit more) consists of environmental hazards; large square fans and flying metal objects that don't seem to resemble anything specifically. Navigating the stage was more of a bore than fun. The boss of stage two though... that was the icing on the cake, the cherry on top, yada yada. It was extremely tedious. The boss boxes you into a triangle that is about a third of the screen. To damage the boss, you must shoot these cap things that protect it's weak points. They will expand away from the boss the more that you shoot them, and you must get between the cap and the boss to shoot it's weak point as the cap slowly retracts back to it's original position, all while you dodge bullets. It's extremely tedious. Not only is your movement extremely limited, but even being able to damage the boss is a chore. I've already said it, but the word "tedious" really describes this boss very well.\n\nSo I soldiered through stage two, hoping that stage three would be better... it was even worse. Worse than I could have possibly imagined.  Basically the entire stage is an environmental hazard. The first part of the stage consists of large, moving square blocks that leave you with very little space to maneuver. Unless you watch someone do this part or practice it over and over again, there's no way to know how to maneuver correctly. Stay back or move ahead? Who knows? You'll end up touching one and exploding, unless you know exactly what to do. This introduced something I also dislike, just not as much as environmental hazards: memorization. The next part of the stage is heavy on both; Pillars will extend from the side of the screen. Some will close, some will leave openings. Again, this requires heavy memorization, because you need to know whether to pull ahead or stay back; there's no way to know if they will fully close or stop and leave an opening. Pulling ahead may result in you hitting one of the pillars that left an opening, stay backing may result in you getting trapped behind a closed pillar. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated this part. Luckily, the boss of stage three isn't nearly as tedious as the boss of stage two, just a little plain, but it's a huge improvement. Unfortunately, the achievement for beating him glitched and wasn't awarded to me, so that's nice.\n\nI had some lives left after I beat stage three and played a bit of stage four. It didn't impress me, but it seemed to be a lot better than stages two and three. I had no motivation to try again after I lost the rest of my lives fairly early in the stage. There are only five stages, so I figured that I had given this game a fair shake and quit. I proceeded to uninstall it and write this review.\n\nI wouldn't even recommend this game to hardcore bullet hell fans. I have no idea why people like it so much.","July 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 19 of 44 people (43%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","43","19","44","5","1"

Flawless controls, top notch unique designs and oozing character from every bullet-ridden pore. If more shmups were this good the genre would be a lot more than an almost forgotten relic from arcade days past and a playground for uncreative indie developers (sorry guys, everybody and their moms can make a generic shmup).\n\nIkaruga owes a lot to its grandfather "Space Invaders", like any other vertical-scrolling shooter but cleverly subverts the basic concept by giving you a colour-switching mechanic: red/black bullets only hurt you when you are white/blue and vice versa. However if you think this will make the game easy you are mistaken. The screen is filled with artful patterns of red and blue that will give you an intense challenge and plenty of replay value, because you will die and die a lot. There are no power-ups, no shields, just a super shot that fills up by collecting bullets which quickly becomes necessary to survive at all. Get hit once and you are dead of course. The gameplay offers more layers of complexity and challenge when you want to go for the big points. Shooting 3 enemies of one colour in a row will chain your points together. Skillful players can continue this chain from beginning to end of each level, although at first it might seem impossible to newcomers.\n\nThe game can be a bit bare bones if you are not a shoot em up fan with only 5 levels in total, but these blow pretty much the whole competition out of the water. The steam port also offers crisp HD graphics, a selection of unlockable artworks and an incredibly well-made leaderboard section. You can quickly download every playthrough from other players and thus learn how to survive this one of a kind bullet hell extravaganza.\n\nDeveloper support is also great. I bought Ikaruga when it was first released and at first it wasn't possible to play offline or on older Windows XP systems (which were at the end of their lifespan but still supported) as promised on the store page, both were patched in a matter of days by the developers who genuinely want to give players a good experience.\n\nAll in all one of my best purchases on steam.

You take control of Ikaruga, a ship capable of changing its polarity which allows it to take hits from bullets of the same polarity without negative consequence. This is the core mechanic of Ikaruga, as you will often times need to change your polarity on the fly so as to avoid death from the constant barage of enemy ships and bullets. One hit will make your ship explode, so unless you dive into the options to make it easier for yourself, this game will unabashedly kick your ♥♥♥ until you get better. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a fast-paced arcade game or those who have enjoyed previous titles from Treasure. They've done an excellent job with porting the game to PC, and hopefully the success of Ikaruga will pave the way for more titles from them on Steam in the future.","February 19, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After you have beaten the levels, there are are other difficulties to try and a very rewarding but deep combo system which is one of the best parts of the game.

I think Ikaruga is overrated in terms of bullet hells with a mechanic not everyone can wrap their head around. With how complex the game can be you're probably better off playing less mecahnically difficult games like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown or even Touhou.\n\nBut with that said as a game by Treasure it is fantastic, definitly one of their best. Like I said before the mechanic of switching between white and black to absorb bullets and deal double damage to an opposite coloured ship is really complex and the most devoted player can do an insane amount of things with it.\n\nThe soundtrack for the most part is fitting to the mood but can be really grand at many points. Graphically I'd say is still the same as it looked on the Dreamcast, Gamecube and original Arcade though a lot more cleaner. This isn't really an issue as the games style still looks really nice even though most of the time it's dodging black and white bullets.\n\nDifficulty is what you expect from Treasure with this game probably ranking close to that of Alien Soldiers type of difficulty which is another Treasure game that's ball bustingly hard.\n\nOverall Ikaruga is definitly a fantastic game that I think is worth it to those who want to devote time to learn the tricks and patterns the game has to offer. However if you want this as your first bullet hell I would recommend finding one that's a little more beginner friendly before trying this game out. A really great game for those who love the genre.","August 23, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonitonigo/recommended/253750/","Tonitonigo","Quack Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonitonigo/","262 products in account","Ikaruga is the quintessential arcade shooter from Treasure, known for such classic titles as Gunstar Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Sin & Punishment, and Astro Boy: Omega Factor. You take control of Ikaruga, a ship capable of changing its polarity which allows it to take hits from bullets of the same polarity without negative consequence. This is the core mechanic of Ikaruga, as you will often times need to change your polarity on the fly so as to avoid death from the constant barage of enemy ships and bullets. One hit will make your ship explode, so unless you dive into the options to make it easier for yourself, this game will unabashedly kick your ♥♥♥ until you get better. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a fast-paced arcade game or those who have enjoyed previous titles from Treasure. They've done an excellent job with porting the game to PC, and hopefully the success of Ikaruga will pave the way for more titles from them on Steam in the future.","February 19, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some would be purely a typical bullet-dodging game - loads of enemies shooting at you - or either an arena with lots of traps and patterns. You have to get used to it.

The concept is still unique; a scrolling shooter with no powerups, no screen-clearing bombs, and brilliant level design which means that sometimes the best way to survive and score highly is not to shoot everything on the screen as quickly and indiscriminately as possible.  This is a game that rewards patience, careful thinking, and the 'twitch' all at once, a game that will humble you for your first few attempts but at the same time leave you saying 'one more go' over and over again.  Ikaruga is not just a great game; it's a milestone in the history of gaming, the very apex of the scrolling shooter, and Treasure's magnum opus among masterpieces, made all the more amazing considering that it was originally designed, developed, and scored by only four people.  You get the point by now - this is a 'buy' at any price, and it's great that Steam will allow a whole new generation of gamers to experience Ikaruga's brilliant simplicity.","February 18, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No? Stay away from this game, then. Otherwise, please continue reading...\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know about Ikaruga: It was originally a bullet hell SHMUP released in Japanese arcades, and then released on the Dreamcast in Japan. Stateside, it got an enhanced port to Gamecube and XBLA, and now onto Steam. What followed was a bunch of bloody hands and broken controllers. Okay, maybe not, but that's how hard this game is.\n\nBy default, this game has no continues. Ever. And if you're not good at chaining your kills, extra lives will be very scarce. Oh, it's possible to earn them, but they're only rewarded to the ones that are actually experts at the game. So if you're a casual player of the genre (or of games in general), you're going to ragequit this game pretty quickly.\n\nAlright, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the game: The gameplay. As you can tell from the game's trailer, there's a polarity system, where you dodge opposite colors and absorb matching colors. Absorbing bullets powers up your Energy Bar, which allows you to deal a devestating attack to all enemies on the screen, depending on how much energy you have stored up. Shooting an enemy of the opposite color of what you are deals more damage than of the same color, which aids in helping you clear the screen at a more efficient rate. You also build up a bigger score with chaining your kills; killing three enemies of the same color generates one chain, and can be built up with both colors, but will also be canceled out if you hit an enemy of the opposite color of the current chain you're working on.\n\nIs the gameplay solid? Oh, definitely. Maneuvering is a bit slow for my tastes, though it works for this type of game, so I'll give it a pass. The amount of bullets on screen is balanced thanks to the polarity system, and also adds an excellent risk/reward system of which firepower you'll use on your enemies. Chaining is pretty difficult to get the hang of at first, but it adds a layer of strategy for gaining a high score, along with game progression if you need the extra lives. So for once, spamming bullets is actually looked down on. Rather ironic and maybe taboo for the genre, but it truly works.\n\nGraphics-wise, it's pretty much the same stuff from every other port out there. But really, they're fine, as is. All that matters the most would the bullets, the color of the enemies, and your ship's polarity. All of that is already nailed, so there you go.\n\nAudio-wise, I like the soundtrack. I've heard parts of it before on Youtube, but it's good to be able to hear them in the actual game. And it just helps with the mood of the game, as well.\n\nOPTIONS! Oh, TotalBiscuit will be disappointed with no FOV slider and lack of other video options, but face it: It's a game that's been around for over a decade. If your computer is a toaster, it should handle it just fine. But one thing I really like would be the ability to play the game on a vertical display, as how it originally should be. Keep in mind that the full screen mode will be on your first highest-resolution monitor, if you have multiple monitors and plan on using one for playing the game. There are also different ways to set up the HUD, if need be. You can also adjust how many continues/lives you have (warning: No high scores allowed for these changes), along with how often you earn extra lives. This helps if you just want to play through the game entirely without hassle. There's also being able to play the Prototype mode, though I haven't played that yet, so not sure how that goes.\n\nIf I had to have one gripe with this game, it would be the lack of native gamepad support. This game allows for Xbox 360 controllers, but my Logitech gamepad and Mayflash arcade stick don't work with this game unless I use Joy2Key. Yes, while that works, having native support would be nice.\n\nOverall, as a fan of SHMUPs (mostly Gradius), I really like this game. Just know that this game, by default, is really difficult, but a unique take on the genre nonetheless. If you enjoy SHMUPs and/or the bullet hell subgenre, pick this game up. If you're new to the genre, I'd probably go check something else out first, like Jamestown.","February 18, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 3D graphics, soundtrack, control and hit detection are all satisfying.\n\nWhen I just bought the game, I thought, "oh well a dodge-bullet game? It certainly seems good, and I've been playing Touhou(famous dodge-bullet franchise from Japan) for years, so it shouldn't be too hard for me, right?"\n\nAnd then I found myself to be too naive. This game gave me nightmares. It's too hard. Way too hard. There are 5 stages in total, and even in easy mode, each stage cost me a good number of credits. I can only defeat 3 of the 5 bosses(again with lots of credits). Thank god there's free play.\n\nSo why is this game that hard? The danmaku itself isn't so hard, but I just keep dying and dying. I watched some replays from the in-game online leaderboard, and I think I know why.\n\nThe rules of this game are too complicated. You have to take care of too many things all at the same time. To list some of them:\n1. Dodge all bullets of your opposite polarity.\n2. Try to absorb as many bullets of your polarity as possible, because you need energy.\n3. Watch where you're flying so you don't crash into the wall or get stuck, which happens a lot.\n4. Watch the enemy's life bar and know when they'll die, so you don't get surprised by their countarattack.\n5. Think about when to unleash homing missiles. These aren't just an optional powerup, these are required to get past certain situations.\n6. And keep in mind the chain you are building up if you want a good score. Shoot one wrong enemy and all chain is lost.\n\nOh hell. I actually regret buying this game, because I would prefer an "easier" game where you just hold down the shoot button, and then all you care about is dodging bullets. I still give this game a "recommended" though, because it is a good game, just too complicated and too hard.\n\nAnother complaint is that the system requirement is too high. Even after an update including video options, the game still can't run at 60fps at lowest settings.\n\n+ dodge bullets like crazy\n+ shooting combied with puzzle\n+ online leaderboard\n- system requirement too high\n- too difficult\n7 out of 10, good.","February 21, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The polarity mechanic adds an interesting twist to the genre, and it works excellently for the game; it will either make the experience easier or harder. It sports a timeless art style that remains striking even to this day and one of the best soundtracks ever composed for a video game.\n\nWhile Ikaruga is considered to be one of the "easiest" shmups due to its polarity mechanic, it will kick your ♥♥♥ in until you remember every single level like the back of your hand.  If there had to be one shump to play, Ikaruga is easily one of the very few worth playing.","July 8, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Forget the shades of grey, it all boils down to black and white, with just a touch of red and blue for good measure.\n\nThis game is honestly one of the best shmups I've ever played. Most games that match the level of hype Ikaruga maintains are a letdown, but this one is everything it's ever been made out to be if not more. It is hard. Really hard. But it never feels cheap. Every death feels like it was your fault. The seemingly simple mechanic of reversing the ship's polarity opens up for surprisingly deep gameplay, making weaving through bullet curtains a much more involved (though by no means easier) experience. Rather than just dodge, you actually try to get hit in order to charge your "super weapon."\n\nIn short, if you like shmups, Treasure, and/or punishingly difficult yet fair games, get this. At $10, you can't go wrong. Also, as an XP user, I can vouch that it's working after the update; literally the only problem I have with it is the broken Offline Mode support, and it's NOWHERE near enough for me to not recommend this game.\n\nGet it; play it; love it.","February 25, 2014","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been a big fan since I was first introduced to the game on Dreamcast and I still suck at it. This version looks very nice, although the graphics are obviously dated. It is also very disappointing that it lacks a Practice Mode like in the GCN version. I really hope they add it as an update. Also, I miss the Shinra walk from the original and GCN version. Also the menu system is cumbersome and you cannot cancel out of certain menu sections. There is also no option to Restart a level. And you can't cancel out of a game replay so watch at your own risk!

The shmup I played the most was Tyrian 2000 - which was excellent in it's own right (and also it's shareware these days - grab it now!). So when this came onto Steam, an immediate purchase was carried out!\nAnd it doesn't disappoint. The 'polarity-switching' mechanic is an incredibly simple idea, but it works really well. And the difficulty immediately manifests itself from the beginning (speaking from experience as I have died at least twice before level 1 even started!). Thankfully, the ability to change the keyboard settings is much appreciated, so a comfy gamer position can be assumed before the game completely stomps you! There may only be 5 levels, but each one will take many, MANY attempts to get past. And with multiple difficulty levels and game modes, the replayability is surprisingly large.\nSo in summary: a well-crafted and well-ported game. And for the shmup veterans, this is also a must-get.","March 26, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is still unique; a scrolling shooter with no powerups, no screen-clearing bombs, and brilliant level design which means that sometimes the best way to survive and score highly is not to shoot everything on the screen as quickly and indiscriminately as possible.  This is a game that rewards patience, careful thinking, and the 'twitch' all at once, a game that will humble you for your first few attempts but at the same time leave you saying 'one more go' over and over again.  Ikaruga is not just a great game; it's a milestone in the history of gaming, the very apex of the scrolling shooter, and Treasure's magnum opus among masterpieces, made all the more amazing considering that it was originally designed, developed, and scored by only four people.  You get the point by now - this is a 'buy' at any price, and it's great that Steam will allow a whole new generation of gamers to experience Ikaruga's brilliant simplicity.","February 18, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No? Stay away from this game, then. Otherwise, please continue reading...\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know about Ikaruga: It was originally a bullet hell SHMUP released in Japanese arcades, and then released on the Dreamcast in Japan. Stateside, it got an enhanced port to Gamecube and XBLA, and now onto Steam. What followed was a bunch of bloody hands and broken controllers. Okay, maybe not, but that's how hard this game is.\n\nBy default, this game has no continues. Ever. And if you're not good at chaining your kills, extra lives will be very scarce. Oh, it's possible to earn them, but they're only rewarded to the ones that are actually experts at the game. So if you're a casual player of the genre (or of games in general), you're going to ragequit this game pretty quickly.\n\nAlright, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the game: The gameplay. As you can tell from the game's trailer, there's a polarity system, where you dodge opposite colors and absorb matching colors. Absorbing bullets powers up your Energy Bar, which allows you to deal a devestating attack to all enemies on the screen, depending on how much energy you have stored up. Shooting an enemy of the opposite color of what you are deals more damage than of the same color, which aids in helping you clear the screen at a more efficient rate. You also build up a bigger score with chaining your kills; killing three enemies of the same color generates one chain, and can be built up with both colors, but will also be canceled out if you hit an enemy of the opposite color of the current chain you're working on.\n\nIs the gameplay solid? Oh, definitely. Maneuvering is a bit slow for my tastes, though it works for this type of game, so I'll give it a pass. The amount of bullets on screen is balanced thanks to the polarity system, and also adds an excellent risk/reward system of which firepower you'll use on your enemies. Chaining is pretty difficult to get the hang of at first, but it adds a layer of strategy for gaining a high score, along with game progression if you need the extra lives. So for once, spamming bullets is actually looked down on. Rather ironic and maybe taboo for the genre, but it truly works.\n\nGraphics-wise, it's pretty much the same stuff from every other port out there. But really, they're fine, as is. All that matters the most would the bullets, the color of the enemies, and your ship's polarity. All of that is already nailed, so there you go.\n\nAudio-wise, I like the soundtrack. I've heard parts of it before on Youtube, but it's good to be able to hear them in the actual game. And it just helps with the mood of the game, as well.\n\nOPTIONS! Oh, TotalBiscuit will be disappointed with no FOV slider and lack of other video options, but face it: It's a game that's been around for over a decade. If your computer is a toaster, it should handle it just fine. But one thing I really like would be the ability to play the game on a vertical display, as how it originally should be. Keep in mind that the full screen mode will be on your first highest-resolution monitor, if you have multiple monitors and plan on using one for playing the game. There are also different ways to set up the HUD, if need be. You can also adjust how many continues/lives you have (warning: No high scores allowed for these changes), along with how often you earn extra lives. This helps if you just want to play through the game entirely without hassle. There's also being able to play the Prototype mode, though I haven't played that yet, so not sure how that goes.\n\nIf I had to have one gripe with this game, it would be the lack of native gamepad support. This game allows for Xbox 360 controllers, but my Logitech gamepad and Mayflash arcade stick don't work with this game unless I use Joy2Key. Yes, while that works, having native support would be nice.\n\nOverall, as a fan of SHMUPs (mostly Gradius), I really like this game. Just know that this game, by default, is really difficult, but a unique take on the genre nonetheless. If you enjoy SHMUPs and/or the bullet hell subgenre, pick this game up. If you're new to the genre, I'd probably go check something else out first, like Jamestown.","February 18, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shmup I played the most was Tyrian 2000 - which was excellent in it's own right (and also it's shareware these days - grab it now!). So when this came onto Steam, an immediate purchase was carried out!\nAnd it doesn't disappoint. The 'polarity-switching' mechanic is an incredibly simple idea, but it works really well. And the difficulty immediately manifests itself from the beginning (speaking from experience as I have died at least twice before level 1 even started!). Thankfully, the ability to change the keyboard settings is much appreciated, so a comfy gamer position can be assumed before the game completely stomps you! There may only be 5 levels, but each one will take many, MANY attempts to get past. And with multiple difficulty levels and game modes, the replayability is surprisingly large.\nSo in summary: a well-crafted and well-ported game. And for the shmup veterans, this is also a must-get.","March 26, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your ship can take 1 of two 'shifts', able to deal extra damage towards the oppasite shift, and asorb any bullets from the same, but in turn is a 'one hit wonder' towards the other color. With this, along with Treasures '3 same chain' from Raident Silvergun sets this up more as a very dynamic and fast flowing 'puzzle' game then a 'bullet hell'.\n\nInstead of trying to just live, you'll be worrying about the order of enemys you kill to keep your chain going. You'll be asorbing shots left and right to fill your meater up, at times leaving foes alone for this action alone. There really isn't another breed of shooter like this that makes you double take on your approtch, more less REWARDS you for not killing everything the second it spawns on screen.This game thought is hard as nails thanks towards the change in focus you need to make for it, and it alone, and you'll have to sit down and replay stages over and over, learning their patterns towards a 'T' if wishing to get all of those achivements and place well on the global leaderboards.\n\nAs for what this version does that the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and XBLA doesn't:\n-full 60fps with no slowdown outside of the 'intended' doing boss explosions, even on a Geforce 9500 GT, making this the smoothest version yet.\n-It is Arcade perfect in scoring and results, something the XBLA had major issues with\n-Online leaderboards with the ablity to download and watch replays from anyone else who had 'ranked in', allowing you to study from the best without a secondary source.\n-Keyboard, Mouse, and the all desired 'Duel Play' options for controls, giving this version the most freedom of input choices to tweek towards your needs.\n-All of the 'Extra' options are unlocked at the very start, no need to run the game idle for 10 hours to get everything.\n\nIf there are any flaws, it is the lack of background and story information present in the Dreamcast version, more less the artwork relating towards such. The lack of a 'Music Player' option as well is slighty depressing, and of course this version lacks the Online Co-Op that the XBLA had ( thought suggested issues with that version seem to steam from said option... ), meaning the last three achivements will have to be done with ether a friend nearby, or to master Duel Play, a feat only a haldful of people thus far have mastered.","February 19, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

At it's most basic, Ikaruga puts you in control of the titular ship, which has two abilities - you can shoot, and you can change the Ikaruga's polarity. The polarity mechanic works thusly: Enemies are color-coded, and you're immune to projectiles color-coded from enemies which share your present color. This may sound simple on paper, but the game is a bullet hell with little tolerance for failure. Staying alive is a constant struggle and requires unfaltering attention as well as considerable ability to sort out visual noise, so this isn't a good choice for those in the mood for an easy play. Those familiar with Treasure will know that their games are often incredibly simple yet exceedingly difficult and often expect complete mastery of mechanics to progress; Ikaruga certainly carries on the tradition. The game rewards several different approaches to play and has a bevy of settings, providing replay value in droves.\n\nThose who do well enough may find themselves butting heads with a certain stony foe from a previous Treasure game...\n\nVisual and sound design are stellar, with compelling enemy designs and an excellently composed score by composer Hiroshi Iuchi. The spartan black and white design motifs further emphasize (and almost feel like an extention of) the game's mechanics, and the music certainly makes me feel like the last survivor of a botched rebellion going solo against an empire with the power of a god behind it.\n\nAll-in-all, Ikaruga's not going to be everyone's cup of tea since it's an incredibly hectic game, but I feel it's immaculately constructed and that any shmup junkie who hasn't yet ought to take it for a spin. The game is incredibly lightweight - having originally been designed with Dreamcast-era hardware in mind - so it'll even run on nearly anything!","May 5, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonitonigo/recommended/253750/","Tonitonigo","Quack Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonitonigo/","262 products in account","Ikaruga is the quintessential arcade shooter from Treasure, known for such classic titles as Gunstar Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Sin & Punishment, and Astro Boy: Omega Factor. You take control of Ikaruga, a ship capable of changing its polarity which allows it to take hits from bullets of the same polarity without negative consequence. This is the core mechanic of Ikaruga, as you will often times need to change your polarity on the fly so as to avoid death from the constant barage of enemy ships and bullets. One hit will make your ship explode, so unless you dive into the options to make it easier for yourself, this game will unabashedly kick your ♥♥♥ until you get better. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a fast-paced arcade game or those who have enjoyed previous titles from Treasure. They've done an excellent job with porting the game to PC, and hopefully the success of Ikaruga will pave the way for more titles from them on Steam in the future.","February 19, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel that I'm a half decent gamer, and I can tackle some pretty hard games without too much of a problem, such as Alien Soldier, another game that Treasure made. When I first booted this up and set up the buttons for my fightstick, I decided to start on normal instead of easy so I wasn't wussing out to start.\n\nI couldn't get past level two.\n\nThis is a case where you NEED to put it on easy if you're a newcomer to the game, and it's still not going to be an easy ride then. I guarantee, you will die a lot in Ikaruga, and most people will probably rage quit in mere minutes, but if you're like me, and love an great, arcadey challenge of a shmup to add to your collection, then this is something I wholeheartedly reccommend.\n\nFor those looking for an adrenaline rush, this game has it ready, with it's crosseye-inducing bullet avoiding and collecting. If you're an achievement hunter looking for a real challenge, Ikaruga will keep you satisfied, because if you're dedicated to besting this game, you will probably spend months or even years trying to get everything.

The paint-like art style has definitely allowed this game to age better than its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun.\n\n- Incredible Music. Every tune is lovely to my ears.\n\n- Easy to learn, insanely hard to master gameplay. It's rather incredible just how many challenges Treasure's designers managed to squeeze out of the incredibly simple mechanics at play here, and it's awesome to see all the creative enemy designs they were able to make with them as well.\n\n- Satisfying as all hell. Seriously, those explosions. I have never felt quite so good when killing a troublesome boss.\n\nCons:\n- A menu annoyances. To my knowledge, once you select a game mode, you can't back out if you clicked something you didn't mean to. Effectively, you have to play a game and kill yourself or reset the game to get back to the title screen.\n\n- No real explanation of the story. There is a plot to this game, and it's not an excuse plot. I won't devote time to explaining it here, but I do think it's quite a shame that there's no signs of the story in this port (again, to my knowledge).\n\n- Chaining. I admit, I have never been a fan of this part of Ikaruga. While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as it was in Radiant Silvergun (There, you had to chain to upgrade your weapons, which was *essential* to defeating later bosses), I still don't particularly like a scoring system that effectively forces you to memorize everything that happens in an entire stage to hit those elusive S++ ranks. Granted, I'm also terrible at chaining, so take that as you will.\n\n\nOverall, Ikaruga has earned its reputation as being one of the greatest shoot-'em ups ever made. Fantastic level design, creative boss designs, good story (in the versions that actually have it), great visuals and music. What else could you ask for?\n\nBefore I go, though, one word of warning:\n\nWhile far from the hardest game in this genre, Ikaruga is still difficult. Like, really, really, really difficult. Dark Souls doesn't come close.\n\nIf you're not up for that, I would advise you avoid this game.","February 1","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/253750/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","Originally released as an arcade game in 2001, Ikaruga garnered high praise from critics as the spiritual successor to Treasure's much-loved Radiant Silvergun and quickly became one of the most popular bullet hell games of the decade. Witnessing a second and third release on the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube in 2002 and 2003 respectively, the legendary Shmup was later introduced to the newer generation after its success lead to a fourth release on the XBLA in 2008.\n\nWhile narrative clearly wasn't the main focal point of the game during the development phase, Ikaruga does feature an interesting backstory that gives appropriate context to the characters' actions. Tenro Horai; the leader of a small nation known as Horai; came across the Ubusunagami Okinokai or 'Power of the Gods', affording her powers surpassing that of any normal human being. With 'The Divine Ones' at her side, Tenro launched a campaign of global conquest. As the Horai felled each nation one by one, a small group of those brave enough to defy the Horai emerged, called the Tenkaku. Using advanced fighter aircraft known as 'Hitekkai', they fought a desperate battle against the Horai, but ultimately proved to be no match for their adversaries and suffered a swift and humiliating defeat. Once thought to have been among the many victims of the Horai's conquest, a young man called Shinra who had fought for the Tenkaku was shot down in an aerial battle high above the clouds. Dragged from the wreckage of his fighter and taken to the village of Ikaruga, Shinra was nursed back to health and entrusted by the village people with a powerful fighter unlike any other – the Ikaruga. Using the energies of two polarities, the Ikaruga was a versatile aircraft that could adapt to any given situation. With the power of the Ikaruga at his side, Shinra once again took to the skies to battle the Horai and bring about an end to their tyranny.\n\nIkaruga's most prominent feature; and indeed that which sets it apart from almost every other shmup to date; is its polarity system. Enemies appear in three varieties, each corresponding to one or both 'polarities'. White enemies fire white bullets towards the player, while black enemies discharge black bullets. Each boss typically utilizes both polarities and is capable of executing attacks using bullets of either. The Ikaruga itself however, is capable of switching between both polarities mid-flight, on the fly, thus introducing one of the game's most important mechanics – alternating polarities. While using the white polarity, the Ikaruga fires white bullets and is unaffected by those of that polarity fired by the enemy, though direct contact with black bullets is fatal. Any black enemies hit whilst using the white polarity also suffer significantly greater damage than what they would have suffered, had the black polarity been active. White bullets that draw near the Ikaruga are absorbed and converted into energy used to fuel a powerful homing missile attack. The reverse applies when using the black polarity.\n\nThis clever mechanic encourages a 'risk versus reward' style of play that; together with the game's high level of difficulty; results in a very challenging but rewarding experience that makes Ikaruga one of Treasure's most enjoyable titles to play. The stage design itself is also particularly praiseworthy, both for its complexity and originality. While the first stage is quite easily manageable, every stage beyond it forces the player into a head-on confrontation with intricate mazes of bullets that require one to fully master the polarity switching mechanic in order to stand even the slightest chance of reaching the results screen. Skilled players can try to mix up their polarities by alternating on a regular basis to maximize the damage inflicted on the enemy, a tactic that becomes particularly viable when facing off against most of Ikaruga's bosses. Stage 3's boss stands out as being one of Ikaruga's trickier bosses that requires a more subtle approach from the player, involving the use of a number of advanced polarity switching techniques.\n\nDestroying three enemies of the same polarity consecutively results in a 'Chain', causing a substantial rise in the player's score. Each stage has been carefully designed in such a manner that it is possible for the very best players to complete a 'perfect' run of every stage by carrying a chain throughout the entire level, provided the enemies' attack patterns have been learnt well.\n\nThough the game features a steep learning curve that is likely to deter players who are new to games of the genre, Ikaruga offers a fantastic experience to anyone willing to take the time and effort to master the polarity switching mechanic.\n\nIkaruga's visuals are for the most part very impressive. The vast majority of finely-detailed enemies are well-animated. But what truly stands out is their unique design. Many of the enemies Ikaruga throws at the player look nothing like any enemies seen in other bullet helll games. The boss of the fourth stage is one prime example of the sheer creativity poured forth into the game. Each and every background also benefits from the same level of detail seen in the enemy design, with some of the game's mechanical backgrounds being among the most memorable for that reason. The lighting effects seen throughout the outdoor environments capture an atmosphere that makes every stage as breathtaking to look at as it is to play.\n\nIkaruga's powerful musical score plays a major role in contributing towards the creation of a different feel for each stage. While flights through enormous enemy facilities are accompanied by orchestral music with the subtle; yet highly effective; integration of techno music, massive aerial battles amidst amber-tinted skies are fought to the triumphant sounds of trumpets, capturing the intensity and desperation of the fight. Each boss' defeat is followed by a loud and catastrophic explosion that sounds just as impressive as it is to behold.\n\nIkaruga is the finest example of an innovative bullet hell game that is both a masterpiece in terms of its gameplay and art direction. Those who possess the time and dedication necessary to master Ikaruga and its original gameplay mechanics in order to experience the game to its fullest can expect to find themselves utterly absorbed by Treasure's iconic Shmup for a long time to come.","September 23, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I've died more times than I can count already being only 1 hour into it. But hell, this is an enjoyable start into bullet hells for me. Some may not find this as enjoyable, however.\n\n-Aesthetically pleasing\n\nNothing is hard to look at and I find the game to still look beautiful despite it's age and jump through different consoles before being on the pc.\n\n-Addicting\n\nAfter playing other games I can come to this game and want to play more of this game!\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Can be difficult\n\nI warn anyone who is looking for an easy game to not buy this, it will urge you to get frustrated if you're a completionist who has never played this genre before.\n\n\n\nLiterally that's the only drawback, and I think with practice and learning the patterns of the game you can become a master of the game. This was worth the wait for me and I will be playing the crap out of this in my spare time!","October 24, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was glad to find this on here, and even more excited that this game runs smooth. This is one of the most difficult shmups that come to mind, in it that you need to have the right polarity, same color of your ship as the bullets, to absorb the bullets and avoid being killed. It's fast and extremely difficult, but it has an easy mode, as well as an option for continues and lives, so it'll make it approachable to all.\n\nThis is one of the best shmups, around the top 10 in my opinion, and this is a perfect translation on here. If you like 2d shooters, or someone who likes a challenge, this is the game for you. I don't think I would recommend this to new players who are getting into the genre because it is difficult, but it's difficulty options make it approachable.","December 10, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its visual style is stunning... this is one of the games you will reconize from kilometers. And gameplay (polarity system) is so good... IT MAKES ANY OTHER GAME LOOK LIKE AS*! The game is hard, that is for sure, but with practice it becase just more and more enjoyable to play it over and over again. Also, the game features "appendix" mode, a gallery of illustrations and desings of characters and vhenicles from the game and its backstory and I was amazed by the detail and quality of the material in the gallery! Its stunning! And also the soundtrack from the game is the best one I have ever heard and you can listen to it in that mode also.\nIn addition to classic arcade mode, game has prototype mode and chapter select, where you can perfectcize a chapter you are having a trouble with.\nBest shoot 'em up ever created... and one of the best games ever created that deserves to be in the same line with Half life 2 and similar games of that kind...","March 28","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I also love games that have a leaderboard!\n\nWhile I didn't play this all that much, I thought it was simply great at what it did:  9 out of 10.","January 26","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a much of a bullet-hell gamer, but I like to play this when I have to kill 20 mins.  It has global scoreboards and is very challenging. I use a fightstick, and its a great arcade feel. Gamepad support works great too.\n\nThe music is good, the gameplay is fun. If you don't have a game like this in your library, I would certainly reccomend this one to fill that slot.","January 22","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The paint-like art style has definitely allowed this game to age better than its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun.\n\n- Incredible Music. Every tune is lovely to my ears.\n\n- Easy to learn, insanely hard to master gameplay. It's rather incredible just how many challenges Treasure's designers managed to squeeze out of the incredibly simple mechanics at play here, and it's awesome to see all the creative enemy designs they were able to make with them as well.\n\n- Satisfying as all hell. Seriously, those explosions. I have never felt quite so good when killing a troublesome boss.\n\nCons:\n- A menu annoyances. To my knowledge, once you select a game mode, you can't back out if you clicked something you didn't mean to. Effectively, you have to play a game and kill yourself or reset the game to get back to the title screen.\n\n- No real explanation of the story. There is a plot to this game, and it's not an excuse plot. I won't devote time to explaining it here, but I do think it's quite a shame that there's no signs of the story in this port (again, to my knowledge).\n\n- Chaining. I admit, I have never been a fan of this part of Ikaruga. While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as it was in Radiant Silvergun (There, you had to chain to upgrade your weapons, which was *essential* to defeating later bosses), I still don't particularly like a scoring system that effectively forces you to memorize everything that happens in an entire stage to hit those elusive S++ ranks. Granted, I'm also terrible at chaining, so take that as you will.\n\n\nOverall, Ikaruga has earned its reputation as being one of the greatest shoot-'em ups ever made. Fantastic level design, creative boss designs, good story (in the versions that actually have it), great visuals and music. What else could you ask for?\n\nBefore I go, though, one word of warning:\n\nWhile far from the hardest game in this genre, Ikaruga is still difficult. Like, really, really, really difficult. Dark Souls doesn't come close.\n\nIf you're not up for that, I would advise you avoid this game.","February 1","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Replays and the ability to replay levels will get you better aquainted to what the game has to offer.\nI can't recommend this game enough if you are a shmup fan.\nIkaruga ladies and gents.

I upgraded from an older AMD Radeon to an 750ti, and the game refuses to run.  After checking the forums, others with nVidia cards have this problem.  The developer has not responded to any inquiries as to whether this can be patched or not.\n\nIt's quite a shame, as it is a great game if you like bullet hell shooters.  Unfortunately, I would have to say if you want to play this, for now your best options are either the Android port or to get a Dreamcast and purchase this title there.","February 7","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No wonder why all the poor old-school types were just left behind and remembered only as a childhood memory, but when I hear someone with the word “Ikaruga” coming out of their lips, I think about one of my most favorite games of all time. Ikaruga is a vertical-scrolling game that takes role as the successor to its “prequel”, Radiant Silvergun, which never really met my expectations. Unlike Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun focused primarily on special attacks, powerups, upgrades – it’d almost remind you of the Raiden series. Now, some people on the internet nowadays claim Ikaruga as an overrated title – well, they’re wrong. True, Radiant Silvergun is not at all a bad game - you can’t go wrong with that, but you certainly can’t go wrong with Ikaruga, either. It’s not just a black and white world, but it’s also quite a brain-workout. I give it a shiny A++.","March 2","true","108.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its visual style is stunning... this is one of the games you will reconize from kilometers. And gameplay (polarity system) is so good... IT MAKES ANY OTHER GAME LOOK LIKE AS*! The game is hard, that is for sure, but with practice it becase just more and more enjoyable to play it over and over again. Also, the game features "appendix" mode, a gallery of illustrations and desings of characters and vhenicles from the game and its backstory and I was amazed by the detail and quality of the material in the gallery! Its stunning! And also the soundtrack from the game is the best one I have ever heard and you can listen to it in that mode also.\nIn addition to classic arcade mode, game has prototype mode and chapter select, where you can perfectcize a chapter you are having a trouble with.\nBest shoot 'em up ever created... and one of the best games ever created that deserves to be in the same line with Half life 2 and similar games of that kind...","March 28","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
