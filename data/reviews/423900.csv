"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/423900/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Dinocide is an retro platformer set in an alternate prehistoric timeline. I haven’t played a platformer for a while so I must say, it felt good to play this.\n\nThe story of the game is as follows, your lovely companion, which I assume to be your wife/partner, gets captured by a mysterious creature and you’re off to save her. That is it. This is one of the few complaints I have about Dinocide, the superficial story or lack of any actual development and dialogue. Despite this, the game manages to redeem it itself.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. Dinocide plays like any standard platformer and there isn’t much you need to learn. The main gimmick of this game is the fact that you can’t wander on a level and take your lovely time to complete it. As soon as you spawn on a level, a hunger bar at the top will start diminishing and if it reaches zero it is game over and you have to start the level all over again. This bar serves both as your health meter and as a timer. If you get hit the bar diminishes and as time passes the bar diminishes by itself so the game forces you to keep moving. In order to restore it, you need to collect food which is scattered all around the levels.\n\nThe game is divided into several levels and there are a few times on the world map that you get to choose one of two ways to go. This allows for more variety on another playthrough. The levels themselves are divided into several different biomes such as ice caves, forests, deserts and volcanic areas, each with their own enemy and dinossaur types.\n\nWhile playing on each level you’ll also find weapons, dinossaur eggs and gems. The game starts you off with throwing stones as a default weapon but soon enough you’ll start finding, axes, bows and boomerangs which you’ll also be able to use. Dinossaur eggs play a huge role because they basicly give you another life. What I mean by this is that when you pick up a dinossaur, you’ll get a new hunger bar for the dinossaur alone. Not only that but dinossaurs give you special attacks and allow you to walk through lava, swamp water or underwater, depending on their type.Gems can be used at shops to buy more weapons, eggs or food.\n\nThe thing is, if you complete a level with a boomerang and a dinossaur, you’ll get to keep them for later levels. This can be done via a “equipment screen” before each level. However, if you die while using one of the previously acquired weapons and/or dinossaurs, you’ll loose them for good. This actually made me wonder why you can’t go back and replay previous levels in order to stack on weapons for later, harder levels.\n\nThat said, each weapon and dinossaur is unique on their own way. Still, unlike most games on this genre you can’t just spam your attacks because there is a stamina meter which regenerates if you stop attacking. This makes you time your attacks wisely to make sure that when an enemy is up in your face you’re able to attack him.\n\nVerdict:\nDespite it’s short length, Dinocide manages to keep it interesting throughout the entire way. Each boss is unique and memorable. The music is fitting for each type of environment and I found the pixel graphic style rather pleasing to look at. There were some moments in which I grabbed the controller and pressed the buttons even harder as if that would make me actually succeed but most of the times it did not.\n\nDinocide is a simple yet solid retro platformer and I recommend it to anyone who is into those or is looking for something short and easy to play.","March 5","true","7.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/423900/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1508 products in account","Dinocide is a classic adventure-platformer made in the same vein as the classic Adventure Island series. Much like many classic NES era games, there isn't really a lot in the way of story, just the premise that our prehistoric hero sets off on a quest to rescue his kidnapped lady love. I think that was a perfectly fine decision to have made for this kind of game. If you like platformer games with rideable Dinosaurs and Mechsuits look no further than Dinocide!\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with classic platformers, the idea is that you want to move from the left hand side of the screen to the right hand side of the screen. On the surface that seems simple enough and perhaps for the first few levels it is almost that simple, however, as you make your way through the game new elements are added that increase the challenge. To further arrest your advancement the ground becomes even more broken up. This forces you to have to make more leaps of faith and then of course new enemies will also appear to hinder your progress. Those are the fundamental elements of a standard classic platformer. Now that you have the basic idea on what kind of game we are talking about, let's focus on Dinocide itself.\n\nI mentioned Dinocide was an Adventure-Platformer so let's talk about the Adventure portion. As stated above, the game's entire story is that the Caveman wants to rescue his significant other. He begins his quest with a never ending handful of stones and ventures out in the dangerous wilds. As he travels through the levels he will start to encounter items that will make his journey a little bit easier. First off, a handful of stones is great in a pinch but there are far more effective weapons to deal with enemies. The throwing axe will likely be the first one of these valuable weapons you will aquire. It basically works in the same manner as the stones but it does more damage as it arcs through the air. The boomerang will fly in circular pattern around the screen near the hero and then return to him. It has the possibility to hit multiple enemies or hit the same enemy multiple times before returning. The last one is the arrow that you can throw straight across the screen and isn't affected by gravity like the stones or axe. Having only four weapons at your disposal might sound a little disappointing but it really isn’t. It’s more than made up for by giving you the ability to ride one of 5 dinosaurs (and a secret mechsuit) too! Each of these have their own special abilities and also increase your chances for survival.\n\nMost games typically have a health bar that displays how many more hits you can take before you will die. In order to prevent you from taking your time and being meticulously careful as you progress through a level, most classic games will also have some sort of timer that will cause you to lose if it runs out. Dinocide combines these two effects into a Hunger Meter. This Hunger Meter will deplete naturally over time in order to prevent you from standing still too long. It will be further depleted every time you take damage. This makes Dinocide rather challenging. Not only are you having to carefully make your way from the left side of the screen to the right side, you are also having to ensure you grab all the food  along the way in order to avoid starving to death. It's a hard call to say if this adds to the fun of the game or detracts from it. There were many times when I was within striking distance of the exit or food and yet died of starvation just because I happened to have got hit a couple of times on my journey to that point. This caused me to have to repeat some levels far more times than I am willing to admit to. Luckily, there is a bit of a solution to this problem.\n\nThe dinosaurs (and mechsuit which I will class as a dinosaur from here on out) add a second Hunger Meter for you. It is separate from your own Hunger Meter. All food sources you touch will go to refilling the hunger of the dinosaur. Once the dinosaur starves to death, you can continue on with your own Hunger Meter. Hopefully its sacrifice won't have been in vain! However, just sacrificing dinosaurs all willy-nilly isn't exactly in your best interest. Any weapons you buy or find during the level, as well as any dinosaurs you find, will be stored at your camp if you successfully manage to keep them around until you reach the exit. In fact, if you are super careful you can reuse the same weapon and dinosaur until the very end of the game. Even if you find a new weapon or dinosaur on the level, assuming you don't die, your old weapons and dinosaurs along with your new weapons and dinosaurs will be found waiting for you at your camp until you are willing to use them again.\n\nThere is another meter in the game that in my opinion is a little on the short side. It's the Stamina Bar. To prevent you from just spamming your attacks, each time you use your weapon, your bar depletes a bit. If you do multiple attacks in short succession, it leaves you unable to attack further until the bar refills itself enough. This made fighting the enemies much more challenging, and arguably made the game a little more enjoyable.\n\nAs you play through Dinocide you will cross between multiple different biomes each with their own enemies. You will also encounter multiple bosses on your way to rescue the kidnapped cave princess. Luckily, with bosses, the Hunger Meter turns into a standard Health Meter and no longer depletes over time. As an added bonus, if you really enjoy fighting the bosses, there is even a Boss Rush mode which will let you focus on just that part of the game. In order to help promote replayability, there are alternate routes you can take through the game. Each level follows the all or nothing format. Either you make it to the very end in a single attempt, or you lose everything you had with you and have to start the level over again from the very beginning.\n\nRather than collectable coins, gems are used as currency. Many levels offer a shop, which will sell you a weapon, a dinosaur and/or a bit of food. If you have the gems to do so, I'd highly recommend collecting the dinosaurs and weapons. I ended the game with a surplus of gems and was really wishing I’d purchased more weapons when I got the end boss.\n\nPros:Classic Adventure-Platformer that stays true to the genre\nDinosaur mounts\nGame length is appropriate for the genre. It is long enough to keep you entertained, but short enough that you are willing to replay it to try the alternate routes.\nGameplay is not bogged down by excessive story elements\nCombined Health and Timer is a fun standard element twist\nCons:Cliché story: Man sets out to rescue the damsel in distress\nLanding too close to an edge will pull your character through the platform and into the pit even if the character landed on the platform.\nThe Hunger Meter depletes too quickly making the game very unforgiving. Later levels basically come down to you having to quickly collect every bit of food, stick every landing and not be touched by the enemies at all.\nNo checkpoints on the more difficult levels. Failure always resets you to the start of that level.\nUnable to return to previous stages or beat the alternate path levels in a single playthrough. This is likely to prevent farming weapons and dinosaurs, but the ability to do that would be welcome. The end boss is very difficult without upgraded weapons or dinosaurs to assist you.\nOverall, Dinocide is great, albeit very challenging, classic adventure-platformer. It has enough classic elements that should make any fan of the genre happy and it has enough of its own elements to make it not just another cookie cutter game.","March 9","true","7.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/423900/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","After yesterday’s review of a somewhat disappointing platform game, Marcus Level, I didn’t want to set my hopes too high for Dinocide. However, this was very difficult. It’s a game that again appears to have everything that I look for in this type of game being inspired by the NES old-school single player platformers. It’s also not the developer, AtomicTorch Studio, first game on Steam. Generally developers learn a trick or two from their debut game and I hoped that this was the case here. Their first title, VoidExpanse,  released in April of last year, was met with a rather poor to mixed reaction by the reviews on Metacritic where the game averages a 59 critic score which is somewhat bogged down by the 40 that GameSpot‘s Kevin VanOrd gave the game. However, Steam players genuinely appeared to like the game (72-28 positive-negative review score as of time of writing). With that said Dinocide appeared to have potential from the outside looking in.\n\nSo it turned out to be. A game with a whole lot of potential and one that does a lot of things right. The atmosphere created by the music and the 8-bit era graphics. The nicest touch being the health mechanic that decreases over time but can be replenished by hitting food. I found it to be an incredibly deft decision because of the caveman character and setting that you play. I quite enjoyed the four different dinosaurs that you can utilize and ride with each having their own little attacking move that aides your ability to complete levels and to unlock certain things throughout the game. Arguably the most important advantage for the game is its accessability. This is something that everyone will be able to not only play but find some level of enjoyment from.\n\nI only have two criticisms of Dinocide. First, the game may be a little too easy. I played through the majority of the levels without dying a single time. When I did die it was often because I had attempted to do something silly. Had I used any level of concentration I would have known not to do it. One of the things that really that I believe made the NES games so good was that when you beat them you really felt as though you had earned it. Unfortunately, that’s really not the case here. My other criticism is that the game is over too quickly. With the game being as easy as it is I was hoping for more content but the game can be completed in a couple of hours. The only real replayability is in choosing an alternative route meaning that you will never hit every possible level in one playthrough. Unfortunately at time of writing the game lacks Steam achievements so the only reason to replay the game is to visit those extra levels without any extrinsic value to doing so. Steam achievements would add a lot of value to the game and given the fact that AtomicTorch utilized them in VoidExpanse I am somewhat shocked and disappointed that they weren’t implemented here.\n\nDespite the two pretty heavy criticisms that I have of the game I really did enjoy my time with it. With increased natural difficulty it could have been much better but it’s still a good game. Some may argue that it’s not quite worth its asking price of US$9.99 but it does come close. If I were a price conscious consumer I’d wish list this for now and pick it up when it is discounted or bundled. At that point you’ll receive maximum value and quite likely a bargain.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 2","true","7.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/423900/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3532 products in account","Dinocide is a platformer with an emphasis on eating food to keep your health bar up.  It gradually diminishes as time ticks by, so you have to continue to eat to stay alive.  Taking damage will decrease a portion of the meter, so making sure you find food while navigating the level is the key to survival.  I like the style of the graphics, since the older games strike a chord with me.  I grew up with Nintendo and such, so there is a reminiscent feeling that goes along with the pixelated style of game that I really enjoy much of the time.  Here are my overall thoughts on initial gameplay:\n\n\nPros:\nI enjoy using the controller with this game.  This is always a plus for me when I can do everything with a controller, since it's usually easier on the hands.  Only a few buttons to worry about as well, which can be a good thing!\n\nThe graphics are great, in a sense that I like the older pixelated NES/SNES feel.  They remind me of many games of old, for sure.\n\nThe few weapons you get are fun to use, and I also enjoy the concept of throwing things at enemies to kill them.\n\nThe dinosaurs are great because you get a second meter - while you hope you don't need to use your own health, so you can finish the level with the dinosaur for use later.\n\nThe dinosaurs have special attacks which can quickly dispatch enemies around you while you try to keep your life/hunger gauge up.\n\nCons:\nI don't like the hunger system, though it is unique.  I feel a little bit rushed, since the meter goes down rather fast, and taking damage decreases the meter even more.\n\nI do not like that I can't go backwards and redo levels I wanted to try over again in the story mode.\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI would have to say that trying levels out and seeing what they are about is a good idea.  It's not a bad idea to die some while exploring various levels to find out where a nice line would be to travel for max benefit, or bonus perks, like gemstones, or shops or dinosaurs, for instance.  You have infinite lives, basically, but if you use things, and you or they die, then you lose them.\n\nKilling things can be detrimental to success on this one.  Sometimes it is better to skip ahead and save your meter.  Collecting gems, dinosaurs, and weapons is a great idea whenever possible.  They carry over when you clear a level.\n\nThe whole system with the hunger meter is a bit too fast for my liking.  Sometimes I get overfilled, and other times, I find it incredibly difficult to not get hit, move fast enough, and maintain my hunger gauge throughout the level.\n\nI am currently stuck on a part with a strange frame rate issue, but hopefully I can finish this one up soon once it's figured out.  The developers were quick to answer my request for help, and I'm hopeful I can finish this one soon!\n\nEDIT:  Developers could not replicate my strange problem, so we updated my save file to continue on, so I am planning on doing this soon.  Hopefully it's just a freak thing that I encountered alone.\n\nGood game so far, and I would recomend it as it is right now for anybody who enjoys the older style games from the past.  This one embraces that sort of aura!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/recommended/423900/","snowfox444","Snowfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/","463 products in account","~~Beta Key provided by developer. This does not affect my review, these are my honest opinions.~~\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FljakgYdLgk\nTags: Action, Indie, Adventure, Classic, 2D, Pixel Graphics, Funny, Atmospheric, Platformer, Colorful, RPG, Singleplayer, Casual, Family Friendly, Fantasy.\n\nOverview Dinocide is a classic NES-inspired platforming adventure game developed and published by AtomicTorch Studio.\nIn each level, the goal is to reach the end without running out of food/stamina. If you run out, you die. By food/stamina, I mean that there is one bar for both. To replenish this bar, there is food scattered throughout each level. There is also a speed run mode, which is a welcome challenge if you like racing the clock and trying to beat your previous times.\n\nBats, spiders, and scorpions, oh my! Dinocide features a large variety of enemies that reflect the biome you are playing in. There are bats and spiders in caves, scorpions and snakes in the desert, caterpillars and other creepy bugs in the forest, ect.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the dinosaur mounts that you can find in some levels (which reminds me of Mario riding Yosi). Each mount has a unique ability that makes the caveman life a little easier. The first mount you will get is an orange dinosaur that shoots fireballs (Digimon/Pokémon anyone?). Mounts can jump, move, and kill enemies faster. There is even a special underwater mount for the underwater levels.  If you make it to the end of the level with your mount and without dying, you get to keep it in your collection.\n\nSimilar to the mounts, there are also weapons that you can collect along your way. The weapons work in the same way as mounts do: they can be collected in levels and are kept if you complete the level with it equipped. Weapons I have collected so far: a bow, a stone (which is unlimited, since it is your default weapon), an axe, and a boomerang, Each of the weapons are projectiles. They all differ in projectile path, speed, and distance. My favorite has to be the boomerang (because it’s awesome!). There is a stamina bar that prevents spamming your weapon attacks. You can use a weapon usually about 3 times in a row before your stamina is depleted (don’t worry, it regens quickly). If you die in a level with a weapon other than the default stone, you lose it (you can collect more than 1 of each item). The same goes with the mounts.\n\nDinocide does a great job of incorporating classic gameplay and feel into a modern game. The gameplay is full of non-stop action and the challenges are straightforward and fun. Definitely reminds me of classic NES platformers. I think I recall a game called Joe & Mac that had a similar premise. Be warned: if you stand still or linger in one place for too long, your food will run out [quickly] and you will die.\n\nAfter about 5 or 6 levels, you get the option to choose between two levels instead of being forced along a linear path. This is nice, and the levels also strive to make gameplay slightly non-linear, with multiple paths, (some with secrets) all toward the same goal.\n\nOne of the few complaints I have is that there is no tutorial, and I died several times on the first level from starvation before I knew that you have to run as fast as you can to get some food. I won’t count this against the game’s score, however, because most retro games lacked a tutorial and required the player to figure out how to progress and learn from their failures.\n\nThere is a few glitches I have noticed: one is that when you die and are walking off a platform, your dead body floats in a straight line. As well as this, when you jump into an enemy and die (or die while jumping in the air) your body shoots straight up, instead of dropping, as it should. These bugs don’t really effect the gameplay in a significant way.\n\nConclusionDinocide is a must play for anyone interested in retro styled platformer games or 8 bit games in general. Fun, challenging, fast-paced, and great for all ages.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/423900/\nRead the review here on our website: {LINK REMOVED}http://giveaways.pl/reviews/dinocide/\nVisit our steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vantom","January 21","true","4.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunedog/recommended/423900/","dunedog","dunedog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunedog/","314 products in account","This game is pretty much Adventure Island, for better or worse.  I have not played long but there is one big reason, for me at least, that is going to stop me from playing any more: the energy meter.\n\nLike in the original Adventure Island, your energy meter constantly depletes, and not slowly.  The pace of the depletion makes it clear that you are to always be going forward so that you can eat some food and replinish some energy.  Touching or being attacked by enemies also depletes the meter.\n\nThis kind of harsh time limit being imposed on the player without choice has always bothered me.  Every time I have ever encountered it in a game, I felt like it limited the player's ability to explore how the game works.  You have unlimited lives, though I have not tried to see if you have unlimited powerups (between levels, you get to choose from powerups that you have collected) between deaths.\n\nBecause of the energy meter, every death I got felt cheap or not really my fault.  It wasn't that I was bad at the platforming or fighting the enemies.  It was because the game didn't want me to take my time.  I feel like strict time limits work when the player chooses it, making it an optional challenge.\n\nFor this, I cannot recommend this game.  It is seemingly well crafted and I like the aesthetics, but I cannot continue playing it because of the harshly restrictive energy meter.","March 17","false","0.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/423900/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1062 products in account","Status: Not Completed\n\nPresentation\n\nIt looks and plays like a NES game...well, not really. Some effects are too advanced, sprites have too many colors and the controls menu shows a classic 3-button Genesis controller. Which is nice, because I'd choose it over NES controller anytime, but it also looks out of place. I guess that's because you need not two, but three buttons.\n\nThe art is amazing and animations are nice, everything looks clean, sharp, colourful and just speaks “high quality”.\n\nStory\n\nWhat story?\n\nSound / Music\n\nThe same high quality, they're authentic just like the graphics. They do their work and there's nothing wrong with them, but I can't say I remember any music from the game after playing it.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game feels like a rehash of the old hits (Joe and Mac, Adventure Island, etc.), but it knows what it is and you shouldn't expect anything new here either.\n\nIt's a simple platform game. The healthbar you have depletes over time and depletes even more then an enemy hits you. You need to collect food on your way throughout the level to stay alive. If you die, you just return to the beginning of the level, there are no lives or continues. But the game gets really harder because of that meter and on later levels you don't even think about exploration, you just run to the end of the level, collecting all food you can get and trying to avoid enemies or anything else. If you were born to be a speedrunner, that would be great for you, but for everyone else (including me) that can be a major flaw.\n\nControls are simple and responsive – you have a button to jump (of course), a button for basic weapon and a button for special ability (useful while riding a dinosaur).\nThe game stands by its name fully – you'll see a lot of dinos here which you can ride (and use their abilities). Not just dinos, but also a space mecha. But it's a secret, I didn't tell you that.\nThere are bosses, they look great and their patterns are easy to understand and learn. The first boss was perhaps too easy.\n\nOccasionally, you get the chance to choose your path, which leads to different levels. You can't come back and there is no indication what to expect rather than image on the map, so trust your guts. By the way, the levels don't have any titles. It's kinda a problem, because you can't ask someone “hey, do you remember THAT level?”, the answer would be “ehhh, what level?”. The game really needs at least something like “A1, B1, A2, B2”.\n\nAnother major flaw it's the level design and cheap enemy hits which come with it. It's all simple and OK on the first levels, but later in the game you'll meet such “exciting” things like leaps of faith (jump down without seeing where you will land) or enemies which attack you out of nowhere and get about 50% of your health with just one hit (scavenger on desert levels is the reason why I stopped playing the game). There are also platforms which won't lead to anything and won't allow you to come back – you land on it and that's it, the only way is to jump into abyss, restarting the level by that (by the way, there's no option to restart it through the menu, only by dying).\n\nTechnical\n\nThere weren't any bugs during my walkthrough. The game feels well polished.\nYou can rebind the controls and the game works with Xbox One controller.\n\n\n\nDinocide is a clone in an ocean of clones, but it stands out by its high quality of everything. That's the reason I chose to play it and it didn't disappoint. Still, depleting healthbar system is rather controversial and level design flaws cannot be ignored.\n\nThe review copy provided by the developer\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","March 30","true","5.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Not only does it lack the challenge of the game it’s trying to be, but it doesn’t even feel like they even tried to make a memorable game. Dinocide lacks boss battles, interesting level design or even the challenge of losing the game due to your character having infinite lives. The gameplay feels as stiff as the animations look, and everything just feels like an Alpha build that never got to see the light of a beta before being pushed out onto a shelf.
