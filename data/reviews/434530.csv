The controls feel in the first moment quite uncommon but you'll get used to it quickly (you control each side of the bar over twinsticks or A or D keys).\nCollect with the powerbar the floating blobs of your color like in a fishing net.\nDeny the contagious green ones and the unexplodeable missiles\nTry to startle all bombs but dodge their explosion circleLateron you'll see it's totally challenging and merciless. Do not ever let drop a blob at the bottom of the screen. You'll be double punished.\n1.your bar becomes longer and less controlable\n2.your multiplier drops to zero.\n\nAround a score of 2k and a multiplier of 15x your bar gets twincolored. Means left blue, right purple. Ofc you still can just collect the blobs with the right matching color. Hopefully the devs can somehow speedup the movements and control ability during EA. Not gonna go above 15x multiplier yet ...\n\nUpdate: The ability to change colorsides is much better than to flipover and gives the game some depth. Forget to mention the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Ambient music of the 70's like ska or jazz","February 26","true","13.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","1"

I completed a badge and saw I got a coupon for 50% off some game called Flobe. I clicked on it to see if it interested me. At first I was disappointed because I saw what looked like a kind of cheap, dime-a-dozen arcade game. I looked farther into the game though, and it interested me. Being that with the coupon, the game was only 50 cents, I decided to buy it.\n\nWhat I got was the best 99 cent game on steam to be known in a unique and addicting arcade game. The controls are a bit wonky, but they make sense and are very responsive, and anyway, the weirdness of the controls keeps the game challenging. The graphics are fine, and actually better than I expected. Don't use the trailer as reference, because it looks a lot different than the game now, which looks much nicer. On top of all that, the music is amazing! It's something you don't see a lot in arcade games like this, and it really makes it much more enjoyable in comparison to some 9 second loop  you'd hear in some other arcade game.\n\nIf there was anything I would complain about it would be that there are a few annoying bugs, but being that the game is in EA, those will get sorted out in due time.\n\n9/10","May 28","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

We expect bugs, graphics issues and some core issues. Admittedly I only played the  game a few times but it's clean, solid (so far) and surprisingly difficult to stop playing once you get the hang of it. Controller is a must I think. Nice casual game that's easy to pick up once in a while if you don't mind loosing track of  the time. Check it out, certainly worth it, even at this stage of development.","February 26","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Had a hard time putting it down, honestly. Some simple achievements, easy learning curve, though definitely a lot easier with the controller and played as a twin-stick shooter.\n\nI'll have a more in-depth look shortly but for now wanted to give this a thumbs up, as it is a fun little time waster.","February 22","true","0.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","4"

I am at a high score of 2502 right now, and I am trying SO hard to beat it. Just found one bug in the x30 multiplier achievement. It says i have 15/50 instead of 15/30.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the incredibly addictive casual indie game, Flobe. Flobe was released on Steam Januray 23, 2016 by Developers Skinny Jean Death Studios & Porcelain Labs and Publisher Forever Humble PDX.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://youtu.be/0hGvtLpMfDs\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\nCheap, pretty and insanely addictive. Also, less than a buck. 5/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\nFlobe. It is pronounced just as it looks. Flobe. Flobe is a casual little strategy-type indie arcade game with a puzzle feel to it. Essentially you are a blue "bar" that can move all around the screen, change sizes, flip around, etc. With this blue bar, you need to catch these little blue guys flying down the screen. Seems simple enough, but there are other colors. Catching another color will end the game, making you start over. Missing one of your own "collectibles" to catch, however does NOT kill you. It only makes the game harder from that point forward by forcing your bar to become one size larger, which can become a pain quite quickly. You need all the mobility you can get in the game! Keep collecting though, and not missing any, and your score multiplier increases. Once you hit 15X, the game exands itself and now you find yourself chasing 2 colors. IT ramps up quickly! The first thing you notice, is that it is very pretty.Very visually appealing. It has both fantastic graphics, and great sound too. The controls are very responsive and slick. Just make sure to use a controller, as the game was definitely designed with that in mind. The gameplay is so addicting. It is your basic arcade game in that your motivation is to keep increasing your top score. Trust me, you've never had enough. This may be the indie-casual-arcadey type version of "One More Turn".\n\n5/5 for my tastes. It is under a dollar, beautifully presented, easy to pick up and difficult to master. Go give it a shot, and when you do I want you to keep one thing in mind too.....the kid the coded this fantastic game is a mere 14 years old...if this is what we get while he's 14, we have a bright gaming future ahead! Keep an eye on this Forever Humble PDX studio..\n\nHappy Gaming!","February 28","true","8.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

He explicitly said that he is looking for a player that is utter ♥♥♥♥ with the controller. He did not ask me for a good review or whatever, he said "dude, just ♥♥♥♥ off"....or "dude, just play it". I can't remember.\n\nSo after he mentioned the name, I went to check it out right? I don't like hoarding games I'm never gonna play (IM CRAZY, RIGHT?)\n\nFrom the video I figured this looks really easy. I was like "yeah I can totally get smashed and have fun on this thing half sleeping" but guess what. That didn't ♥♥♥♥ing happen!\nYou wanna know why?\nCause I didn't have any booze left.\nSo I started playing it while drinking water. Not as fun as with alcohol but meh.\n\n\nAnyway, I am writing this from the position of a handicap using the controller. I sucked. A lot. Jesus Christ I sucked so bad it was hillarious. The only good thing I was capable of doing was to extend that bloody bar vertically on my screen. Then I'd gaze at it, look at my controller, then back at it and ask "how the ♥♥♥♥ did this happen?"\n\n\nAnyway, the color swapping is an interesting idea which I could barely see, because I sucked so hard. I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing get to it!\n\nThe keyboard control is much better for me, so I tried that thing out. Got to a whooping of ~ 200 score, then my ♥♥♥♥ING WIRELESS BATTERY WENT OUT. Then I grabbed the controller again and BAM! Nothing happened. I died before i could get to 100.\n\nWas pretty funny though for me because I would start off as this pro guy and then puf, the bar would go vertically  with max size. FML xD.\n\nAnyway if you're looking to hone your controller skills I'd suggest you play this. And the multiplayer version is if you wanna make your friend look pathetic....or yourself.\n\nAs features I'd love to see a share to twitter or some crap xD.","May 10","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
