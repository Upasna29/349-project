The puzzles while interesting and entertaining are not so difficult you get frustrated with the game. There are a few trickier ones hidden throughout towards the later part of the game, but they are spread out to keep it fresh rather than to see what your IQ level is and succeeding at making most of us feel stupid as many of the old adventure games delighted in doing (or so it seemed).\n\nWith clean graphics, voice acted humans and for written quips and mesages from your Bots as they go on adventures, it is sure to keep you with a contented smile and maybe a few well-humoured grins. Definitely worth the purchase price as is on Steam. (Though if you go grab the currently humbelbundle as of this writing -4/25/2014- for the weekly sale, you can grab this game and a few more for as little as one dollar donation! THough of course, donations can be any ammount you choose from 1.00 and up to get the Steam keys for it.\n\n(Don't know what humble bundle is? Go to www.humblebundle.com and check it out for yourself).\n\nIn short, I recommend this game highly for a casual fun, story driven experience. It is great for those rainy days, causal relation sundays or just when you want to game after a long day of work or school but not be wrapped up for too long at a stretch. One of the other nice features of the game is your ability to save at any time during play (after cut scenes). This makes being able to pick it up and put it down again extra nice for those who may have to run on a minute's notice. None of the cutscenes are overlong, so that also adds to the fun as they add to the story rather than make you roll your hand or drum your fingers in a thoroughly "Hurry up!" manner.\n\nAgain, excellent fun game, with almost zero learning curve. Every bot you get has to pass three level-tests, to make sure you understand their abilities. Then as quickly as that they are in with your regular crew. It has taken me no longer than two minutes to get all of my bots on their tests. You couldn't ask for a easier learning curve or easier to remember what layout for what bot does what. No need to try and decode secret abilities.\n\nIf you have not had the opportunity to pick up this game, do so. True, replayability is not top of the motivations for getting this game-but it is enough fun that you will want to keep coming back to it every so often after you have beaten it, in the same way the "Monkey Island"series has become a gamer cult classic, it would not surprise me to find Puzzle Bots as another of the point and click adventure gamer cult classics in times to come.","April 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's short, cute and not too difficult. I'd say it's perfect for a kid. and not your inner child..an acctual child. The 'puzzles' are really simplistic and strait forward with 5 different adorible robots that do very strait forward things and nothing but those things. In my opinion the end was poorly done based on the previous pace of the game, they go from being obvious to being abstract right at the end which confused me and caused me to take longer at the end. My real issue with this game is I worked till the end beat it..then the game automatically fastforwarded through all of the end dialog so I got none of the end story. If you have a child you want to get out of your hair for a while with something minimally thought provoking but not brainless, then I'd get them this. However if you yourself are looking for something there are better things out there for 5 dollars or for free.

It's quite short, it does have some collectibles to pick up and it does luckily autosave. I say luckily, because having gotten rather stuck on one puzzle I alt tabbed out of the game only to find this apparently equated to shutting the game down. It also turned out that the reason I was stuck was sadly because the puzzle had glitched and become unsolvable and the autosave fixed that... albeit by resetting the puzzle. It is very cute though and if the price seems right for (at most) a couple of hours of vague entertainment (or possibly more if you sit a small child in front of it) then it's worth a look.","April 29, 2014","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/80300/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","This game took me by surprise.\nIt ended up in my library through some bundle and I didn't play it for the longest time.\n\nI'm glad that I did though, as it is positively delightful.\nThe game follows 5 miniature robots who, after each having been invented by a different inventor at a research company, begin to explore and question their surroundings. Meanwhile (sometimes literally) in the background a larger story is taking place where the inventors question the motives and past of their employer, have crushes and dreams and in general feel very human.\n\nThe game has full voice acting for the human characters and cute robot sounds for the robots, it's clearly not AAA-budget voice acting but it's actually really good and I was consistently entertained and swept along by it.\n\nThe puzzles, which are linear and progressively more complex, are nice little one-screen environmental puzzles where the various abilities of your 5 little heroes is put to the test. The solutions are all pretty easy to figure out (maybe with the exception of one of the final puzzles, which required some more timing than I was used to until then), but that didn't detract from the enjoyment I was getting from it at all.\n\nCharming. That would be the one-word review of this game. It wraps up nicely, doesn't outstay its welcome and oozes personality (which is impressive considering you're controlling a (literal) handful of robots).\nA perfect example on how to make a neat game without having access to a huge budget, and something I'd recommend to everybody.","January 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ory_/recommended/80300/","ory_","ory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ory_/","298 products in account","Puzzle Bots™ is a charming gem that pushes all conventional genre boundries and shatters every expectation with it's unique and challenge approach to the Yearly Unique Keen Autism Required Ingrates (YUKARI) Program sponsored game series.\n\nWho wouldn't want an adorable little robot of their own? Thankfully, Dr. Hugo's Factory for Making Robots is here to help. The company makes cute little mechanical companions of all sorts, from robotic mermaids to walking flamethrowers. But something is not quite right with Dr. Hugo, so the robots take it upon themselves to find out just what's going on. In Wadjet Eye's Puzzle Bots you'll get to control a gang of five robots as they search the factory, solving puzzles and getting into trouble. The result is an incredibly charming adventure, packed with plenty of humor and some deviously clever puzzles.\n\nThe strange thing about Dr. Hugo's Factory for Making Robots is that, aside from Dr. Hugo himself, there are only five employees. And each one of these young inventors has built exactly one robot. When one the inventors stumbles upon a mysterious metal box that can't be opened, the robot team decides to sneak out to try and open it themselves. They end up uncovering a devious plot threatening the whole company, involving hidden cameras, lost toys, and lots of lasers. The game features a uniquely charming sense of humor, especially when it comes to the goofy cast of characters, both human and robotic. You'll come across numerous, hilarious geek references, and the dialog is as silly as it is endearing.\n\nThankfully, Puzzle Bots has much more going for it than just its goofy sense of humor. The game plays out a lot like a traditional adventure game, but with a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving. You'll be controlling all five robots -- who are introduced one at a time at the beginning of the game -- and each has a different ability. Hero, for example, is the only robot who can pick up objects, while Ultraboy bears a striking resemblance to a bulldozer, and thus can push heavy items around. Most of the puzzle will require you to utilize all of the different abilities of your robot team in order to find the right answer.\n\nFor the most part the puzzles aren't too difficult, but they do require you to pay close attention to your surroundings and make use of all of the abilities at your disposal. There is a recharging hint system in place as well, which doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but instead provides subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) tips to push you in the right direction. Unfortunately, there are a few hair-pulling moments of frustration, where it'll take some time to figure out exactly what you're supposed to do. In these instances it's usually easy to figure out what needs to be done, but figuring out how to do it is another thing entirely.\n\nA lot of what makes the game so charming simply boils down to the fact that everything is so small. Since you're viewing the world from the perspective of the robots, who themselves are\n\nabout the size of a small rodent, even everyday objects appear huge and daunting. They also take on new functions. A coffee maker becomes a spaceship, while a book can become a bridge. The robots are also delightfully clueless when it comes to humans. When two of the main characters kiss for the first time, one robot remarks "maybe they're doing battle."\n\nFurther emphasizing the game's undeniable charm, is its wonderful, cartoon visual style. Puzzle Bots looks like a playable Nickelodeon show, with bright colors and a delightful, hand-drawn style. As a bonus, you'll also get to see some gorgeous posters of each of the five robots created by superbly talented artists like Harvey James and David Hellman. And you can also collect special hidden items throughout the game, which give you access to solid amount of interesting concept art. It should also be noted that Puzzle Bots has some great voice acting, as the spoken dialog really helps add to the game's humor and lend some personality to the characters. The robots, in particular, sound adorable, communicating via a series of R2-D2 style beeps and boops.\n\n\nThere are a few technical problems that you'll experience throughout the game, though they're mostly minor. The animation is a little wonky at times, which is frustrating given the game's cartoon style presentation. And occasionally the music will skip, which tends to happen mostly when the game is shifting scenes. Thankfully, these aspects are pretty easy to ignore and don't do much to detract from the overall experience.\n\nPuzzle Bots is both light-hearted and challenging and features one of the rarest of videogame characteristics: a great sense of humor. It's the kind of game that will have you smiling almost the entire time you're playing. The story is silly but well written, and the puzzles are challenging and only occasionally frustrating. It's hard to ask for much more from an adventure game, except, maybe, for a little robot of your own.\n\nPros:\n\nGoofy but charming sense of humor. Adorable cartoon style presentation and great voice acting. Clever puzzles make great use of robot theme.\n\nCons:\n\nPuzzles are occasionally unclear. Music frequently skips in-between scenes.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 4/5\n","May 24, 2014","true","1.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","3"

The puzzles are on the easy side of things pretty much the entire way through and the curve of puzzle difficulty is pretty smooth, adding more complexity the further the game progresses until you have 5 different bots to work with by the end.

This should not be an E rated game, it should be KO rated for kids only.  The acting is not even remotely good for an adult audience.  This should be marketed to kids.  They should, if they haven't, turn this into an application for the kids tablets and the Kindle.  With this being said, it is worth having in your library for when a couple of young kids come over to your house.  Other than that, I would pass.  I wouldn't dismiss another game from these guys though.  They should make one geared for adults, maybe with some logic thrown into it.  I liked the simple animation in this game, I just wish that I would have been warned that it was a kids game.  Also, there is no plot until the very end, which I do not particularly mind.","September 30, 2014","false","19.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, instead of a fun jurney, the developers decided to take the lazy route and force a very, very dumb and short story which ultimately ruined the game for me. It's short, way too short, like only 25% of what I expected to see. The sad part is that all the charm which got me to play the game was lost around the end. The dialogs went from funny to... oh my god they're serious with this and why the ♥♥♥♥ did the little robot "hero" had to talk? The voice they chose was horrible. I couldn't bare to listen any of his lines due to the way he talked.\n\nMechanically the game is ok-ish. Something which I found extremely annoying is that you can not cancel commands(really annoying during the toy house stage) and that you can't change between characters using the keyboard. I ran across 1 game breaking bug during the toy house stage where hero would get stuck on the stairs, meaning that you had to repeat everything(good thing the game has auto saves). And some visual bugs during the last few stages. They aren't anything big but I think they deserved a mention. The options menu is limited, no resolutions option is present or master volume scroll or any options for that matter.\n\nNow let me say some good things about the game. The beginning is fun, you immediately begin to like the characters and want to get to know them better (sadly you don't get that chance). The robots have their own personalities which are also fun but they don't get enough attention. Only the main robot "hero" gets all of the attention and main interaction and that's such a missed opertunity. Having more levels with character interactions would've created a bond between the player and the characters which would've led to a very satisfying end because you have something to remember the game.\nYou're sadly just left with a forced love triangle which you're barely given enough time to give a crap about.\n...\nI was supposed to talk about the good things about the game but all of the charm ended up with a bitter taste and there's no point talking about mechanics because there's no physics involved or anything. It feels like a 1994-2003 indie title.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about the game is that young children may enjoy it, just make sure to keep lighters away from them in case they get any wrong impressions from Kelvin.\n\n3.5/10 from me.","June 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm currently on my endless mission to actually install, test and categorize all those games in my too long list. From the name, description and screenshots, I would not have touched this game, but I currently force myself to play every game at least a couple of minutes to find out, if the gameplay might be a jewel or if I like anyhting about it. Most of those games end up as further reference in one of my categories. This game, however, hooked me up for some reason and I finished it.\n\nI'm not sure what kept me going. The puzzles are very basic, the mechanics are simple and the human characters are annoying. It must have been the robots. They are too cute, they have almost more depth than the human protagonists. I could not stop playing until I knew what happened with those little guys.\n\nThe game is rather short. Of those 4 hours on my clock, 1 hour was preparing a meal and eating and about half an hour was being stuck at one puzzle towards the end, because I didn't observe the environment carefully enough. The puzzles are not very challenging, but the few that actually require some thinking will get you pants down, because your brain is calibrated to simple stuff.\n\nI can recommend this game to children and to everybody who has a heart for robots.","September 27, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short game, and if you know what you're doing, you can finish it in just a few hours.  The graphics and animation, while charming, are underwhelming.  The story is almost entirely back-loaded, leaving you wondering what Dr. Hugo is thinking for almost the whole game, and introducing important characters and plot elements only at the very end, causing all but the most alert players to need to play through it again in order to understand the whole story.\n\nHowever, another playthrough is not something you're going to mind.  The gameplay is easy to get into, and should be instantly familiar to anyone who enjoys the classic Lucasarts and Sierra adventure games.  The characters are memorable and likable, and their dialogue is hilarious.  The puzzles are, for the most part, both logical and whimsical.  Each level has a different feel to it, and you're likely to want to save at the beginning of one or two just to have the satisfaction of playing through them all over again.\n\nIs Puzzle Bots perfect?

But (always a but) it's way too short and the story is fairly non-existent.\n\nJust as the puzzles start to ramp up their already fairly easy difficulty the game ends. Still, worth a couple of bucks. It's already $5 so expect to see it for half that or less come the big sale time.","May 13, 2011","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Difficulty is pretty average, with only the last puzzle causing me any real grief. No inventory shenanigans, voice acting and a decent sense of humour make this follow up to the AGS hit Nano Bots worth $5.","February 12, 2011","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And you probably will. Luckily it has a hint feature which truly helps, sometimes.  Some good comedy, but about none in the last hour.  Worth 2 dollars.  5 bucks? Not for me.

Not too bad for what's being offered. When a robot finds a bonus item they all do a little dance to some House music.

The controls do get a tad annoying sometimes (you have to click to where you want the bots to go) because using arrow keys is faster, but the funny, cheesy story makes up for it.

The game is short (max 3 hours), the puzzles are pretty basic but the plot and character dialogue actually had me chuckling a fair few times during the course of this game.

Very cute with an interesting yet simple plot. Most of the puzzles are relatively straight forward but there are some real head scratchers in there and the final puzzle is a doozy! Nice and bright with simple and colourful animation. Voice acting good with some funny parts that give you the odd chuckle. If you're just wanting a little something to pass the time with the odd head scratcher thrown in with enough things to keep you interested, and a low price tag, this will probably be for you and will be quite universal. However if you are looking for more of a challenge where you really have to think outside the box this will probably be too easy for you and not scratch that itch. The use of the bots was easy, however ocassionally it can be irritating when you have to switch between them quickly (you will know where I mean when you get to it).\nI got this as part of a point and click puzzle pack and as a whole I thought it was a really nice, well made casual game that I could dip in and out of.","May 14","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
