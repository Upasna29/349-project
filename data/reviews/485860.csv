It makes fun of itself, it has extremely clever humor. I am the type of person who hates spending too much money on anything, and I can honestly say that I think game is worth much, MUCH more than it costs. I would be content with purchasing this game for 5$, or even 10.\n\n[Slight spoilers, I only say that because I hate to deprive anyone of the experience] To elaborate on the clever humor, in one scenario you may end up on a laptop looking for a game to play, and if you select "Impossible Quest" it will send you to the title screen.","June 3","true","1.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

(literally)\n\nThe endings are absolutely hilarious. If I were to pick a price appropriate for its value, I'd rate it priceless.\n\n9/10","June 5","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

But there a lot of jokes, memes and... endings (yeah, more than 100!) I even dont know another one, like this to compare, so I guess Impossible Quest is unique :) If you gonna buy it, belive me, you spend money very well","June 3","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You can die of phone poisoning, recreate the ending of Mass Effect, and travel through time. The only complaint I have is there isn't more content.","June 6","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's as simple as navigating through menus repeatedly. It's funny, though, so that's alright.","June 3","true","0.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"
