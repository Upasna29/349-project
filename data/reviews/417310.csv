"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEpicSmiley/recommended/417310/","TheEpicSmiley","Oliver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEpicSmiley/","223 products in account","This game is a great way to learn Hiragana and Katakana letters, if you mind the high level of difficulty. It is a somewhat fast paced educational Rhythm game that uses Hira / Kata letters, and your knowledge of them, to go through levels. You would need skill in timing, memorization, and quick reactions in this game.\n\nFor someone who knows (or knew) Hiragana and Katakana before, it is still surprisingly challenging. The challenge lies in your reaction time, and memorization. Sometimes, some letters or characters would appear way too near the actual time you have to input them. I know this adds extra challenge, but I have a feeling this should be adjusted a bit.\n\nFor people who are brushing up on their Hira / Kata, this is a great way to remember the basics, and also to distinguish on the differences of how each character sounds. I usually had trouble with my あ's and  お's because they look so similar.\n\nThey say that this "is a game that anyone can enjoy", now I think that is kind of ballsy to say. I'd say that if you are even remotely interested in Japan or learning new languages, and also if you are really into fun challenging rhythm games, that's when this game can truly be enjoyed. (This is only my opinion though.)\n\n\nI bought this immediately as soon as it got on the store, and I could safely say that it was worth it. If you are interested in learning Hira or Kata, and are fond of rhythm games like me, I think that this would be right up your alley.\n\n\nRecommended.\n\n","March 19","true","1.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

BUT at least for me the prompts move to quickly and I'm still figuring out which button is which when the action has already started. (which is aggrivating as I already know hirigana and some katakana) but this is more likely my own issue with fast-mapping and this style of game rather than a design flaw.\nIf you are just starting to learn japanese, this can be a fun way to supplement your studies!","March 19","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

An other fix is needed.","March 19","true","7.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

That being said, I did in fact grab this as a changeup from the memorization I've already done.\n\nI already know both hiragana and katakana, but I think this helps me in my aim to read them less consciously.\n\nAlso I'm not great at rythm games, but the challenge makes it fun.\n\nTo the Dev: If you do patch the difficulty down, it would be cool if you put the original difficulty in as a hard mode or somesuch.\n\nAlso it seems that the achievements aren't triggering properly.","March 18","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I still think that there are a lot of things that could improve the game itself and believe that the game isn't for everyone, as the game is more like flashcard memorisation with music than a game which will teach you the Japanese alphabets. There is nothing wrong with this if you want to use it to supplement learning the language in school or your own self studies but it's not really geared towards everyone.\n\nAs someone who already knows both Hiragana and Katakana here are my thoughts on the gameplay itself:\n\nPro:\nSimplistic play style\nGreat for learning to memorise characters once you have learned what they are\nDeveloper fixing issues/updating the game\nGame runs perfectly with no crashing or errors\nCon:\nGives Japanese characters but seems to forget to tell you what the English letter equivalent for it is. You can get the sounds if you click on the characters in the pre-mission screen but would be better to see the written letters. Also been reported an issue if you are using a controller that you can't get the sounds, you must have a mouse currently to do this.\nToo much emphasis on memorising patterns of characters instead of teaching the characters themselves\nSoundtrack is OK but the SFX are not great, feeling like they will get on your nerves after a couple of hours play. Thankfully you can turn the sound completely off if you feel this way.\nNot enough notice given on which characters go to which keys (it randomly changes with each pattern) making the game unnecessarily difficult\nKatakana tutorial is the exact same as the Hiragana one (didn't even bother to change characters to Katakana)\nIf you had more notice on which keys were for which characters, slower tempo for earlier levels to give people who are new to the language more time to adjust to the characters and less emphasis on what the pattern is after it's been flashed to you then the game might be ok but as it is now, it's not great.","March 18","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game was indeed a bit frustrating at first with the various Hiragana and Katakana switching keys every now and again but that was actually an interesting way to implement learning instead of simply memorization. I came into the game knowing little to nothing about either or and I'm surprised at how quickly I'm picking up Hiragana and Katakana. Overall, If you like rhythm based games with a bit more difficulty then normal and would like to learn Hiragana and/or Katagana then give this one game a try.","March 21","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not as easy as it sounds as the layout on the controller is changing constantly to keep you awake.\nAll the while a nice manga backround is scrolling by.\n\nUpdate one day later:\nContacted the developer, about the problems I had. One day later and he gave us already an update to those problems. Holy that was smoking fast.

Which is pretty much what you need to do a repetitive task like commiting something to memory.\n\nI dislike all of the levels that require you to remember multiple characters and their order for a while and then play them out. The difficulty curve on this game swings wildly because of seemingly random combinations of variables on how the levels play. It's even worse when on the one level I played it just flashed the hirigana characters before the blocks, and expected you to identify them (as the romaji letters were shown on the keys), AND remember them (because there was nothing printed on the boxes to jump over), made worse because some of them were only shown for a fraction of a second before it flashed the next.\nI get that it's good to force you to try to identify them faster, but memory isn't my strongest point and remembering whole words is different to remembering multiple single characters.\nMaybe it does serve a roll, but I can't see how and I just find them frustrating.\n\nI've not come accoss a section that I haven't been able to get past though so it's not a big deal, and I still like the rest of the game for what it does. I just wish the boxes always had something printed on them (preferably the romaji characters if the hirigana characters are shown on the keys, or the hirigana characters if the romanji are on the keys)","March 27","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
