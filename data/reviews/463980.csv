And what does that do? It makes an addictive game that I planned to play 4 hours to get my first impressions. Instead, I ended up playing 14+. This should tell you something. Using skills to turn a defeat into a victory was always satisfying, and a game that was great to play in the background while I was watching YouTube videos. The different classes and items helped to keep the variety up, while buying news skills and changing up strategies was great to see what new combination I could put together next. The game could use a few tweaks to make it more of a streamlined experience, and the developer seems to be taking feedback after he watched the video review I produced. And I would like to see the game on the iOS/Android platform, as I think it'd work really well there. But even for what may seem like a higher price compared to other solitaire/card games out there, Solitaircia delivered in some addictive gameplay, and made my other reviews that much harder, with the time I spent on this one.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5sXGBBmtL8\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nAddictive. It has that pick up and play for just one more match. And then one more match. And then one more match.\nThe added skills do help take away some of the weaknesses of the base solitaire game. They add to the strategy of the game, and help makes things interesting.\nGood variety of enemy skills and status effects, which force you to change up your strategy and  adapt to the new situation. Hording energy a key part of your strategy? Well have fun against an enemy who can burn those energy reserves off.\nClass decks force you to prioritize one or two attribute, and do play to rather interesting strengths, like the bard's want of hording energy.\nThe items you can grab are rather effective and make coin collecting rather important.\nSound design does well in giving little tone hints about certain events in the game, giving you information that you need: like when you're unnecessarily burning energy\nAnimations and artwork are clean and rather nice to look at. Like some of the enemy designs and descriptives as well.\nNegatives:\nSome of the animations after a while do get a little old, in terms of the time that it takes to execute.\nThe music needed a little bit more variety.\nWish it had hotkeys. After talking with the developer, it will be in the first patch, so that's good!","May 31","true","14.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","31","40","2","0"

It features procedurally generated attacking monsters and you must battle them using cards and spells yo ugain from your cards.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are pretty standard for a 2d card game. The art is beautifully drawn and colorful. The whole game has that spooky atmosphere.  The enemy monsters are very adorable and drawn pretty good.\n\n\nSound:\n\nThe music in this game is very good and I like listening to it while playing the game. The music has that Halloween/spooky theme going on as well.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe way Solitairica works is the basic concept is you have a bunch of cards on the screen and you have a deck and one card in hand. You must select a card from the top which is one number lower or higher than the card in your hand. You must do this to all the cards and finish all the cards on top. Once you finish them the level is beaten. There can be other tasks too but mostly you will see are missions which tell you to clear the cards.\n\nSo the basic card gameplay is similar to numerous card games found on Steam such as Faerie solitaire etc. but this game features RPG elements. You have elements on your cards which can give you abilities which will help you beat levels. You also have enemies in this game and every enemy does something different so you have watch out for their attacks which can do a lot of things. Every monster has a different strategy, some do more damage, others keep adding things like freezing or burning the cards You have an energy bar which when depleted you will lose the game.\n\nEvery time you lose a battle against an enemy you’ll have to start the adventure again from the start. They will give you runes though which can help you buy better decks and upgrades. Once you upgraded the decks you can have much better chance of beating the enemy in the next run. There’s a total of 18 levels and every one of them feature a different monster. The game gets pretty difficult in the later levels so you can expect to play the game a few times in order to build a better deck and to have a chance against the later monsters. This game can get pretty addicting if you’re a card games fan.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA very addicting and fun solitaire/RPG/Rogue-lite game which will keep you entertained for hours. It has that “just one more game and I am off” thing but you never leave it. I recommend this game, it’s pretty fun.","June 1","true","1.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/463980/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2516 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Solitairica is solitaire wrapped up in a fantasy setting, complete with magic, weird enemies, and a strange sense of humour.\n\nThere's no introduction to provide a backstory, but it seems that for some reason it's up to you to fight the armies of Stuck through 18 levels of the Blandlands, to confront some sort of sinister evil. Each level has you fighting a strange creature, many with a humorous twist, by completing a hand of solitaire.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are functional, with some humorous touches. Each group of levels in the quest has a different static background image over which the main game is played. Your opponent for a hand is shown at the top, represented by a deck of square cards, and the normal playing cards that make up the hand are displayed at the centre of the screen. You are represented by a heart, showing your life points.\n\nCards and abilities are animated, and it's the abilities that shine as far as the graphics are concerned. Some of these (such as the beards) are very odd indeed, but should elicit a chuckle or two at least.\n\nThe interface between battles is big and cartoon-like, with icons that are easy to understand and use, and some nice simple animations showing your progress and your next opponent. Graphics options are minimal, only allowing resolution and windowed / full screen selection.\n\nSound - Sound effects are good, with various effects for magical spells and abilities, and appropriate sounds for button feedback and card movements. There are a few musical flourishes at various points in the game, such as when winning a level or losing the game, but during battles there's a notable lack of background music that leaves the game feeling a bit empty.\n\nGameplay - As mentioned, your job is to battle through the 18 levels of solitaire that make up The Blandlands in order to confront the evil that awaits you in the castle at the end.\n\nThe basic solitaire rules are implemented, but what makes the game interesting is the introduction of various special powers, spells, and items that reduce or improve your ability to complete the hand. As you play through you'll no doubt die (by your opponent draining your heart's life points to zero), which puts you back at the beginning again. Never fear, though: each death earns you 'wildstone' gems, which are used to improve your deck or purchase a new one for your next attempt.\n\nBetween levels you can spend coins, earned through completing levels and getting long chains of cards, on items and spells to improve your chances. There's not a whole lot of variation in items, though, with most being of the "begin with +x" in a certain value variety. Similarly with the enemies you fight: there's only a relatively small number of enemies you're likely to encounter at each stage, sometimes enhanced by one or more abilities. It's hardly the "horde of ever-changing enemies" and "wide variety of items" that are promised in the game's description.\n\nThe promised 'rogue-like' features come in when you die and return to the beginning of the game. At this point you can spend wildstone gems you've earned on upgrading your card deck (up to three upgrades per deck), or purchasing a new deck. I wouldn't really call the game 'rogue-like' based on this, but it's a nice feature nonetheless.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Good sense of humour\n+ Cute graphics and sound\n+ Simple to learn, but fun and addictive\n+ Items, spells, and deck upgrades keep you coming back for more\n+ Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Crashes to desktop with 'fatal error' on occasion (but it seems to save turn by turn, so you don't lose anything)\n- Repetitive, especially in the early stages of each game when you tend to encounter the same enemies with no special abilities\n- Lack of background music during battles leaves the game feeling a bit empty\n- Some grammar errors (e.g. "no where" instead of "nowhere")\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I enjoy Faerie Solitaire, on which I've racked up 15 hours or so. Initially I thought Solitairica played a bit like a poor man's Faerie Solitaire, but after playing for a couple of hours I can see that was unfair. Solitairica takes the same basic solitaire rules and takes them in a different direction. It adds spells and enemy abilities, and wraps the whole thing up in an amusing fantasy world to produce a game that stands on its own.\n\nOverall, Solitairica is fun and addictive. Bear in mind, though, that it can be frustrating: a moderate run of poor cards, especially against some of the more dangerous enemies, can easily lead to your demise with nothing at all that you can do about it.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","June 1","true","4.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

It's borderline, just because of one almost crippling negative.\n\nThe first game I had was brilliant. Totally enjoyed it.\n\nThe problem I have is with it is the "roguelike progression" description. And the "Every time you get stronger" announcement when you lose. No you don't. You have to do a lot of grinding many games before you get a very very small amount 'stronger' - and then do it all again a few more times. And that seems about it.\n\nAnd the griding is flawed. It's far quicker to do the first level over and over, rather then actively play the game properly. There is no reward benefit for doing well (on a time-played basis).\n\nIf you could keep, say, one item or spell for the next round (which you would then permanantly have access to at the start) this would be a massive improvement to the game, imo. As it is, after grinding for an hour or so to unlock the first (pretty much worthless, tbh) 'upgrade' I really can't see any motivation to try and progress.\n\nIt's a fun game, and the spells/items really do make it quite a lot more than just a standard solitaire game. But losing everything after every game more or less destroys the whole purpose of putting it in an RPG-like setting, imo.\n\nIt feels like a mobile game heavily designed towards IAPs for progression, although I can't find it on the app stores yet. The portrait oriented windowed mode seems to confirm this. But there are no IAPs on the Steam version; and so practically no way of progressing.\n\nIf you like solitaire enough to play exactly the same game over and over (and yes; I understand that's what solitaire is all about), then this is probably a great game. If, like me, you were expecting to have some feeling that by playing more you were likely to be able to progress further, then maybe look for something else.","June 4","true","3.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

While the game grants unlimited draws, it isn't likley your character could survive more than 2x through.\n-There isn't really much of a story or real dungeons to explore, just a seemingly endless run of 1 on 1 ever increasingly difficult baddies to defeat.  Use gold earned from each win to better equip yourself for the next encounter until you're finally bested.\n-Each character will start off with a unique combimation of 4 skills (1 for each of the game's 4 suits) with at least 1 unique only to that class.\n-You'll start with only the Warrior unlocked, and with the experience tokens you earn from runs, you can unlock the rest of the classes.\n-The monsters you fight are often somewhat randomly generated with the game stringing together a couple adjectives and a noun that the game will breakdown the significance for you before the fight","June 1","true","15.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I enjoyed it right out of the gate and the longer I played the more I got into it. While there is a luck component to the game (as with most card games where you draw from a deck), you never go into a fight without knowing what you're going up against, so you can always prepare your setup a little to deal with what's coming.\n\nIt definitely plays even better on the PC and I love how easy it is to pick up exactly where I left off each time.\n\nWhile the starting Warrior deck is a good baseline for the game, I really started to fall in love with the more advanced decks available.\n\nFor the price I think you're getting a great little game that will give you hours and hours of entertainment.

Making it a roguelike encourages repeat play because each time you "die" you feel like you'll be able to get further on the next go round instead of just trying to get a high score or playing through a "story" straight through. It also feels like it's very well balanced in terms of the enemies' abilities and there's an even ramp-up of the things you're able to buy compared to how many coins you're earning.
