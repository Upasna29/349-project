"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/457530/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Here is the dream coming true for a certain kind of otome gamer: now you can pursue your butler as a romantic interest! Interested? Buy the game already, it's for a dollar anyway. Not so much? Skip, 'cause this brief definition is really all that there is to this game, and by using the word "pursuit" previously, I already overcharged the concept. The whole VN consists of 5-6 choices and 3 scenes, without any kind of decent story build up. Cute, brief and without much content, My Lady sadly feels like the outline of an Harlequin romance without decent story progression, character depth or even expected romantic exaggeration.\n\nYou are young Lady Bauxmont, a fair noblewoman of age seventeen and desperately in love with your butler, yet it is not possible for you to be together thanks to the difference in social classes. Age old story aside, you have a tyrant of a mother who'd most surely arrange a marriage with another aristocrat of your age quite soon; thus, you have one last chance to get things into your hand and try to grasp your happiness with the butler. Lemons and oranges as your fateful maid Sophie tells you; lemons and oranges...\n\nThe game is extremely short and characters are not given any kind of depth at all to actually comment on that quality. You are free to name Miss Bauxmont and the butler as you please - or keep original names, which are Elizabeth and Alexander - to arrange some kind of immersion for the player, but it’s a sad attempt at that really. The chosen art style of faceless figures feel unfittingly eerie and existentialist compared to the flighty mood of the game also. One serious plus is that the game is fully voice acted with good enough acting in the sense, especially for Sophie with her accent, laughter and remarks. The game comes with 5 endings, which are easy to reach yet the choices and their influence in endings are a bit ridiculous. Apparently, the kind of woman you are and what kind of an ending you'd happily pursue is dependent on your choice for the dress color you'd pick to wear that given day. Oh, well... What are you gonna do sometimes?\n\nI haven't played the developer's previous game, quite successful and surprisingly freeware Seduce Me the Otome but apparently it has a truckload of content in it and much replayability compared to this one, so it is frustrating to see the previous game being a freeware and this not. I'm aware that it's a one dollar game and there shouldn't be expected much, yet I'd personally prefer paying for Seduce Me the Otome rather than for My Lady. With at least some proper story build up between the starting position and one of the endings rather than the abrupt appearance of a suitor we know nothing about, this game could have been much more pleasant or at least interesting. As it is, go buy yourself a can of soda if you don't have an unbearable fetish for butlers - correction: the "concept" of butlers since Alexander doesn't bear much personality himself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimchitea/recommended/457530/","kimchitea","Kimchi Tea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimchitea/","1820 products in account","A short visual novel where you romance your butler. The characters are underdeveloped; the game relies on the idea that you, the player self-insert, has a thing for butlers, rather than anything compelling about this particular protagonist and this particular butler that makes you want to see them get together. Self-insert protagonists really aren't my thing, but hey, when the game gives you faceless and nameable characters and advertises the protagonist's CV as "YOU!", you can't say you weren't warned =P\n\nThe writing is okay, but there are some awkward phrasings, as well as slang that doesn't make sense for the characters and time period. Could've used a once-over by a good editor. The choices can be a bit obtuse, as well, but the game's short enough that it's not difficult to find all the endings.\n\nThe voice recording quality is mixed and obviously amateur, but the acting itself is good overall, and helps give some nuance to the characters. In particular, Sophie might come across in text as one of the protagonist's best friends, as she says, but the voice acting gives the impression that she's playing a role she finds a bit tiresome. EDIT: I forgot to mention that the balance of voices to background music is correct at the default settings, which is a rarity for visual novels in my experience, and is much appreciated.\n\nAt $.99, I'd say My Lady is worth buying if you're an otome fan who likes butlers, but probably not otherwise.\n\nP.S. It should run on Windows XP!","March 30","true","1.0"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","2"

It could have used a bit more depth, but it's good for being lighthearted though.\n\nOne of the endings was impressive because it actually promoted a simplified version of polyamory, which is quite rare in stories.\n\nIf you've got a dollar to spare, I recommend it.","April 29","true","0.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The story is simple and straight forward, no complex plot twists here. Even so, I had fun. Art style was okay (I found it interesting that all the characters are faceless; leaves everything to your own imagination), BGs were ok, BGM was nice. I also liked the VA a lot: I’ve played really expensive games with poor VA and this one, yet so simple and with a good price, has a great VA.\n\nI hope to see more works from this developer soon!\n\n8/10, because I wish this VN could be just a bit longer, haha.","April 3","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

From Seduce Me to this, I love what she does. Her voice reels give me liiiife, and she's such a sweetheart with so many great ideas. I liked hearing Bradley and Scott in here, as they're both rockin' velvet voices.\n\nThis is short, sweet, to the point. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You want that fine butler ♥♥♥ and you gotta get it. So please, don't worry that it's a whole freaking dollar. It's worth it.\n\nThe producer works her butt off and puts out consistent content across the board despite roadblocks she hits.

As the game's description suggests, there are branching paths and multiple endings. The game itself is rather short, you should be able to get all endings within an hour. Despite it's length the game is rather good. The writing is crisp and to the point. The music is pleasant to listen to and fits the story. The character and background art, while limited, is more than suitable for this game. Given that the game is priced for a dollar, there is no reason not to pick it up if you are a fan of visual novels or narrative-driven games.","April 8","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting and music were extremely good for an indie visual novel. The choice of faceless mannequins was... different and I would have preferred at least a CG with their actual faces, but you could also see the choice as providing a blank slate to input yourself into the story, so don't let it put you off. I was very glad I bought and played.","May 8","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Emphasis on short - you can easily earn all the endings & achievements in under an hour. The story is simple and straightforward – you’re in love with your butler, but he’s too polite to romance a lady of your standing. The romance is not deep by any means, but if you get the right ending(s) you’ll be filled with warm fuzzies.\n\nI thought the art style – grey, faceless people - was sort of off putting at first, but by the time I finished my first play through I decided I really liked it. It gives the game a bit of a surreal, dream-like quality.\n\nBGM is nice. I wasn’t a fan of the voice overs and muted them fairly early on.\n\nIf you’re a big fan of otomes and you’re looking for something short it’s worth the $1 price tag.","April 20","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
