This has ruffled a lot of feathers, and with good reason, as there are some real birdbrains making videogames nowadays. But I'm talon you, this isn't one of those, this game is eggcellent. You might fink people just buy it for ironic purposes, but it's eggshelly a very good game. The premise may make you worried that the game's a bit of an odd duck - a human gull going to a school for birds? To call that "realistic" would be ostrich, so a lot of peeps might wonder how the flock that can make for a fun game. But if you give it a chance and carrion with it, you'll discover that it is well written, with a migrate cast of characters. You're bound to have a pheasant time with this, and even if you're still hesitant, you should swallow your pride and buy the game on a lark (it's not that expensive, so don't worry about the bill), and you'll discover an impeckable game with hours of replay value. So just spend some cash from your nest egg, and from heron out you won't egret your perchase. You'll have a hoot, guaranteed.","September 5, 2014","true","11.2"," 6,436 of 6,791 people (95%) found this review helpful 989 people found this review funny","95","436","6","989","182"

Hatoful Boyfriend is a bird dating sim.\n\nI purchased this because I thought it would be funny to say that I was playing a bird dating sim.  There wasn’t suppose to be any real feelings behind this purchase, it was all in jest.\n\nI launched the game and quickly got to the bad ending.  I figured I should at least complete one or two “good” endings before I uninstalled the game and abandoned it to be just another game in my library.  To accomplish my goal of being able to complete a good ending, I quickly made a “birds.txt” where I would list everybody in the story with a couple words to allow me to remember who was who.\n\nRyouta : Childhood friend, sick\nSakuya : ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\nYuuya : Works in infirmiry, upperclassmen, half brother of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, flirt\nNageki : Library silent dude\nSan : RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN\nKazuaki : Homeroom / math teacher, falls asleep\nShuu : Doctor\n\n\nReferencing this “cheat sheet”, I was able to get a good ending fairly easily.  I repeated myself, this time going for a different ending...sometime in this third playthrough, something changed.\n\nBy the end of that ending, I was actually enjoying what I was doing.  This “Joke of a game” was actually drawing me in, not because of “bird dating sim”, but because of the actual plot and the compelling characters.  My cheat sheet was pointless, I knew all the names.  Everybirdie had their own personality, and their stories had wildly different outcomes, yet were all tied together to help reveal a plot that actually mattered.\n\nAs you play through the game more, and achieve different endings you find little bits and pieces about the world.  You read how birds became the dominant lifeform on the planet, how the human race almost fell to extinction, and how bird politics work.\n\nEach story feel completely different.  They all showcase a huge variety of emotions and social conditions.  One story / ending exists entirely for humor, and no deep thought is put into anything.  You are able to laugh your way through a 20 minute story and have a great time.  You re-roll your game, and suddenly your story is filled with great sorrow between all the funny bird puns.  Sadness then turns into happiness as your story becomes complete.  Re-roll again, now you are exploring yet more bird puns, but this time also the impossible expectations sometimes forced onto oneself from their family.  Re-roll, now genocide is brought into the fold.  Re-roll, we are happy and excited again.\n\nWhat the hell just happened?  This game somehow managed to put an actual fantastic plot full of emotion and lessons of how the world works into...a bird dating simulator.  Somehow this completely over the top game idea is completely overlooked the more you play it and fall in love with it.\n\n\n\nEverybirdie should download this game and try it out because “lol bird dating sim”.  You’ll be amazed as the joke suddenly starts being enjoyable and the fact that everyone is a bird spouting bird puns is able to be completely overlooked.\n\nWhat is Hatoful Boyfriend? Hatoful Boyfriend is a fantastic game filled with more emotion and story than it should possibly contain.","February 14, 2015","true","8.4"," 568 of 590 people (96%) found this review helpful 123 people found this review funny","96","568","590","123","5"

But as I carried on through the different routes you could take, I found each story more and more compelling. So many twists and turns and things that just randomly straight up hit you in the feels or made you think "wtf just happened?"\n\nThe main story is really creative and the genre twist really takes you through a loop and keeps you hooked. And for birds, the characters are really well developed.\nI think the makers of this game knew exactly what they were doing. I want to take the player into a false sense of "This is going to be hilarious and stupid" Which granted, at some points, that's what it does. Very well. It's really funny.\nWhen really it's building you up for a huge unexpected story hit. All the different routes are just branches of character developments, readying you for the main plot. I applaud that.\n\nOver all, I'd actually recommend buying this game and doing exactly what everyone else is doing. Go in while not taking this game seriously at all and let it change your mind. Because it seriously will. Then it'll leave you there to sit there and think about how unexpectedly brilliantly done it is. Mediatonic, Hato Moa... hats off to you, this was a great experience.","October 29, 2014","true","16.7"," 665 of 707 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","665","707","17","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/310080/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Hatoful Boyfriend is more nuanced and compelling than it has any right to be.\n\nIts outrageous concept is so over the top that it’s hard to view the game as anything more than a joke; something amusing but mostly held together by the mere fact of its existence. But these preconceptions, strung along by even its own marketing and description, are hiding the shockingly well written and emotionally stirring narrative underneath.\n\nTo be entirely clear, it is in part exactly what it appears to be: an otome dating simulator/visual novel, set in a world where birds have evolved to be the most intelligent species and humans have been mostly driven to extinction. Playing as the lone human student at Pigeonation Academy, you are tasked with going about your day, trying to scrape by in your schoolwork while wooing the bird of your dreams.\n\nIt’s an intentionally laughable idea, and one which at first can seem so ridiculous as to turn those less drawn to Japan’s stranger exports away, but its one which never dissolves into idiotic bird lover pandering (assuming that’s a thing that exists) or outright stupidity with its writing. Hatoful Boyfriend is entirely aware of its own absurdity, and treats it almost as an afterthought, to the point that the fact these characters are nearly entirely birds became irrelevant at least as far as being a very odd novelty.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend’s writing is exceptional, both hilarious and comical, and heart wrenchingly sad and contemplative. Though it begins as little more than a silly teenage romance, it spends this time crafting characters that you come to care about, before hurling them into a plot darker and more precarious than I ever could have imagine. While there are certainly parts (and entire storylines) within the game which are nothing but comedy, allowing the humorous and charming side of the game to take the spotlight for a moment and provide more than a few laughs, it was when the subject matter moved away from this silliness that I began to finally see the hidden brilliance of the game’s writer.\n\nIt’s shocking to even consider at first, and even now as I’m writing this I’m rather stunned at what Hatoful Boyfriend manages to do with its narrative, but it handles it's incredibly dark material with incredible grace and consideration. Calculated genocide, mass murder and biological experimentation, interspecies racism, and the value of family are not only touched upon, but discussed at length and in such a way as to not only allow you to take them seriously within the game’s context, but actually emphasize and become emotionally invested in the avian characters that once seemed so innocent and comical.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend made me laugh; it made me smile and appreciate its subtlety; and it made me cry. The spectrum of emotions I experienced throughout my handful of playthroughs (which should be considered a requisite, as you will miss the vast majority of the game’s content if you only go through it once) was something I never imagined this game to be capable of. It kept me playing for hours on end, up late into the night, and I’m still attempting to process all that I witnessed. It could very well be the apotheosis of a game you shouldn’t judge by its cover, and something that everybirdie ought to at least give a chance before writing it off as something it by and large is anything but.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 4, 2014","true","9.4"," 408 of 426 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","408","426","4","10"

I bought this game for the laughs. I mean, a pigeon dating sim? I assumed I'd have fun with it for a couple of hours and then be done. I was not expecting what happened next.\n\nCons I must admit that there are negatives, and I will point them out before I praise the game. To start off, I'm not sure if this can be considered a negative (I think it's a positive), but a few of the story lines seem to be created merely for amusement and humour. They make no sense, and are there as a joke. However, If you are looking for something that is 100% serious, you're in the wrong place, and I have absolutely no clue why you would be here in the first place. Anyway, the interface and skill point system is simple, but they do the job. There are a few spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout, which may be distracting, but they are far and few between. As well, the starting routes are short and perhaps shallow. I recommend you try to complete all of the endings in order to see the "Bad Boys Love" bonus ending and the epilogue.\n\nPros Despite all of that, this game sets you on an emotional roller coaster if you put in the time to explore the different routes, and carry through with the finale. With various endings, each path provides a unique narrative. If the final ending is achieved, all of the stories tie together quite well, leaving you with an unexpectedly profound story, a group of memorable characters, and a collection of bird puns.\n\nI came for the laughs. What I got was comedy, romance, horror, mystery, and tears.\n\nI didn't ask for this.\nBut I'm glad it happened.","May 25, 2015","true","11.3"," 158 of 165 people (96%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","96","158","165","16","0"

On these terms, the title of the game is self-explanatory. Hatoful Boyfriend is a humorous otome/visual novel in which you get to date birds. Aside the humorous, or even strikingly unconventional nature of the game, this joke veils a deeper truth.\n\nThe story is set in the fictional future of 2188. A century ago starting with rock pigeons, birds all over the world started to take the next step in evolution and challenged the omnipotence of mankind. After a long period of conflict and even open war, the mankind survived only as a minority. Now, the majority of the world's conscient population consists of birds. In this particular dystopia, we take the role of the only human student invited to attend St. Pigeonation, the most prestigious high school for birds of the world.\n\nAt first, the display of the story keeps us oblivious to the grim face of our setting. Nothing indicates that Hatoful Boyfriend would be more than an unimaginably crazy joke. We keep playing the game in this meaningless context, as a silly joke, flirting with different kinds of birds and all. We laugh our hearts out for the absurdity of given situations, the reactions and portrayals of characters, and logical flaws of the setting are unbearably funny. It is like watching one of the most absurd anime series, like ever!\n\nBut as the stories progress, and we accomplish different kinds of romances, we learn a bit more about different characters each time. As we play, they become more than silly depictions of birds. We learn their stories, their backgrounds, their aspirations and their wounds... just like real people. I tell you, the narrative of this game, and the narrative's ability to conceal the most shocking fictional events in silly jokes are totally scary. As we play, bits and pieces roll up to their proper places to paint an incredibly political and ethical discussion with suspense and immense tragedy!\n\nGameplay wise, nothing is extraordinary. There are some pretty background pictures, and an incredible amount of bird photos flying around. Each character has their own separate background music. You start reading, and make some dialogue or event choices now and then. Finally, it wraps up to become a romance path for a bird of your choice. When you complete all endings, and start a new game; you face with the question whether you'd like to keep a long forgotten promise. If you say yes, things take an incredible turn, to reveal all past mysteries. Annoying or peculiar occurrences that you've been witnessing in your prior games now form a painful meaning. This final storyline reveals a darker side to our fictional setting, and brings question to concepts such as war, peace, misinformation, discrimination, racial and ethnic differences, and even biological war! Now, that was certainly unexpected, wasn't it?\n\nHatoful Boyfriend starts as an absurd joke for you to kill some meaningless time, yet if you bear with its lame display and take a moment to look deeper, it rewards you with a most thrilling and disturbingly realistic story. Take your time, get bored by the joke. You'll end up picking a glass of water to wash the bitter feeling in your throat towards the end.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 24, 2015","true","14.1"," 158 of 171 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","158","171","8","4"

It does not even come close.\n\n\n\nLet me tell you how my adventure went...\n\n\n\nA little background on me. I used to be a human soldier for the United States. I lost my legs in Afghanistan (Landmine+Humvee=Not Good). After coming back home to a wife who cheated and wanted a divorce, I fell into a deep depression. I thought my life was over and my existence had no purpose. That was, until I found this game.\n\n\n\nI thought this game was a joke. A bird dating sim?!? This'll be hilarious. It was even on sale!

The angels of heaven rode down from Valhala one the backs of giant white doves, singing "Hallelujah" from their based lungs. Our eardrums deafened as the intertwining storylines of this gift from god put our minds on a new level. My computer exploded, but the game didn't stop.

The game is the way it is today because of us... we fixed the sins of this previously hellish world.\nIt was time.

Sometimes art is in the form of a concept or idea and not just an optical quality, and it's in this sense that I highly regard Hatoful Boyfriend as a work of art. It takes a tired and cliched concept and reworks it into a thought provoking and never before seen idea that manages to be both humorously satirical and affectingly sentimental, causing the general public to reconsider and ponder the meaning of a mostly mocked genre.\n\nSome may discount the games merits based on the corny puns, and these people miss the point entirely. What makes Hatoful Boyfriend so damn funny, so artfully clever, and so hard to stop smiling at is the overall concept of what's happening and the way the emotionally driven story is delivered. The idea of seeing such seriously toned dialogue combined with the strange and surreal imagery of a school of pigeons is wildly outside of the box, and to anyone with an imagination is at first incredibly entertaining. What really takes the player by surprise is the emotional draw the story has on you in the end for what at first was such a seemingly laughable and satirical plot.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend isn't just a satire or a mockery, it's not just one big comedic joke like some might intially believe. The characters are written well and manage to shine with more personality and.. humanity(?) than what we're used to seeing in the generally shallow world of anime dating sims, which is what makes the experience feel even more bizarre, strange, yet memorable given it's subject matter. It manages to feel more real and authentic than even the most sensible or conventional games in this form of interactive storytelling.\n\nThe strange feeling evoked by Hatoful Boyfriend of feeling a growing emotional attachment towards something so seemingly overlooked as a pigeon or bird in a video game is one I'll remember. People with no connection or empathy for the animal kingdom my find it hard to swallow the ongoings of St. Pigeonation and won't take away anything of value from this quirky change of pace needed in gaming, but those with an open mind and heart to the topic will come away with a new found respect and admiration for a species generally viewed as insignificant or often misunderstood.\n\nIf you're the type who isn't too concerned with artistic and strange new takes on old genres, or you're one of those gamer types who enjoys the same-old-same-old while fearing changes to the industry then by all means skip this and play what you usually play. For people who want something new in the medium and want to see differences to gaming that allow a wider variety of people into the world of interactive experiences we call games then Hatoful Boyfriend is something you'll want to check out.","September 5, 2014","true","14.5"," 192 of 224 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","192","224","0","5"

Why do the courses served in the school cafeteria have such morbid names?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/310080/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","Every once in a while, you run into something that challenges your expectations in ways you couldn’t have possibly expected. It wears the surface layer like a wolf in pigeon’s clothing, promising a few quick laughs through the trappings of a dolled up Visual Novel featuring an all-bird cast. And if you were to think of it as nothing more, what with all of the pink upholstery and hearts surrounding every element of the game’s outward presentation, then no one could blame you. But it also counts on this charade to drag the player into something beneath its skin. Hatoful Boyfriend is indeed a game about attending an all-bird high school as the only human in the academy. Yet, if one cares to look above, they’ll see a murder of crows circling overhead.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend will appear familiar to anyone who has played a Visual Novel or two. Once you’ve started a new game, it will ask for your name, introduce you to the majority of characters in a warm and friendly environment, and generally settle you into daily life at St. PigeoNation. Navigation works similarly to the thousands which have come before it. You progress forward by clicking or hitting enter as a dialog box completes to display the next one and advance the story, occasionally make a selection to build your stats or guide which bird you will chase for their affection. There’s also the option to save and load, as well as alter some basic settings, and a convenient fast-forward button in the upper corner, should you wish to skip over dialog you’ve already seen. And of course, branching paths which all lead to their own endings, all depending on choices you make.\n\nThe first trick Hatoful Boyfriend pulls out of its hat is how short a single run can last. The very first run I completed took me about an hour in total, which draws the player in, promising quick trips down alternative paths to collect all of the pigeon husbando~ hearts. This is exactly what it wants you to do. Only going through the game once wouldn’t allow for the seams in the feathered costume begin to show, so it pushes you towards seeking every han- er, wing, you possibly can. With every successful unique ending, you’re rewarded with curious snippets in the “archive” section in the main menu. Between the diary entries and newspaper clippings, it’s trying to warn you. Only, we’re too occupied as players staring at the plumes of tail feathers to see the forest for the trees.\n\nAnd it’s hard not to. The game’s use of standard visual novel/anime characterizations intelligently manipulates the player into wanting to chase down the Tsundere French transfer student, the plucky best friend you’ve known since you were both younger, the goth kid who speaks a language all his own, and even the creepy one who mutters statements under his breath that would be admissible evidence in court. Down each path, there’s plenty of humorous dialog and heart-tugging character development. The fact that they are all birds instead of humans or anime portraits just pulls the covers over your eyes when the real drama finally hits. They’re all entertainingly written, even if they stay extremely close to the tropes that birthed them. Let’s not allow the down comforter to be pulled over our eyes though. Several of the paths lean heavily into exposing Hatoful Boyfriend’s big secret, which is given to the player after certain endings have been cleared.\n\nBBL mode, known as “Bad Boys Love”, is what Hatoful Boyfriend is really building towards. All of the characters you meet, all of the interactions you have, they all lead down the path towards BBL mode’s story. To explain what exactly BBL is would be to spoil the true meat and potatoes of the game, and thus I can’t in good conscience actually explain it to you. Even if I did tell you, in great detail, what it is and what happens during it, there’s no way you’d actually believe me. It is a much bigger bird than the others, with secrets tucked between every feather. I’ve seen many reviews not even mention it in fear of spoiling it but I feel as though that isn’t enough to truly entice someone into playing the game. Much like Hatoful Boyfriend’s tricks, I have spent most of this review building up to BBL mode simply to get you interested in what lies beyond that cage door. In order for you to discover the truth, however, you’ll have to spread your wings on your own.\n\nIt might just be because I let my guard down from the pigeon-centric cast but Hatoful Boyfriend left me feeling shaken. What I’d gone through was both hilarious and frightening at the same time. Just keep your wits about you, reinforce your constitution, and carve it into your soul. Hatoful Boyfriend is not just a dating sim where your boyfriends all have winged limbs and beaks. It’s an example of playing to the strengths and comforts of a genre while turning convention on its head to have the stork deliver a story so full of twists that it took me 3 sheets of paper and small handwriting to keep track of it all.\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I mean, really, who seriously buys a PIGEON DATING SIM? I thought this would just be a lighthearted, funny game I could play for some kicks and giggles. Don't get me wrong, the actual romance storylines were pretty hilarious in nature, like the part in Ryota's romance where you get a peek at his job (if you've played the game you'll know what I'm talking about).\n\nHonestly, I wasn't expecting much from this though besides the joke about it being a pigeon dating sim... until I got to the BBL storyline. Without spoiling anything, let me just say the BBL storyline/ending has nothing to do with romance. It gives you a huge insight on all the characters, their pasts, and how they're all connected. It's rather long compared to just romancing one of your bird companions, but well worth playing through. The BBL storyline/ending does not give you much choice options and is more like a visual novel, but I really appreciated how the developer chose to make it. For me, it turned this simple pigeon dating sim into something far more complicated and intriguing. It is also the reason that this game has become one of my favorite games I've played in a long while.\n\nI give this game a 10/10 purely for the BBL storyline/ending.\n\n11/10 for being a pigeon dating sim :p","October 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","62","73","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammwich/recommended/310080/","sammwich","sammwich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammwich/","141 products in account","I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed the game in its entirety.  This game has two distinct parts, the dating sim and the Bad Boys Love secret route unlocked by romancing every bird possible.\n\nThe first part is simply too short to be entertaining.  Any route can be read in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between routes, including sections that have no effect on the particular route you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed.  This also caused me to inadvertantly skip content I hadn't read before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of route.  There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling Okosan "convenience store" or "grocery store" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.\n\nConsequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a route.  By the time you finish a route, you feel like you were merely introduced to the character.  Picking routes are also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various birds, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired bird is necessary to romance them.  The routes I enjoyed most, Okosan, Shuu, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball.  For a game that is billed as a comedy, most routes utilize stereotypical melodrama.  Bird puns and pop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Hatoful Boyfriend and at best you'll smirk a lot.\n\nThere is a very simple stat system, raised by choosing between three elective classes at regular intervals and in a couple of events that likewise present three choices which raise a stat.  The stats serve one purpose, which is to determine whether you get a normal ending or an extended ending.  Extended endings require you to raise one stat to maximum and reward you with an extra scene that was implied in the normal ending anyway.  Each ending has a separate achievement and you can't get both the normal ending and extended ending achievements in one go, so you have to play the same route twice in order to get all the achievements and unlock the Bad Boys Love extended ending.  I wasted part of my life to get the BBL extended ending and it was just as disappointing as the other extended endings.\n\nThe second part of the game, the Bad Boys Love secret route is much more interesting, but by the time I unlocked it I was already tired of the game.  I trudged on in hopes that it would be good and it was, kind of.  The game suddenly takes a much darker tone, reveals how the world came to be dominated by talking birds, and becomes a mystery story.  It seems interesting for a while, but as all the threads come together it becomes a soap opera for the ages.  Characters are revealed to be secret brothers, secret childhood friends, secret enemies, secret agents, secret terrorists, secret weapons, secretly superpowered, secretly alive, but, alas, there are no secret comas to complete the cliche pantheon.  I got the distinct impression that the first half of the game was written primarily to introduce the characters so that the meandering mysteries wouldn't simply baffle readers.\n\nAll in all, Hatoful Boyfriend wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale.  I will likely never read it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever.  As some consolation, the trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1.50.\n\nIf you don't mind a lot of repetition, love every visual novel no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game.  Otherwise, pick up just about any other visual novel on Steam.  Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Hatoful Boyfriend.\n\n4/10","November 5, 2014","false","8.0"," 167 of 249 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","167","249","11","0"

And it is glorious.\nHatoful Boyfriend is a PC visual novel about dating pigeons\n\nYou play as the lone human enrolled at the St. Pigeonation's Institute, a prestigious high school catering to a diverse population of roughly human-sized sentient birds.\n\nYour childhood best friend? A rock dove. Your maths teacher? A quail. The cool kid and resident school bad boy? A fantail pigeon who inexplicably also speaks in affected French on occasion.\n\n\nHatoful Boyfriend could have easily devolved into belabored bird jokes and puns for a cheap snicker, but instead opts for a surprisingly cohesive fiction and is all the more hilarious, heartwarming and disturbingly dark for it.\n\n\nAll of this is presented in the style of a visual novel as a parody of Japanese dating sim games.\n\nThat is to say, it offers a text-heavy branching storyline where the visuals mostly consist of a portrait of whichever character or characters you are talking to standing against some background scenery. It just so happens that in Hatoful Boyfriend, those character portraits are photographs of birds.\n\nThe thing is, it all actually kind of works.\nHatoful Boyfriend is a PC visual novel about dating pigeons\n\n\nThe absurd premise is treated with such absolute deadpan mundanity that it is hard not to be won over by its charm and sucked into the stories of your avian paramours.\n\nAnd the writing, despite abundant typos, is quite good when it comes to fleshing out your feathered fellows into characters who are worthy of intrigue even if not always worthy of a young girl's affection.\n\n\nThe absurd premise is treated with such absolute deadpan mundanity that it is hard not to be won over by its charm and sucked into the stories of your avian paramours.\n\n\nHatoful Boyfriend could have easily devolved into belabored bird jokes and puns for a cheap snicker, but instead opts for a surprisingly cohesive fiction and is all the more hilarious, heartwarming and disturbingly dark for it.\n\nThen things get weird. Yes, in a game about bird smooching, things had not yet gotten weird.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is designed to be played multiple times, encouraging you to experiment with branching plot threads in order to see every bird's romantic conclusion.\n\nJust as each subsequent playthrough starts to reach a Groundhog Day-like rhythm, Hatoful Boyfriend dives head first down a rabbit hole of plot that would make Hideo Kojima blush.\nHatoful Boyfriend is a PC visual novel about dating pigeons\n\n\nAnd while the sharp turn is unexpected, it is a turn that the game completely earns every step of the way thanks to the balanced tone of its writing.\n\nSadly, for all of Hatoful Boyfriend's character charm, the game struggles on a technical level. The typo-laden script has already been mentioned, but bears repeating because of the word jumbles that made it past Mediatonic and Devolver Digital's editors.\n\nThe crucial epilogue scene, for lack of a better term, also sees your ability to save the game limited to certain rooms without any explanation. It is still possible to save the game outside of these rooms, but loading a save file there causes the game to start up without dialog boxes and making progress impossible. There are no save issues during the main romance plotlines, though.\n\nYes, Hatoful Boyfriend is a dating game with a bird gimmick, and that alone will be enough to keep many players at arm's length. But to pigeonhole your time at the St. Pigeonation's Institute as a mere gimmick would be a grave misjudgment of a game that is far more delightful and unexpected than even its bizarre premise would suggest.","April 9","true","29.1"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","28","29","9","2"

Although it's hard to review this game without spoiling nearly everything I can truthfully tell you that it's well worth your time and that you'd be missing out if you passed Hatoful Boyfriend up.\n\nDespite each playthrough being short (around 45 minutes to an hour and a half per route) there are fourteen total endings, following the usual visual novel fashion of ranging from happy, lovely fairy tale-esque endings to extremely dark, likely traumatic endings. Things escalate QUICKLY. Eventually you'll reach the point where you can experience the true ending, which lasts a fair bit longer than usual and is actually an incredibly suspenseful and fascinating mystery/thriller. It alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nThe characters, although they're well.. birds are actually fairly well designed albeit a little basic due to the short, concise nature of the game itself. Artistically the characters are beautifully drawn and are, admittedly, very good looking.\n\nThe soundtrack is solid, fairly run-of-the-mill for the most part with a few tracks that really stand out.\n\nAll in all, despite being mediocre as far as visual novel gameplay and writing goes, the game's charm makes it entirely worthwhile, and hey, who doesn't want to tell their friends that they've been playing a bird dating simulator?","September 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"

You take on the role of the only human student at St. Pigeonations. Why are you the only human? This might seem like a silly joke to further enhance the meme factor of the game.

As of writing this, I've played through three characters. I enjoyed them all, however one in particular, Nageki, had me in tears by the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dersite/recommended/310080/","dersite","sapphire★fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dersite/","125 products in account","If you like visual novels and/or dating sims, or are willing to try playing one of those, I cannot recommend this game enough.\nI know this sounds weird. Dating pigeons? This is obviously some kinda joke that has no right costing as much as it does.\nBut I can guarantee that playing the old version of Hatoful Boyfriend back in 2012 was one of the best experiences in my life. I thought, "Hey, I like dating sims and the demo is free, the worst that can happen is that I'll hate it and delete it".\nNo, the worst that could happen was getting my heart crushed into a million pieces and falling in love with a game about birds. I mean, I don't even like birds!\n\nBut what this game really did was teach me that you can't judge a book (or a game) by its cover, that being open-minded and looking past your preconceptions is important, and that it's nice to try new things once in a while. You might be surprised by what you find.\nIf you think the very concept of this game isn't reason enough to give it a try, I'm not sure what to say. Come back and try again later?\n\nThis less-than-ten-bucks game that looked like nothing but a silly joke, with only one picture for every character, that used mostly free resources and stock images, managed to be so much more immersive and interesting than any other high-budget visual novel I've played.\nThe game does play like a parody of dating sims for at least half of the game, but even then, the characters are very fleshed out and well written, so if you're looking for something nice to break away from the generic high school girls with the same old no-plot dating experience, this is it.\nIf you're familiar with dating sims (or harem anime) you'll recognize the character types right away: you have the childhood friend, the teacher, the quiet one you're not sure how to approach, the ladies man, the spoiled one, and the list goes on. But there's a lot more to these characters than what you can see at first glance, and figuring out their stories and why's and how's is half the fun.\n\nThere are many funny moments, yes, oh so many. Hatoful Boyfriend fully embraces its weird concept, which makes it very enjoyable and fun to play. It's not just the birds - the player character is also a very funny character with quite a few gems in her dialogue.\nBut as you play you can easily notice there's so much more going on; there's always that hint of something deeper and darker on the back of every route. The game doesn't just take things for granted - most questions raised during the game will be answered. For example, why you're the only human in a school for birds. Yes, this is addressed in the game, and you might be quite surprised by the explanation.\nThe storytelling in this game is incredibly well done. It's not just what's expected of a visual novel, but a step above.\nThere's not much more I can say about it without getting into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nTL;DR: There's something for everyone in this game. If you're not afraid of new experiences, give it a try - you may be surprised by how easy it is to get absorbed into this game's odd, comical atmosphere. Once you're into it, you may want to go all the way in. The routes are short enough that you'll find the time to play more of them. If you don't like it, well, at least you can say you tried - brag to your friends about how you didn't survive the pigeon dating sim!","September 9, 2014","true","21.3"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

J-just give me a sec; it's not what it looks like! I got the game for t-the, um, story! Just listen, I'm going somewhere with this okay? *sigh* Okay, without further ado, I present to you...\n\nLASTING IMPRESSIONS\nHatoful Boyfriend\n\nGENRE\nDating Simulator/Visual Novel\n\nSTORY\nIn Hatoful Boyfriend you take the role of Hiyoko Tosaka, a human going to a prestigious highschool for birds. The school in question is St. Pigeonation’s, and it's known mostly for being the world's greatest gathering place for birds. You're a sophomore now, but you haven't done much to adjust to the atmosphere of Pigeonation's just yet. You're not entirely lost though, as you also have one of the several woo-able birds with you, your hardworking best friend Ryouta Kawara. Along with him you can also bond with narcoleptic math teacher Nanaki Kazuaki, bashful aristocrat Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, distant bookworm Fujishiro Nageki, suave ladies' man Sakazaki Yuuya, enigmatic doctor Iwamine Shuu, and hyperactive track star Okosan. With so much romance in the air, it's hard to believe the school holds so many dark secrets...\n\nGAMEPLAY\nEver read a book online? It's like that except every once in a while the books asks which choice you want to make. The choices you make will determine which bird you end up with, along with which ending you get for them. [Provided you don't get indesicive and go the way of the dodo, of course.] Each day you will be asked which class you want to take; this decides which trait will be leveled for that day. As previously mentioned, this will affect which ending you get for your desired bird.\n\nVISUALS\nNot much to say. It's pictures of birds with various backgrounds. The backgrounds look very nice, and there's quite a large amount of them. You also get a little end card pictures for your gallery after the end of each route. They're gosh darned cute.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nThe soundtrack is a delightful mix of royalty-free, classics, and original [I think?] tracks. All of them fit perfectly with any of the situations at hand. [Except maybe when Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy plays, that's always just plain silly.] There's many tracks from Kevin MacLoed and SENTIVE; the sexy, suave Dispersion Relation, Simply Blue, Daybreak [Personal favorite.], and tons of ones with gibberish for names. The collector's edition is worth is just for the beautiful OST.\n\nSEQUELS [SPOILERS]\nHatoful Boyfriend is the quintessential example of an idea that I've had for a while now; some games should never get sequels. While it's obvious that a bad game shouldn't deserve a sequel; I'm of the opinion that if a game is GOOD enough it shouldn't HAVE a sequel. If a game does all that it wishes, if a game provides a fulfilling, complete experience; it would be insulting to continue where the game left off. You may be thinking 'How does a game about dating birds provide a fulfilling experience?' I'll tell you; it's because the entire dating sim portion of the game is a mere facade. Once you've completed all possible routes at least once, you have the option to unlock BBL; a grim narrative that reveals the lore behind this game's world, the motivations and sins of characters, and completes all story arcs. The dating sim part of Hatoful Boyfriend is there simply to set up characters so that you know who this story is centered around. You know how they act by then, what their situations are, and this only helps to greatly strengthen the story. It's a fantastic conclusion, and it's one that left me speechless. Which brings us back to sequels. As I've said, a sequel to this game woud be a downright insult; a direct sequel that is. A direct sequel would be insulting, as the game would have nowhere to go with the current story; all arcs are completed. However, an indirect sequel would be a very, very smart idea if done correctly. By merely taking the characters we know and love and putting them in a different kind of story; the game has somewhere to go. Oh, and it did go somwhere, as an indirect sequel exists. [Holiday Star is its name if you were wondering. Not yet on steam though.]\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI dove this game. To say that this was a pheasant experience would be the understatement of the century. While at first glance, it may look like quite the bad egg, it's surely a narrative you'll never forget. I'm talon you, it's all here! Great soundtrack, amazing characters, bird puns; it's just a quail of a time! The price ain't nothin to go squawkin' about neither, no need to worry about some ludicrous bill. This is the defenition of the phrase 'more than meets the eye' and you'd have to be some hard boiled individual not to enjoy the humor at the least. I know I'm gushing, but I just can't recommend this enough! While you're at it, make sure to kill two birds with one stone and buy the collector's edition with it. The soundtrack alone makes it worth it. Alright, I've egged you on for far too much now, I'll sparrow you of any more. Hatoful Boyfriend has left a resounding lasting impression; it's not what the source material is, it's what you do with it that makes it a golden goose egg.

I'd laughed at the premise. "A DATING SIM ABOUT PIGEONS?! HA!"  I held out playing it for so long because it just seemed to hilarious to be true.  And then.... I downloaded the demo.  Let me tell you, at first, I was just, "Oh, this game is so cute!  Look at these adorable interactions!"  I completed the demo with Yuuya and was completely enamored.  I /needed/ the full version.  Enter Steam, releasing it in HD.\n\nDear Puddi, I never expected this game to give me what I got.  There's so much going on that you cannot glean from just playing one or two routes.  Play the whole thing.  Then play the BBL route and cry a million tears.  Cute game, yeah right.  More like vicious emotionally destructive game.  And I don't regret buying it--I regret laughing at it and putting it off as some dumb game.  Why there isn't more light on Hatoful is beyond me, because it's a beautiful game.  Does it have its errors?  Of course, doesn't every game?  It's well put together, though, and any errors in the script don't detract from the game (they may make you read the segment a few times, but it's definitely not game-breaking).  I've played a dating sim or two in my time, but this one is probably the best.  These are well-written characters, with feathers, of course.  It's easy to develop a connection with them because they are so well-written with hidden histories and pasts that you can find in Moa's mangas (available on Amazon!).\n\nTL;DR: If you have any preconceptions about this game, FORGET THEM.  Buy it and try it for yourself.  Don't watch someone else play it, and don't just brush it off as some dumb game, because it's definitely worth the hours it takes to play it fully and completely.\n\nHappy Birding ♥\n\nP.S.: If you buy Hatoful and you enjoy it and want to put yourself through additional pain and misery, there is a sequel called "Holiday Star," available in English (i.e.: you don't need to patch it) for about $3, if I remember right.  Just visit Moa's wordpress and you can get it!","October 29, 2014","true","10.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

There is a lot of enjoyable writing in this "game" but to me it is worth neither the time nor the money needed to uncover it.\n\nThe setting is hilariously absurd and the graphics are quite minimalistic (hand drawn backgrounds with a total of about a dozen photos of birds for the foreground). I quickly got used to both. What really spoils the experience for me is the horrible interface. This game is basically a novel where you click through lots of dialogue. One would assume that it provides a pleasant interface for that. This is not so:\n- The save function does not work when facing a decision - a natural point to save - and the saves seem to be broken at times.\n- There is much overlap between subsequent playthroughs so it is very tempting to use the fast forward function. However, that function does not stop when encountering those scarsely scattered bits of new dialogue. Also there is no rewind function so more often than not you miss some content. Why can't I just jump back and forth however I like? Even novels on paper have that feature.\n- I really miss an overview of the characters with full name that is always accessible. The game uses first names or nicknames most of the time but occasionally a character is refered to by last name and you only ever see these in the initial introduction.\n- Two of the endings have absolutely obscure trigger conditions and it took me a guide to get them.\n\nFinally, be aware what you're getting for the price: After watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots on the store page and you have seen a good part of the visual content. Apart from that it is a couple of thousand lines of entertaining text in a flawed "engine".","January 1, 2015","false","18.2"," 43 of 64 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","43","64","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattius/recommended/310080/","kattius","[nBn] Kat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattius/","317 products in account","Hatoful Boyfriend is a game where you go to bird school, which is for birds (and you, a human), and you date a bunch of different pigeons (or quails, or even a java sparrow) over a series of eight different routes. The game is relatively short in this aspect! I was surprised by how quickly I was getting through each route--even with fourteen endings to get (some sweet, some sad, some downright horrifying), the game itself feels surprisingly short.\n\nHowever, this is likely because completing specific routes unlocks the other "half" of the game, as such--a more straight-up visual novel that reveals the secrets behind St. PigeoNation's (the school that you attend) and exemplifies some pretty excellent worldbuilding for what, on the surface, appears to be a game about dating birds. It also delves further into the backgrounds of each of the main characters and will emotionally destroy you.\n\nThe game has a few typos and questionably built sentences, but it's overall an enjoyable playing experience. The background art is pretty nice to look at and some of the music is so great I sort of regret not buying the collector's edition to get the soundtrack.\n\n10/10, would let pigeons emotionally destroy me again.","September 5, 2014","true","10.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","3"

You can even get yourself a birdy boyfriend! There's Ryouta the childhood friend, Sakuya the fancypants, Yuuya the ladies man, and many more amazing avians. It plays out like a regular otome/visual novel does, read the text and make some choices. I bet you're thinking "omg so random, dating pigeons lol", and that's a natural response. But if you were to look up the definition of "don't judge a book by its cover", I'm pretty sure there would be a picture of Hatoful Boyfriend there.\n\nYou see, the pigeon dating sim premise is just a cover for the real story. After you unlock certain endings with different birds, you can start a new game and the true story will reveal itself, aka the Hurtful Boyfriend (or Bad Boys Love) route. In BBL you will learn why Hiyoko is the only human at the pigeon school, why the pigeons can talk, why she needs to form a bond with the birds, and much more. I can only say so much without spoiling it, but be prepared for a mental meltdown. It is filled with drama, tragedy and unsettling content. After seeing certain endings in the dating sim part, you'll probably be thinking "well, I've already seen some disturbing stuff... This will be a piece of cake". LOL NOPE. The dating sim endings are nothing compared to the true BBL route.\n\nTo put it simply, this game is like one of those sweet & sour candies; it looks and tastes sweet on the outside, but once you delve deeper in you'll reel back in shock and wonder wtf happened to the sugary outer shell.","September 8, 2014","true","8.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

Everyone just needs a shoulder to lean on, or an open ear to whisper their darkest secrets to. That's all anyone really wants. Even the ones that don't seem like they want love, they're the ones that need it the most.\n\n\nSome people find love in family, or camaraderie. Some people find it in romance, or art. Some might find it at the bottom of a family-size bag of Cheetos while they jack off to pictures of girls with tails. Hey, everyone has their thing. Everyone is entitled to their own form of love. Unless they're humping their dog or their child, in which case it's illegal and they can find love in a prison shower.\n\n\nPeople can find love everywhere and anywhere. Life finds a way. Even if you must go beyond your comfort zone. Beyond your race, your culture, and your people. Love knows no limits. Not even the sky. Because who wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ a bird?\n\n\nI know I sure would. And if you don't think you're up to it, you haven't played this masterpiece yet. This isn't just a game. It's a journey. A life-changing experience. Prepare to have your eyes opened to the truth.\n\n\nHatoful Boyfriend actually falls under the category of visual novel, as it's a Japanese otome game. Otome is Japanese for sausage fest. You're playing a girl getting aggressively humped by every guy in the immediate vicinity. Which, in this case, are all birds. And you get to make the exciting choices that will determine not only who's eggs you'll be laying, but the fate of the world as we know it.\n\n\nHatoful Boyfriend was originally developed for the PC in 2011, later seeing multiple rereleases and upgrades before getting an HD remaster that released on Steam, PS4, and PS Vita.\n\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is, simply by existing, worth checking out. No where else can you experience the excitement of being the only human girl at an all-birds high school. It's the only of its kind, and simply the premise itself should warrant at least a single playthrough.\n\n\nNot only is it relevant simply because of its premise, but it also works rather well simply on its premise alone. If you're picking it up simply because "LOOK, BIRDS" you'll get exactly what you're looking for. It's wacky, zany, kooky bird fun. Good stuff.\n\n\nBut underneath that simple premise, a surprising amount of depth is layered. Spoiler alert, dating birds at an all-birds school is not something people usually do. Usually. It's not quite a mainstream way of life yet, but we're rallying for our lifestyle to be recognized by the masses. Someday, human-bird relationships might be accepted. Birds don't even have access to public schooling yet, so we have a ways to go.\n\n\nShockingly, Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody dating sim. A joke game of sorts, satirizing the otome genre. All of the cliches, all of the character stereotypes, they're all here. You can expect all of basics to be here. Maid costumes and all. It's tasteful satire, not in an overbearing "LOOK GUYS WE'RE MAKING JOKES HERE" kind of way. The writing is hilarious, and carries a sort of ironic whimsy to it. It's fully aware of its nature, but runs with it regardless. It is a visual novel, which means reading, which means no this is not an action game or anything vigorous like that. Unless you wanna dip your little parakeet perch in honey and bird seed so you can stick it through the bars of grandma's lovebird cage while you play. Those HD character portraits are pretty feathery.\n\n\nIt's not only poking fun at otome visual novels, it's in fact written well enough to be a competent example of the genre that it's making a mockery of. The characters are interesting and compelling in their own right, even if they are just caricatures of otome stereotypes given bird form. They're fleshed out with a surprising amount of detail, given that the nature of the game didn't require much to begin with. Just "look, they're birds that you can date, this one is the jock bird and this one is the nerd bird" would have sold just as well.\n\n\nIf you happen to fall in love with the excellently written birds and words, a lot is in store for you. They've done a beyond fantastic job of rewarding the player for dedication. As a dating sim should, there are multiple endings. At least one for each character, and sometimes two. One "true ending" should you flawlessly woo them, and the just okay ending. Where you confess your love and they say "thanks". Going the extra mile for more endings will reward you by unlocking even more endings. Better endings.\n\n\nAnd should you stick around long enough for every single ending, you will be generously rewarded with the best part of the game. There's a lot of tough choices to make, but if you make them all it will be so worth it.\n\n\nFantastic writing, characters, atmosphere, and a stunning amount of depth and meaning really make Hatoful stand out among other visual novel games. But it's not without issues, though they're more to blame of the genre itself than anything else.\n\n\nAfter you've played through the game for the first time, regardless of which bird you hope to woo, much of the game remains the same. You'll be going to the same classes, seeing a lot of similar dialogue, and riding the fast-forward text button a ton. That's the biggest flaw with the game.\n\n\nThe other being, as I mentioned, the game rewarding people that stick through the game until the very end. Because it's a really big reward. Like, possibly the size of the rest of the game itself in its entirety. I can totally understand why they did it, because the reward itself doesn't carry quite the same impact and meaning until you've played through every ending. It's a steep hill to climb, with a pay-off to match.\n\n\nTo go any further would spoil just how perfect the ending is, but it stays true to its absurdity all the way to the end. It honestly blew me away how much depth they put into it. It's really not a one-trick pigeon, as it might lead you to believe.\n\n\nPeople might dismiss it as "that weird bird game" or "creepy Japanese ♥♥♥♥" or "memes". They might play it purely for the "look at me lol I'm so random" factor, or the jack off to those luscious, feathery bodies. But you realize you're dismissing, stereotyping, and fetishizing a way of life. There's more to it than that. There's depth here. We're more than a stereotype, and I'm tired of needing to hide who I am.\n\n\nEducate yourself, open your mind, and accept that some people have a different lifestyle than you. Some people want to have a nice family with kids in a suburban house. They want that white picket fence life. And some people, they really like birds. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And if you think there is, I think you need to check your privilege. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","March 28","true","10.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","11","12","5","0"

It is actually a parody of visual novels, with the classic character archetypes you'd expect in a school setting in an anime/visual novel: the childhood friend, the snob rich guy, the athletic guy...\nWhat differentiates it from other visual novels is, of course, the fact that these characters are all birds. That makes many normal situations inherently hilarious. However, do not dismiss it as just a comedy game. Beneath all the "haha, birds" is a strangely compelling and engrossing story. There's a surprising attention to detail, from the random bird facts it throws out sometimes to the well-thought-out world full of interesting characters.\nI have few complaints about the game, but the main one would be the lack of an "auto-skip only seen text" option. To get all the endings you need to replay the game multiple times, which is immensely helped by the auto-skip button. However, the auto-skip will also happily skip over unseen content if you let it be. That can lead to missing certain scenes.\nStill, I really like this game. It was far, far better than what I expected and is probably one of the best visual novels I have ever played. I also hate it. Because now nobody will believe me when I say that a game about birds is so good.","February 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","1"

No one takes it seriously at first glance, but they /learn/. It's a carefree experience where you pursue a pigeon boy of your choice and everything is sunshine and rainbows.

But I don't know why I've put in my head that maybe the character was dreaming. She wasn't at all. Nope, you're living with birds that developed their brains to the points that they do what a human can do. Being the only human into a prestigious school, how will your girl choose her life?\n\nBecause there is some romance in it but also humor (with San's quest for pudding) or horror (Shuu's human portrait never gave me a hint about his... destructive personality). Anyway, if you can't "blend" with your birdie, you're dead. Yes. You're being killed. Well, it's the bad ending. But between staying and living with birds like San, Sakuya or Ryouta or living the way of the sparrow with the only female bird or asking yourself why you're following Anghel into a surnatural plot and many others...\n\nAnyway, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fresh game: as not everything is revolving about dating, as there is mysteries too and with all the humor inside... Even the characteristics are minimal: wisdom, charisma or vitality. The graphics are also colorful and as the characters are birds... they're just good pictures. The soundtrack is also good: I never imagined a Christmas-themed horror tune for the doctor....\n\nBut I do think that the best story inside is the hidden one, where you're investigating a real mystery inside. It was really elaborate and you see that Hatoful Universe is more complex than what you could have imagined.\n\nI don't regret to have changed my mind about this game.

Especially if you are not into otome specifically, but are just interested in a very intriguing and fascinating story. Make sure to finish all story lines to understand the depth of the VN.

This game is seriously by far one of the most rollercoaster-y experiences I've ever had.\n\nI'll admit, I bought this game because I thought it was a joke of a game; you start off by dating a menagerie of birds, all with differing personalities and different endings. Some are pure humor, others are tinged with sadness, and still others will make you question what the hell you just played (and even then, there's two ways you could go with this). I had some knowledge of the backstory beforehand, but I wasn't prepared for what came next.\n\nThe endgame takes the main game's rollercoaster of feels and turns it up to 11. Once a happy, satirical dating simulator, the game shifts to a murder mystery with one simple stroke. Over three hours worth of dialogue to digest, and over three hours of sheer emotional WTF; springboarding from utter despair to stifling a giggle at Okosan's antics is a bit jarring, but the game pulls it off rather well.\n\nAnd the true ending?\nIf people take this review seriously and get the game, I just gotta say that it is by far one of the most touching endings I've experienced.\n\nIf nothing else, this game should be played JUST because of the endgame. The main game is a comedic and incredibly well-constructed setup to a tragic, emotionally charged ending that's satisfying in its own way. I completely, 100 percent recommend Hatoful Boyfriend as a game that everyone should experience in their life, as soon as possible.\n\nps yuuya best birb","April 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","5"

And, on its surface at least, Hatoful Boyfriend is a shallow dating sim where the human main character is enrolled at St. PigeoNation's, a school for pigeons. She takes classes, she goes to festivals, and she romances and falls in love with various species of birds. However, Hatoful Boyfriend's stereotypical high school romance exterior is only an entertaining and light-hearted charade that covers up a plot full of politics, intrigue, mystery, and sorrow.\n\nThe first half of Hatoful Boyfriend is quirky and humorous, filled with various pop culture jokes and absurd situations. Players find themselves romancing one of several standard character archetypes: the childhood best friend, the lazy professor, the haughty aristocrat, the womanizing jock, the bullied library nerd, and so on. The scenarios are cute and heart-warming, with each character having their own separate little storyline. Every short playthrough of the game—which frequently take under an hour even if you read all of the text—ends with a primarily sappy romantic ending.\n\nAs players go through multiple playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend, however, a more insidious underlying plot is slowly revealed. Every romantic plot line will unveil more pieces of St. PigeoNation's dark history and the tragic cast of characters that attend classes there. These pieces on their own add spice to an otherwise bland dating sim that seems to cash in on its unique and somewhat ridiculous premise of a human girl dating pigeons. And, if one were to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a couple of playthroughs, that would be the feeling that one would be left with: Hatoful Boyfriend is an amusing dating game to spend an afternoon on, but nothing remarkable.\n\nHowever, players that choose to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a few short playthroughs are missing out on the part of Hatoful Boyfriend that makes it an excellent game. If the first thirteen playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend are an amusing way to pass an afternoon, then the last playthrough is a gut-wrenching ride through a twisting plot that ties together everything the player has done up to that point. The short of it is this: this isn't just a game that you should play, it's a game that you should strive to complete 100% of the way.","September 7, 2014","true","8.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Therefore, I haven't got through all of the endings because it felt unnecessary grindy and repetitive.

The decisions you get to make are not all that interesting.\nOnly a minority of the text is different between the various non-secret paths. The majority is exactly the same, so you end up seeing the same text repeatedly.\nThe UI lacks the features one would expect from a game in this genre, and generally seems a bit shoddy. You can't save at decision points. There's no way to easily skip over the text you've already seen to get to the new stuff, which is especially egregious given how much duplication there is between paths. (You can fast-forward, but it skips right over the new text too.) And there's no way to review the dialogue if you accidentally miss a line.\nThere are some bugs. At one point, the game became unresponsive to input and I had to kill it, losing my progress since the last save. At another point, my saved game became corrupted and I had to start over. These were rare enough that they weren't really a problem, but they happened. Just save sometimes and use more than one slot.\nThe secret path - which is really the only reason to get this game - has effectively no interactivity. It's just an exercise in tapping the space bar and reading text for an hour. That said, it's at least fairly interesting text.The non-secret paths are short and the game as a whole will probably take about 7-10 hours if you have the patience to go through it all.\n\nAs somebody else said, it seems like the whole rest of the game is just a setup for the secret ending. It was something of a slog to get to that secret ending, but I did enjoy it once I got there. But I can't recommend this game at full price. You're basically paying for several hours of banal "play" in order to get the reward of reading a non-interactive but fairly interesting short story. For the money you can buy much better full-length books, and there are plenty of fascinating short stories to read online for free. But if you really want to read a short story about anthropomorphic pigeons, Hatoful Boyfriend might be for you.","February 5, 2015","false","8.2"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","0"

If you have never touched any of the genre or are doubtful to try, let me give you a piece of advise. You can't really say this game has a high replayability value, but rather the replayability is the game! Gathering all the ends is just the way you go through an intro to all the characters, just to have the real story (BBL ending) unfold upon you, so don't trash it after the first try: if you plan to get to the credits and uninstall the game, don't even bother buying it. If you plan to actually read the dialogs... congratulations! You're gonna love it :D\n\nPros:\n- fresh new approach\n- awesome RP value!\n- nice music\n- hilarious gags\n- skip button for all those known bits\n\nCons:\n- stats values in this game have virtually no effect\n- main stories are rather short and dull compared to similar games\n- your input is rather limited so endings are rather easy to access, makes it too linear\n\n\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","7.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Compassionate, dramatic, this is writing that always knows when to take a moment for humor AND pathos. Let the deep and highly metaphoric story sink in over multiple playthroughs or you will be missing out on some of the best divergent storytelling of the generation.\n\nAs you click through interaction after interaction just know that others are out there are taking time to do the same. Slowly begin to realize that some people can be trusted. It was people that made this game, after all, people finally aware of the  consumer fatigue of space marines and dragons. You may never fully rehabilitate into a properly functioning member of human society by their standards but you understand, just as I understand, that it is people that we do NOT understand. Remember, birds can be trusted, birds always come back. Some people are meant to be with people, and others, like us, are just different. We may not have the shiniest of neck feathers and our ultimate failing is to be aware that we are not aware. But we have finally found somewhere we can live in peace.\n\nLet us never forget the healing power of columbidae society but let us always try to remember to wash our berries before we eat them. Our digestive and respiratory systems may be different but blood is pumped into the heart from the body through the veins, the blood then enters the right atrium, then gets transported through the right ventricle and then is moved to into the lungs and oxygenated just the same.\n\n"In some things they shame us, by and large. Once mated, they are wed for life, unless forcibly separated. When set to the task, such as a long race, they will persevere and endure through measures of hell that only the best of men will willingly undertake. It might be argued that they are simply, dumbly, following the programming of instinct, that they can do nothing differently.\nPerhaps that can be said of us as well."\n- Where Pigeons Go to Die.","September 4, 2014","true","21.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You can only play the true one after playing most of the others, but I suggest that you finish every other ending before tryin' the true one.\n\nAs the stories progress and you accomplish different endings, you'll learn a bit more about different characters. Their stories, their backgrounds, their aspirations and their wounds... They'll look just like real people and you'll start to love them. Bit by bit, the details of each bird story will form the background scenario for the true ending that's completely thrilling, gorgeous and unexpected. Get ready to shed a lot of tears.\n\nI recomend this masterpiece to every Visual Novel fan. Believe me or not, this game is much more than it looks like.","April 20","true","11.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Hatoful was bought for me by a close friend who thought that a bird dating simulator would be a nice joke gift for someone who likes birds so much. Initially, I believed this game would be funny and cute. I was very excited to play it, and the first few introductory pages in the game were hilarious. I absolutely loved it. What I did not expect, however, is that this game is an incredible source of mental and emotional trauma.

I didn't understand why it was $10 for a dating game about birds, so I never bothered with it at full price. Me and some friends had some laughs going through one of the endings and it wasn't touched much since.\n\nFast Forward to the 2015 Summer Sale.\n\nI bought 3 copies of Hatoful Boyfriend - again, on a huge sale. I'm the cheap friend - and gave two of the copies to friends, and saved one for myself to play for some small laughs. Get an ending or two, waste some time. But as I got more endings, I learned more and more about the world I was thrown into, and just how intriguing it was. And I learned more and more about the characters I'm around, and how everything fits together more than one would find in a simple dating simulator - human or otherwise.\n\nThree and a half hours later:\n\nI have gone through eight different endings. I have nearly cried twice, and completely ragequit once. I have been piecing the world together and it is an outstanding place. I have come to understand just why it is worth its full pricetag, and feel dirty having only paid a cut price for this.\n\nIn short, Hatoful Boyfriend is a top contender to being one of my favorite games ever.

However, the real depth of this game surfaces with each continual playthrough.  Something far more sinister is happening at St. Pigeonation's.  You will eventually find out the answer to almost any question you may have had when you first heard of the game.  Why is everyone a bird?  Why are you a human?  Who is the Hatoful Boyfriend?

That means the majority of the content is reading. If you dislike reading turn back now.\n\nAlright. For those of you still here yes this game is satire, but it can also take itself quite seriously. While playing this you have the amusing routes(which can overlap), the tear-jerking routes(which can overlap), the childhood friend route, the jerkwad routes, the senpai route, the sensei route, and the reformed thug/female route. Additionally there's the secret plot-heavy route that will not be spoken of for the sake of spoilers. The gameplay is much like you'd expect from a visual novel. Make a few choices. If you select the correct ones and have the proper stats congrats. You just landed yourself a good ending. Speaking of stats they aren't used as much as the other games of the same read-and-select format. An amusing game at the core for the most part.\n\nNow what this rerelease was mainly supposed to fix was the engine. You see the previous engine back before the steam version was riddled with bugs and made playing it rather difficult. While this engine does run much more smoothly than Famous Writer did it does, in fact, have some bugs too. There have been reports of freezing on a white screen during the loading process before getting to the menu, crashing when loading human portraits, and likely more that have yet to be reported. Thankfully these aren't as numerous as the previous iteration. Still annoying, but some have reported fixing it by restarting the game. As per the others... Well this is a custom engine. Perhaps there will be patches in the future to fix the problems.\n\nAs per double the original price... Moa used a lot of open sourse content to make the game as cheap as possible at first, and this remake gave the game its own look background-wise as well as replacing that outdated freeware engine. The music is the same and the birds are higher resolution, but more or less the same. That said some of the birds are higher resolution than the other birds.\n\nAll in all I still do recommend it since it is less likely to backfire on you than the original and does provide a good deal of amusement.\n\nEdit: It slipped my mind earlier, but the collector's edition does hold true on its claim. The original game is included if you feel like owning both renditions.","September 4, 2014","true","9.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was very surprised by the change in direction with the BBL ending but not in a bad way.\n\nIn the BBL ending, your choices have no consequences or really any effect on the story. This switches it from a dating sim to a visual novel experience. After spending x number of hours completing the dating sim endings, I enjoyed seeing the amount of thought put into each of the characters and their backstories. Even though some things weren't explained or expanded upon, I found it to be a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOkosan forever! <3","September 20, 2014","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Going into it you might think its just a weird Japanese visual novel about dating birds. And, well, it sort of is. But what you wouldn't know without playing it is just how much more there is to this game.\n\nThe vast amount of diversity speaks volumes of the effort put into making this game the experience that it is. Although it is classed as a dating sim, this is one of the few games that tackles many other genres, and actually does it well. Basically, each of the different characters' story lines you can follow are unique to one another. Each character has a very different personality and backstory, as well as their routes have their own uniqe themes and plots that other characters routes don't necessarily have a focus on. This is what makes this such a great game, because it makes you WANT to complete every route so you can learn the whole story, rather than making you feel like you have to suffer through several playthroughs of the same thing to get the end result. Each of the different characters stories are enjoyable and entertaing in their own unique way, be it a sweet romance, or a bone-chilling mystery, they are all very different.\n\nThen of course, there is the secret "true ending" story route, wheather it can be called that or not, it is one of the most fantastic works of story telling I have ever experienced in a visual novel. I'm not going to spoil anything, as it really should be played without any prior knowledge or spoilers, but I strongly encourage players to play through every possible story route even if some may be silly at times, as that's what gives this game its charm. Each one of the stories you can play through will entertain you with silly jokes, emotion evoking plots, or even suspensful and horrorific secrets. Then after all those memorable events, you will be able to enjoy yet another very unique, very interesting, and very well written and played out "true ending" scenario. I could talk for hours about how great all the individual routes and the overarching plots are, but it is truely something that is best left for you, the player, to discover by playing the game for yourselves.\n\nIf you havn't yet bought Hatoful Boyfriend, or are maybe considering the purchase but are unsure if you will enjoy it, then you have my reccomendation to buy and play this game, and  that it will be something that you'll be able to enjoy playing, and re-playing, for a very long time to come. For the amount of content this game has, it is definately worth buying. Through all of its silly laughs, its shocking secrets, and its heartbreaking emotional moments, Hatoful Boyfriend has become a personal favourite, and hopefully you will enjoy it too.","September 25, 2014","true","143.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, that's the case here as well but with pigeons. Or so it seems. But the story behind everything is simply stunning. I just couldn't stop playing - and crying.  Do yourself a favour and play it blindly (or use a spoiler-free guide for the routes), to gain the maximal feels destruction.

True, it looks like a simple joke aimed towards visual novels and the like, however that is not the case. This game has enough to crush a player's heart through various ways but can also reward you with happiness on some routes. All the same, this game is more than meets the eye. The images and art used is high quality as standard, although a couple of birds do seem a bit blurry and pixelated. The English translation has been done well and I have only noticed a couple of minor errors (or what seem like errors) on the BBL ending. This should not deter you from getting this seemingly innocent game and playing it yourself, as the gameplay is superb and of a high quality overall.\nIt was enough to make me cry a few times, and for my heart to swell quite a lot especially for one particular character (out of sadness).\nFinal rating - 9/10\nThis game is a lot less of a joke than the store page makes it out, so keep that in mind.","October 13, 2014","true","15.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a really dark and lengthy secret storyline titled "Bad Boy's Love" after romancing all pidgeons, which I haven't played yet, but will tonight.\n\nMy favorite way to play this dating sim is to get in a Skype call with myself and 3+ friends, enable Skype screen-sharing, have people voice act their own characters, and vote on decisions.\n\nIf you are one of those people who wants bird sex (you freak XD) just leave. There isn't any.\n\nPROS:\n-  Many storylines to take.\n-  I genuinely believe that this has a better story than the dull story of Skyrim. (sorry Bethesda.)\n-  Entertaining and funny diologue.\n-  Great for playing with friends.\n-  Great for YouTube (if anybody does let's-plays.)\n-  Each storyline (excluding secret ending Bad Boy's Love) is about an hour and 20 minutes in my experience, playing at a relaxed pace.\n\nCONS:\n- Some of the funniness (if that's a word) tends to go away after a few playthroughs.\n- Needs a lot more music tracks.\n- Playing the same beginnings and middles for different ends grows incredibly repetitive.\n- Holy sh!t the names are hard to pronounce (except some of the easy ones like Okosan and Azami.)","January 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/recommended/310080/","ssface","Super Shark Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/","285 products in account","The game is pretty entertaining because the writing is good and the idea of dating pigeons is funny.  The characters are great, all with distinct personalities, including the main character.  Unlike some other dating sims, it doesn't branch off into a separate route for each character you date --instead, the new stuff for each character is interspersed between scenes common to each character... expect to be hitting the skip button a lot.  The amount of new content for each character is pretty good, though.\n\nThe real meat of the game is when you unlock the final route after completing all the other routes.  To put this in perspective, there are 15 endings (not counting an epilogue).  I read all of the dialogue out loud with my friend, using the skip button for dialogue we already saw before.  It took 10 hours to do the 14 normal routes and 6 hours to do the final route alone-- that's how big the difference is.  So make sure you do the final route, since it's a huge amount of the game and it really ties everything together well.\n\nWhere the game fell short for me was in the implementation.  There were a number of annoying technical aspects that really detracted from the game.  One was the skip button, which sometimes failed to skip past old dialogue and would also skip past new dialogue.  Another big one was the save games, which do not work if you have the game installed somewhere other than your C drive-- a real annoyance with the really long final route.  And then there were just some small annoyances like unnecessary extra clicks (such as having to click twice before every choice), the slow speed of the scene transitions, and a ton of typos... which were actually kind of entertaining, but still.\n\nEven so, the game is worth playing.  It might not be the most polished VN you'll ever play, but it has some solid writing and is just a really fun experience.","April 21, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

True, it looks like a simple joke aimed towards visual novels and the like, however that is not the case. This game has enough to crush a player's heart through various ways but can also reward you with happiness on some routes. All the same, this game is more than meets the eye. The images and art used is high quality as standard, although a couple of birds do seem a bit blurry and pixelated. The English translation has been done well and I have only noticed a couple of minor errors (or what seem like errors) on the BBL ending. This should not deter you from getting this seemingly innocent game and playing it yourself, as the gameplay is superb and of a high quality overall.\nIt was enough to make me cry a few times, and for my heart to swell quite a lot especially for one particular character (out of sadness).\nFinal rating - 9/10\nThis game is a lot less of a joke than the store page makes it out, so keep that in mind.","October 13, 2014","true","15.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And it definitely is that, at first. But keep playing, and it becomes much, MUCH more.

I'll just say this: there's something like 8 different birds you can romance. Keep re-playing the game until you've gotten the ending for each of them (each playthrough lasts about an hour, but you can fast-forward through bits you've already seen before). Then fire it up again, and get ready for a ride......\n\n(I realize I haven't reviewed the actual game here.

Based on forums, this game may trigger high level of depression called "Avatar Effect" play it on your own risk!\n\nYou think that birds are dumb primitive creatures? Not true! For example, pigeons are learning and teaching matematics and music, they have complex relationships with each other. I had problems with japanese names. As a mid-European kid, i fell far from the manga genre, grew up on american comics and though i have my own manga favourites, i was not able to get too close enough to the genre. I remember the great battles of Yu Yu Hakusho with Yusuke Urameshi and Kazuma Kuwabara, the midriff tearing brilliant humorous moments of Slayers with Lina Inverse and Gourry Gabriev, or DBZ's Shongoku, before it was banned from my country. But that's it.\n\nI read about Hatoful Boyfriend on hungarian gaming sites, there are no animal pornography, and too much foolish detailed conversations bout it, as they told. The protagonist is a human girl, the other actors are mostly male pigeons, they have been introduced themselves early at the story. Many lives, many fates, player deciding what will happen next, there are silly and realistic, serious topics too, it depends on us what kind of ending we get. There are a lot, so the re-playability of the game is high, it is like visiting parallel dimensions. The characters are very well personalized and all different lovely fellas, i don't want to spolier anything so i better stop here.\nThe music is very great, reminding me for the music of early Sims games, relaxing, there are 1-2 rock tracks too, reflecting for the current topic's mood.\nLocations are drawn, with bird photos, and some drawn manga characters if we enable them at start.\n\nThis product is not that i've imagined based on the media, it is much, much more!

It features a human girl in second year of high school attending a prestigious St. Pigeonation's Institute, which before would only have birds. As the only human in the school the protagonist attempts to find love among the winged animals, similar to dating sims.\n\nAt first I was very annoyed how shallow the game seemed. Days went too fast like you weren't attending the school or trying to socialize with the characters you were supposed to fall in love it. You couldn't get to know the characters much deeper and there weren't many choices for practically anything. And even if  it took me almost 10 hours to get all the endings, one storyline with one character doesn't last much longer than one hour so in that aspect I would call it a short game. I was annoyed because I thought HB had only received such a high fame status and a positive rating due to some YouTubers playing it. You know those games that just get famous because reasons and in reality there's not much meat in them? I was so sure Hatoful Boyfriend was one of them and so I started to feel resentment towards it.\n\nThat was until in my playthrough, the path I chose with the character I could relate the most, a sad plot twist happened. And it blew me away. I kept playing and thinking "Wait a minute. This game is supposed to be goofy and funny with its pigeons and bird references. This can't happen. This can't be sad. What is going on!?" And as I kept going and choosing different storylines and different characters to romance, more and more twists and turns were thrown at me. So many twists that they could put M. Night Shyamalan to shame.\n\nAnd I started to realize everything was not so superficial as I thought it was. Presumably the creator first meant HB to be an April Fool's joke but as it started to gain attention she began to properly work on the game. And to quote her she wanted "to create something that seems ridiculous and crazy at first glance, but that once you look into the world, you would fall into the depth". This is what best describes Hatoful Boyfriend.\n\nAnd so it is unfortunate the best part of the game only comes after playing halfway through. It is a special kind of ending which you can only unlock after going through multiple other endings. This Bad Boys Love ending, as it is called, differs by being much more lengthy than the others (about the length of one storyline with one character if not even more) and having a different protagonist. From there on out the game changes from a comedic, teenage school life to a full-on murder-mystery solving. That ending is what makes everything better by having many heartfelt and grim moments which can also make you like a character you didn't like before and vice versa. It was at that point when I started to enjoy myself.\n\nLikewise there are bits and pieces of the whole plot sprinkled all over which you can only find if you go through everything. Alone they won't make much sense but once you find everything and put the pieces together, things start to take shape. That student ID  card you found on the floor and handed to a teacher? You couldn't understand it at the time but in the next storyline you definitely would. Or the suspicious conversation between two individuals? The strange death of one gloomy student? Everything is linked somehow.\n\nOf course not everything is perfect in the paradise. There is a huge saving/loading bug, the latter one negatively affecting me. I could save but I couldn't load my saves (evidently rendering saving pointless) so every time I started a new game I would have to play it through in one sitting. And some people have had trouble saving their games. It baffles me glitches so bad have been since the release yet nothing has been done to fix them.\n\nSteam only allows you to either recommend or not recommend a game so I'm forced to pick one of them. I have very mixed feelings about Hatoful Boyfriend. In the end it surprised me in a good way but there are things which got in the way of me liking it too much. It is the first half which sets the whole game back for me. If it all had been something along the lines of the extended BBL ending with comedic reliefs in-between, I'm sure it would have been that much better. And though there is some deep content to find within, you have to keep digging quite a while to find it. In order to witness the conversations you couldn't see before and unlock rest of the endings, you have to repeat much of the gameplay you already went through. This repetitiveness is tiring and dull.\n\nIt isn't a bad game, but in my eyes it isn't so good to warrant a positive rating.\n\nPros:- Storylines are intertwined cleverly\n- Numerous great plot twists\n- Second half of the game (aka BBL ending)\n\nCons:- Save/load bug\n- First half of the game (before BBL ending)\n- Repetition of gameplay to get to good parts\n\nPersonal Rating: 3/5 - Mixed","May 3","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It challenges the social standings of humans and their place in the world - the world that humans have altered themselves for the greater good, only to have their creations turn against them. It touches upon the existance of the supernatural, and the consequences of mingling with fate and the higher order. The juxtaposition between the birds and the humans is highlighted as you interact with key characters. You will have to face with and debate against (or for) political issues that will directly affect your well-being. The more you, a human, gets involved into these affairs, the more you unravel about the hidden mystery behind St. PigeoNation Institute of Littledove Hachiman City.\n\nWould definitely recommend - you will not be disappointed.\n","June 25, 2015","true","60.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I was embarrassed and didn't want to admit to even my closest friends that I was won over by this charming game.\n\nBut then I couldn't stop telling them about it. I wanted to tell the whole world what a twisted surprise Hatoful Boyfriend turned out to be. Yes, of course it's ridiculous, of course you can't take it TOO seriously, but it is also so much deeper than just a "bird dating sim." It commanded all my attention and free time over the course of four days until I was finally able to finish it. I obviously can't say too much without spoiling it (as anyone who's played knows) but if you're going to set aside reservations for only one game in your life, make it this one.","September 12, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's difficult to classify this game as something other than a dating sim, because it can become more than that depending on your choices. It's also very difficult to discuss this game without resorting to "omg look at this wacky game! It's soooooooo random! XD" Don't let the Pewdiepie hype portrayed by many streamers deter you from even glancing at this due to your disgust. Those people are the same idiots that also scream, "Dark Souls is too hard! Golly, this is so epic!"\n\nI can say, first and foremost, that this is a visual novel. Regardless of sub-genre, that's what this boils down to.\n\nIt's a very intriguing visual novel. It performs under the guise of a classic Japanese high school dating sim while donning the peculiar gimmick of having birds for the school's students. While this may sound extremely gimmicky, and I won't lie, it is. That is not necessarily a bad thing though! This allows for a different kind of exploration into one's feelings. Can you get emotionally attatched to a bird to some degree? You would not think so, but these birds are essentially people-type characters. They talk, have inner/outter conflicts, and even run in marathons. I can also imagine the same could happen if it was a high school of Super Robots, but it's not. That would be an awesome game. We need that to be on Steam right now.\n\nIf you're still interested at this point you'd might as well start reading further into this. Let's face it; if you're interested in a dating sim with birds, then you probably have few other things to entertain you at this point in terms of modern gaming.\n\nWould I even like a dating sim with birds where I would not be able to even date females? That's how I felt, but I was tired of the typical tropes of AAA games and decided that I would instead let myself fall victim to the cliches of standardized Japanese gaming this time around. I was absolutely correct in the aspect of dating sim cliches remaining intact, but I was not prepared for the fact that there are routes that rip the afforementioned apart. If you're reading through Fate/Stay Night, then of course you'd expect things to become intense and heavy. When you play an average dating sim you're just expecting two people to get together and happy things ensue with a nice ending, save for School Days. That was just depressing on about every level.\n\nYou won't expect things once they hit you in Hatoful Boyfriend, and that is the true glory of the writing in this game. It just happens to be covered in a feathery layer topped with a beak.\n\nI fully recommend this title to visual novel enthusiasts, or anyone who just wants to dive into the visual novel genre for their first time. With a title like this being easily accessible to a North American audience on Steam, there has never been a better time to start!","September 12, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes all your expectations about this game and blows them completely away, and no one really can say much about it without spoiling the entire thing. It really does deserve that 'psychological horror' tag! It's really well-written and miiiiight even make you forget you're empathizing with a bunch of birds. ;v","September 7, 2014","true","24.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"A dating sim, but all the boys are pigeons?" I thought, "Sounds incredible, I have to play." And sure enough, it was incredible. Just not in the way I expected.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is funny, it's true, it has a very funny and quirky sense of humor that will be incredibly enjoyable for anyone who enjoys puns or jokes that almost slip under your radar, but when you catch them make you snort with amusment. Oh, and the fact that your character, as the only human in a school full of pigeons, is treated in the same stereotypical way that a singular intellegent bird would probably be treated if the situation was reversed ("stereotypical" human/primate behavior, constant references to her species in both jokes and regular conversation, she literally lives in a cave), is very funny as well. However, the real charm of Hatoful Boyfriend is when it is not being funny. This game, at times, is much more serious than you would think possible, even heartwrenching and disturbing. This game will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will constantly shock you (assuming you manage to avoid spoilers before playing, which is very recommended as the shock is part of the game's charm) and keep you interested and wanting to play all the way to the end.\n\nI pirated this game years ago expecting a joke game and now I've bought the $15 special edition on steam because I believe that this game absolutely deserves every penny. This game has made such a big impact on me, it is easily one of the best visual novel-type games that I have ever played and I would absolutely reccommend it to anyone and everyone with the attention span for visual novels. Even if you don't think you have the attention span, watch a playthrough or try it out somehow because this is one game that really should not be missed. Also I just want to mention that the music is incredible.\n\ntl;dr\nCome for the pigeons, stay for the amazing story and shocking turns (and the great bgm).","September 23, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was embarrassed and didn't want to admit to even my closest friends that I was won over by this charming game.\n\nBut then I couldn't stop telling them about it. I wanted to tell the whole world what a twisted surprise Hatoful Boyfriend turned out to be. Yes, of course it's ridiculous, of course you can't take it TOO seriously, but it is also so much deeper than just a "bird dating sim." It commanded all my attention and free time over the course of four days until I was finally able to finish it.

After binge playing this game with all my free time for about 4 days, I can honestly say that this may be in my top 3 games for this year. This game actually has a serious story. One that you need to get all of the endings to put together and one that will make you step away from the keyboard after you're done and say "What the hell just happened?" This game is amazing. I never once thought I would be attached to any of these characters but there were times when I legitimately almost teared up. This game is funny. It's sad. It's downright tragic. You are doing yourself a disservice by not picking up this game. And you are doing yourself a bigger disservice if you already have it, got one ending, and dismissed it.

I love almost everything about their writing, the nature of the narrative slowly unfolding non-linearly with each replay, and the exploration of character and testing the player's understanding of character.\n\nI love also how it critically looks at various staples of love-interests in romance in a way that romance novels rarely do. We have more than just the standard alpha-male.\n\nWhat I don't like about dating sims is that I have yet to find one which lets me just skip (not fast-forward - SKIP) scenes I've seen before and the sheer amount of grinding involved in stat building. Sometimes I want to do-away with stat-building completely and take a page out of Moacube's book where you have other types of decisions which advance plot define your character's character and "stats".\n\nHatoful tries to make stat building more connected to plot by actually providing you with a unique scene along with each stat building time point. However, I still found the stat building unecessary. I also found the needing to romance a character in two different ways in order to unlock the epilogue really...arduously boring.\n\nThat said, Hatoful Boyfriend improves on a lot of other dating sim mechanics and really invests in taking the player's preconceptions of whimsy and istead offers a genuinely good science fiction story. There is a lot of depth in this game should you commit to seeking it and a lot of heart.\n\nI still await the day where we work towards dating sims that remove grinding, whether that's re-doing vast stretches of story to get to new scenes or improve (or do away with) the stat building. Sadly, Hatoful Boyfriend still suffers from both, though to a lesser extent than the average dating sim. This detracted from my experience. I still heartily recommend this game as amongst one of the top games you can play in its genre.

Please hear me out first before you call me crazy! (Warning: spoilers ahead) I believe you are supposed to follow the romances in the order of the achievement list to maximise the effect.\n\nIt starts out as what you'd expect: a simple dating sim where you can romance birds. But as you go along, the supernatural becomes more evident, with ghosts and weird pudding gods (???) and fallen angels and reincarnations and stuff. And then you get to the highlight of the game. The BBL ending. Whereas the 14 other endings took me about five to six hours to complete, I was staring at my screen for like three hours for this, and I couldn't stop no matter how much my eyes hurt. It's madness.\n\nWhat started as a cute bird romance sim became some weird combination of horror and mystery, with a conspiracy that tied practically every single main character to each other in some way or other. The hints have been there all along, even in the "normal" romance routes, but after playing this you'll understand everything, and your mind will be blown away.\n\nOn a sidenote, I wonder what kind of drugs the makers had to take to think of this kind of ♥♥♥♥.\n\n10/10 would rather play Hatoful Boyfriend BBL ending than watch/read Game of Thrones.","December 5, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I expected a good deal of WTF, and got a lot more than I bargained for!  I've never played a dating simulation before (it's not really my thing), so I can't measure Hatoful Boyfriend against other similar games.  However, I will honestly say that I have enjoyed the stories that unfold.  (I'll admit, tears were shed!)\n\nThe music and sound effects are mostly cheesy.  I thought the premise of dating birds was random and humourous, but to my surprise, the game finds a way to make it plausible.  There's an interesting, hidden underlying story that gradually gets revealed as you play through different birds' stories and endings.\n\nIn summary, I didn't know what to expect from Hatoful Boyfriend, but it surprised and delighted me.  It's no masterpiece, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing it.","September 10, 2015","true","28.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe that was a double plot twist because I really expected that the big revelation would have been, that he wasn't bad at all. Or something like that :D\n\nWhat happend in the after game was really mind blowing for me then. It was clear from the beginning that some endings are very special, coo coo pudding. But the fact there was a multiple hour long story that unlocks only after you have every ending - wow. It even explains every other ending/character story. (Hmm, except for pudding. But pudding is everything, the true meaning of life.)","June 18, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me tell you the tale of my experience with Hatoful Boyfriend.\n\nI bought this game during the Summer Sale of 2015 for around $2.50. The only real reason I did was because I'd told a friend of mine I would and I didn't really want to pay $10 for a game about dating pigeons. Anywho, after buying the game I started it up, figuring I'd play a route before my friend came to play it with me. I think I named myself Deez Nuts. Sometime in the beginning, before I began to romance a pigeon, I exited. I felt guilty for not waiting for my friend, though, so I quit.\n\nFastforward to a month or so later. I can't wait for this game anymore. No one else is using the computer and because my brothers are occupied with other things I've got the whole day to waste away on it. Nageki's route is the first I complete because he's a shota boy and he's tiny and quite.\n\n[SPOILERS START HERE]\nThis was a mistake. There is much more to Nageki- he is not just a tiny quite shota boy. He is a tiny quite shota ghost. And after you fall in love he disappears, because you helped him remember why he died. The first of many tears were spilled here.\n\nFiguring his route was the only one that invloved such an upsetting twist, I began to progress through the game. I wanted those achievments.\n\nNext up was Sakuya. Not super depressing this time, which was good. So, Yuuya's next.\n\nI made another mistake here. Lots of important plot was revealed in Yuuya's route, but honestly I can't remember it all.\n\nI played Okosan's route after Yuuya's. Very silly. It was exactly what I had expected of the game.\n\nRyouta's route. Oh man, Ryouta's route. I liked this bird from day one. But of course, like all anime best friends, there's more to it. His mom is dying. He's working so hard to pay for her medical bills. So hard. And she ends up dying anyway. The ending is upsetting, but very sweet nonetheless.\n\nMath teacher's is pretty average, if I remember right. I don't actually remember much about it, but I think we learn that his brother died long ago? I don't know.\n\nShuu's route was the worst of the main ones by far. It's as creepy as is to be expected, and then some. Of course, you die in both the ends, the true end being MUCH WORSE than the normal ending.\n\nI say main endings because there are EVEN MORE LAYERS to this game.\n\nAfter completing all the main routes, you unlock a special secret route called Bad Boys Love, also known as "Hurtful Boyfriend" and/or "BBL". This route made me feel such intense distress. It is the reason I have 12 hours on this game. There were multiple times I had to stop and take a moment to compose myself in this route. It is REALLY that upsetting. The worst thing is I still feel it. I think about it when I fall asleep, in the middle of class, during dinner, and I feel an emptiness in me that cannot be filled.\n\n[SPOILERS END HERE]\nI regret buying this game only because it has toyed with my emotions too much for it to be fixable. Years from now, when I'm married with two children and have a stable job, I will think of Hatoful Boyfriend. I will remember the emotions it made me feel. My children will ask me if I'm feeling alright. I will look out the window, a nostalgic gleam in my eyes, and I will tell them the tale of Hatoful Boyfriend. It is priced at $10 for a reason. It is worth those $10. It is even, dare I say, worth $15. Whatever you must pay, it is worth it.","July 2, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imkappastar/recommended/310080/","imkappastar","\psi(\alpha)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imkappastar/","109 products in account","Short Version / TL;DR\nHatoful Boyfriend is a fantastic dating sim. You might think the whole concept of a dating sim with birds as the characters a bit silly, but it has a story and characters that really pull you in. Plus, the extra storyline, Bad Boys Love AKA Hurtful Boyfriend, could be a short game of it's own.\nRating: Buy if you're interested in this kind of game, or if you want to try the genre out. If you're unsure, wait for a sale, you just might love it.\n\nLong VersionMight include small spoilers!\n\nCharacters\nThe characters are extremely well designed, in general. In the beggining you'll be introduced to a relatively small number of characters, which may be hard to remember, due to their names, which are Japanese names like Sakuya or Yuuya, but after your first playthrough you should become confortable with remembering some of their names.\nFor me, most characters are interesting, with the exception of Ryouta, who isn't as interesting, due to being the more normal out of the group, and because I find his backstory depends too much on his mother.\nCharacter Rating: 9/10\n\nStory\nThe story is absolutely amazing. With various ending, you'll be entertained for various hours. The story largely depends on what route you take. For example, San's story is mostly comical, but Nageki's is mysterious and a bit saddening. I haven't played through all of Bad Boys Love, but from the great part I've seen until now, it's extremely mysterious and depressing, and, as stated before, could be a game on it's own.\nStory Rating: 10/10\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are good for a game of this kind, the human counterparts are beautifully designed, and the backgrounds are generally well drawn. All I'd say bad about them is that the birds might not always be as high quality as the backgrounds, but don't come with expectations of AAA quality graphics.\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n\nMusic/Sound\nThe game has music that almost alwyas fits the situation, and can vary from the depressing tunes played all over the game, to San's cheerful theme, to Hurtful Boyfriend's frightening songs.\nMusic/Sound: 9/10\n\nFinal Rating:\nI think it's a must have for visual novel/dating sim fans. If you're unsure whether you'll like it or not, wait for it to go on sale, and pick it up then. Or offer it to a friend as a joke, and maybe he'll love it (like what hapenned to me!).\n","June 30, 2015","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love almost everything about their writing, the nature of the narrative slowly unfolding non-linearly with each replay, and the exploration of character and testing the player's understanding of character.\n\nI love also how it critically looks at various staples of love-interests in romance in a way that romance novels rarely do. We have more than just the standard alpha-male.\n\nWhat I don't like about dating sims is that I have yet to find one which lets me just skip (not fast-forward - SKIP) scenes I've seen before and the sheer amount of grinding involved in stat building. Sometimes I want to do-away with stat-building completely and take a page out of Moacube's book where you have other types of decisions which advance plot define your character's character and "stats".\n\nHatoful tries to make stat building more connected to plot by actually providing you with a unique scene along with each stat building time point. However, I still found the stat building unecessary. I also found the needing to romance a character in two different ways in order to unlock the epilogue really...arduously boring.\n\nThat said, Hatoful Boyfriend improves on a lot of other dating sim mechanics and really invests in taking the player's preconceptions of whimsy and istead offers a genuinely good science fiction story. There is a lot of depth in this game should you commit to seeking it and a lot of heart.\n\nI still await the day where we work towards dating sims that remove grinding, whether that's re-doing vast stretches of story to get to new scenes or improve (or do away with) the stat building. Sadly, Hatoful Boyfriend still suffers from both, though to a lesser extent than the average dating sim. This detracted from my experience. I still heartily recommend this game as amongst one of the top games you can play in its genre.

Make no mistake, it's very good: funny, heartfelt, and surprisingly engaging, it's just a very frustrating game to discuss in detail (and especially to recommend) since it has a lot of really important plot twists and rug-pull moments that can lose their edge if you've been spoiled to them beforehand. As such, it's kind of hard to review in-depth beyond a very generic "it's really good". Which it is, for what it's worth.\n\nIt's kind of a game you have to take in on good faith; if you've heard the game is good and want to check it out for yourself, or if you don't know anything about it but think the premise is ridiculous enough to want to experience it for a laugh, you should definitely trust your gut and pick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joga5000/recommended/310080/","Joga5000","Joga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joga5000/","784 products in account","This game is amazing. Admittedly, my experience with visual novels is a bit lacking (consisting mostly of Analogue: A Hate Story, Hate Plus, and various Twine games), but I have a feeling that Hatoful Boyfriend is probably not quite representative of a typical Japanese dating sim VN (and not just because of the birds).\n\nI don't want to spoil too much of the story, but it frequently veers pretty far off the beaten path. Japanese High school dating sim VNs have never really appealed to me too much as a general concept, but this game is much, much more than just a dating sim. The stories are wildly varied depending on your choices and what ending you're going for. There is thankfully a fast-forward button to get right to different choices to see how they play out, as well as ample save slots for saving before important choices.\n\nAnd I'd strongly recommend playing through every ending (don't be afraid to use a guide after your first playthrough). Each ending is interesting and varied on its own, but also because it unlocks a special epilogue story that's actually much longer than a normal playthrough. And the epilogue is definitely worth playing through - it gives a lot of background information on how the (evidently post-apocalyptic) society came about, and explains a lot of the backstories of the birds and the world you inhabit. It does drag on a bit near the end, but I'm really glad I played through to the end.\n\nIf you like visual novels you'll love this game. If you don't like visual novels you'll still love this game because it's hilarious and weird and delightful. It certainly delivers a silly tongue-in-cheek bird dating parody, but it's so much more than that. Buy it.","November 24, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pah, that's ridiculous!... is what you are probably thinking. And you are right, but that is not the whole truth; beneath its satirical surface, Hatoful Boyfriend hides a gripping story that turns it into a very solid Visual Novel.\n\n+ The silly humour makes this VN accessible even to those who are not into Japanese culture, making it excellent (and affordable) for those seeking to dip into the genre;\n+ While short, the main routes are solid and varied, ranging from tear-jerkers to plain WTF, with some hilarity in between (try Okosan's route first of all!)\n+ The "hidden" (and arguably "canon") route presents a very interesting darker tale;\n+ The OST and visuals are not mind-blowing, but they are pleasant and do their job.\n\n+- While I did say it was a fine VN for beginners, it is still a parody of the dating sim genre and thus some of its content might fly over your head;\n+- The ending of the "hidden" route might be considered too convoluted by some, although I would say the journey is still worth it, no matter what opinion you might have of the ending.\n\n- While the main routes being a bit on the short side isn't a big deal and not something I can complain too much about considering the game's price, I do think some routes could've been fleshed out a little more;\n- The translation has some typos and English oddities.\n\nVERDICT: If you think that this game is just a gimmick, play it and let yourself be surprised! With more than what meets the eye (you can easily clock 6-8h if you complete all routes), Hatoful Boyfriend was an excellent surprise and should be considered by all those who enjoy Visual Novels or plot-heavy games. If you are looking for gameplay-heavy elements, however, you WILL be disappointed, but that's just how VNs are.","January 9, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.\n\nYou are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to "fulfill the promise," and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.\n\n--\n\nMy only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.\n\nOh, and the occasional typo or missing word, but that's not a big deal.\n\n--\n\nHave fun, everybirdie!","January 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it because it was a decent price, kind of goofy looking and I didn't want something that was going to frustrate the hell out of me and consume my soul. Well, my soul was somewhat consumed for about 10 hours of gameplay because I couldn't stop playing. I was frustrated the first day and ready to quit and wah about what a waste of money it was but after I picked up some of the birds' personalities it got a lot easier to navigate. The only thing I DON'T like about this game is there are a few "normal" vs "true" endings to some of the storylines (which are annoyingly similar but a PIA to figure out), and you need to get all of them to unlock the last chapter which is honestly very worth all the time you may or may not throw into the game. I think it does make a diference that these are birds and they're not really animated looking which spruces up the whole visual novel thing...and makes the entire story, characters, and interactions that much goofier and entertaining. There is more darker content than you'd expect, but that's not a bad thing at all. Though I've gone through the main storylines a hundred times now to unlock all the endings I would play the BBL ending again because it has high replay/story value.

I put it on my wishlist and me and my friends laughed.\n$20 in my steam wallet, I thought "Why not buy it?

My first playthrough left me a little confused, but the more you play, taking different routes, the more you uncover of the story and lore and you see how complex and interesting the world of Hatoful actually is.\nThe characters are interesting and diverse from the creepy Shuu, to the pudding loving Okosan. Going through each path allows you to uncover more and more about these characters and become more attached as you go on.\nYour first playthrough may take you an hour or so (if you read the dialog you lazy dog) but later, each playthrough may take 20-40 minutes depending on the paths you take.\nThe music sets the mood of the characters and the sound effects can really set the atmosphere.\n\nGreat, emotional visual novel/ dating simulator full of giggles and tears, would recommend.","September 19, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As such, it's kind of hard to review in-depth beyond a very generic "it's really good".

And to some degree, I agree with them.  A great deal of this was only mildly entertaining and I did not understand why people (especially close friends of mine) loved this game.  The game begins with the main character (a female...  yes, you play a female in a dating sim...) starting her sophomore year [unsure if right or not] and during the next year dates several bird-boy-people-things...  NOW, you must be wondering, "Why is a girl dating birds!?  How can she develop intimate feelings for these avian creatures!?  HOW CAN THE BIRDS FRICKIN' ACT LIKE HUMAN BEINGS!?!?!?"  Put those questions aside when you play the story, but just don't forget about them entirely.\n\nEach character's dating route got progressively more funny and interesting the more I played it, EXCEPT FOR ONE which made me feel like I was mashing my head against a wall for doing something so inanely stupid as it was not a good route to take...  If you play the game, you will know the one because you will think the main character is dumb.  After playing through just about every route at least once, I unlocked a new route that was only available to begin in the beginning.  THIS FINAL ROUTE, HOO BOY IT WAS A DOOZY!\n\nThis final route made the entire game so much more worth it, and answered soooooooo maaaaaannyyyyyy quuueeestions!  OH, and if you want to do the epilogue, you need to get all endings before doing the Final Route (There are some characters with TWO endings, one being a normal ending and the other being a TRUE ending...).\n\nI am not really going to talk about the final route too much, but let me just say that this game was a rollercoaster of funny moments and intense plots.\n\nI TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, but it sometimes felt annoying to play through a route again JUST for the epilogue...  Good thing this game has a skip function to speed through text...  Saved me MUCH MORE TIME than I would have done, if that function wasn't in the game.\n\nIn short, if you love games with fantastic stories, GET THIS GAME NOW!","November 15, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All jokes aside, this game is a very solid VN. Don't let the pigeons fool you, it's not simply a gimmick, the author honest to god loves birds and it really shows! When I played the original version a few years back, I initially was grinning like an idiot to sobbing uncontrollably and this game gave me feelings I never asked for or expected at all. It's definitely more than what it appears to be on the surface, so if you love visual novels or don't mind text heavy stuff I'd highly recommend this. Plus, proceeds do contribute to the purchase of toys and food for the real life version of some of these birds. You wouldn't want to leave Okosan hungry, would you?\n\nIf you've already played the game, this adds an Azami route and polishes up backgrounds and for me, the text was much easier on the eyes. If you haven't played before, prepare for a wild ride and an intense urge to hold hands with fluffy pigeons. It's worth every penny and if you love it as much as I do, look into the mini-sequel Holiday Star!

It starts off as an otome-style dating sim/visual novel with cutout photographs of birds, primarily pigeons. It sounds like the most bizarre premise for a game ever, and for the first couple of playthroughs, it is. You'll laugh at the madness, the implausible scenarios (just how do pigeons use those desks from the classroom background, anyway?) and the goofy dialogue. You'll probably get Okosan's ending first, because it's just too absurd to resist. You'll treat the game as if the whole thing were some sort of silly parody.\n\nBut then ... something happens, and you acclimate yourself to the weird world of pigeon dating, and all the sudden the cast reveals itself as the well-developed, sympathetic, and strong characters they all actually secretly are. Certain paths start to break your heart instead of your brain. (I'm looking at you, Nageki and Ryouta.) Then, if you get all the standard endings, it unlocks a final route with a sudden turn into a dark, deeply emotional horror/mystery that completely defies description.\n\nIn short, you laugh at the very premise of this game, and you are right to do so. However, like some sort of Trojan Pigeon, that goofy exterior is used to deliver one of the greatest visual novels, if not one of the greatest games of any genre ever made. I'm serious. So is the game, eventually.\n\n(I do have to dock a point or two for the combined total of some minor text errors and gameplay bugs in the current version.  However, please do not let this dissuade you.  Still HIGHLY recommended.)","September 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the absurd premise of dating talking, oversized birds in a high school called St. Pigeonation's, you'd be forgiven for assuming that game was entirely parodical. Yet the stories of characters such as Nageki and Ryouta become genuine tearjerkers towards their conclusions, and the game gradually unlocks more sinister stories as you go, with Iwamine Shuu's being the darkest of all normal routes by far, with some very creepy overtones and disturbing implications.\n\nThen you complete enough routes to unlock the "Bad Boys Love" (I have no idea why it was called this) mode, which is incredibly difficult to discuss without massive spoilers, but what I can tell you is that not only does its own story go to very dark places, but it gives every other route far darker implications in retrospect.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend's sequel, "Holiday Star", was released awhile back on DLSite, and is not a dating sim in any respect. Its main story is almost entirely linear, but it is hilarious and absurd, featuring such nonsense as fangirl powered cannons. Like the original game, its story gets much darker later on. It also dials back the dating sim elements to unlockable extra scenes that are accessed through the main menu.\n\nIf you can enjoy, or even just get past, the premise of this game, then I wholeheartedly recommend it, because the worst it can be is a cheap laugh. If you give it a chance, you'll find that it's far more than that.\n\nIn addition, the Steam release upgrades the game to 1080p with some very nice, crisp artwork - although the bird pictures look even more out of place now - and adds some additional content in the form of a route for the awesome Azami. Its Collector's Edition is also a good deal with 2 silly wallpapers, the soundtrack, a copy of the original DLSite version of the game, a Hatoful Boyfriend manga and a "yearbook" artbook of the game.\n\n","September 6, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pah, that's ridiculous!... is what you are probably thinking. And you are right, but that is not the whole truth; beneath its satirical surface, Hatoful Boyfriend hides a gripping story that turns it into a very solid Visual Novel.\n\n+ The silly humour makes this VN accessible even to those who are not into Japanese culture, making it excellent (and affordable) for those seeking to dip into the genre;\n+ While short, the main routes are solid and varied, ranging from tear-jerkers to plain WTF, with some hilarity in between (try Okosan's route first of all!)\n+ The "hidden" (and arguably "canon") route presents a very interesting darker tale;\n+ The OST and visuals are not mind-blowing, but they are pleasant and do their job.\n\n+- While I did say it was a fine VN for beginners, it is still a parody of the dating sim genre and thus some of its content might fly over your head;\n+- The ending of the "hidden" route might be considered too convoluted by some, although I would say the journey is still worth it, no matter what opinion you might have of the ending.\n\n- While the main routes being a bit on the short side isn't a big deal and not something I can complain too much about considering the game's price, I do think some routes could've been fleshed out a little more;\n- The translation has some typos and English oddities.\n\nVERDICT: If you think that this game is just a gimmick, play it and let yourself be surprised! With more than what meets the eye (you can easily clock 6-8h if you complete all routes), Hatoful Boyfriend was an excellent surprise and should be considered by all those who enjoy Visual Novels or plot-heavy games. If you are looking for gameplay-heavy elements, however, you WILL be disappointed, but that's just how VNs are.","January 9, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.\n\nYou are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to "fulfill the promise," and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.\n\n--\n\nMy only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.\n\nOh, and the occasional typo or missing word, but that's not a big deal.\n\n--\n\nHave fun, everybirdie!","January 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It starts off as an otome-style dating sim/visual novel with cutout photographs of birds, primarily pigeons. It sounds like the most bizarre premise for a game ever, and for the first couple of playthroughs, it is. You'll laugh at the madness, the implausible scenarios (just how do pigeons use those desks from the classroom background, anyway?) and the goofy dialogue. You'll probably get Okosan's ending first, because it's just too absurd to resist. You'll treat the game as if the whole thing were some sort of silly parody.\n\nBut then ... something happens, and you acclimate yourself to the weird world of pigeon dating, and all the sudden the cast reveals itself as the well-developed, sympathetic, and strong characters they all actually secretly are. Certain paths start to break your heart instead of your brain. (I'm looking at you, Nageki and Ryouta.) Then, if you get all the standard endings, it unlocks a final route with a sudden turn into a dark, deeply emotional horror/mystery that completely defies description.\n\nIn short, you laugh at the very premise of this game, and you are right to do so. However, like some sort of Trojan Pigeon, that goofy exterior is used to deliver one of the greatest visual novels, if not one of the greatest games of any genre ever made. I'm serious. So is the game, eventually.\n\n(I do have to dock a point or two for the combined total of some minor text errors and gameplay bugs in the current version.  However, please do not let this dissuade you.  Still HIGHLY recommended.)","September 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, users can play visual novels that are not on Steam such as Katawa Shoujo (which is exceptionally good by the way), but we should seize the opportunity Lord GabeN has given us, allowing us to play dating simulators on the legendary platform known as Steam. So don't lose this opportunity!\n\nHatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel game in which the player dates pigeons. Although this may sound like an unusual concept, we gamers are always looking out on the market for the latest innovative games which bring new concepts and ideas to the congested video game market. Although the visual novel genre isn't especially innovative, the idea of having a romantic relationship between the protagonist, you, and various male pigeons is certainly innovative. Therefore I am giving this game a thumbs up.\n\nThis may seem like a review just to laud the game's innovation and creativity. However, the gameplay and graphics are also up to par with the other releases which have come out at around the same time as this game. Even though this game is a visual novel, it provides immersive gameplay which will keep players like myself hooked on for hours at a time. The soundtrack for the game is one of the best in the market, which is why I purchased the Digital Deluxe version of the game, which includes the song's soundtrack!\n\nPositives\nExceptional graphics (Can be considered a benchmarking tool similar to what Ryse: Son of Rome was on PC).\nExceptional storyline (Not as good as Barbie Dreamhouse Party but still better than The Last of Us).\nExceptional optimization (Runs better than Assassin's Creed: Unity).\nExceptional gameplay (Combine Flappy Bird and Angry Birds).\nExceptional characters (Especially Okosan).\nMixed\nNo nudity (Depends whether you like nude pigeons or not. If you do, I do not know if there is an uncensored version out there...).\nNegative\nNo anti-aliasing (I feel like the graphics could be even more amazing if there was some anti-aliasing).\nNot enough pigeons (I need more to suppress my desires...).\nEven though this game has some negatives about it, I would still consider it to be GOTY. We all know there is no such thing as a perfect video game. The positives heavily outweigh the negatives and that is all that matters. So therefore, I hope that you have carefully read this review and will pick this game up as soon as possible.

Most people will look at this game, play through maybe one or two routes, write it off as "jokey birb game", and, unfortunately, never touch it again. Which sucks, considering the real meat of this game lies in the epilogue, where the genre does a complete 180.\n\nThis game goes from animu-like dating sim with some hilarious parodies of a lot of visual novel tropes (with the exception of the Nageki route, which deals with some very heavy subjects), to a murder mystery full of twists and turns, with some surprisingly disturbing horror elements thrown in. There were at least three different points where I thought the game was about to end, but it just kept throwing more and more curveballs at me.\n\nThe core game is full of wonderful silliness and knows what it is. The characters and their personalities are memorable and hilarious.\n\nDefinitely a must-complete kind of game.

I've never been a visual novel person, but it's truly done something that toys with the emotions and does some beautiful storytelling.

You think you're going to see some puns, date some pigeons, have some lighthearted fun.  You would be correct!\nHowever.. you will also start to care about these birds.  These characters will grow on you.  And then the story will turn.  Most of these endings somehow caused me to feel more emotions than I care to admit.  Better yet- once you unlock the BBL route you're in for a surprise.  Watch as a dating sim turns into a sort of mystery game with one of the most compelling stories I've seen in a while.\n\nOverall I am plesantly surprised with this game, It's quickly become my favorite.  I HIGHLY reccomend to anyone that loves a good story, the writing is amazing and the character development is great.  Characters aren't as flat as they might seem at first glance!  There is a manga as well as drama CDs out there for this title, along with a sequel.

When I bought and played the game, my thoughts were “what EVEN”. Now, after finishing it (in multiple ways!) and reviewing it, my thoughts are “WHAT EVEN”.\n\nI just. What. What even?\n\nSo it’s a visual novel. About dating birds. As a human girl. In a school for birds. And you WILL adore the birds, fall in love with the birds, cry at the birds, and then stare at the credits in disbelief because did all of that just happen in the span of an hour?\n\nAnd then you’ll do all of it again. Seven times.\n\nFor real though, this game is brilliant. That said, it is definitely not the best game ever. It does manage to be humorous and serious at the same time, and generally at the right times (at least to one familiar with Japanese storytelling conventions).\n\nThe downside is the length: in terms of raw content, Hatoful Boyfriend falls a bit short. It’s true there are eight character routes, plus a couple alternatives and extras, but each route only takes about forty to sixty minutes to complete, and that time gets progressively shorter each time you play: a lot of the text is exactly the same regardless of route taken. Aside from taking different classes each day – which there aren’t that many – the contents of the game won’t change much until about 3/4ths through, where you’re finally locked into a specific route.\n\nStill, the story of the game is very engaging. Though the premise and the world is built on humor, the story takes itself very seriously. Each character is fully fleshed out and their routes just sweep you along for the adventure, and the setting the game builds is solid and easy to get into once you accept the wacky premise. The writing itself isn’t exactly superb, but I dare you to name a VN that has that. What matters is that the humor actually manages to be funny, the emotional scenes are actually touching, and the happy scenes are sweet but not over the top. The final product feels very genuine, and that makes up for its shortcomings.\n\nPlay this game. You will only regret not playing it sooner.","November 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Evidently there was good reason, as you progress through the game, making choices, interacting with possible husbandoves, and taken twists and turns, the experience overall is ridiculous.\nIt is a fun game, and great that it offers a fast forward option when you want to skip sections you have read already (such as the beginning).  Progressing through the story isn't terribly long for most endings, and trying to get each birdies ending is fairly straight forward.  This game is easily replayable, especially when you unlock more endings, and can easily get you hooked.  I suggest buying it on sale, however full price isn't terrible either.\nMy only quarrel is sometimes getting a full ending for a character may not always be clear cut, and thus having to restart a new game may be cumborsome, and one of the endings took a little longer than I would have liked (regardless of how interesting it got).\nIt's a great game and earns and 8 out of 10 stars.\nSomething Everbirdie would love, so go find your husbandove","March 3, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/driwamine/recommended/310080/","driwamine","Shuu Iwamine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/driwamine/","150 products in account","~~WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, IF YOU DONT WANT THE GREATEST DATING SIM OF ALL TIME SPOILED, DON'T READ THIS~~\n\nI first played this game a while ago, on its first English release. I believe that was over 3 years ago now? When I originally heard of this game, I of course reacted like everyone else. "Wow, absurd crazy Japanese dating sim about... birds??? This is so ridiculous that I have to play it."\nA big thing that completely goes over peoples' heads, a conclusion they never seem to come to when they see this game in the Steam store, or when they saw it online wherever for the first time is... could this possibly be tongue-in-cheek? You know, a parody of generic Dating Sim/Visual Novel tropes? Which is kind of crazy to be honest, considering that's what immediately should be coming to their mind - that yes, this game parodies a lot of silly Visual Novels that take themselves far too seriously.\nThe first portion of this game, the "normal high school life" routes, a lot of them use very cliché anime/RPG/Dating Sim tropes, particularly Okosan's slice-of-life, non-serious route, Shuu's sort of yandere true ending, and Anghel's downright crazy and completely non-canon route (is it technically non-canon, considering the effect Anghel causes upon those around him?), but they're written in such a self-aware way, a lot of these storylines know fully well how ridiculous they are and they're not ashamed to be so.\nA lot of the routes do give a bit of insight into each of the characters and you can start to piece things together, but the bulk of the actual plot comes in final route, the Bad Boys Love ending. Hatoful Boyfriend is not a dating sim. The Dating Sim section, in my opinion, was simply a very clever selling point of the game. It is essentially used as such because the devlopers KNEW people would buy something so out there, and for shock value. When you start to realise truly how dark this game is, it's genuinely shocking.\nIf this game was depicted as a serious visual novel about a political faction with extreme racist views, and their goal to rid Earth of the opposing race through means of biological weaponry, even if that requires unethical treatment of their own kind, this game would have been critically acclaimed. Which is funny, because that's EXACTLY what this game is about. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basic plot.\n\nAlbeit the writing is a bit goofy at times, even in serious parts, and there's a lot of unnecessary gore, this game is extremely cleverly written. Despite disguising itself as a dating sim at first glance, and being a mockery to those who haven't played it, this game has pretty interesting politIcal undertones and social commentary, and honestly? I'm awfully more attached to talking birds than I was to any of the characters in westerm, artsy, "plot heavy" (but not really) indie games on Steam such as Thomas Was Alone.\nBut yeah, I'd love to give Hatoful Boyfriend a 10/10 for how well marketed and well put together this game is, along with its amazingly witty writing, but I have to give it a 9.5 for being unnecessarily, I guess, "edgy" and fanfiction-esque at times.\n\nP.S. I've very tempted to figure out a way of rewriting the entire script of this game to be... well, not about birds, and sending it to my friends not telling them what it is. And I can guarantee they'd never be able to guess","September 29, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I bought and played the game, my thoughts were “what EVEN”. Now, after finishing it (in multiple ways!) and reviewing it, my thoughts are “WHAT EVEN”.\n\nI just. What. What even?\n\nSo it’s a visual novel. About dating birds. As a human girl. In a school for birds. And you WILL adore the birds, fall in love with the birds, cry at the birds, and then stare at the credits in disbelief because did all of that just happen in the span of an hour?\n\nAnd then you’ll do all of it again. Seven times.\n\nFor real though, this game is brilliant. That said, it is definitely not the best game ever. It does manage to be humorous and serious at the same time, and generally at the right times (at least to one familiar with Japanese storytelling conventions).\n\nThe downside is the length: in terms of raw content, Hatoful Boyfriend falls a bit short. It’s true there are eight character routes, plus a couple alternatives and extras, but each route only takes about forty to sixty minutes to complete, and that time gets progressively shorter each time you play: a lot of the text is exactly the same regardless of route taken. Aside from taking different classes each day – which there aren’t that many – the contents of the game won’t change much until about 3/4ths through, where you’re finally locked into a specific route.\n\nStill, the story of the game is very engaging. Though the premise and the world is built on humor, the story takes itself very seriously. Each character is fully fleshed out and their routes just sweep you along for the adventure, and the setting the game builds is solid and easy to get into once you accept the wacky premise. The writing itself isn’t exactly superb, but I dare you to name a VN that has that. What matters is that the humor actually manages to be funny, the emotional scenes are actually touching, and the happy scenes are sweet but not over the top. The final product feels very genuine, and that makes up for its shortcomings.\n\nPlay this game. You will only regret not playing it sooner.","November 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely love dating sim games (I'm always a ♥♥♥♥ for hot anime boys) and although I knew that this one was more like a parody, I had also seen a lot of people say that it was really emotional and good. When I first started playing it, I wasn't that impressed--Ryouta and Nageki's routes made me sad and tugged at my heart strings a little, but I felt like the game had been overhyped for me, haha. I was like "okay, that was sad, but it's also about birds???" I ended up just looking up a guide to complete all the routes, because I was mostly interested in getting achievements for it after completing a couple of them. I found it a little frustrating that the routes were so specific, but with the guide that was no problem.\n\nBut then, I got to the BBL route. And I was suddenly EXTREMELY invested, and EXTREMELY EMOTIONALLY COMPROMISED. I don't want to spoil anything, but honestly I would reccomend pushing through all the routes just to unlock this one. It's that good, and it made me realize why so many people liked this game. I even shed a little tear, so ♥♥♥♥ you guys for making me cry over pigeons, personified into hot anime boys or not.","August 2, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though Okosan's route is the most humorous, I'd recommend you to choose a different route first, as quite a few argue Okosan isn't a good representation of Hatoful Boyfriend. The game's fairly light until you get to Hurtful Boyfriend/Bad Boys Love, which does take a bit of time to get through.\n\nThough I've enjoyed the game, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes games like shooters.","August 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Is it the bird you follow or is there more to it. Are you the human in the story or aren't you more like a bird imprisoned inside a human.

Well I guess it is but their's so much more to it than just dating birds.\n\nStory: Surprisingly the game has a well crafted story with great writing and multiple endings depending on which bird you romance. All the characters feel unique with there own personalities, interests, and quirks. The story itself will branch out into different paths, that are amazing and heartfelt. It also helps that Hatoful Boyfriend is very replayable.\n\nGameplay: Just like any visual novel, the gameplay boils down to reading text boxes and occasionally making a decision. Which isn't a bad thing as long as your prepared for it and know what you're getting into.\n\nPresentation: The game has a very cute art style that goes for more cartoonish than realistic and the fact that the character models are cut out from actual pictures of birds is a nice touch. Unfortunately a lot of areas get reused do to the setting of the game.\n\nVerdict: Hatoful Boyfriend is a charming game with some slight problems that fortunately aren't that bad or game breaking. So in conclusion Hatoful Boyfriend gets a 9/10. It is a must buy. It has great quality for a ten dollar game.","May 16, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thirteen hours in less than three days I have logged into this game. Never have I been so drawn into pigeons.\n\nLike everyone else here, I was drawn in by the promise of a silly dating SIM involving birds. I didn't expect this game to be anything intensely amazing. So, when I began, though I had read plenty of reviews, I did not take too many of them that seriously. At first I wasn't overly impressed. The storyline itself seemed solid, though a bit vauge, and the choices that you are allowed in the game are relatively few. It's more a reading adventure than anything, and I quickly learned how to make each bird like me. However, the storyline wasn't nearly so well made as the reviews had spoken of. I had my favorites, of course, but the game seemed a little flat and lacking even at the deepest stories (my personal favorites are Nageki's and Sakuya's), and I disliked the lack of ability to interact with other birds while trying to woo a specific fowl.\n\nAnd then, though tenacity and determination, I got through all 14 endings, and everything changed.\n\nI won't say anything about the BBL ending. It needs to be played to be appreciated. But this story? This entire game is a work of art. I sat for three hours straight, playing the ending alone, just gaping at how well and perfectly everything fit together, with all the character interaction I had been missing and the complex storylines and depth that the game has been lauded for.\n\nThis game is worth every penny.\n\nThere are some technical difficulties I'm not impressed with. The save feature, for me, was a joke. Half the time the game would glitch and freeze when a save point was loaded, and made me have to go through and replay the game again. I saw the intro at least 12 times, which is more times than anyone needs to be introduced to each bird and can get sickeningly boring. The game also had a tendancy to freeze at important decisions, making me have to replay yet again, so it became a real effort in patience trying to deal with these glitches without throwing it out. All through the three hour ending, I was on the edge of my seat half expecting to have to go through most of it again because it might decide to freeze on me. Thankfully, it did not do any such thing, and I was able to enjoy myself through the massive and bright storyline *ehehe*.\n\nI also don't reccomend this game for those who are sensitive to gore and murder. Not because it shows any, because it doesn't, but some of these storylines get rather... descriptive of these things. I wouldn't say it's anything for kids, for sure.\n\nEven with these issues, if you're on the fence, tip over and fly. You won't regret it.\n\n~Kero\n\n","June 18, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, if you're okay with the basic premise: a light-hearted, mostly-text adventure game (visual novel with several courses) in which you play a human girl transferred to a school of intelligent pigeons. If none of that bothers you, you'll find the rest of the game to be very well developed, with a lot of thought and humor.\n\nTo enjoy Hatoful Boyfriend the most, you will want to see multiple endings. There's one specific ending that's really great, but you need to play through other endings first to get it. If necessary, look up spoiler-free instructions on how to get the BBL ending.

What originally started out as a visual novel about dating pigeons, eventually becomes a visual novel about dating pigeons with deep and complex personalities.\n\nThe game (or should I say the visual novel) itself is nothing complex, the closest thing to gameplay here is making a decision. Though your decision will ultimately decide who you choose to get close with and how the game ends.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it is quite entertaining. The writing is fantastic, and all of the characters have their own lovable quirks, in fact the route you take can vastly affect the mood of the story. After going on a certain route, you can do the hidden route which unless you've gotten all the ending (which includes both the normal and true ending for every character) you won't see the epilogue. Getting all of the ending means you have to read through a lot of the things you've read before, there is a fast forward button; but sometimes new dialogues could appear in a scene that you expected to play as usual.\n\nOverall Hatoful Boyfriend is an entertaining visual novel about dating pigeons...\n\nThat was anti-climatic.","December 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Though Okosan's route is the most humorous, I'd recommend you to choose a different route first, as quite a few argue Okosan isn't a good representation of Hatoful Boyfriend. The game's fairly light until you get to Hurtful Boyfriend/Bad Boys Love, which does take a bit of time to get through.\n\nThough I've enjoyed the game, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes games like shooters.","August 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
