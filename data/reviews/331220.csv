The game play, while very simple, is a ton of fun, and makes for an incredible party game.\n\nBad: We could not get every device working. The biggest boon to this game would be having friends come over and download it on their phones or tablets, but when we tried running multiple platforms together it was bug city. Different devices would log in as the same player, ghost players would be able to run around and stab whoever they wanted (which was hilarious, but for the wrong reasons), and the game would crash constantly or throw people back to the lobby.\n\nI hope a patch comes in the next few days, I will definitely be trying this out again. Recommended, but with a warning.","December 4, 2014","true","0.4"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","36","45","2","2"

But of course, it says in the description that it is only local.        0                Gameplay        Simplistic controls, downsides are limited letters for username and constant configuring when opening game. If you don't have enough controllers, you can even download the app from the App Store and the Play Store!        9\n\nSummary: Funny and addicting game to play with friends and siblings. The music is perfect for this game and the controls are simple. I definitely recommend this game to those who have friends or siblings that play with you often.\n\nDescription (possible spoilers): At the start of each game, you'll have to find yourself as there are many people who look like you (you'll see what I mean if you play the game). There are three modes; classic, spy, drunk, and rotating. Obviously, the more people you have, the more fun the game is. The thief who reaches 30 points first wins.\nIn classic, you have to try to find your friend and stab them first. The first kill is more points than the other kills.\nIn spy, you have items: gun, trap, smoke, and decoy. The gun lets kill your opponent from a range distance. The trap reveals players who step in it. Obviously, it's invisible. The smoke creates a black smoke screen to help prevent players from knifing you or to help prevent from traps. The decoy (my personal favorite) switches your player with another character.\nIn drunk, one player is a sheriff and the other is a drunk. The sheriff stands out as it is colored (color depends on player). The sheriff has a gun, and has two bullets to try to shoot the drunk. If you have three or four players, the sheriff gains a bullet for a kill of another player. A drunk can't do anything but move and fall... on his face.\nRotating is just a randomized game mode of the above. In rotating, there is also a showdown mode, which has just two players (even in three/four player mode) fight. Sometimes, both players has a gun and the first one who shoots the other wins. Knifing is optional.\n\n\nStill on the verge of buying this game? Watch some YouTube videos.\n\nI love the idea of using an app as a controller. It makes problems easier :D\nOh, and watch out for the weed. The big, scary tumbleweed, of course.\n\nOverall score: 9.7/10","December 14, 2014","true","3.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","28","35","4","0"

But I always read analysis. Let's be clear: some games can benefit more from positive user's feedback than others. I didn't need to read at people's opinions to know I was buying Awesomenauts or Binding of Isaac.\nBut truth is that it took me some time to finally purchase Thief Town. I wasn't pretty sure. And it was a damn good purchase. The game excels at what I think is the most important for a local multiplayer: creating tension and hilarious moments that make you and your friend burst into laughs.\nIt's not a game you will play more than an hour in a single session (but most local multiplayer games aren't designed for that, to be fair). But it's a game you will surely propose to play every time you and your friends decide to have a fun time playing some local multiplayer on Steam.\nIts strengths remind me to Nidhogg: a super easy to learn game that guarantee a lot of laughs.\n\nI picture you at the same spot I was: doubting if this not so specially good-looking game worths the money. Believe me, mate: it is super worth. Highly recommended.","December 1, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

They find a way to make it cross-platform yet can't make it simple to actually play on a local network.\n\nDo NOT get unless you plan to play on literally the same machine or connect through ethernet or some s***.\n\nToo bad too. Just a little effort into the execution and it probably would have been fun.","April 17","false","0.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

That is because you can use controllers, the keyboard and even smartphones.\nBut once you get it all set up, this is so much fun to play with friends at a party. Grab a beer (or more) and everybody involved has a good time.\nIf you play this at a party with more than four people, I can asure you that even the spectators will have fun guessing who is who. Soundtrack is also a blast to listen to.","November 3, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
