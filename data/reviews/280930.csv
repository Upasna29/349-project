Although it is not the most original ever game created, it takes the best from TD games like Plants vs. Zombies, and combines it with fast-paced action to create something new. It includes lots of upgrades, power ups like machine guns and rocket launchers, and varied skins for your caterpillars which you can unlock via playing the game.\n\nIt doesn't make too much effort in the campaign mode, there's not even a determined story, just caterpillars fighting each others, but that doesn't make the game less funny; sometimes it gets repetitive, the different levels of each scenario don't change much from each other, but at the end of each scenario, you get to fight one of the hilarious bosses who are pretty challenging. Upon completing the campaign you unlock an endless mode, in which you can play without restrictions.\n\nThis game has a friendly user interface, allowing everyone to play it; also the learning curve is easy, but the game gets hard to master once you progress.\n\n+Action-TD game\n+Lots of upgrades and power-ups\n+Easy to learn and hard to master\n+Awesome last boss\n\n-Levels get repetitive\n-Short campaign\n\n79/100 Very good","April 28, 2014","true","4.3"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","39","48","0","2"

It gives you about 10+ hours of content with a few types of challenges for various campaign levels. The bosses during the later half of the game also require a bit of contemplation and strategizing because they start becoming a bit more challenging.\n\nAs an added bonus, the multiplayer was seamless and I had no issues whatsoever while achievement hunting with a friend.\n\nIt's one of the more casual strategy games out there in the same price range but it was definitely quite fun.

But does that mean that this isn't any fun? Certainly not.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video of what you should expect when heading into this. Take a look if you're interested or just read my summary of the game below. Just a warning though, it has birds carpet bombing with their crap.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/cpoGKJ-wYVw\n\nI'll start by saying the basic premiss of this game is a tug-of-war between two sides, something you've probably seen before in other games. But does this do anything different? No, not really. However, it's still pretty fun to play.\n\nYou construct your units with a regenerating resource that can be upgraded to regen faster for the same resource, the cost gaining in price every time. The units  themselves are mashed together by a decent number of parts you can select before going into the match, and each one does different things, such as make your guy charge faster, shoot enemies at a distance, knock the enemy backwards, set up mines, poison an enemy, heal the soldier over time, and so on. The charm to it is constructing the unit you want to make and seeing it charge into battle and (hopefully) crush your foes. You just have to keep in mind that even though you're creating a stronger unit, it costs more to make it while the enemy might be swarming in on you.\n\nThe other fun part to this game is customizing your soldiers with skins and upgrades, and you can choose which upgrades/skins you want without having to go through others first, which is always appreciated. I also like how open ended this game is about beating certain levels/challenges. There isn't always a correct way to go about something to achieve victory. You can either spam out fodder to overwhelm your enemy, have a mix of certain parts that benefit off each other, or have titans with every expensive part you can throw on it that stomp mostly anything in their path. There's just a good number of things you can do.\n\nBut lets talk about some of the negatives now. Because this is a phone port, there isn't much interaction with you and what's happening on the field. You're kind of farting around and waiting to send out your next unit. While it is fun to to watch your units do the work, I wish there was more you could do than just summon an animal friend.\n\nI'm also not a fan of buying straight upgrades for parts you already own. That doesn't encourage swapping parts from ones that you made better than others. I much rather play with a different weapon to give my units than use the same ones for every mission simply because the game is that much easier with them. The fact that the game limits how many parts you can take into battle also irks me. There could've been a lot more depth to the game if you could always choose a counter unit to what your enemy was sending at you instead of being stuck with what you chose and hoping it works out.\n\nBut to sum this game up, even with the lack of interactivity, this is still a solid title for under 3 bucks currently, and possibly still worth it for 5 if you enjoy a decent time waster. The multiplayer options also open this game up for more fun if the campaign and endless modes aren't your thing.","April 28, 2014","true","1.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

We picked up x2 twin packs and have been playing it head to head and switching opponents between the four of us. I am hereby recomending this game to all my friends. I will also be checking out other games made by these Devs. the gameplay reminds us all of Swords & Soilders, which has been one of our favorites since we got in the Wii like 5 years ago. When we saw that game on Steam we picked it up and enjoy the online multiplayer modes in both of these games. REAL online multiplayer done right... we look forward to buying any DLC for this title the moment it is available. Also we hope they add 2vs2 multiplayer ASAP. Swords & Soilders sadly never did.

You're moving battlepillars across the screen, in 2D, from left to right, and have to engage in fights with other battlepillars. Get to the base of the enemy, destroy it and you win the game.\n\nThe game isn't about tactics but more about spamming these creatures as fast as you can, if possible with as many weapons as you can add. You see, you can create your own battlepillars by selecting which weapons you want it to carry. By collecting and generating leafs you can make your creatures even larger.\n\nWinning a level earns you apples that can be used to upgrade your battlepillars, special powers and/or base.\n\nAll of this is extremely fascinating stuff. So fascinating that I got bored within an hour. But considering the price it's not a bad deal at all.

While lacking in higher strategy, this game has managed to turn a simple concept into a decent experience, my main issue being resource management and economy. The simple concept of 'build minion, send at enemy' could have been done quite poorly, however with Battlepillars there is a decent amount of customisation that makes the game fairly enjoyable to play. The current price level is reasonable (as far as steam goes when there isn't a sale on) so you may want to pick it up if you have younger children who are better suitable for a simple mechanic.\n\nNote: Please bear in mind that the stuff you unlock in single player is what you often get in multiplayer (there are options to limit the opponent to mutually aquired items, and to grant opponents the items you have if they don't.) This allows for some  seriously unfair matches (+150% resource gain for example) that will often sweep you quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not perfect and it may be a bit too simple for some, but it's still reasonably enjoyable to play.\n\nOverall, 5.5 - 6.5/10\n\nEDIT: Accounts from other people have highlighted problems I have not yet experienced myself. Please take into account these other accounts before considering purchasing this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/280930/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4210 products in account","One good thing about the game is the upgrades.  As the game progresses, new tools and upgrades become available.  Some of them use unit that will help your team or hurt the other directly.  The unique thing about some upgrades is that some of them do not work until later.  For example, one upgrade acts as a revenge bomb.  Once the unit dies, it will unleash several smaller units that will start attacking the enemy.  Another upgrade is calling in allies that will aide your side through effects like attacking the other side or bring in extra supplies.  These ally units come at a steep price, but they can turn the tide of battle if ever in a tight situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the weakest part of the game is the battle itself.  Like most strategy games, you need to send your units towards the enemy base.  However, these games usually have a detailed map where terrain is part of the strategy.  With Battlepillars, it is always a straight line with no option of changing direction or even sidestepping.  Without a way of changing things along the way, it becomes merely a battle of unit selection.  Even with that area, there is not much strategy to use there, either.  As mentioned earlier, you can buy new units in order to use deeper strategies, but that really is not necessary.  By using a few powerful units with a little speed and/or armor, it becomes too easy to overwhelm the enemy with only a few units.  This is especially true with multiplayer.  In multiplayer, the first player that can send three strong units will usually win the battle.  Without the need to think, the battles are merely a series of crashing units.\n\nThe battle’s one redeeming quality is the gold challenges.  Along with simply defeating the enemy army, a gold challenge asks you to complete the battle under special circumstances.  Some of them are simple enough like using a certain size unit.  However, others require things like limiting how much you can use.  When working under these conditions, it forces you go use some strategy.  It is not enough to save the game, but they help it from being a total lost.","June 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

You create your own custom battlepillars out of individual parts you first earn as you progress and then are able to upgrade as you go along. It has a very simple interface. It was originally a mobile game, but it was ported to pc very well. Even though it is an overall very simple game, it provides a good amount of challenge and some replay value, which is always important for me. Each level has an optional gold challenge you can try to beat in addition to just beating the level in general. I would recommend this game.

Build your perfect army of ants to counter enemy strategy and destroy their tree!\nEvery battle starts with each side having a Tree - barracks with 1 turret, where your ants come from.\nYou construct every single ant right during battle from segments - parts of their body, which can be weapons, armor, legs, or some utility stuff like honey-throwers that slow enemies or spider eggs which spawn spiders. All segments have different stats and Leaf cost - so the more segments you add to an ant, the bigger, stronger and more expensive it will be. Leaves are the only auto-generated in-battle resource, its production can be upgraded to increase generation rate - so you always have a dilemma of building another ant vs upgrading production right now - games are very short and every second matters. You cannot directly control units - once they are ready, they will go forward to an enemy tree, until they meet enemy in their attack range. Note, they move with different speed too - 1-segment ants will overrun your 6-segment monster and die with no use long before he shows up - unless you time things correctly.\nFor destroying trees you get another, non-battle resource, Apples. These are used for buying new segments and upgrading old ones, upgrading the tree, buying skins and Allies.\nThere are 15 segments total, each segment can be upgraded 3 times, but you can only choose 6 for each battle. Think wisely.\nSkins change how your ants look, and more important, they also change stats. Different strategies require different skins. The only one I couldn't get is Golden (hidden) skin - it is only unlocked when you complete gold challenges of both campaigns, and I only completed 1st one.\nAllies are game-breaking 1-use powers, which you can buy for lots of apples. Like a bird bombarding the battlefield with dung and destroying everything like a nuclear bomb. I didn't use them during campaign, AI doesn't use them either :O - they feel like cheats.\nCampaign has different levels divided into missions, each ending up with unique boss - a huge tree-sized ant. All of these actually require different strategies to complete, and many of them will require you to restart until you know your enemy well. Each level has a Gold challenge - for example, to complete it with some limitations or conditions, varying from very easy to extremely hard.\nGame is Android port, PC version is called "Gold Edition" for there is 2nd campaign, Moon missions. Its so hard I could only finish half of it, with only 3 Gold challenges - a real test of skills.\nStrategic depth is pretty good, people invented many strategies already, but somehow multiplayer didn't appeal me at all - I didn't even try, though for strategies I usually do.\nNice small game, but not for long.\nClass: III - Simple Bread\nVerdict: Yes\nReviewed: 8.24.2015\nVersions: Battlepillars Gold Edition\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: Several Dozen Hours\nDeeds:\n1st Campaign Complete With All Gold Challenges\nAll Upgrades\nAll Skins Except Golden\n77% Achievements","August 24, 2015","true","35.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Game allows you to buy whatever you want, and the the AI assumes you have what you need to deal with rushes, not cool.\n* Minimal to no strategy. It seems like you conduct the battle, the the problem is that a specific set of tools will work on a specific level. Get in, get beaten, try again with a different combo, again, again, until you realize you don't HAVE what you need, so GOTO 10; (grind)\n* People put the gold challenges as a plus, but it isn't, because to get gold you need tools and tools cost apples and you get extra apples by getting gold, so you either have what you need and breeze the gold or you don't. Helps with the grinding, EXCEPT gold makes levels harder so it's not even grinding, it's hard grinding.\n\nWould I recommend this game? No. If I do, someone will pick it up, get stuck at the 10th level or so, flip it off and go to sleep, never to play it again. Why would I do that, when so many great games are on sale for less? And for what? I'm not condemning the graphics, or the gameplay, or the music (fix that loop, BTW, at some point it just ENDS), I'm condemning the laziness of the developers to put in difficulty, which is mandatory for casual gaming, and a mild hind on what should use for a particular map. I don't have infinite time to waste on trial and error. Some people do. They play on Normal/Hard. I don't. I play on easy with hints.

Ground breaking graphics which put the Frostbite engine to shame, extremely good performance on computers which have less than desirable specs, and an encapsulating and emotionally deep story which will drive you along a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nEnter an engrossing world where the player assumes the role of a colony of caterpillars which rise against their fascist, oppressive brethern in an epic conflict which will try your resolve, morale and ability to lead others to victory.\n\nWith a limited ammount of resources and an unrelenting foe, you must lead your citizens in a revolutionary conflict the likes of which have never been seen before. The conflict of Battlepillars will make the Russian Revolutions of 1917 look like a picnic day.\n\nOnce you realise that the war against your extremist allies is fruitless with troops, you must call upon your allies in arms to lift the siege against your territories, including a large, blue feathered bird, which will decimate your foes in an unholy storm of hellfire.\n\nAfter beating your enemies back, you must then press the attack deep into enemy territory, eliminating high ranking officials of the enemies war-machine, and steamrolling any resistance in your way until total and utter victory is yours.\n\nBattlepillars Gold Edition was a gift from a dear friend, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for blessing me with this masterpiece of a game. Anyone with polarised opinions of this game should definitely invest their money in this work of art. Some claim that The Last of Us should receive a Game of The Year nomination, some would also argue that it is Grand Theft Auto V which has reached the zenith of what is quality and an excellence in design for the gaming industry. These critics have clearly never experienced the ferocity that is Battlepillars.\n\nWords cannot explain the utmost respect I hold for the creators of this game, who have blessed gaming community worldwide with a masterpiece which will not be forgotten anytime soon.\n\n10/10\n\n- Dinkum","September 9, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlasterBox/recommended/280930/","BlasterBox","BlasterBox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlasterBox/","53 products in account","I don't recommend or reject this game. I wish there was a 'neutral' button, not because the game's bad, because it's casual.\n\n+Funny game\n+Well-made casual\n+Nice upgrade system\n+Lots of armors, weapons\n+Achievements\n\n-A little 'gay'\n-There are free and funnier games\n-Weak online gaming\n\n\nPROS\n\n1. Funny game\nThe game's much funnier as it looks like, believe me! I bought it at a 75% discount and for the first ten or or fifteen minutes I thought what the f'ck am I playing? Don't even believe I bought it. Just gonna give a chance then leave. But turns out that the experience was better than I expected and I'm completely sure I wasn't the only one who thought like that.\n\n2. It's a well-made casual\nEvery single detail was well drawn and well thought. The leaves falling on the ground, the 'pillars crawling to attack, the weapons animations, everything. It sounds stupid - but it's not, having a well created game, even if the concept is not good (not saying this game concept is bad, just giving an example), boosts the gaming experience a ton times.\n\n3. The upgrade system is cool\nIt has a very nice upgrading system where, unlike almost all other games upgrade trees you usually afford useless (sometimes expensive things) to reach the stronger ones, this game allows you to focus on what you need.\n\n4. A considerable amount of armors and weapons are available\nLots of weapons and armors are available! Lots of them! Thus, the game is way more personal and less linear, you can evolve the way you want and follow the upgrades you want. The upgrades can be related to 'pillar skins (generally armor or life upgrades), 'pillar segments (support and attack upgrades) and various others, such as increasing leaf regen or you tree maximum life.\n\n5. Ingame achievements\nThe game has Steam and ingame achievements (the golden leaf). Earning any ingame achievement earns you more money to upgrade your soldiers, upgrading them probably will give you more achievements and so on.\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n6. A childish interface\nDespite the game being awesome, its interface is waaay too childish - even though is a more complex strategy game than it looks. The point is: there's no problem for you if you intend to buy this game but if you do so you'll probably want to play alone. If you have roomates or relatives constantly passing close to your computer there's a very big chance (if not certain), that you will be mocked. You shouldn't even discuss this game with other people that are not close friends, or else there's a possibility they may guess you're a little childish, or even gay (not saying it's a bad thing, okay, just poiting this out). This is, in my opinion, the most important topic of this game. If you urge to buy it please consider this topic 6 strongly.\n\n7. Free and funnier similar games\nYea, despite this game's great there are other free and even funnier games! One of them is the [/i]Epic War[/b]. Here are some of their best games with the same line of thought of Battlepillars and even better graphics, made of Flash:\nEpic War 3[www.kongregate.com]\nEpic War 4[www.kongregate.com]\nPalaDog[www.kongregate.com]\nEpic War 5[www.kongregate.com]\nMiragine War![www.kongregate.com]\nThey're all casual and more funny than 'pillars.\n\n8. Weak online rooms\nI've been playing since a long time and I've never (I repeat never!) seen an online room to play with. That's not a problem and does not change gameplay but you should at least consider it if you will to play with someone or earn all the achievements.","July 3, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was wrong, after I struggled finishing the 1st boss (seems like there is 8 of them) I got stuck on the first level of the second act. And seems like the only way to get by this level is upgrade your parts to be stonger. And if you upgraded your parts to play more of a rush tactic and face ennemies with flame bomb (which does AOE) and destroy any weak unit, well you're screwed. You need to go buy some other part and upgrade them which cost you 150 apples(currency of the game) and you get around 12-14 per level. So go play 20-30 times the same level in order to level up a bit to get by this level. SO MUCH FUN! It seems like this game was made for android and you could pay to buy apples to get un-stuck from harder levels. Had fun for 30 minutes. Uninstalled and will never play again.","September 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For someone hoping for a complicated base defense or tactics-heavy game- or even something as complex as a basic tower defense game- you're likely going to be very disappointed [as I was].\n\n\n\nPros\n*Didn't seem to have any bugs\n*Polished presentation\n\nNeutral\n*Putting together parts is as cool an idea as you'd expect, but you never really feel a good impact from adding a single part, and the aesthetics feel like they could have been made more interesting.\n*Upgrading system is straightforward and uncomplex\n\nCons\n*Available Parts have preferential- rather than tactical- relation to one another. This is emphasized by the small number of parts you can bring to a map.\n*The map interactions are bland and repetitive, with the same tactics working each go, and the enemies feeling far too identical\n*Combat is overly simplistic- hands-off combat can be fun, but only if team building/tactics is emphasized, which in this game, it is not.\n*The game is far too easy- likely because making it harder'd require a more complicated combat system.\n*The interface is lacking\n\n\nIn summary, the game is just overall lacking in depth.\nIt- as the store description states- is a tug-of-war game, not a strategy game.\n\nOf course, if you want a tug-of-war simulator represented by sacrificial swarms of caterpillars with special woodland summons to affect the outcome, then by all means, this is your game!\n\nThis would have done a lot better as a free flash game- even for fans of the casual strategy genre, I can't recommend paying full for the game, not with better games cheap or even freely available.\n\n\n2.5/5","October 5, 2015","false","8.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

It's really refreshing from that kind of games (tug of war), upgrades, combos, ressources, all those adds to this game a nice touch. The concept of using caterpillars is actually pretty cool, the skins are funny at times (like the hippy one), they make look caterpillar like real predators and badass! The levels, well it's a tug of war, what do you expect from a tug of war map? else than a straight line. Bosses are quite long, still not challenging yet (just spam with 125 cost of legs then gg).

The weapon effects are not too flashy, but it still works well.\n\nThe controls are simple quite, with visible hotkeys if you don't want to click on your caterpillar parts. The learning curve is minimal, and the tutorial is fast and helpful, allowing you to get a feel for the game very quickly. The feedback for both the enemy and your units are provided as small health bars and a minimap helps you keep track of the action. You can zoom out to view the entire battlefield.\n\nUnlike most games of this style, you do not have separate unit types to send out. Instead, you have caterpillar parts that you can add to the base (the head). Each piece has a different function, and the cost increases with each added component. Your "mana" to send out units comes in the form of leaves, and you can upgrade the maximum leaf pool (which also increases the generation rate). Periodically, leaves will drop on the ground, and you can click these to add quick points to your pool.\n\nThere are quite a few pieces to choose from (ex: long range cannon, armor, speed legs, slow gun), and you have the option of upgrading each to a maximum level of 3. At each level, the aesthetics for the piece changes, something I particularly like to see in games.\n\nA few levels into the game you will unlock base defenses (a fixed turret) and the ability to upgrade your base components. You also get special weapons (like a bird bomb, a turtle slow, etc) that are one-time use (and very expensive). To buy upgrades, you use apples that are rewarded at the end of every level. As you attack the enemy base (a tree), apples will randomly fall - picking these up are optional but highly recommended.\n\nThe grinding is actually very reasonable and can be quick. You can even afford many of the upgrades if you just progress through the levels.\n\nThere is an option for getting a gold (flower/medal) for each level if you complete a specific challenge. For example, some might ask you to beat the level under a time limit, or to use x max number of leaves, or x max number of caterpillar parts.\n\nThe game plays very well and can be a lot of fun if you enjoy this type of playstyle.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","July 14, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You build segmented catepillars (segements might have legs=extra speed, miniguns, grenade throwers, etc etc) and fight incoming catepillars with the objective of getting to their tree first and destroying it. I'd say if you can get this game on sale, buy it.\n\nPros:\n-Simple\n-Fun\n-Random\n\nCons:\n-Mildly repetitive\n-Difficulty varies drastically (like one level might be hard but then next super easy)\n\nRating: 8/10","May 27, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea of building units per segment is nicely applied, and they can individually be upgraded between stages. There are skins to unlock ingame that provide slight benefits, challenges for every level ...\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weapon effects are not too flashy, but it still works well.\n\nThe controls are simple quite, with visible hotkeys if you don't want to click on your caterpillar parts. The learning curve is minimal, and the tutorial is fast and helpful, allowing you to get a feel for the game very quickly. The feedback for both the enemy and your units are provided as small health bars and a minimap helps you keep track of the action. You can zoom out to view the entire battlefield.\n\nUnlike most games of this style, you do not have separate unit types to send out. Instead, you have caterpillar parts that you can add to the base (the head). Each piece has a different function, and the cost increases with each added component. Your "mana" to send out units comes in the form of leaves, and you can upgrade the maximum leaf pool (which also increases the generation rate). Periodically, leaves will drop on the ground, and you can click these to add quick points to your pool.\n\nThere are quite a few pieces to choose from (ex: long range cannon, armor, speed legs, slow gun), and you have the option of upgrading each to a maximum level of 3. At each level, the aesthetics for the piece changes, something I particularly like to see in games.\n\nA few levels into the game you will unlock base defenses (a fixed turret) and the ability to upgrade your base components. You also get special weapons (like a bird bomb, a turtle slow, etc) that are one-time use (and very expensive). To buy upgrades, you use apples that are rewarded at the end of every level. As you attack the enemy base (a tree), apples will randomly fall - picking these up are optional but highly recommended.\n\nThe grinding is actually very reasonable and can be quick. You can even afford many of the upgrades if you just progress through the levels.\n\nThere is an option for getting a gold (flower/medal) for each level if you complete a specific challenge. For example, some might ask you to beat the level under a time limit, or to use x max number of leaves, or x max number of caterpillar parts.\n\nThe game plays very well and can be a lot of fun if you enjoy this type of playstyle.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","July 14, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You basically put a lot of parts together to make a "battlepillar" and send it out to fight the enemy's battlepillars then the one that kills the other and advances towards the enemy base to destroy it. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, leading you to come up with new strategys left, right and centre to keep up with the enemy's strategy. The campaign mode is fairly long and has interesting modes and enemy strategys which change throughout but the best part of the game is grabbing a friend and going 1v1 where you and your friend will be frantically trying to outdo each ther in a battle of will. I highly recommend it.","December 22, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
