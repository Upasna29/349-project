"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdm800/recommended/44310/","rdm800","RDM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdm800/","55 products in account","Honest Review in current state (Finished Game)\n\nPros\nGreat dynamic weather system.\nGood car sounds.\nVisuals not too bad considering how old the game is (2010).\nGreat AI however may seem a bit slow for veteran F1 drivers. They are fairly aggressive, but not overwhelmingly so, which means that they will try to overtake you be it the inside or outside.\nFun online, good to see people still in online lobbies.\nLive the life feature in career mode. Players in career mode can participate in Press Conferences and/or paddock interviews. Gives a great feel of immersion into the career and the game itself.\nMultiple practice sessions (FP1-FP3). It is the only Codemasters F1 Game to feature all three practice sessions in a race weekend.\nMost wheels compatible with PC are supported and picked up instantly by the game, even if you plug it in mid-race.\nGame pads also supported.\nGood balance between Game Pad and Wheel, no one device is faster than the other at any track.\nManual pit limiter and braking for pit box.\nNice car handling and Force Feedback system.\n\nCons\nRequires the dreaded 'Games for Windows Live'. Can make the game a real pain, especially if you haven’t created your own Xbox/Games for Windows Live account.\nAI are inconsistent. At some tracks they can be a great challenge but others they seem to lack the pace.\nAI occasionally makes stupid decisions. Can act stupidly on tracks they are not well optimised on. This can include braking down a straight or midway through a fast corner, going defensive when not required, not leaving you space on the track.\nGame bugs that haven't and won't be fixed. Can include game giving you pointless penalties although you might have done nothing wrong, Force India pitlane glitch - car burns out engine whilst the limiter is on, pitlane exit white line glitch - game doesn't penalise player when crossing the white line upon exit of the pits, despite the fact that the game manual states that it should (pg11).\nGame lighting is very dull.\n\nF1 2010 set the standard of racing games way back when it was released, and the game itself is still arguably the best Codemasters Formula 1 title to date. It is a very accessible game and has a nice balance between Arcade and Simulation. The graphics aren't too bad, but many newer titles such as  Project Cars  and Codemasters newest F1 Game,  F1 2015  put it to shame. The handling and gameplay however are very good despite the few bugs that are within the game. The AI are fun to race against and the online experience is still great thanks to the many people that continue to play this game.\n\nF1 2010 is one very good racing game even by todays standards. The AI is almost unmatched in the Codemasters franchise and the presentation is fantastic. The game itself could have used a little bit more polishing but usually go unnoticed as you play. The Games for Windows Live feature does let the game down however, but apart from that it is a very solid racing game and I would highly recommend it to newcomers or veterans.  8/10\n\n\n\nReviewed using Logitech G27 Racing Wheel.\nGive the review a thumbs up if it helped you. Feel free to send me a friend request on Steam!","August 3, 2015","true","110.2"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","27","27","2","2"

In late 2008 F1 2009 was launched on the wii and the psp but not on the ps3, pc or 360 and that left a lot of fans disapointed, but late 2009 saw the realese of F1 2010 this time only on the ps3, pc and 360. F1 2010 had a rocky launch with various bugs (that have been now fully patched) but critics and fans alike loved F1 2010 for its great graphics (that still hold up well today), fantastic sound, great ai and the best dymanic wether system ever seen in a racing game of its time, but where I think F1 2010 shines is the in depth career mode that has been dumed down in later F1 titles. Career mode features press confrences after every sesion and offical rules in tyre usage, full race weekends and so much more. F1 2010 is must buy for any F1 fan or racing game fan at only $9.99 you are getting a great racing experince that later F1 games have fallen short.\n\nF1 2010 features all the teams, drivers, tracks and rules of the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship. Introducing the, then, new no fuel refill during race pit stops rule\n\nJust a quick FYI F1 2010 Requires GFWL (games for windows live) I thought I might mention it because some people hate GFWL, I personly don't understand why.","August 21, 2015","true","12.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

Instead of simply having races thrown at you one after the other, you get the option of playing "full race weekends" which includes Practices 1, 2, and 3, Qualifying 1, 2, and 3, the Race proper and an after-race interview should you make the podium.\n\nThe interviews and performance you provide effects how your teammates view you, and while the opinion of your team is not immediately apparent, it starts effecting you in the long run.\n\nThe races, even with a shortened lap count are long and can take anywhere from a half-hour to an hour and a half to complete. This isn't so easy to sit down and play, as it really requires the ability to dedicate yourself to complete a full weekend at a time. With that said though, it feels like a well-done Codemaster's injection into a rather straight-forward sport (to the layman at least.)","June 29, 2011","true","16.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

It's not awesome enough apparently. PC in particular, suffers from more issues that the consoles as well; various, random laggy sections (usually in the menus or track intros) regardless of your specs. Apart from the F1 fanboys, and the issues, this game is fantastic. The AI are excellent though seem to turn on a dime, (I assume this was a dev decision, to prevent AI from ramming the player off the track). The weather is amazing along with the ensuing pit strategies for weather changes. It's stunningly gorgeous, all 19 tracks look beautiful and authentic, as well as the 24 car line-up.

The driving is a little on the arcade side, but still difficult and highly enjoyable.  You can choose from basic car setups along with the preferred tyres, weather has an impact on races, and the AI is no pushover - but then again I'm probably not the best driver in the world.  I'm using a basic joystick to control the car and it works extremely well with no configuration needed.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, it doesn't feel dated at all, the career feature is cleanly implemented and easy to understand.  And as others have said, there's no nonsense with KERS or DRS to worry about, its pure racing.  The only negative I see is that it uses Windows Live to save your progress online, when it could have just stored it locally.  I had a hassle getting Live setup and had to go through several iterations where it kept wanting to install updates before the game would load my Live profile, but once that was out of the way it hasn't been a problem.\n\n100% happy with my purchase, I'll be getting many hours of enjoyment from this game.","December 7, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have tried the demo's of the others but have not been taken enough to switch from this one. It is a game I kep coming back to and simply love the graphics and feel of the race cars. My only gripe is that it is a bit easy. I was World Champion in my Sauber in my second season. No matter what difficulty settings you have it simply should not be possible. I play with no assists, legend AI and 30% race weekends. Actually if I turn off driving line and turn on tyre simulation it gets ridiculously tough!

So i decided to buy this game. the handling is great. even with a controller because my steering wheel only works with my xbox.\n\nWould recommend if you are into racing games. or just like F1.\nOnly probelms i had was due to lag spikes ever so often. But all I had to do is lock the FPS to 60fps using my graphics driver.\nFor a game from 2010 it competes with those today.","December 30, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you want to live the life of a Formula 1 driver? Then this is the game for you! The career mode is at the top of the list for any F1 game, including F1 2015 (if you can even call that a career mode). This game is worth every penny, and if you don't mind being years behind, then you will love this.\n\n- Pros -\n\nCareer Mode - This game has the best career mode in any F1 game that I have ever played (which would be all of the Codemasters F1 games). If you want to get as close as you can to living the life of an F1 driver, this is your game. The AI can be a bit stupid at times, but they are better than most of the other games.\n\nAI - While not the best I've ever seen, I would consider them good at least. They aren't as stupid as they are in the other games, so that's a plus. They aren't going to be as racy as say Rfactor AI, but it's pretty good for the F1 franchise.\n\nMultiplayer - If you like playing single player, then you're set. But if you also enjoy playing with your friends or other people, then you're set as well. The multiplayer is the best out of any of the F1 games produced by Codemasters.\n\nSimulation - I can't help but feel this game was made more with simulation in mind. Why, Codemasters, did you dumb down the series so much later on? I loved having to actually brake for the pit stop and remembering to hit the pit limiter. I loved being more in control of the game, rather than it doing everything for me. Maybe it's my love for more "simulation" racing games, but the series is too arcadish now. Not saying that's a bad thing, but I prefer the sim type. This game though, is fairly simulation. While it's still kind of arcade, it takes a lot of mechanics from sims, and I liked that.\n\n- Cons -\n\nPhysics - While people may disagree, I do not like the physics in this game. The car feels a little too slippery, even for an F1 car. I feel like F1 2013 had the best physics for the F1 games. Not too slippery, not too grippy. Maybe it's the setups I use, but the car just feels too slippery for my taste. If this game could have the physics of F1 2013, this could be the perfect F1 game ever created by Codemasters. (I say Codemasters because F1 Championship was probably the best game)\n\nAI - I know I put AI in the pros as well, but sometimes the AI are just plain stupid. The blue flags seem to screw them up quite a bit and they just park it on the apex of a corner, and that's extremely dangerous. It's like dodging ducks on the race track, but ducks shouldn't even be there. The AI are mostly intelligent compared to other Codemasters F1 games, so this isn't a big con.\n\n- Final Verdict -\n\nThis game is easily the best Codemasters F1 games ever made. And for only ten dollars? That's quite a bargain. If you like F1 or even just racing games in general, this game is great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nJust buy the damn game. It's good. You won't regret it.","August 18, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really had no interest much in racing games such as F1, I played a few on the old PS2 years ago, but not much. This is in the top 3 of my favourite steam games.\n\nI bought the game in a sale, for £6.99. At first, I had a few issues getting the game started, and was so fed up and close to refunding the game, however I managed to find a fix on the Steam Community, managed to fix it. I am so glad I have not refunded the game, because it is amazing. Performance is quite good, I don't have a good PC, however can run this game at about 30-45fps.  Whether you win, or lose, the game is still quite enjoyable and rewarding when you get a good result.\n\nAt the moment, there is only 10 hours on my record. This is because I do have a life, and unfortunately can not play this game all the time, however I am expecting to eventually reach a very high play time.","May 1","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
