Others disappoint, leaving you with an empty wallet and an unstimulated mind. And sometimes, once in a very great while, you get far more than what you pay for. Uninvited isn’t the greatest game ever designed, but for a non-sale price of $2.99, it delivers. For all you classic Mac gamers out there, you might have even heard of this game or its series.\n\n– Now in Color! –\nThe original Uninvited was released for Mac in 1986; several ports to other consoles and OS soon followed. A neat feature of this package is the newer, color version of the Apple IIGS Port; I suggest playing this one, at least for your first playthrough or two. After you’ve got a handle on what’s going on, I encourage you to try the original; it’s in greyscale, but the effect is more unnerving when you get to the scary parts (also, sound effects are cooler in the original).\n\n– A True Classic –\nUninvited is an early adventure game that helped shape the face of modern adventure games, a “Missing Link” in the transition from fully text-based to modern character control and exploration. Every object has a unique description and some smaller ones can be moved or picked up. This is a critical element of the game; items you find early on may be needed later on down the road.\n\n– Story –\nThe general backstory is that you and your kid brother have crashed your car outside of a large, spooky mansion. As you rush to get out of your car, it explodes, leaving you stranded. Your brother is nowhere to be found; you must search for him on the estate grounds and in the mansion. Demonic forces are running loose – danger is everywhere. Save frequently; this game has numerous instant-death situations. And don’t dawdle. There’s a counter of how many actions you can perform (including moving stuff and examining objects) before your body is possessed and you lose.\n\n– Difficult? –\nI really liked this game, but, as with all adventure games from the eighties, it is nearly impossible at some points. If you get really stuck, Google search “Kiran S. Kedlaya Uninvited Walkthrough”. Should be on AtariArchives.\n\n– What I Liked/Disliked –\nThis game is funny if you have a macabre sense of humor. There are numerous ways to kill yourself that are quite amusing; oftentimes you won’t realize it until it’s too late. Then you debate whether to get angry that you have to replay the last five or more minutes or laugh at how idiotic your character really is. The object descriptions are all very humorous in a condescending manner, further solidifying your subconscious theory that the protagonist is an idiot.\n\nThis game is really, really tough. There’s a ton of backtracking, loads of insta-death situations, seemingly useless objects are actually essential while others that look promising are just red herrings, lots of annoying thunder SFX scripted sequences that slow you down while exploring and, to top it all off, a “time limit” that kills you if you don’t figure out what’s going on in time. Aside from difficulty and annoying thunder, though, there’s really nothing to complain about in this game; it’s a fun, cheap brainteaser.\n\n– The Price is Right! –\nThis game is only $2.99 offsale. If it goes on sale (especially under  $1), you have no excuse not to buy it. It’s very worth it. Also, there are Steam trading cards, if you’re into that.\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\n- Recommended\nHighly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential","July 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Playing a New Game after knowing what to do up to a certain point goes by quick, as most of the game is trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nIf you liked these kinds of old adventure games, I highly recommend this for a small distraction!","November 16, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Between Shadowgate providing a great fantasy dungeon delving scenario, and Defa Vu giving its players a noir detective story to play through, the Uninvited filled its niche in the series very well, allowing its players to explore a very creepy and haunted pixelated mansion while looking for their missing sister. I didn't originally play this version (my experience was with the NES game) but it still holds up quite well and reminds me of the dark and cloudy October days of my youth, puzzling my way through rooms, finding my way through the labyrinth, and being completely engrossed in the experience. Having it for steam allows me to revisit those days again. The only thing missing from this game would be the music, which I don't believe was part of the game until it was released for the NES. Regardless, one can easily put on the OST in the background, start up the Uninvited and revisit the days when horror games were scarcer, and the Uninvited had a special place in our game library as THE horror game.","March 24","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Similarly to Myst, you have to piece together clues to progress, and whilst I found the game unrelenting in its difficulty, I can't say I didn't enjoy my time with Uninvited.","November 15, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
