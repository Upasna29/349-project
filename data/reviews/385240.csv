"http://steamcommunity.com/id/titomosquito187/recommended/385240/","titomosquito187","TITOMOSQUITO187","http://steamcommunity.com/id/titomosquito187/","966 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile the selling point of this game is the usage of popular pop culture and political figures, they have little necessity to the game itself other than to give a few laughs when you see somthing like "Oscar Wilde holds Washington down in a pool of water, slowly killing him.", only to be followed with the next update being "Wilde decides to go swimming in a pond". What a ruthless SOB that guy is! Of course seeing things like "Trump drowns Putin" feel relevant to world events of today, but are mostly random in this simulation game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673721178\n\nSo what is this? Well...it is a simulation survival game in which you are allowed to create hundreds of characters on your own, as well as use the pre-creted ones, and then have them try to survive in an ever increasing world of dangers. The default characters tossed into the game all have their own images like Trump, Putin, Zuckerberg (He was a beast in one of my sims killing about 5 people), Notch, etc., but you can change all thse images to anything you want for their player cards (not sure why you would want to), as well as give them all your own "favorite quote" that you think each may say. You can add as many new players as you want as well. There are about 50 I think, which makes the "Random characters" option for a quick game a bit silly as it requires at least 100 chatracters for the option to work, which means you have to create over 50 more characters yourself for that option to be viable.\n\nAfter customizing your players to what you want them to be, they are all randomly thrown into the world and randomly interact with it and eachother until their ultimate demise. You can change a few stats on them, but I can't see any real benefit to that so far as I maxed out all of Trump's stats while doing nothing to anyone else (everyone else has a default stat set of 5/10 on all stats), and Trump still wasn't killing people off any better than anyone else, and in my game he actually died trying to escape the arena despite me continually giving him food and watter, while not helping hardly anyone else. (Which may happen when Trump is ultimately impeached after becoming president MIRITE!?)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673720290\n\nThe characters all appear as tiny little stick men on the screen and if you click on them you can see their player card, which allows you to move, feed, or kill them as well as showing their pictures. You have some other windows that you can pop up to allow you to see who has died and how, see who is teamed up, etc.\n\nYou can help some of your favorites by giving them food an water to keep them from dying of hunger and thirst, or just flat out "kill" other players you don't like, but in the end they are all subject to some sort of RNG as to when, or if they will die. Most of the in-sim options to leave care packages don't seem to work that well that I can tell. They seem to sit on the map forever even if you place them right in line with the players as they walk over them. You can start "Events" too like acid rain, weird fogs, etc. that have an impact on all the characters. I only started a few, and it looks as if they are random too because you can't pick which event you want to start. I have no idea how many of these there are, but I hope there are many, and they are all more ridiculous than the last.\n\nFor $1.99 I can't say it is too expensive for this, and I generally found it rather entertaining to play. You can make it simulate hundreds of created characters and just let it run at any speeds you like. The defualt is 150x normal speed, but if you want to read all the things that happen early on you should lower it to around 50x or less if you plan to add more than about 25 players to your sim. I didn't find any bugs so far, and it is fun to let it simulate for an hour, or more if you make hundreds of characters, just to see what the results are. I'd like to see more ways to look at the logs and find after game results, but overall it is worthy of the $1.99 price tag and fun enough for a few hours of sim play.\n\nThere are trading cards, which currently are worth a fair amount in a 5 card set due to there being some very in demand emoticons such as Donald Trump, Bernie, Hillary, etc., and of course "Awoo!" being the big emote get for $$$ and "yah...i no wut dat iz i'm Rule #^_^". So at $1.99 your 3 card drops can probably be sold for well over $1 total to cut the cost of this game in half if you buy it right away. :P","April 26","true","2.0"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","36","39","5","3"

I basically knew what I was getting into, but its actually more useless than even the negative reviews led me to believe.  I understand that its not really a game so much as a simulator that you mostly watch with little interaction.  It is mildly entertaining watching reports roll in like, "Phil Collins bashes Hitler's head in with a brick," but the novelty wears off quickly.\n\nThe problem is, that there really isn't a simulator here.  I wouldn't mind watching this in a hands-off way if there was more going on with the simulator, but its really just completely random.  you might as well just write a list of celebrities on a sheet of paper then roll some dice to see who dies.\n\nIt has "arena events" and you can even add your own, but the events are nothing more than a title, flavor text, and a percent chance for each character to die.  Events do absolutely nothing else, just kill a percentage of the characters and report each death with a piece of flavor text.\n\nJust not good enough, not even for two bucks.  There are already games a lot like this called "life simulators" where you watch hundreds of dots thrive and survive in a survival of the fittest environment, and most of these life simulators are much more indepth than ultimate arena for the same cost.  In most of the life simulators, you can set entity behavior and  traits and watch your little microcosm play out.","April 29","false","4.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

The premise is that characters from literature (Tom Sawyer, Moby ♥♥♥♥(?)), science (Plato, Newton, Steve Jobs), history (Columbus, Churchhill, Rosa Parks) politics (dare I say: Trump, Cruz, Bernie, The Queen) fight it out on a rugged, though primitive and minimalist, top-down landscape.\n\nUltimate Arena has dozens of fighters to choose from, as well as an editor, and there seems to be no limit to the number than can fight together. Basically, the player clicks START, then sits back and waits for reports to come in as the battle progresses on its own. Players can add to the number of land mines, provide a "care package" individually, or trigger random events such as attacks by rabid cats.\n\nAnd of course you can tilt the stakes by editing the stats for your favorites....or favorite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. (Or add yourself as Superboss!)\n\nUltimate Areana constantly generates reports on actions and deaths (or not, by choice) such as "Cruz forgets what he's doing", "Hitler takes a bath", "Marilyn falls face-first on a land mine and blows up", "Oscar Wilde kills Ghandi.". You know....fun stuff, and SO historically accurate in every possible way.\n\nFor the price, I say Ultimate Arena is a fun game to have running in the background while you're doing something more worthwhile....like watching Titanic yet again (....yawn..) or masturbating.","March 1","true","0.6"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","16","30","7","0"

Shortly afterwards, Gandhi held Hitler's head underwater until he stopped moving. And Jeremy Beadle fell face first onto a land mine... I shouldn't laugh at any of these, but I couldn't help myself. Apparently I also now have a new very evil laugh.\n\nWhat else you wanna know? It's a game that lets you pit anyone you like against anyone else, in a (crudely drawn) random arena. You can drop landmines and care packages, or trigger random events. Nuff said.\n\nThe game *could* use some more starting characters though, like 50 or so, which would let you use the "random characters" start option. Be nice to be able to drop more than land mines and care packages as well (maybe weapons crates? Would be useful...). At least you can create more characters yourself and create new events (although again, it'd be nice to have more control over what events actually happen, but having Charlie Sheen eaten by fire ants was kinda entertaining...)\n\nRecommended for those need-a-quick-fix-of-evil five minutes.","May 21","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In adding/editing a character, you can give them stat boosts or handicaps based on characteristics like strength, agility, intelligence, etc. However, past character creation the game is pretty shallow with regards to features. The controller can drop mines (which almost always kill people), care packages (which I have never seen picked up), and start "events". I have only seen two or three different types of events, and I haven't noticed anything change after the event. The characters' health stay the same, and no one is ever killed during events (in my experience).\n\nThe developers also thought of this cool little bit: Alliances. In larger games the participants will form alliances with one another if one or both run into each other unaffiliated with an existing alliance. This is a cool idea, however the extent of their alliance's function is to keep allies from killing one another when they come into contact. This is bad when the game is down to two people in the same alliance, as the gamecould go on indefinitely. Also, Allies should stick together, but here they run about randomly like headles chickens.\n\nSo here's my request: MORE FEATURES!\n\nThis game could be so cool! If the controller had more things to do aside from sit and watch the little gingerbread men run into one another. Create more options for the controller to interact with the participants. More variety in the updates screen would be cool too. Make map sizes, terrains (or at least describe the terrains that are already present, like the brown areas (Mountains?)), make it so that only Jesus can walk on water, and make the events more than just a message at the bottom of the screen.\n\nGreat job so far, really looking forward to progress and updates!","March 16","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The look of the game cannot be any simpler: it is a bunch of white figures on a crude map background. There were a few times the game crashed on me (how this is possible I do not know), but the rest of the functions seemed to work as intended. The menus register clicks, the maps are randomized and the image uploader didn't cause any issues. The game manages to almost work perfectly, but considering how little is here it should be.\n\nThe game is comprised of two phases: selecting candidates and watching the outcome of the arena match. You can use images to create new candidates which adds to the total count. While watching the match, you can lay down mines, care packages, or start a event which can make life harder for the remaining contenders. Play by play commentary is displayed on the right side of the screen showing who killed who, if someone drank or ate, and if someone is losing sanity. Once the final contender is left, they are displayed as the winner in quick match or the game resets and starts again if it is an endless match. This is the entire game, watching little people run around a screen until one is left.\n\nThis is a tough candidate to rate. The task the developer has set out to achieve is complete in this game, but it barely qualifies as an interactive medium and acts more like a movie than a game. I cannot in good faith recommend this game due to the clear lack of gameplay and content. If this program has any use, it might be for picking potential winners of the Super Bowl. You could just as easily put names in a hat to fulfill this assignment though.\n\nPros\n\n- It mostly works\n\nCons\n\n- No real gameplay\n- No content\n- Few crashes","April 28","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Its a flash movie that you have a vauge amount of control over.\n\nBut i am getting ahead of myself. "Ultimate Arena" is a flash game currently asking $1.99, with its lauch sale reducing the price by a dollar. I was one of the first buyers of the game, buying it when it came out within the hour, and only paid a palty admition fee to experience what i thought was a neat concept.\n\nThe concept of the game is that its a simulator for the popular "Lets throw random people in an arena and have them kill each other" genre that is so popular with movies these days. And thats it. Thats the game. You click to choose who you want in your little match, the EA verison having about 40 or so characters from history. This includes Stalin, Gahndi, Hitler, and so on. Random historical figures that the devs didnt need to pay money to use the likeness of\n\nDespite the "very positive" review that this game is currently showing (as of 3/19/16), when you look at the reviews, you notice that all of their total playtime adds up to be less than 2-3 hours apiece. So while this game does have a silly concept, its nothing buy a toy you play with once and then uninstall. There is very little interaction with the game once you actually start playing, save for the "arena tropes" like sending supplies or dropping mines. But even then, its a game that does not need you. At all.\n\n\nAll in all, this was a silly concept without a whole lot of depth or actual gameplay. If it was on sale for 50 cents or less (american dollars), yeah pick it up and have a laugh or two while you wait for your other games to install.

You take different famous people, stick them into an arena, and let them brawl to the very finish. You have very little to no input on the match itself, but you set the fighters and the match settings and then let the game begin.\n\nThe real beauty of the game isn't in the match itself, but in the Updates Log, where you can monitor the action of all the participants and see what they're doing. An update might be as dramatic as one man spearing another and killing him, or it might be as simple as someone taking a bath. However, the ridiculousness of each update provides the entertainment here. You migt see that a spiteful crow has stolen Beethoven's bread roll, or that Steve Jobs just gouged out Franz Kafka's eye. The combination of silly events and placement of historical figures allows the game to work.\n\nHowever, if you're not looking for that kind of humor, but instead an actual game, where you can interact with the environment and feel like you are accomplishing something, then this game is probably not for you.","March 16","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","6"

The updates can be a little bit funny at times but that's all the game really has to offer other than some customization. However where this game really shines is the emotes. I would go so far as to say this game exists solely for the emotes and nothing else. You've got Trump, bernie, Hillary and best of all you've got :awoo:.\n\nAlso, the game pays for itself and more. The emotes can cost more than $2 (:awoo: costs an absolutely insane $30) and the trading cards are $0.60+ so if nothing else you can make a profit here.","March 28","true","11.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can see this game doing very well if the developer stays active with community which seems to be the case!","February 29","true","2.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

When you are making the map and selecting the charcters can you make it select the a.i s intellagence, what I mean by that is that they wont walk past a care package they well actually use it or not just stand next to a enemy. Would love a team system what I mean by that is you can ever say team red and instead of the regular white it would be like red, blue, orange, green etc and they would work together to attack the enemy team.

Best dollar I ever spent.\n\nThe way the game works is you pick whatever fighters you want in the arena (there are already several pre made and you can make as many more as you want) then watch them kill or be killed by other fighters, random events, or hunger and thirst. The last fighter standing wins.\n\nFun way to pick a raffle winner or settle an argument.","March 9","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth the price if you have a few bucks to spend. I'd suggest waiting until this game is more developed and has more features. Also the devs need to fix that copyrighted stuff.\n\nEDIT: In the description of the game it talks about features that aren't in the game yet such as steam workshop and certain events. It should be in the Early Access tab for things they wish to add but, just know that those aren't in the game as of writing this.","March 28","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, the main reason i'm recommending this is because it is SO MUCH FUN in that first hour of gameplay. Just watching some of history's greatest people(and a stray dog) fight to the death is actually awesome, and just watching and seeing what happens will really brighten your day.\n\nBut after an hour, I say it loses most of it's touch. I still am able to get pleasure out of it, and my brother loved seeing some of the stuff happening, and he usually hates these types of games. But a big reason it starts to get boring, is because A LOT of stuff starts to repeat. The main reason it's so much fun for the first hour is because you get to see a lot of stuff happen that you weren't expecting. But soon, you see just about everything the game has to show at the moment. Granted, they do allow you to create new characters and events, and that's pretty fun. I actually made a YouTuber arena, full of some of my favorites and least favorites fighting to the death, and that was one of my favorite things to watch all week.\n\nAnd for S2, this is still worth a buy if you are looking for a good hour or two of fun. But at the moment, I think i'm gonna try to refund it, and just buy it again later. When it has more to offer, i'll be one of the many who returns to give this game another shot. But until than, I think i'm just gonna play Brantsteele.\n\nPros :\n* Really fun for an hour or two\n* Plenty of ways for the contestants to interact, even if some are repeated a bit too much\n* Allows you to create your own cast of characters to fight\n* Able to directly influence the combat by allowing you to add landmines, send in packages, and start death events\n\nCons :\n* Gets boring due to lack of content in some fields\n* Feels limited due to the concept\n* Isn't technically a game, acts more like an interactable simulation\n\nPersonal Score : 6/10(It's Okay!))","May 14","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
