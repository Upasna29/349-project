"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/447190/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","It’s been a LONG while since I’ve been compelled to write a review, and it took a game so incredibly bad to push me over the edge, but I’m doing it for posterity.  I simply cannot let the horrors of Pub Encounter go unannounced.  This review will be less formal than most, as the emotions boiling within me are too strong to temper with pretty words and structured paragraphs, so I apologize in advance.  I also apologize to anyone who has played this and absolutely loved it.  Save yourself the anger over what I’m about to say and scroll past the following paragraphs right to the “thumbs down” button as I am sure you will feel obliged to do.  But let it be known that I begrudge no one their pleasures. I have some rather odd fetishes myself, but Pub Encounter is well beyond what I would consider enjoyable in any way.  If there’s one word I would use to describe how I feel about it, it would be disgusted…and dirty.  Ok, so two words.\n\nI’ve always found the idea of romancing older characters in otome games intriguing.  This is ground that is rarely tread upon, and to finally see a title that unabashedly embraces the premise was exciting beyond belief.  I just knew I had to play Pub Encounter as the potential for interesting and unconventional storytelling was evident.  If only I hadn’t been blinded by my enthusiasm, perhaps I would have been prepared for what I was about to face.  Truthfully, even the game title was a huge red flag that I ignored in my starry-eyed daze.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673359399\nPub Encounter begins with our stressed out protagonist stopping at a bar after work for a drink and to put another day of mistakes behind her.  Walking into the dimly-lit establishment, she is faced with 5 middle-aged men, 3 of which instantly begin drooling over her as if she were the fresh kill that the pack leader just drug in.  I’m no expert on human interaction, but I’m pretty sure men in their 40’s and 50’s do not act anything like the characters in this game.  Even pubescent teenage boys do not act anywhere near as creepy as these men.  If this were me, after being nearly accosted by the lawyer and writer of the group, I’d have quickly drained my glass and left, never to return.  But our young and “intelligent” protagonist decides to make her way back to the bar yet again as one of the potential sex offenders has lingered on her mind ever since.\n\nAside from the fact that the novel was clearly written for the sole purpose of having the MC sleep with her chosen beau as many times as can be squeezed into a story that is only 8 chapters long (9 if you count the ending), the writing is absolutely atrocious.  To be fair, the translation itself is pretty good with few typos and awkward phrasings; but the things these characters say, how they act and carry themselves, and the lack of intriguing (not to mention plausible) back stories for any of the leads makes reading through the drudge a painful chore.  My brain began shutting down after finishing the second of the five routes, and as I started up Mr. Cop’s storyline, I felt sweat beading on my forehead as I faced another 3+ hours of mind-numbing boredom.  There is no substance present at all, and the characters are so poorly conceived that I could not find within me any semblance of interest in experiencing how their stories resolved.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682369947\nThis is to say nothing of the protagonist who is the most frustrating and stupid character I’ve ever had the displeasure of playing.  She constantly places herself in situations that in real life would have had her dead on the side of the road somewhere. Then there’s the fact that she trusts and falls for these men without knowing ANYTHING about them except that they want her so bad they can’t take it.\n\nWhich leads me to Pub Encounter completely squandering its potential for romance with older characters. I realize some of the effect may be lost in translation as the MC may be speaking more formally to them in Japanese, but the stories themselves barely emphasize the age difference at all. It's just the MC getting all hot for one of the guys, some ridiculous back story, and then 3+ chapters of them screwing each other's brains out. And the sex scenes aren't even appealing or titillating, they’re embarrassingly awkward and stupid.  At one point I questioned whether the writer even understands how the human body works.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681366354\nI realize that R18 otome titles are rare, and that many female readers are desperate for anything they can get their hands on, but we need to demand better.  If this is what passes for mature storytelling, I'll pass.  I'll take a well-written, yet chaste, love story over this tripe any day of the week. The allure of the chase, blossoming relationship and eventual confession of love is lost when the MC has already fallen head over heels for her beau and sleeps with him by Chapter 3.  Though perhaps it was my mistake expecting anything more of Pub Encounter than the trashy erotica that it is.\n\nBottom Line: Strongly Not Recommended!","May 13","false","30.6"," 113 of 119 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","113","119","16","13"

The reason may be poor translation, but sadly it's not an excuse.\n\nWhat am I talking about exactly?\n\nSloppy writing.  Very lazy, very unrealistic, dialogues looks so fake, there's absolutely no way someone could read it and be like: "yeah... That's how people talk to each other in real life!". This is a visual novel and I stand by my point that visual novels should be based on solid writing. I can survive not-so-good graphic and not-so-good music, but not this.\n\nCharacters. Honestly I bought this game, because I thought that since characters are older than standard otome love interests, maybe the whole game will be more mature. But no. Don't count on that. If not because of art and the fact that they introduce themselves to you and tell you their age, based on their act I could not recognize that they are truly more mature.\n\nProtagonist.  It's obvious yet still painful. It's a huge sin of great amount of games that are coming out from various studios (usually Asian ones though). I get it - cultural difference. But we can have awesome anime and manga female characters yet in those sort of game, protagonist is almost always the same - weak, with no personality whatsoever, completely submissive, and innocent, and soft-spoken and... No, she's not just "shy" as you may think right now. She is literally bland. There's no substance to her and absolutely no way I could find any common ground with this character.\n\nStory . So yeah, imagine that. Young girl comes to the bar where usually only "mature men" are present. Of course she is noticed immediately. She wants the drink so one of characters ask her what's wrong. She says few sentences about job, which are basically dismissed (because come on, we don't want to give protagonist to much lines of dialogue) and then our "mature men" start to act all childish like, which I assume is this game version of characters introduction. Well, it's bad. Then after this one night we get to choose which character we want to pursue. And then the girl wakes up, thinking about this one man that stand out sooo much, that she just can't not think about him and need to come back and sit with this "pleasant" company, just to have few line of unrealistic dialogue and then few totally random encounters. It's first chapter, those two characters doesn't even know each other yet they feel somehow oblige to explain themselves and act in certain manner as if they were dating already. There's no feel of actual developing a relationship or "getting to know" each other. Oh and yeah, various characters "randomly" bump into each other all the time. Which is explained by... wait for it... fate. Seems legit!\n\nMusic. Annoying. Turn it off and play your own, this will be more pleasant experience.\n\n... or just don't bother, unless it gets huge discount.","April 13","false","0.7"," 68 of 94 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","68","94","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ButtfartPrincesspantsVIII/recommended/447190/","ButtfartPrincesspantsVIII","Buttfart Princesspants VIII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ButtfartPrincesspantsVIII/","215 products in account","Well, I think I've played enough to know how this game will go, and to make a review with the general idea.\n\n\nThis is yet another game brought to you by the people who made "the Men of Yoshiwara" who have recently released "Destiny's Princess".  The HUD and options menu are exactly the same as these two games, which is nice since it's a simple and well designed one with the option of a skip button.\n\nSadly, I don't think they should've rushed to get this out so close to their other release. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but it feels like a seperate part of the company worked on this game and it feels a lot different than the previous two. Don't walk into this expecting bishies and girly romance. It starts with you leaving work after a miserable day and entering a bar full of over-familiar middle aged men and you basically go from there.\n\nThe art is a lot different from the other games, especially around the eyes, which I think was a bad choice. I think it was intended to make sure you knew they were older, but it just put me off. It's nice to see them at least experimenting with their art styles. The music is also pretty chill - not as good as Destiny's Princess music, but it's not something you'll mute when you play.\n\nI think this game was intended for slightly older otome players and not players that just want cute bishies for their 16+ aged protagonist, and I think this can be seen by the fact your character is above the legal drinking age and casually walks into bars when she's feeling rubbish after work (work that she's been at for over a year, might I add). I know this might be off-putting to some players since the romantic interests are older, but bear in mind that the protagonist is older too. Although in my humble opinion, I really don't like the old, white haired bar tender, so I think I'll leave that route to others.\n\nI romanced Mamoru Arashiro because I'm shallow and he was pretty. The actual content of the game was very impressive - I found the dialogue flowed way smoother in this game than in previous games, and the characters felt a lot more human. It wasn't feudal Japan or formal concubines - it was just some guys chilling out in your local pub, which I really enjoyed because the characters, once again, felt like they were more relatable than they were in "The men of yoshiwara" and even more so than they were in "Destiny's Princess" which I'd actually complimented for it's character development. This game definitely focuses more on story, plot and characters than it does on art (although I wager the art style in this one took them longer) and I'm still debating whether this is good or bad.\n\nRegardless, it's nice that the company has branched out to different styles and trying different methods - change like this isn't always a bad thing, and I think it's lovely that older players can feel less like kougars romancing barely 20 year old men in every other available game.\n\nIt's also worth a mention that I find this game similar to anime I've read where the protagonist ends up living with an older man - it feels like it has that charm.\n\nOverall, I would say don't walk into this expecting the typical "Yoshiwara/Destiny's Princess" formula and setting. Don't buy it if you think dating older men is creepy, because there are no "younger" options, you should stick to Yoshiwara etc for that. I would buy this game, since it's on sale and one of the few otome games we as a community have on steam (albeit that is changing rapidly lately), and it's not a bad game at all, I've rather enjoyed it. However, if you're stuck between this game and "Amnesia: memories" or "Destiny's Princess" etc, I would grab those games instead of this one. Unless you're up for something a little different.","April 13","true","10.1"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","43","53","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/missshinrai/recommended/447190/","missshinrai","Shinrai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/missshinrai/","169 products in account","A relatively straight forward Otome Game by the creators of "The men of Yoshiwara" and "Destiny's Princess".\n\nThe game is different from the two mentioned above. The focus here lies in a modern, mature slice of life-Romance with relatable & deep character evolvement (much more than in the games above) and an older female protagonist who can be quite sweet & cool (seriously i loved her bold "Come at me bro!"-attitude in Ryus routes. In others she was more naive/shy/sensitive/supportive but not the extreme dumb damsel in distress which i hate most of the time in most otome games). But i wished i could handle some situations with a bit more sassyness or independent behaviour.\n\nIn some routes there are quite a few crime, mystery or psychological elements. Aaand drinking. A lot. Learned a lot about beautiful cocktails thanks to that game hehe.\n\nSome routes are a bit longer than others, one guy has 2 routes, but most of them have next to their normal Sequel Story another one which you unlock after playing both endings for their character (acces via Main Menu>Sequel Scenario).\nQuite a lot of content (Main routes, sequel, date, another sequel etc.).\n\nIf you looking for a game with pure romance, this is not really your game. It tries to show what it means to be in a relationship - with all the lovey dovey stuff, but with deep emotional bonding and conflicts, too. What it means to get stressed and frustrated and how to overcome that. How to build up trust for one another. Because the guys are older and the protagonist is adult sexual themes can be quite steamy here via text. No direct scenes though (except kissing/face shots like in Destiny's Princess). In contrast to other mature otomes i played it tries to show sexual things in a positive and joyful consentual way, which i liked.\n\nIf  sex frightens you or men who are a bit bold/teasing/can't handle their desire for you all the time because they love you so much don't play this game. They are not that forceful, but quite kinky at times ;P. And don't play this game if you think all older men are just pervy creeps.\n\nBut i hope you are an open minded person who gives a crap about age. This game can surprise you :).\nThe guys are very sweet. Everyone of them has a distinct, individual and complex personality with strength and flaws. No clichés detected so far which i liked. The stories can be a bit soap opera like at times (i had to laugh because it was hilarious). I liked how they showed scenes from the perspectives of the guys (like how they see the protag, come to understand their feelings for  her or how they reflect their relationship with their barfriends etc.).\n\nThe graphics are different from the other games so far. At the beginning it put me a bit off, because the guys looked so ill,sick,tired  (sorry english is not my native language). But after a few hours of gameplay i give a damn about it -> personality & story ftw. The Cgs were very focused on faces and hands. There are fewer CGs like in the other games.\n\nThe music is nice, very soothing at times thanks to piano and jazzy cozy atmosphere overall.\nVery few typos so far detected. The translation is solid and easy to understand.\n\nWho likes to try a refreshing take on otome games, is not afraid/shy of older men and want to support otome releases here on Steam should consider to buy this game (10, 79 > *snip*)","April 13","true","21.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

With that said, it isn't exactly like The Men of Yoshiwara, so try not to go in expecting that. The biggest difference, at least for me, was the characters. The LIs of Pub Encounter are mature, middle-aged men, as the game frequently reminds you. I didn't see this as a bad thing. In fact, it was refereshing to see a cast of characters in an otome game that were not barely legal, at best. That said, I felt that Pub Encounter plays kind of fast and loose with the term "middle-aged". Some of the men I'd put at mid-thirties, where others are quite a bit older than that. Again, not really a bad thing, just a minor complaint. The art style wasn't awful, it just felt unpolished. There was a lot of detail put into making the men's eyes appear older, but some other areas were a bit lacking. I did like the MC a lot, though. She has more personality than many MCs in other otome games and sticks up for herself more. It's nice to see that games are now starting to cater to an audience that wants an independent heroine, not a glorified damsel in distress. The overall plot is decent. I'm not typically into slice of life, but I found the story engaging enough to hold my interest long enough to complete a route and make me curious enough to pursue another. Do be warned, though, there are sexual themes in this game. You don't get any CGs of it, like some other VNs, but there are some very discriptive bits of text that accomplish the same goal. If you are not interested in playing a game where a younger woman enters a romantic/sexual relationship with a man older than she, do not buy this.\n\nOther than that, I do recommend the game. It's got high replayability, the characters are likeable enough, and the plot is decent.","April 14","true","2.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubynxt/recommended/447190/","rubynxt","rubynxt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rubynxt/","10 products in account","This visual novel is definitely for more mature audiences. Would only recommend if you are 16+. Partly because there are plenty of steamy scenes, and also to ensure you understand that these stories are not a handbook for real life, healthy relationships. There are a couple of characters that heavily manipulate the protagonist in their relationship, and she's more than happy to be used. Don't learn from that!\n\nThe whole premise is to explore a relationship between a young adult female and a middle-aged man that she meets at a pub. It reads very much like a normal novel instead of an interactive story, sometimes you get to see the story from the perspective of both the protagonist and the other characters. The choices you  make affect your 'likeability', deciding if you get the Good or Best ending (both are worth reading).\n\nThe protagonist has a very distinct personality and often has internal monologues, so you pretty much feel like you're reading about someone else's story  or a printed novel instead of being in control of the game. Her personality differs slightly for each character's route. In general, she is easily manipulated, submissive, blushes easily, hyper sensitive to touch and intimacy, and acts like a high-school virgin even though she is in her mid-20s. It's a little disturbing how these older men keep calling her adorable and making a big fuss about how her cuteness makes her attractive. Also disturbing is how the protagonist keeps choosing to drown her work sorrows in alcohol when maybe she should just find a new job and a healthier source of self-esteem.\n\nThat aside, the stories are emotional, dramatic, and overall well-written. All of the stories are interesting in their own way, however not all of the routes focus on exploring the age gap factor. The characters have strong personalities and at the end of the day, you will feel like you know them very well. One nice touch that makes the experience more immersive is that the characters change their pose or expressions with each dialogue box, so it feels as if they are really reacting to the conversation with you.\n\nI've played all of the main routes so here's a quick guide to the different characters.\n\n- Ryunosuke: The most decent guy of the lot. Formal until you get to know him better. Status gap doesn't seem to be an issue, although it should be. Story feels like two young adults going out together on normal dates. One of the routes where the protagonist isn't a submissive doormat.\n\n- Mamoru: Very forward and flirty. Can't keep his hands to himself. Has the steamiest route, half the time you guys are getting it on. Story depth is disappointing considering the setting, he could be placed in any other game and would fit right in. Protagonist makes me want to punch my screen. She's easily manipulated, submissive, and controlled. This route makes for quick and dirty entertainment, I guess.\n\n- Hideaki: Really friendly and outgoing guy that doesn't act his age but is very concious of the age gap. The only one with an ordinary job and status. This is the closest you can get to a typical office guy. Very emotional story. Protagonist is stronger in this route and goes through a lot of tough moments to support him.\n\n- Soichiro: The pub owner and the oldest. Possibly 60 or 70 even? Very gentlemanly with a few tricks up his sleeve. Despite being attracted to the protagonist, he suspects that she has misguided affection (or puppy love) for him, which makes him hesitant to return any advances. The story largely focuses on the emotional bonding between them.\n\n- Yorihisa: Seems like the thoughtful, intelligent type but he's even more manipulative than Mamoru. He tricks the protagonist into entering into a relationship with him then plays with her feelings througout. He totally takes advantage of the fact that she's a desperate fangirl to get what he wants.","May 2","true","17.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/recommended/447190/","narucch","☆ Naruchin ☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/","120 products in account","I am a fan of the Forbidden Romance series and have most of the games on my phone already. These otomes are not afraid to be different (looking at you, Voltage cookie cutter formula) and are more adult in their writing and themes. Pub Encounter always caught my attention while browsing the selection but I never downloaded it, so I was happy when it came out on Steam.\n\nPremise number 1: I am not particularly interested in older men.\nPremise number 2: I like strong, indenpendant MCs who can carry their own weight.\nWith that said, I played through the routes of Hideaki and Mamoru, read the first 3 chapters of Yorihisa before force-skipping, and force-skipped the other 3 routes for the achievements. I can't really talk about Yorihisa, Soichiro and Ryunosuke's routes, since the guys aren't my types, but I don't fault the game for that.\nThe romance progresses quickly. The game isn't a journey to know each other that culminates with a kiss, MC and the love interest get together early on and have to overcome an obstacle together. This 'obstacle' is very dramatic, and lots of crying will happen. The game touches mature themes and questions fairly well. Also the MC gets laid A LOT.\n- Hide's route is easily my favorite. This policeman is a sweet guy and with him the MC can be somewhat assertive. His trauma is rooted deeply and you unveil it slowly; I thought the game handled it well.\n- Mamoru works as a lawyer and his tattoo screams yakuza. Guess what the main drama will involve. While his looks gave it away, it's not actually that simple, and I appreciated it. The MC gets laid a lot in his route.\n- Yorihisa is an author and university lecturer. His route plays with the stereotypical narrative of a game of love in which the first to fall in love loses. Would have actually enjoyed it if the MC didn't spoil it with her attitude.\n\nThe MC was actually the reason I gave up on Yorihisa's route and brute-forced my way to the achievements via skipping.\nGet ready for a 100% otoge MC, folks. She whines. A lot. She blushes at the slightest touch. She gets dizzy while thinking about the man she loves.. According to her, being liked was enough to set her heart racing and making her flustered and incapable of putting a sentence together without stuttering. She also calls herself 'a little kid' compared to the men; I approached the game thinking she was in her mid-20s but realized she is probably younger than me. She even gets mistaken for a high schooler.\n\nI am a fairly speedy reader and each route took me around 3 hours to complete. The lenght is a plus, although it did feel a bit dragged towards the end. I am not a native speaker, but I thought the translation flowed well and I didn't see many mistakes.\n\nI enjoyed the art. It's anime but it's different. Mamoru was quite handsome and the rest of the guys weren't half bad either. The CGs were quite pretty but the MC had eyes only in some. Shoutout to the backgrounds (looking at you again, Voltage, with your low quality 3D render backgrounds in your AAA titles). Still sad that there is no e-mote system in the Steam ports, but oh well :)\n\nI don't usually care for the music but the (very) few tracks were enjoyable, and one in particular I really liked (the second song in the video, I'm obsessed!).\n\nIt might look as if I hated the game, quite the opposite. I like crazy narratives like these, I like otomes, I am in love with the Forbidden Romance series, so I ended up liking the routes I read. I think this game in particular suffers from a straight up port: in the mobile version one can read the first chapter of each guy before purchasing a route, here it's all bundled up. Considering it includes sequel scenarios, date scenarios and extra stories, the price is great, but if you are unsure, I'd suggest to download the Android/iOS version first to try.\nDo I recommend it? Yes, IF you like the kind of narrative (get together early to overcome a dramatic obstacle), you don't mind a whiny, easily flustered MC, and if the description of the guys catch your attention.","April 28","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Apparently, in some weird upside-down alternate universe, this is what we're missing out on.\n\nThe guys' stories are not too bad, but the prologue was a big awkward social scenario that would never, ever happen in real life.  Okay, okay, I admit, if *anything* about this game was realistic, then I wouldn't be a lonely post-20's alcoholic sitting at home playing otome. I'd be going to the bar, like.  Every. Single. Night.\n\nThe story's sexy parts felt a little too mosaic-censored.  I was hoping for just a little more detail in the text.  Also, the story text switches without warning to the guy's POV several times, briefly, and it kinda threw me off.\n\nLike others have said, there are some typos and weird translations.  Annoying sure, but not so frequent that you can't look past it.  While it's not perfect, it's still slightly more polished than other otome for on mobile.\n\nThe engine seems polished enough.  I didn't run into any bugs or crashes.  Some of the game options are a little inscrutable.  I didn't even figure out how to switch to full screen until after I finished one guy's whole story.  herp derp :(\n(Hint: during the game, press escape, then click "screen change"...)\n\nAll in all, cute story, cute guys. Best paired with red wine. :D","April 21","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

I think it's decent enough and for the discount price, its worth it to me. I'm not sure I'd pay full price, as it seems the publishers needed to do a bit more work with localizing it and ensuring that the text makes sense. Because of this, it makes me hesitent to want to purchase any of their other releases.","April 16","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With the exception of Mamoru's route and (to some extent) Ryu's route the storylines were pretty boring. Also, the artwork can be a little creepy at times. Most of the guys are only supposed to be in their 40's but they look ancient here. I think the artists got a little too carried away with the lines around their eyes.\n\nThe game's romance options are:\n-Mamoru: a flirty lawyer with a dark past\n-Ryu: a serious CEO with trust issues towards the opposite sex\n-Hideaki: an easy going police officer\n-Yorihisa: a cynical writer (who in my opinion was the biggest d-bag out of the guys)\n-Soichiro: the sincere bar tender (who felt the creepiest to romance based on the way he was drawn.)\n\nI'd love to see more quality otome games be released like Amnesia and Dandelion Wishes. So, I feel bad not giving this one a good review, but I just can't say I'd recommend it.","April 16","false","11.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

Interesting men and interesting storylines. It's not the typical VN with teenage girls/boys, and that's nice for a change. Even though I like these, too, I'm really fond of a game meant for 'older' players. There aren't that many out there anyways. I also liked the artwork and soundtrack, but that's a matter of taste anyways.\n\nI'm pretty happy I bought this game and would look forward to others like this, but most likely there won't be any.\nOnly negativ thing I found out about Pub Encounter are some typos and grammar errors, but I didn't mind them as much. I was still able to understand everything.\n\n10/10","April 15","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
