Yes, one could describe it as a Zelda Clone, but that shouldn't be taken as a negative.\n\nYou play as a boy trying to find his father, or something like that. You gain magic spells that can be used to solve puzzles and fight monsters. Instead of weapons, you use spells to dispatch enemies.\n\nThe game plays just like a top down Zelda would: you have a overworld that you can explore and find treasture; you find items that expand your abilities and allow you to progress further into the game; there are dungeons that test your physical prowess and mental ability; and the fighting is done in real time. There's a story tacked on, but it's not very good or engrossing.\n\nI really enjoyed playing the game because the puzzles are nice brain teasers and the game is easy to pick up and play in short bursts or long sessions. Finding hidden items is never boring and there's always something new to discover. Also, you learn new spells that keeps the action fresh and entertaining.\n\nSystem wise: there are no options for resolution or graphical effects. However, I did not have any problem running the game and it looks like it was running at 1080p. The sprites are colorful and the animation, although not amazingly dynamic, looks fine and suits this type of game.","December 15, 2015","true","4.9"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

I'm writing a review early because it's a travesty that this game has so few reviews; I intend to update it later. But I've played enough to know the positive rating is deserved.\n\nSimply put, if you like Zelda you will probably enjoy this game.","January 23","true","31.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I've gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. You can tell that the developers really cared about making a quality product here, and it shows in spades.\n\nSo what does this game that so many Zelda clones seem to lack? Heart and charm would be the two biggest aspects, in my opinion.\n\nThe heart comes from how the overworld, dungeons and various other locales have all been well fleshed out with secrets and puzzles. You can see that these were not just thrown together all willy nilly, but were constructed with thought and planning for the best gaming experience.\n\nThe charm comes from the character interactions (specifically bewteen Khoma and the Red Witch). While the translation does make it hard to understand things at times, it is a rare occurance, and it doesn't detract from the overall experience very much, if at all.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes:\n\n-The controls are very tight (I play with a controller, have not tried k+m).\n\n-The puzzles themselves range from easy to challenging. I ran into a couple headscratchers, but nothing that made me ragequit or resort to using a guide.\n\n-Combat is fairly basic, but with enough depth to not make it boring or repetitive. Most people play these games for the exploration aspects anyways, I would imagine.\n\n-The music in this game is really great. Game soundtracks are an important part of enjoying a game for me, and this games soundtrack really delivered.\n\nSo to wrap things up, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Zelda-like adventure games. You will not be disappointed by this one, I assure you. Give it a shot and support a developer that cares about delivering a truly enjoyable gaming experience!","February 6","true","42.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The gameplay compares well to old Zelda games like Link to the Past. You are without a sword, though, and all your abilities use mana instead making mana management important. The abilities/spells you aquire are interesting, they add new fighting mechanics, and unlock new areas for you to explore in both new and already explored maps. Exploration always feels important and rewarding\n\nPros:\nFun exploration\nQuality puzzles\nUnique abilities\nGreat level design\nNice, coherent art-style\nGreat post-release supportCons:\nMediocre writing\nSlow natural mana regeneration","December 28, 2015","true","31.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varietygamer/recommended/412270/","varietygamer","VarietyGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varietygamer/","524 products in account","Bethem is an action-adventure game built in Game Maker Studio.\n\nCan't say much in regards to the story so far (just started playing), but it seems humorous and doesn't take itself seriously. English translation is a little rough in places (especially in regards to the jokes-lost in translation). There may be a little too much exposition/dialogue given the tone of the story, at least at the start.\n\nIf you like Zelda, the action based combat mechanics are very similar to older Zelda games such as Link to the Past or the Gameboy titles.  There is an overworld, there are dungeons and associated puzzles to solve in order to progress. The interface, item mechanics and character abilities are all taken from Zelda.\n\nIt includes a very pleasant soundtrack. The sprite work and animations are passable (albeit simplistic). Controller support (xbox) is great, and game feels very responsive; combating monsters and solving puzzles is actually fun and I found myself wanting to complete each area and progress.\n\nThere seem to be some problems with running it on modern high-end hardware. I can only play in windowed mode, and have had to disable avast real time scanner every time in order for it to start.\n\nFrom the perspective of a Zelda fan, this is a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere. I would recommend it on that basis. But I must caution that it is a little rough/unpolished around the edges for a release title, both technically and in terms of visuals.\n\n\n","December 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Similar to Zelda, you have to travel to 8 dungeons to collect 8 artifacts.  Along the way, rather than tools, you will collect spells with different effects.  These spells can be used for attack, but also for clearing obsticles, such as the fire spell that lights torches and burns wood obsticles.\n\nI am also impressed with the way they have handled the dungeons.  It takes effort not just to find the dungeons, but sometimes subquests to gain access.  For example, the fourth dungeon first requries you to find and light three candles hidden elsewhere in the world.  While I do like taht they added some extra challenge that encourages you to take new powers and explore areas you could not reach before, there is one minor negative.  It can lead to some frustration trying to find an obscure location without any decent clues.\n\nThere are some good side-quests as well.  A trading game where you start with one item and trade with various NPCs throughout the game.  there are collectables in the form of red opals and candy for various quests as well.  Overall, the game is a fun experience with many things to keep someone entertained for a few dozen hours.","March 27","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only real annoyance was that there was no sort of kickback feature when the main character or enemies got hit, so you could get hit a lot of times before being able to escape and position yourself to attack again.  But once you have enough hit points, it doesn't end up mattering much and you end up running kamakaze through much of the map. :D","March 30","true","19.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Tried to play it with default arrow keys. Didn't like it frustratingly after the intro sequence had finished, I thought it would have autosaved as I found no way to do that from the menu. It didn't so, I changed the keybindings to wasd + jkl. I didn't like this setup either. I have no idea why there is no keyboard (wasd) + mouse buttons support. I also thought that the volume was just too loud even when I put things on a lower setting. I do not have my volume usually at more than 14% in Windows sound mixer. I do not use any boost or gain or anything of the sort.\nI refunded the game because of the controls and yes I played it for just about 5 minutes. Not just because of the controls but because there is no way to skip the cutscenes. Sometimes I don't really care about taking 15 minutes reading dialogues of text that isn't even that interesting or important to the game play. My apologies to the developer, but I just cannot accept this. I do not know if they used a custom developed engine or if it is GameMaker.\nSome might question why would refund a game that is so cheap? Same reason why I don't give money to companies that haven't earned it. Maybe if they had better keybindings and skippable cutscenes I would have actually been able to play the game.","May 4","false","0.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"
