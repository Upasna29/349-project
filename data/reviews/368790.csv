It's still work in progress so there's more content to be added and tweaks to be made, but even so, there's plenty to craft, several environments to explore, and huge dungeons to fight in.\n\nAlmost everything you craft you can take with you if you move camp, there are several resources to mine, and food to grow, and there's a good variety of enemies.\n\nFor a good time be sure to make the cannon and place it in a dungeon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR40hzn49G4","June 29, 2015","true","11.0"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","50","67","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViciousViscous/recommended/368790/","ViciousViscous","ViciousViscous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViciousViscous/","292 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is my first review for a game, so here it goes:\n\nFor being an early access game, it's actually pretty fun and the overall aesthetic is very pleasant. It takes a little while to get used to, but the interface actually feels really good and the chat felt very natural. I teamed up with a bunch of other newbies and it was really easy to coordinate our actions using the chat function, and I typically avoid that in most games because it takes away from the gameplay a lot of the time. The crafting is very much like minecraft, and I should warn you that you have to click and hold the left mouse button to "absorb" materials. Absorbing works very much like minecraft's mining function, and you can pretty much absorb anything.\n\nMy biggest fear for this game stems from the fact that if you're on a public server, you can't really defend your stuff or level up or anything, so it takes a bit too much from Minecraft's book if you ask me. Dungeon crawlers and adventure games should reward playing a bit more, but it seems like all of your work can disappear the next time you play (I just ended up handing all my stuff off to the people I was playing with because we were just getting used to the whole structure). I like how stealing activates PvP, but I would like for more organized ways of teaming up with other players rather than the free-for-all style it feels like now. I tried building a house with some other players and we kept accidentally activating PvP every time we tried to upgrade walls.\n\nI'll keep updating this review as I play the game to reflect how I see its progress, but overall I'm happy with it and I'm excited to see where it goes. I'm a bit of a serial game returner, so it says a lot to my friends if I keep a game that seems unfinished. The developers seem committed to making the game better, and I really appreciate that. I'm also an aspiring developer and I can really get behind a lot of the choices they made. It feels unique, but they're not always trying to reinvent the wheel, which gives it a nice new-but-familiar vibe.\n\nfor day 2 or whatever of its release, it shows A LOT of potential. I was running it at super high framerates most of the time. Two issues I did have, I tried dragging items into crates and it works, but was really unresponsive, and any time another player teleported to me it made my game freak out a little bit.\n\nAt this point I'll give it a solid 8/10 for it's overall vibe, but I definitely see that turning into a 9 or 10 if they keep making it better. Also, it'd be nice if Iron Ore was a little more available because I kept seeing gold more than iron, which seemed a little silly to me.","June 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","31","40","2","0"

The games offer a uniqe interface and design, where you are getting interested really quickly in what you can craft and build.\n\nThe game is beautiful and makes you wonder what's hidden around in the huge map we are in. The game also offers local / singleplayer and a multiplayer online for those who want to play with others.\n\nOverall you need to hunt for food so you don't die, since you have a hunger to take care off. I haven't seen any potions so far for health (which is regenerating slowly).\n\nThe crafting system has many different kind of items to craft. Traps, chairs, spiketrap, different kind of floor marterial, weapons which is bows, swords etc. You can make a workbench which is needed to craft advanced items. Aswell for melting ore's. If you find different kind of food, you can harvest it.\n\nHome design is great, and the astmotphere wants you to stay late, even you need to go work. Even i am sitting right now with a funny feeling in my stomach saying: "Move on.. do it.. It's calling." You can collect all items in the Orelight world as far as i'm aware.\n\nAfter finding sultions for playing the game with a smile on my face, i can recommend this game for people who wants something different than the usual crafting-survival, concept of dungeon-crawling with basebuilding multiplayer game.\n\nIf you think this is not enough to make you support the devs or the game, i would recommend watching what i've experienced to get a better feel for the game: http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/6737093","June 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwiftAndBitter/recommended/368790/","SwiftAndBitter","Swift","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwiftAndBitter/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOreLight is an upcoming hack and slash with resource gathering and base building features. While it is currently in a rudimentary state, so far the developers have put together a solid foundation to work from.\n\nIf you're expecting a $20 (or $16.99) gaming experience, I'd advise you to be patient. The game is in Early Access for a reason: it is not finished.\n\nThe fighting is rudimentary at best (a set of swords, a set of bows, mindless clicking, no skills or abilities). Mining and harvesting is currently just right clicking on objects and waiting. Base building has a bit more content going for it, with the ability to build your own little abode based on crafted items or items pilfered from neighbouring inhabited and uninhabited dwellings.\n\nIn closing, OreLight looks truly promising. That said, there is still a lot of work ahead for the developers, so if you feel like trusting them I'd recommend going ahead purchasing a copy. Just consider it an investment for a game that will be finished in the future. Otherwise, you'll just be setting yourself up for disappointment, and no one wants to be disappointed, right?","June 29, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

I don't see this growing to the point where it's an interesting game. Maybe it's just early days yet, but I have my doubts. I found it to be very simple mechanically and lacking the depth to hold my attention.","September 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyleblane/recommended/368790/","kyleblane","kyleblane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyleblane/","443 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been playing OreLight off and on since March of 2015 (prior to its Steam Greenlight) so I would guess I have an additional hour or two of gameplay under my belt compared to what Steam shows. (Full disclosure, I was given a copy of the game from the developers... but you probably figured that out because it available in March)\n\nThis game shows a lot of promise. It's clearly still a work in progress, but what I see and play so far is quite enjoyable. It has a beautiful graphical style and amazing lighting/shadow effects. The gameplay/controls have their quirks, but it's overall very solid.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, and I like that.\n\nThe skeletons are derpy and the light dialog here and there can be enjoyable. The enemies will yell "Adventurer!" and "Kill him!" when they see you, but every once in a while you'll see something funny. In the video linked below I captured a particularly funny moment about 15 minutes in where a skeleton says, "The wife keeps moaning about how I've never killed an Adventurer." I like that, and I expect more of it to be added.\n\nAnother funny moment for me was the realization that I have to use an anvil to make mashed potatoes. It's little things like that that I enjoy about this game. Also the fact that mashed potatoes is an item.\n\nI do have minor gripes about the game (Mainly the collection of resources. It doesn't always try to collect the item I'm clicking on) but I don't intend to mention them because this is in early access and minor gripes are to be expected. I just want to affirm that the game shows a lot of promise. It is in early access. It is fun.\n\nHere's a link to the previously mentioned video. This is gameplay of when I found my first dungeon while exploring. It also involves me running back to my house to get better equipped because I almost died at first.\nhttp://youtu.be/KGpT_aZt4Ss","June 29, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"
