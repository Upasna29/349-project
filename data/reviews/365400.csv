But beyond that, my biggest problem here is the controls. This game was designed for a mobile platform in terrms of the type controls that it's going for, you don't get the precision that you'd want (at least I'd want) regarding the mouse. Sadly, that leads to a bunch of problems, and while variety eventually develops, the gameplay doesn't excite me as much as I would hope.\n\n+:\n-It now runs\n-Different premise, interesting to say the least.\n-There's variety down the line.\n\n-:\n-Controls are too imprecise for my liking, and leads to some problems in terms of the technical precision needed to do some puzzles. Repeating the same parts over again can get irritating.\n-Music will wear on you, and also got a DMCA on one part one when attempting to make a video (just fyi for YTers out there).\n-Gameplay lacks oompf.\n-Early on, combination of imprecise controls and gameplay leads to problems.\n\nFootage of Gameplay:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uskOzz-XBC4\nFootage of attempted Play here for first video: http://youtu.be/ivgbev2r34E","May 11, 2015","false","1.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","17","23","9","3"

Usually I'm not a big fan of tutorials, but some games need one and this game surely is one of them.\n\nThere's no intro or anything else when you start the game. You are simply thrown in the first level without any explanation of the controls or the objective of the game. I could gather that it's a breakout 'mutant' in which you have to shoot coins and gems and then place the ball into a mining cart. You do that by controlling a handcar which has an adjustable 'bat'. The controls are quite unintuitive to say the least.\n\nThe visual presentation is nice, yet not very varied. The music doesn't fit and got on my nerves pretty quick.\n\nIt's not a horrible game, but it needs a howto or a tutorial. Also the controls could use some work. As it is right now I won't recommend the game.","June 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Are those just ways to score a bit more?\n- Broken leader boards (my first score on lvl1 worked, but everything else never updated, even new high scores in the first lvl)\n- Broken achievements? I'm pretty sure I did some of them (bullettime, firetime) since they appear around lvl10\n- Limited amount of rebound: It's entirely part of the gameplay but in some levels and thanks to unresponsive controls/weird physics it's just frustrating and uselessly punishing.\n- Muting the music doesn't mute other sounds\n\nIt's really hard to recommend at this point, it would need a more polished version to be worth playing. Wait for updates.","May 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

Now  this would be fine if I was playing on laptop as 1366*768 is a common screen resolution. However my resolution is 1680*1050 and for what ever reason the game refuses to use this resolution. Ugh.\n\nThe music is not very good and got on my nerves fairly quick. I turned that setting to off.\n\nThe game play is that you have a ball that must fall into the cart along with picking up some diamonds and coins. You bounce the ball using the mouse. Push up for the teeter totter to rise and lower. Your supposed to collect diamonds for something I had no idea what for. There is a shopping cart icon for something I have no idea what for.\n\nThe game feels like a very lazy port of a mobile game. Unclear instructions. I still have no idea what the shopping cart icon does or what its even for. I even click on the cart and got me into another game with big boxes  labeled  on either side. One labeled flaps and the other with no cart. ? Not sure what that even is supposed to mean.\n\nSo no clear goals in game. Low resolution options and lack luster game play. The positives the colors are bright and the 2 insects look good. My score would be a 5/10 as the game stands now.","June 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters are lovable and the music, sound and the settings for all of the levels are very fitting!\n\nAll this adds to the overall originality of the game. Where most games can get quite dull quite quickly, this games keeps you engaged by throwing in new mechanics and puzzle-like elements every now and then.\n\nIt strikes the right balance between puzzle and enjoy ability. Puzzles aren't so hard that you'll be put off, but they are well thought out enough that you come back for more.\n\nAll-in-all, this is great game for its genre! \n\nIf there’s anything I'd improve it would be throwing in more meaningful graphic choices and more resolution options!","May 11, 2015","true","1.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"
