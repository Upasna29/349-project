At first I was leery about the warcraft aspects with the different races and heroes, since I play historical games with just people, but I might be warming up to it. I like the way the combat system works, it somewhat feels like a card game. Although, there should be a way to join your allies in battle. The de jure kingdoms, a Crusader Kings/Risk element, are fun. The campaign so far is great. The game feels like fast-paced game of Risk with added elements such as deciding whether to build up infrastructure or a bigger army. It's shaping out to be a great game.","February 11","true","15.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","6"

Mechanics are simple enough, yet not reductive in the way cross-platform strategy games can be. For those of you confused on why this is in the free to play section, while the full game costs 15.99, the email sent out to the mailing list reads as follows:\n\n"The Early Access build has a free demo section. You can grab an Early Access copy of the game from Steam RIGHT NOW and be playing for free within minutes (depending on your download speed). To get full access to the rest of the game, you will need to buy Early Access, which will be $15.99 USD. This is a 25% discount from the full game price, which will be $19.99 USD on release."\n\nSo presumably, when the game is finished and out of early access, it will be moved out of the free to play section, and into it's permanent section.\n\nPlayed a few hours in the beta, and enjoyed every one. Would definitely recommend this game and already have.","February 11","true","7.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

I played this a lot prior to being released in early access. I am excited to see the campaign mode taking shape, but it has a long way to go.

I'm a working adult. I don't have much time to grind anymore (Work commitments, spouse, familystuff). I don't really play games on PC or consoles anymore because I can't afford the time and it's slightly sad to be on the PC for work all day, just to head on home and go on the PC to play games.\n\nAnyways, I was one of the testers from the BETA period and back then, the game was DA BOMBZ (nobody says that anymore, do they?). It was the perfect "TO-GO" game to come by in a loooong time, and I mean it as in the best game to play when I had to go. 10-30 minute toilet breaks became more fun and I swear there's nothing like amassing a huge army and letting all hell break loose against the enemy to help loosen up the bowels. (Although admittedly, it sometimes doesn't help constipation when you're playing Multiplayer and pipped in the last TURN due to Victory Points). It also helped me get through some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ downtime during traffic rush hour. (Disclaimer: I do not advocate playing on ipad while driving, it is wrong and illegal).\n\nPoint is, it was a good game to put in a good half-hour. Nothing too serious that required my constant attention, but dramatic enough for me to invest energy and soul for a good skirmish.(This is read as: absorbed enough for me to shush the wife so I can destroy the infidel who played PEASANT REVOLT on my unprotected kingdom but not so much that I can't make it up to her 10 minutes later)\n\nNow that's been taken down. Instead, the game is available on STEAM and PC. I don't know about anyone else, but lugging a laptop in the john isn't exactly my idea of fun and I have no idea where to put my mouse. Hurry up with the release of the ipad version already!!\n\nSeriously though, it's coming along pretty well. The new campaigns do add an extra bit of flair to an otherwise solid game. I'd probably take a bit more longer toilet breaks but I do enjoy the "me time". Thanks devs and keep up the good work!","February 14","true","136.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"

Do you value your time yet still strive to play multiplayer turn based strategy games? You should play this game, fast game play with serious decision making and choices.  Cuts out the fat of classic turn based strategy games letting you play more games more often.

Connectivity was stable, although I encountered a couple of issues. I tried to send this using the FEEDBACK button but apparently it needs outlook configured on my PC. So I guess better a review so that others may be informed too.\n1. Scrolling for an emblem actually selects that emblem nearest to your mouse pointer, so i have to scroll back up to change it to what it was previously.\n2. I don't get how the leaderboard works, top on the list was ranked 1054 with 8 wins. If he wins more he goes "higher" instead of being #1?\n3. Had a problem going into windowed mode. Thanks to "Burito" (i suspect he was one of the devs) Nice for them to be online and helpful.\n4. Oh and the chat, I was curious if it was global or what? One game someone not from the game was commenting and sometimes none are answering.\n\nOverall I enjoyed your game. I agree that some of this issues should be expected since it's just an early access release, nevertheless thanks and can't wait for the full build to be available :)\n","February 11","true","88.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Let's say you like strategy games, obviously, youre looking at this game right?  But maybe you don't have time to play Civ 5 or Endless Legend.  Or you don't want to make the time investment for those games right now.   What options do you have if you want to play a world conquering grand strategy game.  Not many.\n\nIn steps Legends of Callasia.  This game is akin to super Risk(the boardgame).  It's a dudes on a map game with some extra stuff thrown in to make more interesting.  That extra stuff includes heroes, you can't move armies around without them, ala Heroes of Might and Magic.  You also have cards that can boost your kingdom, think strategy cards, or can help in battle, think tactics cards.  These add enough flair to make it better than risk.  Throw in a bunch of different maps and multiplayer  and you've got a game you can get some mileage out of.\n\nI did a quick video series shopwcasing the campaign, that you can check out if you want to see the game in action.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwS9qxK4jk","February 17","true","1.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Seems like it has good mechanics, a fun singleplayer campaign, AND I actually saw another player online the other day! With all that said, I really found the F2P model to be underwhelming. Massive props to the devs for not using microtransactions, but it would be much better, in my opinion, to let the player try each faction. As it is, you get 2/8 of ONE faction to try. The other factions have 6 and 4 single player missions, but we don't even get a taste of them. My advice would be to either make one of each faction's missions free, or to write a separate "tutorial" mission for each faction, which would be included in the free game. That way, I would be sure that I like more than 1/3 of the game before spending $16-22 for the full game. I don't think this would decrease the number of people buying the full game, as people would become even more intrigued by the new stories.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely loved the small bit of it that I was able to play, and I am considering buying the full version just based on that bit. However, if I could even have a small taste of what the other factions were like, and they weren't a complete disaster, I would buy the full version of this game as fast as I physically could. Great game, really exceptional story writing, just wish the F2P model could be a bit better.","March 27","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"
