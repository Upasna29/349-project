First time I installed it, I hated it and regreted my decision of buying GTOS. Later on I cooled down and have read some of the other reviews and gave this babe another chance to prove itself.\nI spent couple more evenings trying to figure out what the hell is going on on my screen, studied a few tutorials and manuals online and then one moment it struck me. Damn! This game is absolute blast.\nI've played 90% percent of the WW2 games out there, no exagerrating, if you know some obscure WW2 FPS/RTS/Tactics, chances are I've played that. I'm wargames nut, I've played old and new games, I've played good and bad games. I've tried almost every popular and obscure WW2 games, it'd be pointless to list them all. But this one, believe me, will deliver you insane amount of fun if you will spend a bit more time learning how the stuff works here. Give gem a little care, treat it woth patience and it will treat you in return. It's new, it's fresh, it's a gorgeous game, beautiful and stunning outside and very deep and complicated inside.\n\nIt will suit all your WW2 nut needs. Amazing, breath-taking, painfully realistic, grim, brutal tank and infantry battles (with some close air support & artillery options). I've never seen a combat in a WW2 game portrayed so gritty. Yet I've played Close Combat, Combat Mission, Men of War, Theatre of War (all of which I love and play till this day) but none of them could reach this level of aestethics. Men will scream, bleed to death, sand will fly in the air, shells will strike the ground and leave you deaf.\nIt also has such important aspects as realistic radio & wire lines system, something very similar to Combat Mission if you've played that. Chain of command is obviously present in the game too.\n\nAnd the best thing? You can set everything and anything in this game, extensive number of options lets you edit the game experience to you liking, making it either a true, die-hard, hardcore war sim or arcade RTS, or even a mix of both. If you don't like micro-managing stuff too much it's okay, little men on the battlefield are smart enough to act on their own.\n\nFew words regarding the setting, atmosphere and premise of this game. It's set in Ukraine/Russia circa 1941 to 1943. (Two of the DLCs are set in some-what moden time). One thing I'm going to say that is, Graviteam developers have hit the nail here. The land, terrain, nature, forests, atmosphere, sky.. Oh my god, it looks stunning. It absolutely perfectly depicts and resembles real places and lands. I myself was born in Russia and as a little kid, I used to walk around a lot, exploring all those forests and big, endless lands of my country and let me tell you a thing, if you're a foreigner, who wants to see true russian nature and not stereotypic stuff, play this game. It's art, pure art.\n\nDo you like war movies? Hell, you can just start a battle, grab a glass of whatever favorite drink you prefer and watch the hell let and break loose.\n\nOne of the best games I've got from steam and absolutely deserved money that I paid in the past year. If you feel like it's too much for you, try waiting for a bit, they do have discounts sometime but nobody can predict when those happen.\n\nNo doubt, reccomended. Buy and see it for yourself, don't listen to anybody complaining about interface or other stuff, you WILL get used to it and it's going to be comfortable using it. Also keep in mind, this is not just an RTS, it's tactic, so all these buttons matter.\n\nLast thing about DLCs. Yes, yes, yes, get all of them. (except hi-res textures, game looks fine as it is.) I oppose the idea of DLCs in general, but these are good, believe me, they are worth the price.\n\nP.S. If you get in this game, after playing few battles you might want to get "Aunthetic Battle Sound mod" and the "Uniforms mod". These two are mandatory for even better experience and are available on the internet. Do a little googling.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions if you have any. Have a nice day.","April 3, 2015","true","104.2"," 123 of 127 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","123","127","4","3"

Your units have been resupplied, at least most of them, and you figure out that it will have to do for whatever is coming next.\nYou arrive on the battlefield at 06:48 a.m., the morning mist creates a surreal look of the environment. Will you even be able to make contact with the enemy? You wanted to take your time and encircle him, at least secure your flanks. But he surprised you and attacked first...\n\nAre his units as battered as yours or did he bring reinforcements in without you knowing it? You have no idea about what`s coming at you...\n\nOne thing is sure, however, you don`t want to let objectives Amethyst and Malachite fall into enemy hands. So, you decide to split your forces in two battlegroups. One is worn out, but has better equipment left and the other one... well, they are rookies, but you don`t have anything else. And the tank, what will you do with the tank? Should he try to break a possible attack in the first minutes or do you keep him in reserve, as a last option when everything else has failed?\n\nYou decide to leave the tank behind and use him as a wild card, if one of your battle groups is wavering. Both task forces are set up along the way to the objectives, based on the environment you found good ambush spots and hope that the enemy will pass through them. You are confident with the way you placed your forces, the only thing which makes you worry is ...both battlegroups are separated by around 3 kms.\n\n07:14 a.m. and still no contact. You chose the most battered squad and send them on a recon run in the hope to get a position of the enemy`s assault force. 20 minutes later you are sure, the opponents main attack will hit the rookies...\n\nWhat will you do with your units of the second road block? Should they hold their position in case of enemy activity, should they rush for aid to help their fellow comrades at the first road block? 5 minutes later you are still not sure, if you need the second ambush point at all? Meanwhile forward elements of the enemy have made contact with your weaker task force. Mortar rounds are pouring in on them, the whole task force is in danger of just being swept away.\n\nYou decide to mobilize the units of the second ambush point. It seems to be more important to support your buddies than waiting for an enemy who might not even arrive. But it`s 3 kms through rough terrain, will they make it in time? And what about the tank?\n\nThe tank will maintain his position and you decide to only use him in case of utmost emergency. In the meantime the mortar fire on the first task force has stopped and it looks like for the moment they can defend their position.\n\nBattlegroup No. 2 is still on its way and around 1,5 kms out. Suddenly, they receive fire from a small forest and you think about dealing with them first or to continue to their original objective which was "helping out those rookie guys". It looks like the rookies earn their stripes and haven`t moved back an inch, you decide to clear out the forest to secure the flank of the rookies.\n\nHalftracks are moving in, infantry disembarks and you follow them into the misty forest. The halftrack with the much needed 7,5 cm gun takes the first hit, it goes up in flames you can only feel pity for the ejecting guys. Yet, you don`t know what hit it. Infantry is continuing their march into the woods when they suddenly spot an AT gun, secured by an HMG. Your people are in the line of fire of both guns and hit the ground earlier than you could order them to fall back. They are pinned down, one by one is being taken out, but still, they are crawling towards the guns and still push forward.\n\nOf course it has to be like this way, while your second task force plays hide-and-seek in the forest the rookies are giving in to the pressure and it looks like the line is ...vanished. Time for the tank!\n\nYou have high hopes for the steel beast to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Eagerly you follow your tank while it uses the road for faster movement. After about 100 m something explodes around the tank, you zoom in just to find out that the enemy has secretly managed to sneak engineers through your lines. The tank treads are gone... Why didn`t you at least spare a squad to secure the tank? You will never know, meanwhile the tank, stationary like a AT gun, is fighting for survival. The engineers throwing everything they have, ...but miss. Burning spots around the tank, but the crew inside manages to stay calm and takes out the enemy one by one until he surrenders. The tank didn`t live up to your expectations, but, at least he is not lost.\n\nUnfortunately that can`t be said about the units in the forest. They have overcome both guns, but at what cost? After having sacrificed 70% of their strength you move them back to the halftracks, let them embark and try to save the rest of what`s left of task force 1. There is not much shooting anymore around the first ambush point, it seems both sides are exhausted.\n\nA few minutes later the halftracks finally arrive at your first battlegroup and bring much needed support, though tiny in numbers. But, as soon as the first vehicles open fire the enemy is offering a cease-fire. Will you accept it and call it a day, ...or, what if, the enemy is close to break? Should you risk to go all-in with your tiny relieve force and take a not so glory victory back home?\n\nYou decide to go in for the kill and, at least this time you were right, soon after the transported infantry disembarks and joins the fight the enemy surrenders, the battle is won.\n\nIt is 08:33 a.m., you lost 85% of your combat strength and you think about, if there`s enough left to continue at all. Then you notice that your enemy lost even more...\n\nFor the battles to come you will adapt, ..and you will repair your tank. And you won`t make the same mistake twice.\n\nAnd, since this round lasted almost 2 hours, there`s still laundry to do and your wife needs help with the kids, you decide to leave the game behind for now.\n\nYet, you surely will return. You lost 85% of your troops but you feel like General of the Month...\n\nAt least until your wife enters the room and recites the "today`s to-do list" in front of you...","May 20, 2014","true","71.2"," 120 of 129 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","120","129","5","10"

Or something. I don't know the specifics.\n\nBut it's a good game. More people should know about it. It's not very accessible and the UI is confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it's a good time. Though I'll admit, after nearly 25 hours so far, I still don't totally know what I'm doing. That speaks partly to the game's depth, but also how to the lack of transperancy regarding mechanics.\n\nAt its most superficial level, it's kind of like a Total War game set in World War II. But it's a lot more of a sim than Total War is, and the design intent is very different. The Ukrainian fellows who made Graviteam Tactics are well known in sim nerd circles for their tank simulators, at least one of which used to be on Steam but doesn't seem to be any more and I don't know why. Their obsession with WWII and tank damage models served them well for making a game of a grander scale, where you command little germans or little soviets in squads and weapons teams, and whose lines of communication and chain of command you must manage as you order them to march onwards towards the slaughter. After a battle in this game, one can find the battlefield littered with meat. Manflesh, to be exact.\n\nYou have a bird's eye view of the happenings, starting with the turn-based operations map where you move companies of men and tanks around, check their supply and tell them where and whom to attack. Once a battle commenses you get dumped into the planning stages of the real-time mode, where you set up your little soldiers and give them their opening orders. Opening orders are important, because they have no command cost and allow you to set up your plan and watch it unfold. Your squads and teams for the most part work on their own, though you can of course order them, but they decide on their own behind which trees to take cover, when to shoot and when to hit the deck -- you have no control over such precise details. The best you can do is tell them a general location to move to and a general direction to concentrate their fire. There is little micromanagement in the game, and you are even disuaded from trying to micromanage, as giving orders costs you command and the more into the fire your men get, the harder it is to command them. It's a neat little system, but it isn't readily apparent when you start the game up. It took me more than a few games--and reading more than a few game guides, of which, I might add, there are scant few--to know what the hell the blue bar at the top of the screen meant and why it would change when I tried to order my half-dead, panicking engineer squad to suck it up and advance into machinegun fire (which is a terrible tactic, by the way).\n\nBetween battles you can manage your men, splitting up their squads and allocating ammo and fuel for vehicles. It's a fun a little management game, and is pretty simple. You cannot build units in the game, so what you start with is what you get, though there are usually reinforcements showing up on certain turns and whose arrival and availability you are well informed of.\n\nOperations are dynamic and different each time you play, with the possibility of fighting over the same town or the same hill across multiple battles, each side taking and subsequently losing the objective over the course of one or two in-game days. It gives the game a fun, fluid and unpredictable narrative that enhances replayability.\n\nIn addition to the operational campaigns, you can also play individual battles with units from force pools on any part of the included maps. What's kind of lame, though, is that you can't set it to have the computer generate the enemy force, so you always know exactly what the enemy has right from the get go. Major bummer for me.\n\nBUT IN CONCLUSION: it is a solid game that deserves more press and more people talking about it.","November 6, 2014","true","59.5"," 87 of 90 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","87","90","5","0"

I mean real strategy wargames that reward careful planning and clever execution of a strategically sound battle plan but punish stupidity with cold, ruthless efficiency?\n\nDo you possess the ability to devise a feasible strategy, working within the limitations of available assets, taking into account the conditions on the ground, playing to your own strengths and exploiting the weaknesses of your foe? Are you able to translate that strategy into a series of victories fought on the ground, knowing that each engagement, each success and each failure will directly affect those that follow?\n\nCan you read events as they unfold? are you fluent in the language of nature, do you understand terrain and weather conditions and the role they will play in your ability to prevail?\n\nCan you look through the eyes of your officers on the front, see what they see, feel what they feel, as they attempt to make your vision a reality? Can you hold your nerve, retaining unwavering belief in your own plan as you experience the chaos and carnage of each skirmish, assault and defence, never losing sight of the ultimate Operational objectives?\n\nDo you relish the challenge of managing extremely limited resources? of maintaining supply lines? can you correctly allocate those resources where they'll do the most good? Can you grasp the value of each and every infantryman, of each and every bullet? if success is to be achieved you need to.\n\nAre your shoulders broad enough to bear the burden of responsibility placed upon you? Can you can keep your front line forces in a permanent state of combat readiness? Can you bear to disband brave but depleted squads in order to share out the precious remaining men and ammunition among the rest of the platoon, showing no emotion?\n\nAre you able to maintain the complex and fragile network of battlefield communications that enable your chain of command to function in a way that ensures the prompt delivery of your orders? That enable your Platoons to operate as a single, organised, cohesive and efficient fighting force?\n\nDo you know enough about the many varied tools at your disposal? or the tools wielded by your enemies? Is it wise to throw short barrelled Panzer III's against T-34's? are you familiar with the effective range of your guns, of your enemies guns? Will you instinctively know which battles to seek out and which to avoid?

Taking the unexpected in your stride, recognising when to sally forth and when to withdraw? Are you able to acknowledge and learn from your mistakes?\n\nBecause, once the shooting starts there's no turning back, there are no second chances, once the die is cast the battle must be fought and your men will live or die by the decisions you make. There will be no respawning units, no tank factories churning out replacements, no happy base building or gamey 'balancing' to ease the pain. There is no place to hide, no room here for the weak, the impetuous or the foolish. This game offers no comfort for the lilly livered or those easily intimidated by complexity and steep learning curves.\n\nThis is Operational level warfare gentlemen, as real and as unforgiving as has ever been depicted in the digital media, if you harbour any doubts at all, for the sake of your men, for the sake of your own dignity, I urge you to walk away, Company of heroes 2 awaits.\n\nTo the rest of you I say this - Welcome to Hell!\n\n\o","September 16, 2015","true","98.3"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","74","83","12","0"

Oh, did I mention they're short of ammo, at half-strength, and their Commander was killed in the previous engagement four hours ago?\n\nWell, here you are, a young German soldier swallowed up in Mother Russia in 1943 manning a hill with 5 combat effective infantry units left out of the twelve you started with and it's 3 a.m. and blizzarding and the Popovs are coming hell bent on a suicidal charge to knock you out of some hard-earned ground.  Hope to God they don't have armor because your Engineer Squad got decimated and the Pak gun you have won't penetrate what they've been rolling out.  Well, at least you have some mortar support to call in but those rounds are few to spare so be careful in calling it in because if it's just a probe and you waste your rounds, well....\n\n...Soviets show up,  In force.  No one is dug in.  You call in what few mortars you have left to break up and hopefully stop their assault  because if you can survive till reinforcements arrive then maybe, just maybe there's a chance because the half-tracks you rolled into this winter hell in are either smoking ruins or immobilized and you're damned lucky to have survived with anything.  Now is usually when the praying starts.\n\nMortars fall heavy in their midst but it's so sporadic because the spotting is off that it kills no one except 3 men of yours because the ♥♥♥♥ing mess fell short and they run off screaming into the night ablaze [that is not drama folks; your troops will burn, and they will scream, and you will try to block it out after a while].\n\nThen the mortars finally hit spot on and after watching your enemy suffer a bit as they burn and scream and run off into the frozen landscape to satisfy your revenge, you call off the bombardment early to salve your last sense of humaity.

Resupply is on the way...just survive this turn.\n\nThen, without warning, an uncannily accurate artillery bombardment rakes your position and destroys a large chunk of the men you have left...\n\nBecause YOU called off the mortars before his forward artillery observers were killed.

The battlefields are huge, and your resources usually limited, so you'll need to deploy and use your troops taking a lot of factors into consideration.\n\nWhile GTOS is an RTS, this is not a game played with "clicks-per-minute" and macro spamming, but with thought and tactical finesse. But when the sh*t hits the fan you'd better know how to react or expect your troops to be suppressed and panic in no time. However there is no need to micro-manage, the AI will defend themselves.\n\nThe vehicles have proper penetration values - there are no instant fireball when tanks are hit here. What kills a tank is mostly unseen things - crew is killed by shrapnel, engine destroyed, internal fires, weapon broken. But devastating hits do happen, and a burning tank often leads to pretty explosions of ammo cooking off a long time afterwards. You get the feeling a tank is a really hard thing to kill - as it should be, but beware of getting too close to infantry - Molotovs and AT-grenades can still kill or disable a reckless tanker.\n\nWeapons are realistically modeled, and guns can be fired over long distances. Artillery takes a long time to call in and needs to be planned correctly - but when it does hit it's truly devastating. Nothing says "we need to move NOW" like the blasts of artillery pinpointing your position.\n\nThe game is far from easy to get into  - there is very little tutorial and hand-holding, and the manual can be hard to understand, in bad English or simply outdated. The AI can be on the quirky side or just plain stupid side at times, and the process of applying patches to the game is sometimes a challenge in itself...\n\nBut if you are into realistic war games, consider yourself a war gamer or "grognard", GTOS is well worth the investment.","February 12, 2014","true","0.1"," 70 of 80 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","70","80","0","5"

This is a game for tacticians;  The armchair generals who have the patience to get past the immense learning curve.  Do not expect to just jump right in and take command.\n\nYour troops won't always just go and do what you tell them.  If they are being torn apart, they may run away terrified on their own.  Your soldiers may take the initiative and, with a lack of orders, charge headlong towards the enemy to destroy his positions.  If your unit commander dies, multiple assets and communication break down.  If your communications aren't effective, your units can't recieve orders.\n\nThe interface, though at first confusing, begins to make sense after paying attention during tutorials.  If the player is willing to accept some devestating losses in the first few attempts, it isn't so bad.  The layout is effective enough to apply all the necessary options for troop formations, movement and types of fire.  It just takes some orientation to understand how to apply these options.\n\nI am somewhat well versed in combined arms tactics and skills covered in Marine Corps warfighting doctrine (MCPD-1) and easily understand how  and why this title is actually utilized in European militaries to train infantry officers and platoon leaders.  The enemy UI is challenging and responds realistically and effectively to offense, but tends to do poorly when advancing or attacking.  He tends to stop dead in his tracks during attacks when fired upon and consistently maintains a defensive posture.  Hopefully in the future this can be tweaked a bit to give the UI a more impactful attack pattern.\n\nYou will find that application of standard military tactics per doctrine is played out extremely effectively.  I.e. Deploying maching guns with long and unobstructive lines of sight, overlapping with infantry and armour.  Or, combined arms suppressive fire.\n\nGraphics are of the era this game was originally produced.  Don't expect a melt-your-face mindblowing world here.  But the graphics are good enough to get the job done and can still really impress at night.  Smoke, tracers and explosion lighting give the game a real atmosphere.  Speaking of atmosphere however; the ambient audio makes me want to throw my speakers across the room.  Noises like a rooster ♥♥♥♥-a-doodle-doo'ing every 10 seconds become like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nFans of the Close Combat series, Combat Mission series, and even the Total War series will likely appreciate this game.

With my firepower and supporting troops the firefight was over quickly with the entire enemy platoon being eliminated. I was pleased and ordered my troops to converge on the village.\n\nHowever at the river my engineers began taking fire from a single machine gun from the forest, perfect positioning to engage my forces as they crossed. However the engineers were no rookies and followed my orders to attack the forest and clear it out, the battle was still in my favour. To the right hand side of this engagement the enemy was spotted, I assumed it was another machine gun, set up to give a crossfire killzone and so I quickly ordered my reserve squad within the platoon to sweep in and at least supress it with support from my heavy halftrack. This gun was eliminated with a lucky shot and was immediately destroyed as the dismounted engineers closed. As a looked at the destroyed weapon my eyes widened with fear. It was an Anti-Tank gun, well people, they never travel alone. I ordered a platoon in the villlage to come to the aid of my engineers as there were now more men in the forest than I had thought.\n\nSuddenly as I looked for heavy halftrack to move to engage, it burst into flames. The unlucky crewmembers running out ablaze, in between them I saw a lone Russian solider crawling by the vehicle, he had slipped by and had molotoved my heavy support. Following this my men in the village came across entrenched Russian infantry, bogging them down in a firefight so they were now unable to support my isolated platoon, a retreat could not be ordered as they were already in too deep into the forest and to bring them out was suicide. Two minutes later the village was in my control and the enemy was offering a ceasefire. I had won at the expense of a platoon, a hollow victory.\n\nHowever I now knew exactly what the enemy had and I knew exactly what to use aginst them. After all that was just the first battle.","December 21, 2014","true","104.4"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","43","46","0","0"

It is a Strategy First release. It is almost never on sale (except sometimes on Gamersgate).\n\nNow for the good.\nFirst of all, it has a demo. Try it. That was enough to convice me to buy the game.\n\nThis game is a turn-based/real-time strategy game. There are turn based planning phases with real time battles, which you can pause, speed up or slow down.\nDue to the nature of variables this game has an inexhaustible amount of combinations possible for each battle. In other words, it is infinitely replayable and no two games are the same.\nIf you desire a change in campaign, Graviteam has you covered. There are some Eastern Front WW II DLC you can get... or you can purchase the China-Russia 1969 border conflict DLC, the 1979 Russia fighting Iran in Afghanistan DLC or the 1988 Angola Bush War DLC. These DLC are unfortunately not cheap, but there are sometimes sales.\n\nThis game will kick your ♥♥♥. The A.I. is superb at actually engaging in tactics, which is something that is missing in a lot of strategy games. I've had to rush in order to protect my flank because the A.I. actually learned that they weren't getting in the front door and they turned the tables on me in a way that I couldn't have anticipated, but at the same time it is fair. The A.I. doesn't cheat, unless you want it to (options menu setting).\n\nThe game also requires you to manage fatigue, morale, fuel and ammo.\n\nIf this sounds like something that would interest you then you cannot go wrong with this title.","April 3, 2014","true","28.9"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","0"

I'd try playing it, get angry and quit for a day or a few hours then i'd try playing/learning it again, rinse and repeat. Finally I looked up a tutorial, got a bit of bearings going, and while I still suck at the game, I am improving and when you understand the mechanics and facets of the game it becomes probably the closest thing to actual WW2 battlefield simulation you can find. Sit your troops in a spot for a while and they will dig trenches, add a Artillery Spotter or Air Support Spotter to a platoon and give them a little more oomph, replace dead troops in a squad or vehicle by getting them to a conscript unit and refill their ammo by sending them to a supply group and replace any busted vehicles and fix any that can be repaired. You can order your troops to do things but theres so many variables that can hinder their progress or cause them to not achieve their directive. Of all the things that make this game hard to get into at first i'd say this is the largest. I STILL have a very hard time getting my tanks, soldiers, vehicles and ESPECIALLY MY GOD DAMN ARTILLERY GUNS to do what I tell them. The mortars seem to work fine, but even when I keep commanders from my Arty unit spread out to relay orders and spot land for fire missions they still often just sit there with their thumbs up their asses. The other problem is that about 60% of the time my troops will not target the targets I pick out for them. When i desperately need a tank to be killed and even when my AT guns/Tanks have clear lines of sight they sometimes just will screw around a lot more than actually do something productive. It causes me to panic and usually makes my troops far less effective in combat than the AI's. The odd thing is, i'm not even sure if it is an ACTUAL problem or just my units acting unpredictably, as would happen in real life. There's so many different outcomes to even the smallest scenarios that it could just be circumstances and the game is doing exactly what it should. I just can't quite figure out whats going on, but its really the only major complaint I have, however, and its concerning an important part of the game so It needed mentioned. My only other really big complaint is that there isn't very many units. All the units are authentic to the time period and are extremely detailed, I just really wanted to see some Panthers and T-34/85s and IS-2s and other awesome late war tanks.\n\nOverall a fantastic WW2 RTS/Simulator\n\nPros\n-Very detailed environment, map and units\n-Authentic everything. Map layout, terrain, units available its all authentic.\n-Pretty nice graphics in my opinion. Nothing amazing but very solid.\n-Really realistic reactions from soldiers and units to the various situations. A squad that suddenly loses 3 or 4 men from a mortar could easily be panicked.\n-A ton of strategic depth\n-Play as germans or russians of course\n-Custom battles\n-Very specific and in depth settings for difficulty and gameplay\n-Runs fine and no crashes in the 30 hours i've played\n-Completely dynamic map and battlegrounds. Where your troops are on the strategic map is where a battle will take place in the RTS portion. Its very dynamic but i can't think of a good way to describe it.\n-Varied time periods in the DLC expansions\n\nCons\n-Not very many units to choose from even though they're all authentic\n-Only a single strategic map. The map is huge and has quite a few different areas but still theres only 1 and it'd be nice to have at least 1 or 2 more. **EDIT** (I don't know if i missed them or if its because I bought some DLC on the recent sale but theres more maps to choose from than 1. I know for a fact some of them are exclusive to the DLC but I believe I was wrong in assuming the base game only has 1 map, at least for quick battles. Its still only 2 or 3 at the most so its staying on the cons list)\n-Relatively large learning curve combined with a ho-hum tutorial.\n-Overpriced and stupid Hi-Res textures DLC\n-DLC Doesn't seem to add very many WW2 units, if any, and just adds a new battle area/battle map\n-Confusing UI and difficulty getting units to always follow orders.\n\nOverall, worth getting especially if you like detailed and realistic WW2 games. This is the pinnacle of WW2 strategy when it comes to realism and authenticity, its better than Men of War in that aspect. Its got some quirks but something about it keeps me coming back even when the AI kicks my ♥♥♥ and I rage quit I still find myself coming back to it.","May 9, 2015","true","97.2"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","37","42","5","6"

You're dead wrong.\n\nFirst time I played it I was like that kid crying in the mall because he can't find his mom. I didn't understand this game at all. I thought it's not my jam. But then I watched some youtube vids of it and fooled around with custom battles and I was like dayum... this IS my jam! This game indeed has some learning curve but it's not as steep as some people say. Tutorial that comes with the game can be thrown outta window immidiately as it is more confusing than helpful. Instead you can start by reading  THIS  awesome guide, watching youtube vids of it and of course playing as it's the best way to learn. Don't be afraid to lose battles and campaigns as sometimes defeat can teach you more than victory (and sometimes you can dominate the enemy but the game will mark campaign result as defeat because the scoring system in this game uses algorhythms more complicated than those used by NASA to control trajectory of space shuttles).\n\nThere are multitudes of folks who play games like Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron which are far more complicated. If you aren't a result of generations of inbreeding then I can't see how could this game be too hard for you.\n\nGraviteam Tactics' campaigns have 2 modes: strategical and tactical.\n\nStrategical mode is kinda like a game of chess where you move icons representing platoons on the map. This turn based mode allows you to overall manage your army, add reserve troops to your existing platoons, send squads that lost their combat effectiveness to the rear, etc.\n\nTactical mode is the crème de la crème of the game. This is what dreams are made of. In this mode you get to command your guys on the battlefield. This game is sort of a commander simulator. This means that you only pass your orders down onto your men who then execute them in a way they see is best fitting. Sometimes they won't take a route you'd want them to, pick wrong targets or simply not execute your orders at all. Micromanagement is not only unneeded but is punished as soldiers may take so many orders before they get confused and end up not executing eny of them. Their performance depends on variety of factors like quality of squad leaders (or lack of them), morale, and so on. This aims to represent how unpredictable the real war is and how often commanders need to change their plans because some of their guys fucкed things up. Sometimes losses are unavoidable.\n\nGame is visually pleasing. Not great but pretty good. Maps are huge and really beautiful. Tracer fire in the night looks absolutely stunning. Tank combat is where this game excels at. Graviteam, having previous experience making tank simulators, developed a great ballistic system. You can see enter and exit holes on vehicles, different velocity and trajectory for different types of ammunition, shells bouncing off the armor, etc. Add to that the enormous ranges, realistically behaving tracks and suspension and you end up with best tank combat ever shown in an RTS game.\n\nBase game offers a few campaigns but then there are the DLCs which, in my opinion, are worth buying. Especially considering that 3 of them are post WWII which makes them particularily interesting.\n\nNow I know what you guys are saying "Dawg this is some weird-a$$ game lemme just stick to muh Company of Heroes shieeeet"\nWell, yeah this isn't a game for everyone but if you played titles like Men of War before and you're looking for something more challenging, well look no further!","September 24, 2015","true","65.2"," 101 of 148 people (68%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","68","101","148","85","6"

Imagine ... Total War with WWII soldiers, but smaller scale and very realistic ... imagine ... Company of Heroes but without all the silliness of spawning units.\n\nYou have a map, like a chessboard, on which you control various platoons. When battle occurs, you get a top down view from miles in the air, and you can zoom right in to see individual men. Tactics are paramount. Very tough! Unforgiving, but with great replayability, because small decisions can have big long-term effects, and dead men and broken vehicles don't just appear again next move. There is very detailed hit modelling for vehicles, and the devs patch to improve things like the way grenades interact with tree branches!\n\nIf you like real time strategy but don't like cartoonish exaggeration ... if you like realistic WWII games in which your tactical skill makes all the difference ... if you want to hear lonely dogs howl in the darkness of a Russian village as men die in the snow ...

Demo version is unpatched and very unfriendly to new players.\nBut you know, I've bought it at Steam store, cause friend told me - "If you tried demo - you've tried nothing".\n\nIt's fun, but right after purchase I've spent my whole weekend trying to save 320th I.D. near Taranovka and this was best and fun experience what I had for the last year.\nDeveloper's love to details are great - terrain is beautiful, units and especially APCs & Tanks are modeled in amazing detail, game mechanics offer you so much aproachs to the game in operational and especially in tactical mode, that every time you start new campaign you will have diffirent experience.\n\n\nIt's a shame that I have missed this title.\nAccording to devs site Graviteam Tactics have lot of DLCs - as soon as they'll arive on Steam, they're instabuy for me ;)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are intersted in tactical wargame with operational elements, good graphics and unique gameplay mechanics - Graviteam Tactics should be your choice!\n\n\nRUS:\nНачну с того, что этот варгейм мне порекомендовал друг, до его рекомендаций и последующего приобритения по отношению к Graviteam Tactics у меня было скептическое настроение.\n\nВначале я попробовал демо, но это было ужасно. Тем не менее, я приобрёл эту игру, т.к. по словам друга "Даже если ты попробовал демо - ты ничего не попробовал".\nВ общем он был прав, т.к. демо не пропатчена и с первого взгляда очень сильно отталкивает.\nВам покажется это смешным, но после приобретения я провёл все свои выходные спасая 320-ю пехотную дивизию из окружения и знайте,- это было шикарно, я давно не испытывал такого в играх.\nЛюбовь разработчиков к деталям удивительна - местность выглядит отлично, боевые единицы и особенно БТРы и Танки смоделированы шикарно, игровая механика даёт игроку столько возможностей на оперативном и особенно на тактическом уровне, что каждый раз начиная кампанию можно быть уверенным, что вы получите новую порцию позитивным эмоций.\n\nОчень жаль, что я пропустил мимо себя эту серию игр раньше - придётся навёрстывать.\n\nСудя по оф. сайту, Graviteam Tactics имеет немало DLC, включая современные сценарии(прим. Ангола) - как только они появятся в Steam, для меня это моментальная покупка :).\n\nИтог:\nЕсли вы заинтересованы в тактическом варгейме с элементами оперативного уровня, хорошей графикой и уникальной игровой механикой - Graviteam Tactics это ваш выбор!","August 4, 2014","true","76.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

Graviteam Tactics is the best RTS I've for a while. I was worried I wouldn't pass the learning curve, because it would be boring but I dived into the game in the first 30 minutes. I just chose a random scenario, and after that I got the idea. You don't have the direct control of your units. You just command; like real officer, to your comrades.\n\nThey will obey, but do the job with initiative and figure the best way to do it themselves. Also, you got to establish and keep radio connection to receive info/give orders, like in real war. Also it has no stupid limits in physics. So if you shoot with an anti-tank rifle it will be the same as it is in real life, no more kiddie's limits like in Company of heroes.\n\nWW2 scenarios are very close to real history, And yea, there isn't stuff like "balance" in this game. You will suffer as you try to stop Nazi armadas with anti-tank rifles and few cannons and no one will help you. Forget about balance. All weapons are accurate to real life, no stupid limitations. So for me Graviteam Wargames is a milestone in my experience, and trust me i've played a lot of RTS, it has great potential. All it needS is PvP and some polish like a shiny engine and style. But Graviteam is a small team of enthuasiasts from eastern Ukraine, Kharkiv. Despite your political views devs need your help with money. Don't let the great idea die, support and enjoy it.\n\nPros\nFresh unique gameplay\nAtmosphere of war\nSound(I got an endorphine boost when heard russian winter sound and dog barking in Shilovo42 campaign)\nOptimization -- runs smoothly on any 5 years old year Rig\nHistorically accurate\nGood ballistics and physics -- you just feel it, cause its based on real stuff.\nLarge variety of campaigns. WW2, Afganistan 80s, Africa Cold war 90s.\nAI is smart. Always trying to flank you. He is playing for objectives, and doesn't want to destroy you. So you need to surprise him, ambush, suicidal attacks, call arty on youself, whatever is neccessary.\n\nCons\nLack of style, it's just brutal like in any wargame. But, maybe thats the style itself?\nGraphical engine is out of date, models are detailed(late DLC) and you can buy new textures for the first DLC.\nUgly «burn the eye» types in menu and in-game\n\nIt's on sale now. I advise you to buy Shilovo42 and Operation hooper if you're fresh to the game.","October 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","3"

Similar to total war series where there is the turn based phase (called operation phase) and the real time phase (called tactical battle phase). So think total war but WWII and this is the game. However the scale is much smaller as you are fighting for a single city municipality region instead of an entire country. Also no base building but you do get reinforcements. The AI does a fair enough job, although you will wish they made this game multiplayer. This is a slow strategy game like sins of a solar empire where patience pays off. My only gripe is on the line of sight system, I swear to all things explodie that I should be able to shoot something but yet my guys are like nope can't do boss. Also pro-tip wait for sales as otherwise $15 per DLC is kinda a rip....All in all Great Game 8.5/10","May 16, 2015","true","407.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebaw/recommended/275290/","spacebaw","goodpoints","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebaw/","334 products in account","Simply put, the best tactical wargame around, cardboard or PC. It's not all that difficult to learn, nor is it loaded with tedious micromanagement, so don't be indimidated thinking this is the land version of Harpoon/Command:MNAO.  However, it is time consuming and the slower pace will likely bore those without a serious interest in Eastern Front military history. The manual/tutorials are not very helpful but the UI is really quite simple to pick up with some experimentation. If you've played less realistic games like the Wargame series, Combat Mission, or Theatre of War you should feel some familiarity. As far as subject matter, it's primarily WWII eastern front, but DLC operations are available to expand it into the rarely covered Angolan Civil War as well as a Sino-Soviet border skirmish and a hypothetical Iranian intervention in the Soviet-Afghan War. (unfortunately if you want an actual Soviet-Afghan War scenario, you'll have to look to GT's other game, Steel Armor)\n\nI consider Graviteam Tactics to be the first honest-to-goodness tactical land combat sim, sort of like the squad-level version of Command Ops. No gimmics, no turn-based time segmentation, no motivational speaker leaders rallying troops on to heroic feats; just cold hard weapons statistics.  Graviteam is also renonwn for their tank sims so every weapon and ammunition type is individually and accurately modelled against every type and section of armor (yep that's hull, superstructure, and turret!) for range, ballistics, penetration, etc. It's also the first game on a small unit scale to seriously model communications and command & control: issuing orders requires a level of 'command', which is increased by such factors as being near the commanding officer, squads operating together as a platoon/company, and the presence of comms units. Your units will not always follow your orders, or enact them the way you planned, and once a squad becomes engaged, it can often be very difficult to modify it's orders. Other vital soft factors are accounted for as well with very granular systems for morale, supression, and fatigue.\n\nI can find little wrong with the core tactical system, it just works. The only major flaw is that close quarters combat can get a bit wonky, soldiers often ignore enemies a few feet in front of them and often rush into hilarious melee combat.(alternately exchanging rigidly animated kicks and rifle butt strikes) I'd also like to see a more fleshed out orders system with more control over unit frontages, support weapon usage, line of advance, etc., or the AI's performance in those regards be improved. Some more hotkeys would also be nice.\n\nThe operational system serves primarily to generate skirmishes, but there is some nice detail in the way of fatigue from moving on the operational map carrying over to skirmishes and supply lines for fuel & ammo. I'm a bit baffled why a square grid was chosen for this though as it has the tendency to generate odd engagements (with all units within a square area being drawn into battle) and encourage some gamey tactics as far as unit positioning. A hex grid would have worked far better imo. It doesn't detract all that much from the game, the heart of which is in the tactical mode, but it can cause frustration at times.\n\nYou really have to play the game to realize the level of ambition here. Just astounding. Blows every other squad-level tactical wargame out of the water.","April 12, 2015","true","226.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

He didn't know much about the operation they were being sent on, only that the Germans had holed up on a hill and needed to be dislodged so the army could advance. It was his first taste of battle. Makeev led the regiment through a forest quietly and everyone thought that the germans must have gone home as they had received no fire. That notion was ended as they reached the end of the woods and ran right into the german's dug in fighting positions. They had been waiting and opened fire. The lucky men managed to get into cover behind trees and soon Fillmonov was one of the senior leaders still standing. He tried to call in artillery but the chaos of the battle made it impossible. Makeev went down to a burst of machine gun fire and the regiment was scattered to a few pockets of men desperately taking cover. Unaware of their prediciment the commisar ordered them forwards again. Fillmonov refused the order and instead stayed in cover behind the trees with the few remaining memebers of his regiment. He could tell by the gunfire in the distance that the other regiments were also getting hammered by German fire and he just kept his head down and prayed that they would break through to rescue him and his men. This didn't happen. Fillmonov took a fatal rifle round to the chest just one minute before relief arrived to sweep over the German positions. His regiment ended that battle with only three men left standing. All were killed in the battle to take the next german position farther along.\n10/10 would madly rush all of my regiments into machine gun fire for the glory of the motherland again","May 3","true","5.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","13","17","5","0"

Quite the contrary. It really is the ultimate WW2 RTS simulator. There is simply no other game that is so detailed and thought-through than GTOS.\n\nI must admit that it took a couple of hours of me watching Youtube tutorials and walkthroughs (Arch Warhammer has a nice channel) to actually start somewhat understanding how to play it. But it is worth it once you get an overall idea.\n\nSo, apart from developers trying their best to make sure that people do not play this game (inexistent marketing + awful tutorial), I must say that the game is a blast. You really feel that a lot of love was put into it.\n\nVerdict: If you are into the history of WW2 and want a game that offers a realistic and fun experience, go for it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theblackbradpitt/recommended/275290/","theblackbradpitt","Brunswick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theblackbradpitt/","173 products in account","I grew up playing games like Close Combat and Combat Mission, but I always felt like those two games could be improved upon. Close Combat, particularly the 2nd and 3rd games in the series, were a great mix of highly tactical combat with campaign systems that allowed your units to fight battles which affected future battles and operations. While the later games went on to have bigger battles and maps, they lost a bit of the magic of the early games where the battles felt much more like struggles and where your past mistakes could lead you to be stuck in situations in Arnhem, or wherever, where you had 4 squads and needed to hold on for a half hour to get a decent cease fire. On the other hand, the Combat Mission series took the war to 3D but kept the extremely complex morale system and tank combat. Yet I never found the series quite as engaging due to a lack of any meaningful campaign system and clunky, abstracted interface and graphics. What I always wanted more was a strategic system like that of the later Close Combat series mixed with 3D graphics, and I think I've found that in the Graviteam Tactics series.\n\nI've now played a handful of different operations on some of the expansions as well as the original map and I've enjoyed it immensely. There was much talk about the terrible interface and whatnot in the reviews, but I think if you've played Close Combat or CM the controls are more or less normal, especially when using the right click interface to use the most common movement commands. That being said, the learning curve here will still be large for anyone new to the series and you probably won't do well your first battle. Incredibly, the game starts you out with a night mission where you will probably wonder at first if the game is even working. Once the first firefights kick off and you see tracers flying you'll probably be entertained enough just watching, but most people will probably be baffled as to how to do anything. The graphics and sounds as a whole do a great job of making you feel like you're really in a frozen battlefield, though the sounds aren't the highest quality.\n\nI somehow won my first operation, despite having no idea how it really worked. I still don't really understand resupply or what half the indicators mean, even after reading the manual. But it's still a ton of fun and gives some really unique gameplay. The strategic layer adds a ton to the game, leaving you to make the decision to press for an attack with weakened troops or hold back and regroup. Sometimes you'll find yourself forced to defend for the 6th battle in a row with a couple of platoons reduced to a few squads with no ammo in a town reduced to rubble. When it comes to the battles themselves, they're an hour or less in length and vary wildly in how they go. At times you'll have battles where you and the enemy immediately cease fire because you're so weak. Other times you'll have a 45 minute long running gun battle with tanks exploding left and right and hundreds of casualties.\n\nGenerally your men do what you tell them to do, though you don't need to micromanage too much in this game. Even just using the right click command modes, there's a great variety of commands to give you flexibility. Morale and command are modeled well and I haven't seen many times where my men reacted in unexpected ways. Most battles I have played I enjoy, even when getting destroyed by the enemy, which happens more in this game than I'm used to from other games! Enemy AI tends to be smart and will maneuver around you if they find a way. Cover is well utilized in the game, with buildings, forests, hedgerows, etc giving your men cover in what feels like a realistic way. Using certain commands you can tell your men to find cover when they get to a place which is a great feature.\n\nThat all being said, this game isn't perfect. Tank pathfinding can be terrible and inexplicably dumb. Tanks will sometimes crash into a tree and not realize that they can back up and go around it. Sometimes things happen when it comes to the results of a battle which make no sense, and there's no real explanation of why you just knocked out 10 tanks and lost none but got a total defeat. Sometimes your men decide to lay in a field rather than the fence with bushes 5 feet away from them. But my biggest complaint thus far is with the friendly AI units.\n\nIn operations where you have allied units they will be AI controlled on the strategic map as well as in any battles where you have your own troops involved. I have found that on the strategic level they're worse than useless, with Tiger tank units moving to a far off, peaceful corner to defend nothing while Russian tanks destroy my lines just to the side of them, or my lone KV units deciding they just don't feel like fighting battles and moving behind my lines to hang out. If by some unfortunate event end up in a battle where you have all infantry and the AI controls your tanks or AT guns, forget it and just run away. The tanks will probably go get stuck in a ditch (or in one case, my AI tank decided to crash into a destroyed tank hull and get stuck there) or drive off away from your defenses. The AT guns will probably be in the middle of a forest and will ignore that road 20 feet away where the enemy tanks have to drive. Luckily, I've read that you can turn the AI control off and use the units as your own, with some penalties, which is still much better than letting the AI ruin your game.\n\nOverall, however, the pros far outweigh the cons. This is a highly realistic, beautiful wargame which is a great successor to the Close Combat series. If you always wanted a 3D version of that and found other games lacking, this game is worth checking out. The AI isn't perfect, but the enemy AI at least is generally good and can beat me much of the time. The DLC that I have played are all very cool and well worth picking up, especially during a sale when it's 2 or 3 bucks for an operation which should give you 10-20 hours of new gameplay. I plan on buying the next game in the series once I've finished this one and all the DLC I bought, and I expect it to be great as well!","May 23","true","55.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/33333333391/recommended/275290/","33333333391","Yogi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/33333333391/","108 products in account","Graviteam Tactics brings certain elements to the table not found in many other RTS games.\n\nTL:DR at the bottom.\n\nFirst off the game does a wonderful job of mixing turn-based strategy like the Total War series, with real time strategy like Men of War and Wargame, but also mixes in a beautiful level of depth similar to Hearts of Iron.\n\nGT has several levels/phases before you actually start fighting.  Now, before you get too far, you need to understand that just because the game is similar to the games I mentioned above, it is also very different in other areas as well.  For example the phase that reminds me of Hearts of Iron is the Operational Phase where you are looking at a macromanagement screen moving units around the table to strategic locations.  Here you can rearm units, interchange between other platoons, and give them movement orders all while being careful not to move them too far due to fatigue and fuel usage.\n\nAfter the Operational Phase comes the battle phases, starting with the Deployment Phase.  Simply put this is at the micro level where you deploy your squads at the beginning of the battle.  In the screenshots of the game you'll see a green, red, yellow, etc. grid system.  This is confusing at first but that is basically telling you what the terrain is like in that 10 meter section of ground.  It basically tells you the cover rating, if you are able to trench, etc. but this grid will go away after you deploy.\n\nAfter the Deployment Phase you will have the Initial Orders Phase where you will be able to give your many units some orders so that you are not rushed once the Real Time aspect of the game kicks in.  This is a very important phase in my opinion and can be the difference between you winning and losing.  I like to really plan out my tactics and strategy in this phase and really take the most time here so that I'm not wasting time later on.  This will also help your overall command level which is very important later on.  Basically, unlike Wargame and Men of War, your units will not just follow your orders directly every time you tell them to do something.  In fact the more orders you give them the less they will obey.  You have to remember that most of the battles taking place in Graviteam Tactics are taking place before the use of satellite radio systems and you have to establish a wire connection for most orders to get to your ground troops.  This is something I find very enjoyable and different than other RTS games.  You can actually see your wire teams working to establish communications for your officers.\n\nOnce Initial Orders Phase is complete you will be fighting in real time.  This is where the RTS kicks in and you get to see the bullets fly, and let me tell you, some of the explosions and tracer fire is top notch in this game.  You can zoom all the way in and really get a feel for the action.\n\nMy only recommendations are to buy the Vanilla version of Graviteam Tactics and possibly wait for some sales for the other DLCs.  I was lucky enough to get most the DLCs free from a friend, but I really like all of them.  Each DLC has something different to offer.\n\nMy only gripes with the game are the voice acting (when you zoom in real close).  They are not really done the greatest but it's not something I really care about.\n\nThe other thing is that there is no multiplayer which is a complaint from many players.  This is what I think holds this game back from being more popular at least.  It doesn't mean the game is bad by any means because it's very good really, but it would be really fun to play with other people either through Co Op or against them in head to head or even against someone in a full scale campaign where you could potentially save progress.  I know a lot of people out there prefer to play Single Player anyways, so that they can take their time, it would still be nice to possibly play with a new player who is trying to learn the game.  It's awkward to teach someone while not being able to show them the ropes first hand.  Other than those two things there is absolutely nothing I have to complain about.  I know others have complained about the User Interface but I don't understand those complaints at all really.\n\nJust be aware that the game is NOT something you'll be mastering straight out of the box.  It really takes some expirmentation and practice to get a grasp on.  But if you like a difficult challenge and are willing to put the time then this could be one of the best RTS games you've ever played.  I'm not sure if there is a demo or anything, and I know there isn't a whole lot of good videos on youtube or anywhere else, but if you're ever interested in seeing the game you can PM me and I'll screenshare with you on Skype or here on Steam.\n\nP.S.  If you end up buying this game and really enjoy it, I also recommend buying Graviteam's Steel Armor game here on Steam.  It's basically the exact same game, but you're able to jump in and fight with two tank variants;  the M60A1 and the T-62.  There is also a game called Steel Fury which has a few World War 2 tanks but is not available on Steam at the moment.\n\nAnyways, thank you Graviteam for making such an awesome game and I hope you all can find the time and money to purchase this incredible game for yourselves.\n\nTL:DR...\n\n-The game is very difficult but very well worth the learning curve.\n\n-Total War series meets Men of War meets Wargame meets Hearts of Iron = Graviteam Tactics.\n\n-No Multiplayer\n\n-Bad voice acting when zooming in, but who cares really?\n\n-Somewhat expensive DLCs but just wait for a sale which happens pretty often for this title.\n\n-If you end up liking, check out Steel Armor: Blaze of War (on Steam) and/or Steel Fury (not available on Steam currently)","March 21, 2015","true","26.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This is not Command and Conquer: Eastern Front.  It's going to take me a lot of time to figure out what I should be doing, and the tutorial is not that great.  Even at my basic level of floundering around, it's still a lot of fun.  I have a feeling that once you've figured it all out, just about anything is possible, but I'll likely not be doing much in the campaigns for a while.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing, but they are certainly more than adequate.  When you use the camera view to follow a tank as it trundles toward the enemy, you'll definitely get the atmosphere of battle.  Sound is very good.\n\nThe camera controls are pretty clunky, and I find myself constantly fiddling with the rotation, zoom, etc.\n\nThere is a quick battle setup, but I really wish it could generate random battles based on your mission and the strength of the units you pick.  It does take a lot away to know exactly what units the enemy has and where they will start.\n\nThe unit selection is sort of limited.  I'm not sure if this is due to what was in use in the exact areas at the exact times simulated, but there are a fair number of 1942-3 appropriate vehicles from both sides that could be added.  This is especially true of air support, which is represented by only two aircraft on each side, and air defense, which neither side has any of.  The Il-2 would be a lot less scary with even a 20mm on a halftrack.\n\nAll in all, this is a good buy for anyone into 'serious' wargaming.  Steep learning curve, but quite immersive, and a lot of replayability.  If you want to see if the new Graviteam release, Mius, is for you, this is a budget priced way to find out.","March 11","true","7.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

And I should know, Ive played everything from Company of Heroes 2, to Hearts of Iron 3 (yea you might have to look that one up), yet I digress. This game is the perfect mixture between real time combat and strategy. Its as if they took the scale of Empire: Total War, and molded it with the intensity of Company of Heroes.\nThe game has more mechanics to it then I can even discuss in this review alone. For example, in order to detect an enemy, your unit must ACTUALLY see them, a ground breaking mechanic, I know /sarcasm. Yet, this simple feature alone gives the game a great deal of realism as opposed to a Total War game where the enemy's location is immediately known. The game even has realistic ballistics, mmmm theres nothing better than hitting a T34 from the side and watching that ammunition burn off for the next 30 mins... which brings me to my next point, each vehicle, each gun, each man can be hurt or destroyed in different places. From the transmission of a tank to the destruction of a mortar tube, each component in this game is dynamically destructible. This game will truly challenge your strategic prowess in ALL fields. Whether its making a choice between sending your AT guns forward to nail the enemy into submission or holding them back to save ammunition for future tank advances, this game will CONSTANTLY keep you on your toes in all fields of warfare.\n\nSimply put, this game is much more realistic and tactical than every other RTS ive played in quite some time, consequently it puts it at the top of my list as the most fun as well. The satisfaction from beating back the hordes of Soviets or the crushing of the Huns (Germans lol) can not matched by any other game on the market today, this is a must buy.\n\n11/10 would airstrike again\n","March 20, 2015","true","198.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The various game options allow you to make it as easy (arcade-like) or difficult (intense wargame) as you want.\n\nEngrossing on every level: operational-level campaign planning, tactical-level warfare, beautifully accurate units and environments, wide-ranging theaters of war, skirmish modes, military encyclopedia, real military honors awarded to your troops in real time and more.\n\nYou will have to understand formations, logistics and the order of battle.  The game rewards proper organization of battalions, companies, platoons, squads and commanders.\n\nWWII buffs: in the Krasnaya Polyana DLC you can use a Russian Infantry Division to hunt down and kill Commander Joachim Pieper as he leads the exact units Pieper actually used to rescue encircled Nazi soldiers in 1943.\n\nBuy it and invest the time it takes to understand it.  You'll be entertained for years.\n\nBecause there is no multiplayer, it's important to note the AI is good and replayable in this game.

Battles are fought in two steps, first you make chess-like turn based moves on the operational map and then you fight a series of corresponding real time engagements.\n\nMain game concepts and mechanics are direct descendants of Close Combat series. With squad level control, attention to morale, weapon loadouts and rough realism, however visual part of game is a huge leap ahead. You will find one of the best 3D scenery you ever saw in strategy game here. Lighting, shading, weather effects, complex landscape,terraforming, etc.. Everything looks great and really belivable here and Total War series is the closest what comes to mind if you want to compare visual style.\n\nBattle part provides from \"little\" to \"no\" compromise in this game. Single bullet hit usually means dead soldier, mortar shell on your position usually means dead squad and enemy tank is your  worst nigthmare. Germans are mechanized, better equiped and organized, so all Soviet campaigns are even more hard to play. No balance or helpfull scripts here. DEFEAT means DEFEAT.\n\nAbsolutely must have for everyone who like challenging realistic wargames. Game is pretty old, but dont be fooled by that, it looks perfect and dont have even close analogues anyway.\n\nPROS\n\nStrong concept, mix of Close Combat indepth detalisation and Total War beauty.\nPhoto realistic scenery, dynamic weather and day\\night cycle.\nRealistic physics (terraforming, ballistics, weight, traction and torque for vehicles, etc..)\nREAL night battles (this will impress you)\nHigh replay ability\nAI capable to surprise (you will see)\nRealistic and hard wargame not for everyone, no balance and cybersport ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (you are warned)\n\nCONS\n\nLimited choice of locations and units (compared to mainstream games)\nNot the best unit animations\nVoiceover is trash (who needs it anyway)\nNo fancy tutorials (not a big problem for a dedicated wargamer but a nightmare for a casual)\nSome questionable things here and there (just couple of them)\nHeavy impact on system. Forget about recommended system specs. You will need a TOP 2016 hardware to turn everything on.\nNo multiplayer (biggest dissapointment)\n\nHighly recommended!\n9 out of 10","June 1","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have never played a similar RTS. This game is so incredibly realistic. It just takes so many things into account like fatigue, experience, morale, communications, command, etc. Super steep learning curve but if you just dedicate an hour or so to getting the basics down, it will be worth it. When I first got it i was completely confused and I regretted buying the game but I tried it again about a year later and it suddenly just clicked. This is probably my favorite RTS. Although the scale of the battles can be massive, the small details and smaller fights feel great too (unlike Wargame Red Dragon in my opinion).

Let's start from the basic's, when installed this game will come up with an installation error for no reason (later in the game it does this too). I know many people are saying "well is your P.C spec correct".. well after installing it on 3 different machines I can safely say that the issue isn't P.C spec. I have plenty of games on here with much higher demands and they are fine.\nAfter getting the game to finally run you have a lengthy tutorial on how to run the game. I will say now, that if you do not take RTS seriously turn away (take note: this isn't an RTS as its still very much turn based). One thing this game is great for (and is sort of its curse), is that you really need to think tactics and not just click away until your heart is content. Going back to what I meant in the tutorial, I really think this could have been simplified and sped up with a commentary tutorial (or have tutorial hints that aren't directly in the bloody way of what you are doing).\n...At this point the installation error happened once again. Frustrated I have looked online to resolving the issue and installed it over and over. I have play this game once and that involved me getting past the tutorial to be almightly !@#$ off at the £5-6 I just spent.\nI'm sure the game may have promise, but right now I feel like I've just had Steam and Graviteam (like two school bullies) shove me about and walk off with my lunch money.","May 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","19","4","21","5","2"
