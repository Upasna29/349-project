It'll probably be fun for the first couple of minutes, while you still think there's more to the game than it seems, but then you'll soon find out that there isn't.\n\nYou have 4 heroes on the left side of the screen, and colored runes come scrolling towards them (with each color representing a hero or the enemy). If an enemy rune hits the end of the line, the hero on that line gets damaged. If all your heroes die, it's game over.\n\nAt this point you'll think that each level will have something different besides an increasingly rune-cluttered group of lines that scrolls faster and faster, but nope, that's it. And while it's fun for a bit, the lack of variation gradually becomes very boring. There is no story, no interesting quests or goals, just few very "meh" achievements.\n\nTo make matters worse, the thing is incredibly buggy, specially on level transitions. Pausing is a dangerous choice as chances are that the game will bug instead of really pausing, leaving you stuck in a weird limbo in which you can't do anything but see your heroes dying, which can be very frustrating if you've been playing for a while. You'll then have to start from 0, and hope not to get caught in a bug again.\n\nThe controls are at times a little wobbly, giving the impression that the game was designed for a touch screen and poorly ported to the PC. So at times things won't scroll as they should, and you'll fail to drag runes around, very often leading to death.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast and mindlessly repetitive buggy match 3 game, however, you've found it.","March 24, 2014","false","1.4"," 105 of 126 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","105","126","0","6"

This is nothing but a port of a mobile game.  It may work well with a touch screen, but with a mouse it just sucks.  The mouse often doesn't respond as you want it to.  For instance, you have to drag the runes or whatever around to place them by matching runes.  This is sometimes seen as a click.  The same goes for when you are trying to click.  It sometimes responds as if you are dragging.  You are definitely going to run into problems once the game speeds up.  Just a mess.

Having bugs is inevitable but the lack of communication / support only shows that the developer cares more about creating a sequel (money) than fixing bugs (quality).\n\nIt heavily feels like this game is designed for a touch screen and that the PC port was done in a hurry as far as controls are concerned.\n\nIf I overlook all the bugs and only focus on the game I would simply say this:  it`s extremely repetitive as you only do one fight after another, no "world" / "story" to discover, nothing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/229520/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Dungeon Hearts is a match-3/RPG crossover that fails under its own ambitions of trying to recreate the wheel. It's bursting at the seams with original mechanics and a fresh take on match-3 games, but seemingly forgot to test if any of the ideas it presents actually add anything to the experience or makes for a game that's worth playing. It continually tries too hard to insert itself as something unique in a broad spectrum of derivative peers, that it forgets that the reason those games bare such a resemblance to each other is because the formula works, leaving it standing awkwardly on the sidelines like an odd kid who has been ostracized at his own party.\n\nBroken down into its simplest elements, Dungeon Hearts plays like a combination of Collapse and Guitar Hero. Colored gems come horizontally across the screen toward your characters, and you must combine three like colored gems to form a power gem that allows you to clear away skulls which hurt your character if they make it all the way across. This basic system is continually and rapidly expanded as you play, with unique levels for your four characters, blocks that can't be moved, skulls that take multiple hits to clear away, and so on and so forth. It all combines to make for a game that starts out simply enough but quickly becomes entirely and utterly overwhelming. There begins to be so much constantly happening on screen, that it's nigh impossible to begin to keep up.\n\nI kept hoping that maybe if I just played another round or two Dungeon Hearts would finally click for me, but the longer I stuck with it the more annoyed I became at its cumbersome controls and incessant need to constantly throw more at you than you can handle. There are undoubtedly some really neat ideas hidden in Dungeon Hearts that could potentially be spun out into a better game, but what Cube Roots has done with them feels more like they threw everything at the wall hoping something would stick, than careful and deliberate design. And even then it almost works, which makes the colossal waste of a game that it turned out to be all the more disappointing.","June 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

The game is played by matching three like-colored objects to build attacks that are used against a random selection of monsters. Sliding objects around the playing field is cumbersome and often unresponsive with mouse controls. I can’t play more than a few rounds before my wrist starts begging for relief. Chaining together attacks is especially difficult. I was constantly scrambling to clear out poison blocks with no time to consider any sort of strategy. It is rather rewarding to pull off a massive combo, but all of mine were complete accidents. The RPG elements in Dungeon Hearts are all fluff. I like the idea of incorporating an upgrade system into this type of puzzle game, but it wasn’t implemented in a very effective or interesting manner. You gain experience points by playing a mini game between battles, and your characters automatically level up to be stronger and have more special moves. I would have felt like I had greater influence over the game if there had been a simple skills tree.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/229520/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","If I told you that Dungeon Hearts was a match-3 puzzle game, RPG hybrid, would you dismiss it as another Puzzle Quest clone? Well, it is, but you shouldn't, because it isn't. Let me explain...Dungeon Hearts puts you in control of a party of four adventurers who rush headlong from one battle to the next in an unquenchable thirst for glory that doesn't end until they're all dead. As the adventures race in place and the world scrolls past them, monsters appear in a steady stream from the other side of the screen. Defeat one, the next appears, and the battle begins anew.\n\nDuring battles, which account for about 99% of the gameplay, four lines are drawn horizontally across the screen, each aligned with one of the adventurers. Colored stones scroll along these lines, fate lines as the game calls them, from the right edge of the screen and make their way to the adventurers on the left. Using the mouse you need to drag these stones to place three of them of the same color together either horizontally or vertically. When you do they combine to form a gem that will damage the monster when double-clicked. The gem will also trigger other gems aligned with it either horizontally or vertically to explode, and the more gems in the chain reaction, the more damage is done to the monster. Include gems of different colors in the chain and you'll score even more bonus damage. The gems are also used to trigger the other types of icons that travel down the fate lines. Skulls represent the monster's attacks, and if they're not eliminated before they reach the end of a line they'll damage the adventurer that they hit. Spell and buff icons, for both the party and the monster, are also triggered or destroyed by the gems. If an adventurer dies during a battle, the corresponding colored stones become grayed over and can no longer be used to build gems. This gives you fewer opportunities to make gems, takes away some combos, and puts more obstacles on the fate lines. If you manage to win the battle, the adventurer will be revived for the next. If you lose all four in a battle, then it's game over. Defeat a monster and you'll get to play a fast-paced version of the game in which a tightly packed run of colored stars make their way down the fate lines. Matching three of the same color will level-up the corresponding adventurer, one level per every three stars matched. The game's fantasy theme and level-up bonus levels are the extent of its tie to RPGs, and it's far more of a puzzle game than it is an RPG. The background graphics are colorful and evoke memories of JRPGs of a console generation gone by, but you have to stay so focused on the fast-moving fate lines that you won't really be able to enjoy them. There's no persistence between games, so after your party is all dead you'll begin the next game from the beginning with a group of level one adventurers. And if there was any doubt left about the game's primary nature, at the end of a game you're given a score.\n\nSo it's not much of an RPG - no big deal as long as the puzzle part's fun, right? Well, Dungeon Hearts is a fun puzzle game, but also one that's more geared to those with quick reflexes than those who want to carefully setup and execute their gem combos. The game is fast moving and will keep you so focused that you won't be aware that a game can last twenty minutes or more unless you check a clock (luckily, the game will let you pick up where you left off if you need to leave early). My biggest complaint with the game comes from the controls, specifically that the mouse has a tendency to drop a stone as you try to move it around another stone, particular when you 're trying to turn a corner around another stone.\n\nDungeon Hearts is a fun and challenging puzzle game, but I can see it disappointing gamers looking for more of an RPG element in the game or those who will find that the fate lines move too fast for their tastes. It's certainly the kind of puzzle game you'll come back to now and again. Since it's an indie title and can be had for a relatively low price, it's easy to recommend adding this to your game library.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","24","39","0","0"

This concept is dragged in every single possible direction; it steadily develops as the game continues. Three circles make a diamond, which allows one of the 4 color-coded heroes to attack. Three diamonds make a super charged attack that clears the que. Every time a new type of puzzle piece is introduced the game stops to inform you of what it does. The 4 party members have appealing designs with their own set of subtle passive abilities and stylish super techniques. The red knight uses timed mouse clicks to deal damage, they yellow mage manipulates the que and puzzle pieces, the blue wizard uses rapid mouse clicks to heal and protect the other team members, and the green archer uses skill shots akin to M.O.B.A’s to inflict status ailments.

Much to my disappointment, I instead found myself bored to death within 20 minutes of starting.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Dungeon Hearts overall is that the RPG elements feel very tacked-on and unnecessary. Character skills are poorly explained and feel clumsy to use due to generally poor interface design. Above all, there's very little feeling of actual progression and very little done to break the general monotony of the gameplay. Every enemy is fought in more or less the exact same manner - form attacks by combining 3 of the same color piece, move the attack gem onto a line that contains an enemy attack gem, and click. Repeat ad infinitum. Combined with the total lack of story,  the "epic journey" feels like little more than a slight occasional change in backdrop scenery.\n\nWhen you strip away the façade of supposed RPG gameplay in Dungeon Hearts, what remains is the puzzle game aspects. Unfortunately, as stated before, the puzzle game core is incredibly repetitive and comes with a click-and-drag system that feels incredibly choppy and awkward to use. In the end, the only redeeming factor to be found is the surprisingly solid soundtrack.\n\nIn summary, Dungeon Hearts pretends to be a unique blend of the classic "match-3" puzzle type game and an RPG, but at the end of the day, the RPG aspects are little more than a shallow veneer coating an even shallower game.","July 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I see now that there is   a version for touch devices and I think that's where it belongs.  I say this because a majority of the gameplay involves moving different colored blocks around a DDR/Guitar Hero-esque track.  You only have a limited time to make matchs (before they hit the end) and it gets very hectic very quickly.  Mouse controls just don't work very well for this, and I think a touch device would work better.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay is cool and the ideas are unique enough that although they don't really work that well in practice, I recommend checking out Dungeon Hearts just to see this gameplay.  I really want to get good at it but it's god damned hard, and I think the difficulty comes largely from the limited means by which we can play it.\n\nOh, the basic idea is to order colors together before they reach the end.  You want to stop enemy attacks from getting off while building up your own combos via hitting multiples of s color.  By hitting your colors you do damage to an enemy.

What i want is to meet the developers and watch them play it in front of me so I can see what kind of freakish experts they are.  It is entertaining and useful when you have exactly 10 minutes to waste on a game and it's colorful and innovative which are all things that I like.  If it just weren't for the unrelenting difficulty then this one get such a better recommendation from me but as it stands the easy mode eventually starts sending out more bad tiles than good tiles and I feel like Lucy in the episode where she and Ethel work in the chocolate factory and I just can't keep up.","April 20, 2013","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I wanted to treat this game punitively, I'd say it takes the standard Final Fantasy team line-up (warrior, black mage, white mage, archer) and they've thrown in a puzzle game). I can't be that punitive. This game has complexity, and depth you'd struggle to find in some of puzzle games you'd immediately think of.\n\nYou have four lines across the screen, gems will slide towards you, if they reach the end, they disappear. If you move 3 of the same colour in any pattern except diagonally, you can make an attack gem. Which, when clicked, will attack the enemy you are fighting. The enemy has their own gems too, if you can't move them quick enough, or can't use your attacks to remove them from the bar, they will attack your characters and drain their health.\n\nAnd I'm only getting starting. Characters level up between runs, learn abilities, monsters, mini-bosses, runes that make the game move faster, or randomly freeze different runes, or make you take more damage.\n\nOh, one thing I didn't mention. This game is tough. It starts deceptively simple, but it works through it's mechanics like Neil DeGrasse Tyson blows your mind.\n\nIt has different modes of play, an easy to grasp tutorial level, and a very FF-esque art style (think DS remake FF games).\n\nThe only thing I can even think to ping this game for, is the soundtrack is incredbily repetitive. You might do better to listen to your own tracks and turn the music off entirely.\n\nThe best part? This game costs under a dollar. Seriously, less than a small fries from McDonalds.

If you have played Magical Drop or pattern-matching games, you'll be familiar with this one. You need to match tiles, and explode them to do damage to enemies. Chain more special tiles to do moar damage. Yes, reflex and quick coordination are necessities to progress.\n\nYour team consists of four characters, each has personal special attacks and abilities that you can invoke after reaching certain levels. Enemies can also attack you using their special moves, poison or hex that weakens your char. That's it, RPG style.\n\nGraphic is great and can please my eyes. I'm kinda selective when it comes to graphic quality, but hey for this one I don't even complain. Not hi-tech like that of Diablo 3, but it does its job. Background graphic is kinda boring and repetitive, but during battles who gives a damn looking at background?\n\nSoundtrack is included, much to my joy! And what's more, they're not forgettable. These OSTs are your typical RPGs' OST, fast paced and intense. Bosses' OSTs are even more awesome. My personal fav: Troublesome Foe.\n\nNormal campaign has 3 difficulty levels. If you want challenge, start no less than normal. Hard is for experienced players.\n\nWhat's more, if you've beaten the game and want more, we have Endless mode.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong buying the game.

Heck, even the anime characters don't even phase me that much.  They're pretty harmless and fairly low key as far as such characters go.  The thing that landed Dungeon Hearts is the game play.\n\nThe puzzle style of Dungeon Hearts is not hard to figure out.  In theory, it's actually a pretty decent puzzle system.  Match 3 or more colors to clear gems off the moving game board, each color representing a different character who then does damage to your enemy.  Combine gems of different colors on different levels, double your attack score!  My frustrations come mostly from my self;  I just don't feel fast enough to be any good at the game.\n\nThe learning curve starts out simple enough, but it doesn't take long before you're in the full mix of battle and for me, I started to fumble my gems very quickly. This led to frustration, which led to resentment towards a game I wanted to be casual and ultimately lead to it's being removed from the hard drive.\n\nI'ts not a bad game by any means, it's just not for me.","July 25, 2013","true","2.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Even though the mouse draging in the game might be a bit annoying for some, I found it fun and some what quite interesting to play with as it keeps you going keeps you thinking too (well at least for me it did).\n\nFor the price you pay (even though i paid for it when it was £0.49) you shouldn't expect all singing all dancing game for such a small price. Sure the GFX of the game isn't in a 1920x1080 or higher res for the average user but still feeling like a game people shouldn't mark down so harshly (in my opinion).\n\nIf you want to test you mouse pointing skills or improve how fast you can do this (depends on what you want to do) then this game is ideal for the once a day play sort of idea. I might be talking rubish for some but thats what I see in this game. Nothing too much, just straight play of the mouse and see your reaction are to the movements of your mouse.\n\nGreat game and I spent 21mins on my first go and enjoyed it.\n\nRecommended for people who just want to test their skills on moving objects at fast pace with just the mouse as for those who prefer to use WASD (if thats how you would prefer) then its not intended for that use.\n\n10/10 I probs being playing this once a day to keep me going :DDDD","July 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But I played it with keyboard and mouse on a desktop computer, and in that more traditional situation it felt like playing the worst level of Bejeweled quest mode imaginable.  Everything has a short and punishing time constraint, including collecting XP to level up after a level (or failing to do so!).  The basic gameplay is simplistic and boring -- yet actions that should be the simplest, easiest, and most basic fundamentals of the game are awkward.  Difficulty comes from bad ergonomics, not from a true skill requirement.  There is a lot of interesting complexity to explore, but it's set up to remove rewards for actions several steps from good play, so even the best parts of the game design make the experience less compelling.","May 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was true, but only for something like 10 minutes. Then it gets waaaay too repetitive, even with the changes through the stages.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the game is way too hectic. Although it doesn't seem to have any major flaws, it's just no fun. I like my puzzle games a bit more relaxed. You're just end up dragging spheres and diamonds around almost aimlessly. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL YOU'LL EVER DO, OVER AND OVER. And sometimes there's a lot going on on the board and you can't move things around properly. Also, dragging things around is not as smooth a task as it should be.\n\nSome other things that bugged me:\n- You're always in such a hurry that it's easy to forget you have skills to use.\n- Each battle takes way too much time.\n- You should be able to keep better track of the enemy's HP.\n- I didn't get the achievement for reaching stage 7, although I got the one for stage 15.\n\nI didn't like the game. But I think some people might. Would you like to play a fast-paced match-3 game with an RPG setting? Would you enjoy dragging pieces around a moving board, always in a hurry?

Don't dismiss it thinking that low price means it is some junk. What may appear like a rhythm rpg is actualky a match three puzzle, which feels almost like something entirely different. As you start playing and pass some easy levels you will begin seeing different shapes, new types of blocks, and ability blocks. All of this is happening with the playfield moving to the right quicker and quicker. Gameplay becomes even more fun because of the shorter time available to move your blocks, and having to decide which blocks to match. Based on that last decision you may perform any of the number special powers each of your character has. As can be seen in screenshots, each character has 3 powers fo ra total of 12 when you have all 4. Basically the premise and the gameplay are excellent.\n\nIn regards to graphics and art direction, Dungeon Hearts does not impress too much. Character models are 3d cartoonish characters with large heads. They are not very impressive. Their animations are very basic and sometimes repetitive. It could be annoying or irritating. The models of enemies and their animations are much more interesting. I am not sure how many there are, but they are pretty well designed, diverse, and since they circulate and you see new ones a lot, it maintains interest. Backgrounds are great. Pretty good on the eyes, but they don't mean much contextually.\nthere areBut all of that depends on importance you give to those things. Different for everybody.\n\nSound is alright, and I do not have much to comment about it. Maybe one area that deserves commenting is the music. It doesn't play a big role in the game, and you do not hear a bunch of unique soundtracks. It may give that impression perhaps because the playing field looks like the screen of a sideways Guitar Hero screen. It is just techno action, somewhat generic tracks.\n\nI recommend the game if you want a very cool battle match three game, which involves rpg elements and to a lesser degree strategy. If you want to be impressed by music and fancy graphics, this game appears to never have aimed to impress us with those features.","July 2, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unlike like other match three games like the incredible PuzzleQuest I never felt incontrol of the action. Instead I felt like I SHOULD be in control of the action. The scrolling speed is too fast for one thing. Moveing the gems is maps to the mouse click and drag style and that's horribly inaccurate. By the time I've seen how to make a match the gems are half way across the screen. And this in a game where the gems are basically free form.\n\nI'm still under an hour and a good chunk of that was spend trying to understand the tutorial which doesn't actually tell you that you can drag the gems by the way. I sat there trying to figure out how to make a match for seconds before i realized the thing wanted me to drag and just didn't say so. Yet still I feel no progression. There's no level end, there's no tally up. Just a temporary detour between enemies where I'm supposed to do what looks like a bonus round but is instead just more of the same tension and frustration of trying to see gems and then move them and then click them.\n\nI'm not a fan of the double click either. Part of the reason the game feels too fast is that you can't just match three gems and then fire them off. That oly generates the actual attack gem you need. Which you can then drag and drop and THEN click to perform an attack in the background you never notice and in the foreground that you can never care about because you're too busy trying to find your next trio.\n\nIt's late I'm going to bed and I Dungeon Hearts was a terrible choice for a good night game. I have no idea where I'm supposed to stop. It isn't as if I had to run through X more enemies to complete the level. As far as I can tell there are no levels. You just run and run and run each time adding new gems to the mix. The double hit gems are bad enough. I can't make combos i can barely hit the single baddies. Unfortunately I just can't say I had any fun with the game. It looks fantastic, It runs smooth, I'm sure the soundtrack is banging but at the end of the day.. the game is something I don't want to go back to. I don't WANT to see if there is an end to the level because I don't feel my characters getting better I don't feel anything but annoyance that the gems won't go where i want them to go as fast as I need them to go without getting it and it feels unfair.","October 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

Buy it; it's like $3.\n\nIt's a fusion of your match-3 type puzzle games (Columns, Bejeweld, Candy Crush etc) with a timer aspect like the rhythm games have, mixed in special moves and an RPG aesthetic- something like an RPG version of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.\n\nAs with many puzzle games, the things speed up during the course of the game/match, which ups the level of excecution required- unlike just using a keyboard to move directions and a button to rearrange like your classic puzzle games (Tetris, Columns, Puyo Puyo etc), you use your mouse to move around tiles of the same color together to form gems (chargers), which allow you to destroy the tiles/runes of enemy monsters.  This gives you more freedom, but also allows for a challenge, since you have to figure out what to move where, before things scroll offscreen, resulting in either the loss of assets, or taking damage from an enemy rune which was not destroyed or moved.\n\nFrom a design standpoint, there are a lot of good touches here- aesthetically it looks pretty good, (simple is good), and there are actually an additional three soundtracks, each of which you unlock by beating the game.  When a character is low on health, their color of tiles in the timeline (fatestream) will show cracks, indicating that they are on the verge of death.  The RPG aesthetic works very well.  It took me a while to realize that the various monsters seem to have different styles and skills, which was a nice thought.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, I like that there is some element of excecution allowed in the special attacks- to poison an enemy with the archer, you have to swipe your mouse in the direction of the enemy monster and hit a target.  Healing spells heal more the more frequently you click the appropriate color after choosing to use that skill, etc.  If you want to level up to gain access to skills, there's a bonus stage between battles- but this is also timed, and your ability to level up is dependant on your ability to match special star tiles before they scroll offscreen.  These things help keep players, or at least me, more actively engaged, and I dig it.","November 25, 2013","true","39.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For $3, I definitely can't complain, and anyone with decent hand-eye coordination and a durable trigger finger probably won't either, since the game does require both of these, especially on the higher difficulties and further in to the story mode.\n\nThere are only two things I can possibly make a negative remark about. The "XP rewards," which one uses to buy rudimentary upgrades for each of the 4 individual characters, are very stingy (there are tens of upgrades in the shop, and they all cost between 20-110 XP, while a full story-mode completion, which takes usually around 50 minutes, only gives you 11, 22, or 33 xp on average when finishing on easy, medium, or hard difficulty, respectively). There is also the fact that if you do the entire story without a break (saving and resuming later is possible, however), you'll probably feel like you have carpal tunnel in whichever hand you hold the mouse in for several minutes afterwards, as playing the game does require many precise clicks and rapid mouse movements.\n\nHowever, neither of the negatives impact the actual gameplay, which is fun, intense, and both simple and complex at the same time. Not to mention the game comes with up to five soundtracks, which are all absolutely amazing and go perfectly with the theme of the game. I personally can already tell that I'm going to get more hours of entertainment out of this than some of the games I've spent $10-20 on simply because of my love for intensive and strategic puzzle games, and anyone else with similar interests in gaming genres will probably be able to say the same. $3 well spent!","December 11, 2013","true","22.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

A pretty middle of the road game so it's a YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) situation. I will say that the control seems a little 'stilted' on PC's . Between the speed required and what not, it's rather clear to see that the devs were developing for a native touch screen interface. This isn't a bad thing and again YMMV .\n\nI suspect most while playing it will innately wish they were playing it on a tablet or touchscreen device instead of a pc  with a mouse or controller. Again, this is not a bad thing , being designed for a touch screen is not bad and it shows great thought though as said it comes across as stilted on a PC.

Where your 3 characters will fight against enemies in battles dictated by your ability to match gems. The game itself is simplistic, albeit not intuitively straightforward, as such even after playing the tutorial you will still struggle with some of the mechanics. The core concept is simple however, match up gems to initiate attacks of your characters (based on color) and counter enemy attacks/disarms etc. The game is visually stunning and although the gameplay starts off slow, it becomes horribly complex and fast paced shortly. The casual appeal of this game is great however it doesn't have much more long term value than all match 3 style games. Despite this I fully recommend this as a fun casual game to pickup and play.

It's gameplay style is simple, but can quickly turn from being easy to making very quick thinking. You need to match up 3 of the same color circles in order to create a diamond to attack. It gives you something to think about, and strategize as you go further in.\nThe graphics have a nice style to it, but nothing outstanding. One of my favorite parts about this game is the music, ranging from 5 different soundtracks entirely. (Pop, Jazz, Metal, ect)\nNow the gameplay. These color ruins represent each character, and the grey ruins represents the enemy's attack, or debuff abilities. They travel from the right side of the screen to the left side of the screen. If the color ruins hit the end of left side, any of your ruins will dissappear as well as grey ruins. If an enemy's diamond ruin, or debuff ruin, hits the left end, then it takes effect on which ever character it was heading for.\nI can go on forever on the gameplay, but it's somewhat simple. I do have a few problems with the game. The difficulty can spike, even on Normal mode. I got half way through the game before I couldn't do anything. It felt like the enemies would take more than 10-15 minutes to defeat if you don't stack the damage. Another thing is that the enemy's don't have a clear health bar. The only way you can tell that an enemy is near defeat is when their ruins begin to crack which can be somewhat annoying. One last thing is the level up system. It is a minor nickpick, but I don't consider it all that bad. You must match 3 color star ruins in order to level up. Fail to do so will result in low level characters, and some challenging enemies.\nOverall I think this game is fantastic with amazing music, and quick thinking puzzling, RPG, gameplay. It's just very nice to play this game and it puts me in a relaxed mood in the beginning to becoming intense in the later part of the game. I give it an 8/10.","July 1, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finishing the story mode unlocks new soundtracks, which is a treat in itself.

There are several other mechanics included to make the game more difficult, but that's the gist of it.\n\nThe game itself is innovative and promises to be a fun time-waster.  However, the main problem with DH lies with the fact that the game is near-unplayable on the PC.  It's immediately evident upon playing the first level that the game was optimized for a phone or tablet, and replacing that with a computer mouse just spells trouble... or carpal tunnel syndrome.  The earlier levels are still bearable, but as the pieces on the "Fatestream" pick up speed, you'll find yourself struggling to keep up.\n\nOverall--no matter how cheap this game gets, don't bother getting it.  Why pay for a game that you can't even play?","August 22, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You basically have 4 different heroes with different skills and you gather experience after every combat. Gems appear from the right side of the screen and disappear through the left after a few seconds, and by matching them you attack the enemy or avoid his attacks, so all what you do is click or drag gems all the time in order to perform different actions. The idea is really good, what a pity that is so poorly executed.\n\nI can forgive the extreme lack of detail of the enemies because for this kind of games graphics are not really important, but the lack of detail is embarrassing some times. Obviously they could have worked a few days more to improve it, but they didn’t. We are talking about enemies that almost don’t move and stay still on the screen all the time, it would have been nice if they had the same detail than the heroes or if they just didn’t appear at all in the screen (I rather have a picture of them like in PQ than having a big non detailed grey mass on the screen).\n\nI can even forgive the terrible controls. As I said the only thing that you do is click or drag, and you must be fast. As other players complained about, a lot of times you click but the game detects that you are dragging, and vice versa. That can be really annoying sometimes, especially in difficult combats.\n\nWhat I can’t forgive is the lack of a story mode. There is absolutely no story, no map, anything to encourage you to continue playing. Every time that you play you start from 0, facing one enemy after another one until you die, with nothing in between. The only thing that you can do is use the experience that you gathered to improve you characters but, if for example you just want to improve 5% ONE hero's health, you gonna need to play approx one hour in order to do so! and I'm talking about the cheapest thing that you can do!\n\nSo my opinion is to stay away from it, don’t buy it. Even if you love the idea, the mechanics, even if you like the graphics or you don’t care at all, don’t buy it. You will be playing an obviously uncompleted game, a game that would have been awesome if the developers decided to work on it a couple of extra months, but that right now is not worth even one single cent.\n","August 9, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game caught my eye because I'm looking for the next good Puzzle Quest style game. This is a Puzzle RPG of sorts, requring you to drag matching gems to create diamonds to attack the enemy. The gems are constantly sldiing to the left screen, where they disappear on the player party. Use your own attack gems to destroy enemy attach gems, preventing them to attack. There are other mechanics here with gems that can't be moved or cause debuffs to your player. It get's really tough after a while, I can get about 10 enemies or so with normal, but I have to play on easy to get really far. Level ups work like this as well, where defeating an enemy sends you a slew of star gems to line up to get experience, which in my opinion is often annoying to deal with. I'm not a big fan of the 'YOU'RE ALWAYS RUNNING OUT OF TIME" to make a good move mechanic, so this game starts to bother me after a while, but I apprecaite what they were trying to do. I really like the "battle" tunes and you can simply copy the OST from the soundtrack folder, which includes the cover image.","August 30, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dungeons hearts adds some enjoyable elements to make this millionth iteration of match 3 games a bit more fun.  There are blocks that are sent by the enemy to slow you down.  Your goal is to crush the enemy while stopping his attacks.  As you progress through the game you get certain skills that fall outside simple block movements that can get you out of a pickle.  You also gain experience which gives your characters different abilities.  This gives the player a chance to feel like they can actually beat the game even if their skills aren't up to snuff to make it to the last boss.  There is an incentive to keep playing and boost your skills so that those final levels don't seem to tough.  If you are into puzzle games and don't mind staring at moving blocks all day, you will probably enjoy this game.  If you are sick of the million different iterations of puzzle games, I would probably pick up something else.\n\nFollow us on https://www.google.com/+Brick-media to see more reviews, walkthroughs etc.","July 18, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's gameplay style is simple, but can quickly turn from being easy to making very quick thinking. You need to match up 3 of the same color circles in order to create a diamond to attack. It gives you something to think about, and strategize as you go further in.\nThe graphics have a nice style to it, but nothing outstanding. One of my favorite parts about this game is the music, ranging from 5 different soundtracks entirely. (Pop, Jazz, Metal, ect)\nNow the gameplay. These color ruins represent each character, and the grey ruins represents the enemy's attack, or debuff abilities. They travel from the right side of the screen to the left side of the screen. If the color ruins hit the end of left side, any of your ruins will dissappear as well as grey ruins. If an enemy's diamond ruin, or debuff ruin, hits the left end, then it takes effect on which ever character it was heading for.\nI can go on forever on the gameplay, but it's somewhat simple. I do have a few problems with the game. The difficulty can spike, even on Normal mode. I got half way through the game before I couldn't do anything. It felt like the enemies would take more than 10-15 minutes to defeat if you don't stack the damage. Another thing is that the enemy's don't have a clear health bar. The only way you can tell that an enemy is near defeat is when their ruins begin to crack which can be somewhat annoying. One last thing is the level up system. It is a minor nickpick, but I don't consider it all that bad. You must match 3 color star ruins in order to level up. Fail to do so will result in low level characters, and some challenging enemies.\nOverall I think this game is fantastic with amazing music, and quick thinking puzzling, RPG, gameplay. It's just very nice to play this game and it puts me in a relaxed mood in the beginning to becoming intense in the later part of the game. I give it an 8/10.","July 1, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would end up where I would just make single attacks, trying to clear the board of enemy attacks and hexes. And when you lose a character, it just goes snowballs from there because you lose attack/ability options and need to clear the dead hero's chargers to move things around. I wish there were lower difficulty settings to slow the pace down a little so someone of my skill level could execute plans a little easier. Right now, I just try to clear everything bad with 1-2 attack strikers at a time and hope that the upcoming gem sequence isn't impossible for me to clear. And I only use abilities to clear the board when I'm overwhelmed instead of offensively. It's like being only able to play Tetris or Tetris Attack/Puzzle League on a hard difficulty- things go by too fast to really have fun chaining and comboing things unless you're already good at it.\n\nEventually, if you grind it out, you can unlock upgrades that make the game easier. However, I cleared 24 levels (beating the final boss) and only got 24 xp. There are about 9 upgrades for each character, scaling from 20xp to 110 xp (adding up to ~2095xp total). You'll need to clear many levels to unlock everything.\n\nYou'll need to clear many levels to unlock much of anything.\n\nI would have liked your attack strikers to automatically fire when they reach the end of the screen (instead of disappear and be wasted).\n\nMaybe it would be easier to control with touch screen or keyboard/controller controls? The former would probably be better, the latter would probably still be too slow for the game.\n\nIf you have high mouse dexterity (required) and rapid thinking (more instinct than movand enjoy challenges, this might be for you. If you aren't at that level, prepare for a frustrating experience where you can't do what you know needs to be done in time.","May 13, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dungeons hearts adds some enjoyable elements to make this millionth iteration of match 3 games a bit more fun.  There are blocks that are sent by the enemy to slow you down.  Your goal is to crush the enemy while stopping his attacks.  As you progress through the game you get certain skills that fall outside simple block movements that can get you out of a pickle.  You also gain experience which gives your characters different abilities.  This gives the player a chance to feel like they can actually beat the game even if their skills aren't up to snuff to make it to the last boss.  There is an incentive to keep playing and boost your skills so that those final levels don't seem to tough.  If you are into puzzle games and don't mind staring at moving blocks all day, you will probably enjoy this game.  If you are sick of the million different iterations of puzzle games, I would probably pick up something else.\n\nFollow us on https://www.google.com/+Brick-media to see more reviews, walkthroughs etc.","July 18, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes please!\n\nThe Dark One has taken over the land, and it's up to these guys to stop him!\n\nMy description for this might seem really odd, but it's actually a pretty fantastic blend of the match-3 puzzler and RPG genres.\n\nUsing your party of 4 heroes [Fighter, Mage, Healer and Archer, of course], you manipulate the Fatestream [the game board] to drag, drop and click incoming hero tiles in groups of 3 to create attack tiles that you can click again to attack the enemy you're facing. Set up combos of these tiles and unmatched hero tiles to do bigass combos to deal extra damage [which means clearing a stage faster]. Once you beat a baddy, you use the same techniques to level up your characters, building your way up to skills that can affect your enemy or even the Fatestream itself, depending on the character. Keeping with the JRPG theme, your characters all have HP as well, that you have to keep an eye on. If a character gets killed, their tiles will still be generated on the board, but they'll be useless, and just get in the way of your other tiles.\n\nIt's this kind of interaction between the player characters, the tiles coming at you and the board itself where this game shines. Enemy attack tiles will slide down the board toward your characters along with the color-coded hero tiles. You can counter them with your own attacks, of course, but some enemies may have higher defense than others, which means that more grey, neutral tiles are in the way of your hero tiles, making it harder to position your attacks right to break those nasty attack tiles. Or they might be particularly speedy, throwing tons of attacks your way, or they might be a mage that freezes your characters on a hit, rendering those hero tiles immobile or whatever flavor your enemies have on your run to get to the Big Bad.\n\nIt can get pretty crazy in the later levels.\n\nWith unlockable soundtracks and hero upgrades you can purchase, there's a lot of replay value in it too, so you can keep going back for more and appreciate the gameplay with powerful rewards.\n\nThe only question I have is why in the hell is your hero information stored in the 'Beastiary'?","September 29, 2013","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Admittedly I only really play it as a time killer, but it's kind of perfect for that (it's great on lunch breaks). I like the implementation of skills that you can unlock by leveling up, and I even like the whole 'mini game' to level your characters up. I think the pacing is pretty decent, and the character/monster designs are nice to look at. Also there's something so satisfying about lining up combos in this game that I can't really describe, but it makes me feel awesome.\n\nMy one gripe, as others have mentioned, is sometimes it gets a little hard to control with a mouse. Trying to drag and drop can be a mess, and during hectic battles this can really screw you up. I tried playing with a drawing tablet before, thinking that would make it more managable, but that's not the case. Not much of a problem to me, but the dual monitor issue where it seems you have to have the game in windowed mode can be kinda bothersome, but it's not a super big deal imo.\n\nOverall, I think it's a decent little game, and hell, it's pretty cheap, but if you catch it on sale, you may as well buy it.","February 24, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game caught my eye because I'm looking for the next good Puzzle Quest style game. This is a Puzzle RPG of sorts, requring you to drag matching gems to create diamonds to attack the enemy. The gems are constantly sldiing to the left screen, where they disappear on the player party. Use your own attack gems to destroy enemy attach gems, preventing them to attack. There are other mechanics here with gems that can't be moved or cause debuffs to your player. It get's really tough after a while, I can get about 10 enemies or so with normal, but I have to play on easy to get really far. Level ups work like this as well, where defeating an enemy sends you a slew of star gems to line up to get experience, which in my opinion is often annoying to deal with. I'm not a big fan of the 'YOU'RE ALWAYS RUNNING OUT OF TIME" to make a good move mechanic, so this game starts to bother me after a while, but I apprecaite what they were trying to do. I really like the "battle" tunes and you can simply copy the OST from the soundtrack folder, which includes the cover image.","August 30, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure why it doesn't have it, because it seems a natural candidate for a controller-controlled game, but it definitely needs it. On a trackpad, and even with a mouse, it's just troublesome to actually play the game.\n\nI really like this game, but I just can't play it...which makes it pointless.

Should be fairly interesting yes ?\n\nWell, it would be, if it were actually playable without a touchscreen. Yes, the game is designed for touch screens, didn't even bother to change the terminologies from "tap" and "swipe" to "click" and "drag" if you're playing with a mouse. You know, small gripe, but does show laziness.\nStill shouldn't be a problem if you can play with a mouse properly no ?\n\nAnd that's where we get to the bigger problem, and the reason for not recommending.\nThe mouse controls are just horrible. Clicks don't register, or register between .3 and .5 seconds too late. Drags drop before you release the mouse button (to the point of registering as a click instead). Or they overshoot because the mouse release registers too late as well.\nAnd that in a game where split-second timing matters if you want to get through to the end of a playthrough.\n\nSo if you're planning to play on a desktop machine, with a mouse, the whole thing devolves into a steaming pile of frustration very quickly, instead of being the entertaining in-between games game it could have been.","November 11, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No. Can I recommend this game? No.\nThis is one of those many instances where there is a great idea, with bad execution. If this was simply a "match three" type of game, mixed with combat I don't think the game would be so bad. It's the "rythm game" type of structure where everything is flying across the screen that ruins the gameplay. Not only are you trying to manage your own attacks and combos but juggling or preventing your enemies attacks make this a chore. If the game speed could be slowed maybe 25% or more, this would be a more enjoyable experience. I've beaten the game on all 3 difficulties and can't say I've had more than an "okay" time playing it. Again, the speed of the game is the biggest issue. It might be okay for touch-screen devices but it is not good for a standard mouse and keyboard PC.\n\nAs a final note - I will say that getting the soundtrack with the game is worth the asking price. The soundtrack is pretty fantastic. (It's hiding in your game's folder if you're not aware).","December 29, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yup.. that's how awful the controls are.\n\nIf it weren't for that, the game would be a lot more fun on the PC.

Not much else to say, as a mobile game you shouldn't really expect anything out of the ordinary.

If you want this game just for the trading cards, save yourself the pain and get it on a sale.
