I played this as a kid and it was AMAZING, let's play it again!"\naaaaaand then I realize that it hasn't quite aged very well. Don't get me wrong though, this is still a positive review. I'm just being honest with myself. It looks pretty muddy, the controls aren't that great and overall? We've just done much better in the realm of 3rd Person FPS games since then.\nHOWEVER. It is still a hilariously original game with memorable characters (the tea drinking, british centurion robot is my favorite) and it's still very playable. If you want to revist some nostalgia? I say it's worth the price. If you've never played it before, you'll probably be a hate-it-or-love-it type of person. It might be too archiac for you or it might be just right.\nFor me? it's a classic gem that may not have aged super well, but it's still an entertaining and memorable experience.","July 26, 2014","true","1.3"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","46","49","2","5"

An excellent comedy game with the absolutely awesome (yet sadly deceased) Tony Jay voicing an amusing role as an oppressive King, this follows the typical story of rebellion.\n\nThe game in itself is short, and it's way too similar to Giants: Citizen Kabuto with base building replaced by turret/railshooting sequences. With those marring marks, the game is still enjoyable enough to play through it, especially for any fan of Planet Moon's work.","September 9, 2011","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/6090/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXeL_YPyxOc\n\nWhen I hear “bunch of misfits” I always think of these guys here. They are united by one goal, they are brave, they are weird, they are human, robot, mole and a smelly old man. They are ... Lionhearts!!! This is one of the wackiest game i've ever played. I can't express how crazy and absurd (in a good way) are the story and characters. I write this review with a huge grin on my face. In almost every cutscene I laugh my ♥♥♥ off.\n\nYou are the Lionhearts, a bunch of misfits, who are trying to save their kingdom from the evil king Forge. He wants to unlock the power of the Book of Rule, so it's up to our heroes to steal the book from him and use it to undo all the bad things. Let me introduce the Lionhearts (drum roll): Q – big robot that like to drink tea and he always have a cup in his hand; Jonesy – a mole, often mistaken for a rat and everybody likes to make fun of him; Rexus – short  and smelly old man, that put a spell to locked the book's power. He have some sort of jedi powers and he is blind as a bat; finally the character you control Roman. He always wear a red scarf around his mouth, like he is in the wild west. Truth to be told the game kinda feel that way. The story is complete bonkers and I love it. It will take to very different places and you will meet a whole bunch of insane characters, more crazy than our heroes. King Fogre is also insane. He sends his son Stig to lead his army againts the Lionhearts and he is … to say it politely, not very bright person. I don't want to spoil more. One last thing. In every cutscene you will see amazing stuff.\n\nThe gameplay is straightforward. It's a third-person shooter and you play only as Roman, but Jonesy and Q are always behind you. They help, but you will do most of the shooting. You can give them three command – guard an area, return to you and defend you. They have their health bars, but if some of them die it's not instant game over. You will see them in the next level if the story dictates that. I try always to make them run over a health pack, but it's not that easy.\n\nThe weapons are great. You have some standard like submachine gun, sniper rifle and bolt action rifle, but the others are amazing – Gurnar personal mortar who looks like a tuba and fires granades, rocket launcher that can fire up to four homing rockets and my favourite and the most unique ever created in any media – land shark gun! (появяват се думите една по една и една акула) You fire it at some target and the shark start “swimming” and then it start to eating enemies. It will follow you around for a short period of time. The ammo for all the weapons can be acquired in two ways. The first is by killing enemies they drop different types (they also drop health packs) and the second is by going into “The Grunt & Polewart”. It's a pub. There also you can change your weapon, fill up your ammo and health. What better way to get them and drink a beer.\n\nThe secondary weapons are also insane. Sticky bomb that makes enemies run in panic when it's on them. It's funny to see them running around and screaming. There are more. Guy Fawks Traitor bomb – turns enemies againts each other, Knockout bomb – giant boxing glove that punches enemies from a distance, Portable Black Hole and finally the best from the secondary – Tropsy Turvy bomb. It turns the world upside down and enemies fall to their death. If the weapons were all standard the gameplay would be kinda boring.\n\nThe level design is okay. There vast open spaces, but earlier levels feel kinda empty. Yes, you will shoot constantly, but there isn't something interesting sights to see. But later levels are much better. Most of the buildings can be destroyed and for such an old game, it's interesting to see it. You will see snowy villige, shooting bad guys near the beach or in a trenches and so on. The levels have this weird mix setting between middle ages and steam punk. Really interesting design. There also hidden tokens spread around the levels and when you find them you will unlock things like big head, big hands, another difficulty and so on.\n\nAfter every few levels there is a turret section. They are 2-3 minutes long and don't overstay their welcome. They are fun and challenging enough. And speaking of difficulty this game is not easy. The enemies are not Storm troopers. They are accurate and they will shoot on sight. I died quite a few times, so you have to use all your tools to survive.\n\nOne of the best things here is the voice acting. It's simply amazing. When you combine it with the great writing, you have fantastic recipe for laughing a lot. All actors have british accent. Some sound more scottish, others more english. They all do amazing job. Even the side characters are greatly voiced. My favourite character is Rexus. He is more goofy and with him are the best scenes.\n\nThe soundtrack is also good. Typical orchestral tracks, but some have this military vibe and feel like you are in a war. Others are more ambient, but nothing is more satisfying that to kill enemies accompanied by scottish bagpipes. They will lift your spirit up and you will fight more agressively!\n\nThe things I don't like here are not many. The graphics are not a problem for me. The game came out in 2003, so you can't expect to look great. The biggest problem is the lack of enemy variety. You will see all the time the grunt with bolt action rifle, sniper rifle or the guy with submachine gun or granade launcher. There are few flying like zeppelin and the really big enemies (they are tough and fun to fight), but they are few and far between. The other problem that people may have is with the gameplay. It's repetetive, but I like it. The crazy guns and funny cutscence is what kept the game become stale.\n\nThe game is made by Planet Moon Studios, which also made another underrated cult classic – Giants: Citizen Kabuto, a game ahead of it's time. It's like their faith to make underrated games. If you didn't guess by now, I love AnD. Everything is over the top! The characters, the guns, the enemies. It's funny as hell, you have crazy weapons, hilarious cutscenes, it runs great on a modern PC and on top of that you have a freaking jetpack! Instantly 10/10! Bad joke aside this is a refreshing idea to spice up the gameplay. It adds verticality. Some enemies have it too and it's fun to fly around and try to shoot each other. Or just grab the homing rocket launcher. You have it in almost half of the game and it's amazing! It's not an expensive title, so go now and buy it. I had hell of a good time with Armed and Dangerous.","April 3","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In traditional LucasArts/Planet Moon style, this game is a fantasy third-person shooter with a very British sense of humour and a stereotyped gang of the foolish American, savvy Cockney, Angry Scot and the self-aware, well spoken English robot with a Tea fixation either blundering or saving their way through this fantasy land.of Milola.\n\nThe game was a great one for the time with it's relatively simple controls and console-friendly interface, it felt more like a port than a PC game which is understandable, it was an Xbox release. The game has not aged due to it's awfully rendered DivX based cutscenes and suffers from resolutions not common now. The levels lack variety, consisting of missions to blow an objective up or save hostages from the king's ogres and Germans or hold off waves off attackers in a turret segment.\n\nArmed and Dangerous was quite a difficult game, marching out in the slightly repetitive levels will lead to a quick death. However, you are far from alone with two allies who can't shoot for toffee and a vast array of weaponry ranging from Mortar launching Tubas to Land Shark guns and a vindaloo rocket launcher mixed with a quite destructible environment for the time.\n\nArmed and Dangerous was a fun and hilarious title, and still makes for a solid game despite the badly optimised cutscenes. While it slipped under the radar at the time (and still does) it makes for a rather classic yet flawed LucasArts game. Despite the faults and the game being ten years old now, Armed and Dangerous is still the silliest third person shooter you are ever likely to play.\n\nJust beware of the Shrub Patrol.

Once the book is unlocked King Forge would  rule with an iron fist, but not if the Lionhearts steal it first...\n\nAwesome game with awesome weapons and awesome characters and twisted plot.","February 17, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haveasadumbb/recommended/6090/","haveasadumbb","Spooks the Ghost Lad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haveasadumbb/","632 products in account","Armed and Dangerous features you as Roman (leader of a band of rebels called the Lionhearts) on a quest to find the mythical Book of Rule and bring down the tyrannical King Forge. In traditional LucasArts/Planet Moon style, this game is a fantasy third-person shooter with a very British sense of humour and a stereotyped gang of the foolish American, savvy Cockney, Angry Scot and the self-aware, well spoken English robot with a Tea fixation either blundering or saving their way through this fantasy land.of Milola.\n\nThe game was a great one for the time with it's relatively simple controls and console-friendly interface, it felt more like a port than a PC game which is understandable, it was an Xbox release. The game has not aged due to it's awfully rendered DivX based cutscenes and suffers from resolutions not common now. The levels lack variety, consisting of missions to blow an objective up or save hostages from the king's ogres and Germans or hold off waves off attackers in a turret segment.\n\nArmed and Dangerous was quite a difficult game, marching out in the slightly repetitive levels will lead to a quick death. However, you are far from alone with two allies who can't shoot for toffee and a vast array of weaponry ranging from Mortar launching Tubas to Land Shark guns and a vindaloo rocket launcher mixed with a quite destructible environment for the time.\n\nArmed and Dangerous was a fun and hilarious title, and still makes for a solid game despite the badly optimised cutscenes. While it slipped under the radar at the time (and still does) it makes for a rather classic yet flawed LucasArts game. Despite the faults and the game being ten years old now, Armed and Dangerous is still the silliest third person shooter you are ever likely to play.\n\nJust beware of the Shrub Patrol. Down with the King.","July 9, 2011","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game parodies a bunch of films and other games, and you'll keep noticing the little jokes if you look for them (although most are balls-out and overt).\n\nIt's a bit old and it's showing its age but I remembered having fun with this a *decade* ago and decided to purchase again on Steam and re-play it. I'm pretty sure I had just as much fun.\n\nThe game doesn't really help you out much with how to do things, so here's a tip: when you're doing the tower defence mini-game, you can use A and D to move left and right. I literally didn't notice this until the very last tower defence which is pretty much impossible to beat without moving.","April 17","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
