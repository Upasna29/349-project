For primitive 3D graphics, it is impressive.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpf_cYnK0Bw\n\nI just tried it out and everything works as you would imagine.  I was able to use an Xbox 360 controller right out of the box, and the split-screen works fine as well.  Even has networking modes which you may be able to get working at some point, essentially the game is untouched as it was released in 1995.  Was able to use keyboard or mouse controls as well and there was no issues there, the learning curve is quite easy on this one.\n\nAll sorts of various gameplay modes and upgrades are available.  If you look at the screenshots and like what you see, then the game will not disappoint you, but only recommended for those looking for the retro PC gaming experience.","October 9, 2015","true","6.1"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","63","73","4","4"

This game NEEDS analog controls. Period.\n\nOne negative is the low in-game resolution which makes it hard to judge turns at distance and you to rely on track memorization. While the graphics are mostly OK and at times quite good for a 3D DOS game, there is no option to increase resolution past 320x200. Play it in 14" CRT telly and it'll be much better.\n\nIt would be nice for DosBox to exit itself though. Not a dealbreaker but some people might find this confusing when quitting the game.","January 2","true","6.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

It also feels pretty old, being pretty dated and not really that fun. There is not much in this game actually can make you have a good time. I don't really recommend it, but since it is somewhat cheap you may as well have some fun time with it.\n\nEither way, I can't recommend it.
