"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/222980/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Dead Pixels is a side-scrolling survival/shooter with some lite-RPG elements set in a zombie apocalypse.  You take control of a human survivor making their way to safety through undead filled streets of a city.  The basic aim of the game depends on the game mode.\n\nThere are three game modes; The main mode is you standard Escape the hordes.  Survival is an arena mode where by you have to survive countless waves of hordes. Timed attack is a variant of Survival where by you must last as long as you can. You need to either; get from one side of the street to the other until you reach the end or kill as many zombies as you can.  The number of streets to traverse depends on the difficulty setting.\n\nGameplay is representative of the standard zombie survival genre.  Find guns.  Acquire ammo.  Destroy zombies.  Dont get killed.  In addition you can loot some deserted buildings grabbing medical supplies, explosives and other useful items.  Periodically shops appear where you can sell items that are not needed or cant be used.  Shops allow you to upgrade character stats such as: Running, Weaponskill, Bargaining and Melee which to help you get past the next few stages of the game,  You can also save your progress in shops.\n\nGameplay consists of manoeuvring your character across streets full of zombies avoiding making contact with them or the vile bile they fling at you.  You can shoot, bash or throw explosives to destroy your opponents.   If you are low on ammo you can dodge and flee the nasty hordes, skills that become invaluable the further you progress.  There are number zombie types from slow moving zombies, to faster ones, soldier types, zombies that can attack at range by firing bile at you, and the uber strong mutated  zombies which are hard to kill.  In additiona every so often you must defeat a boss enemy which special powers in order to progress.\n\nThere are many weapons to choose from, the most common being shotguns, rifles and handguns. There are also a good number of equipment items to use along your adventure such as medkits, grenades (explosive, incendiary, freeze, shock) fireworks to distract, adrenaline boosters to speed your movement and though the listings are in text form it can be  particularly satisfying when you pick-up and use a chainsaw, flamethrower or minigun.\n\nGraphics are in 2D and are basic if functional.  While the soundtrack and audio effects add to that overall retro feel.  Together they generate a wonderful ambience and give you an old skool feel providing some nice nostalgic overtones, if you played games in the eighties.\n\nThough gameplay is repetitive in nature I found the experience to be as enjoyable as playing other zombie survival games such as State of Decay.  Real fun though be warned you need fast reflexes and nimble fingers (and luck) to complete the game on the Hardest difficulty setting.  Controls are really well coded and easy to use.\n\nJust note that only local coop is available unfortunately.  If any bad can be said about the game its that the inventory is text based, the graphics arent for everyone and the game can run a little too fast in some places when you could really do with slowing down the action to think your next move through.\n\nDead Pixels has to be one of the best made indie games Ive been fortunate to find.  Infact it could well be "the game" I would make if I could code.  I suggest you pick this one up now in the sale but if you miss it then its well worth the full price.  Note also that a sequel has already been announced for next year.","November 29, 2014","true","22.1"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","46","48","0","0"

Your goal in the game is to make it a specified number of blocks (levels) without dying so that you can escape the zombie-infested city.  Along the way you kill hundreds of zombies, scavenge for supplies, and trade for better gear and skill training.\n\nI recommend this as a game to jump into and play when the mood strikes especially if you have a friend to play with.  Though it's not in-depth zombie survival by any means, few games on that market can compete for the old-school local co-op experience that has earned this game a place in my library.","August 29, 2015","true","2.6"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","0"

Your main goal in the game is to make your way across a number of streets, shooting and smacking through zombies to survive. Dead zombies will drop cash. Along the way you'll find buildings to raid for useful items like guns, ammo, and valuables. There are also some traders stationed along the otherwise abandoned streets, looking for some good profit from the dire situation I suppose. You can buy all sort of items, weapons, ammo, and upgrades from traders, as well as sell some of your own things for cash. Basically, that's the entire game in a nutshell. Kill zombies, raid buildings, deal with traders, and try to make it to the end without dying. Pretty simple and fun.\n\nThere IS strategy involved, though. You see, you have a weight limit on what you can carry, and everything outside of ammo will weigh you down. If you go over that capacity, you will become over encumbered, which will result in your movement being reduced. And what's really neat about this is that, the more extra weight you carry, the slower you become. You can even get completely immobilized if you have too much. But you never are forced to strickly carry only what will fit in your capacity, which give you some freedom in what you value: items or your speed. Some items may not be too useful, such as valuables and weaker or duplicate guns, but they can be sold later. So do you hold on to your money makers, or try to just carry the essentials? Also, when at the traders, what skills do you want to upgrade? What will benefit you the most? Do you want to have more powerful shots to use less ammo, or maybe you should work on bargaining so other things will be cheaper in the long run. Should you sell your item here or bring it back to the trader a few streets back that was offering a good sum for it? Is backtracking worth risking possible ammo and health supplies to get more money? There are a lot of tough calls to make and replayability allows you to experiment with different strategies.\n\nAnd let's not forget co op. In co op you have two people working together to survive, which can be helpful and harmful. You get twice the carrying capacity, twice the melee action, and you can do some distraction and splitting tactics with the clumps of zombies. However, you are forced to share all resources, as the shops only have limited amounts in stock. You also have to be careful not to trap another player on the edge of the screen from moving forward of backward. On the bright side, if one of you dies, the other can revive them at a trader... if they can make it there alone. Working together requires planning. You have to share resources. Who needs what more? What upgrades will compliment each other well? How will your playstyles affect each other's? Again, it's a lot to think about.\n\nThis game does SEEM like each playthrough would be a unique experence. However, I don't think that's quite the case. There ARE a good number of different things as far as guns, valuables, throwable weapons, and items go I suppose. And with the randomization of traders, prices, drops, buildings, guns, ammo... and well... almost everything that's important... the thing is... this randomization hardly changes the gameplay. You still shoot zombies, raid buildings, and visit traders the same way basically every time. The only difference is what they have to offer, what you randomly find, and the exact locations of places. That's about it. There's a case for it being different each time with how you choose to upgrade your character, but since each skill only has a few levels of upgrades, you can easily get close to if not actually max all of your stats in a single playthrough. This all makes the variety a little lacking.\n\nAnother complain I have is that, while there are a lot of different weapons, they all fit into categories based on their ammo type. This means that, at any given time, you'll probably only carry one gun of each type with you for the sake of convenience and weight management. It makes the game easier to navigate with less guns at a time, but really lacks in giving good variety. Although, there IS some variety in the extra couple of modes and different difficulty settings. So that's nice for slight change ups on essentially the same gameplay.\n\nMy smallest complaint is that this is one of those games that doesn't really commit to the retro style. Sure, the graphics and some of the sound effects are 8 bit, but the music, other sound effects, and some visual effects are much more modern. Not to mention the controls. The aesthetic is neat, but I guess it feels a little more like a reference to old games rather than reflecting the style. Maybe I'm looking too far into it.\n\nI do like some of the music in the game. There's some decent humor in it too. A lot of people might complain about the co op only being local, but I can't blame the game for something it didn't do. The local co op is a blast and honestly, online co op would most likely be laggy and not as fun anyway. This game is a great sleepover game. You and a buddy can just play it over and over for a night and it's tons of simple fun. The controls are a bit awkward at first, not being very retro styled at all. After a bit a play you'll start to get the hand of it and realize how helpful they are. I was assuming there'd be one fire button and one button for grenades, and that they would be used in the direction I was facing. However, instead you use the left and right shoulder buttons to attack left and right. Sounds confusing at first, but it becomes very helpful. Sometmes you'll be running away from zombies but you'll still want to shoot them. Well you can't do both if you have to turn around to face them. This setup let's you more efficiently run and gun. Be careful though, as your melee attack only goes the way you are facing. Overall, I think the controls are pretty intuitive for this kind of game.\n\nSo, what's the verdict? Well, this game is a lot of simple, good fun. I'd say it's easily worth $5 on here. However, the asking price is only $3. That's a pretty sweet deal already. But if you're still not sure, wait for a sale. I got it on sale for $1 and look how much playtime I got out of it already? Plus, I've seen it go as low as 74 cents. It's definitely a great title to keep in mind when you have leftover Steam wallet funds from card sales or after you bought some other game you really wanted. It's a nice way to not let that extra cash go to waste just sitting there in your Steam wallet. I'd recommend this is you like simple shooters, 8 bit graphics, or zombie survival games. Dead Pixels is pretty cool.","November 5, 2014","true","11.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

It costs very little, and can be a reasonable buy if you are looking to enlarge your games-in-possession number. It can even be fun to play - for an hour or two (if you're still not sick of zombies and 8-bit games). The game even have coop-mode, for extra-fun with friend...\nI've finished it, get all achievements and overcome all "challenges" there. Yet I dislike it much more than "Deadly 30" or any other little game I've played recently. Why? Because it's not really hard, it's just very grind-based. It takes helluva time spent on mindless and boring process of collecting cash, to buy more "upgrades"!\nAnd even if one really fell with that game, mastered it by every means... hi-scores chart flooded with cheaters! No point to go hard on it, nobody will ever notice your effort.\nYou know what? It's almost the same principle as with Payday - only hundred times cheaper in any way! I usually prefer indie stuff to the overhyped AAA-projects... not in this case.\n\nIn short: that game isn't totally bad, its just overestimated itself. Like fingerprint lock, which opens only if you click it over 9000 times.\n\n6/10 mark. Playable, but not really fun and very grindy in the long run.

Only problematic on Survival and Time Attack modes and when fighting bosses on the Original game mode. May last forever if they are also frozen. Can be easily avoided though.\n\nMy Score: 9/10","December 3, 2014","true","38.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Since Dead Pixels seemed to be far from my preferences, I was interested in finding out if I would find this game good or bad. Well as you properly guessed from the amount of hours, I have put into this game I found it fun.\n\nDead Pixels is basically a simple game. You walk from left to right avoiding or killing hords of zombies. The zombies drop cash when killed, and occasionally during you run through the city you will come across empty houses, which you can loot, and shops where you can buy better weapons, upgrades and sell needless items.\n\nThe graphics fit the game, and the mood is set just right for some less than serious zombie slaying, and as a casual game that you just start when you have 20 min you feel like killing Dead Pixels is great fun.\n\nShort review I know but didn’t see the need to make it longer. I could have kept it shorter by just saying: It’s a fun addictive game I like it\n","November 18, 2014","true","60.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/recommended/222980/","docsarcastic","Doc. Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","356 products in account","Personal Rating: 8/10\n\nWhat's not to love about this game? A 2D Zombie Sidescroller that features so much stuff it's amazing and I don't know where to begin. I think I should make special mention of the fact that the game is controller compatible, so if you do have a controller then I'd use that. Makes the game a lot easier to play through because some of the keyboard binds are a bit, well, naff.\n\nSo, there are three sort of gamemodes in this game. There's the original campaign entitled "Dead Pixels" where you need to make it through 10 Streets to get to the chopper. This gamemode is extremely fun and I've spent many hours on my Xbox 360 playing the hell out of this game. The controls are tight, there's a large variety of weapons and items to use and there's a very good selection of different zombie types and as you make your way through the streets, which of course increase in difficulty every time. You find a variety of items in different houses that you can then sell to people who have opened up shops. Which is where my two biggest problems are.\n\n1. Why would you open a shop in a city that is about to be nuked?\n\nYou're making money in a zombie infested city, it's like the bloke who runs the store on Dead Rising 2, the name escapes me but he'd sell you stuff for money. Money will have lost all value during a zombie apocalypse, we'll be buying and selling things in bottlecaps, bodyparts and Barry Scott's Cillit Bang seeing as there's that damn much of the ♥♥♥♥. But it just doesn't make sense that people would open up stores in a zombie infested city that's going to blow up.\n\n2. If you're going to give us items, give them some purpose.\n\nI honestly have no clue why you're loading me up with Teddy Bears, Lighters and pieces of spaghetti but I don't need them. The only thing you can do with them is sell them, which feels pretty cheap because I don't really know what these people are doing with 50 Teddy Bears and the fact that they're worth so much. You can get a good $100 for a battery, which is pretty ridiculous.\n\nOther than those two points "Dead Pixels" is great.\n\nThere's two other gamemodes, which is "The Solution", which is actually quite interesting and is a sequel to the first campaign. You pick one of six characters to go back into the city, recover a can of baked beans or something and get out of there. But whats the point in that? Where's my motivation? Well, if you do survive and make it back, your crimes will be forgiven. You play a convicted criminal, and this is a way you can clear your name, it's a really nice motive and it's pretty original. There aren't any merchants about this time, you have to call in airdrops from your radio and collect them at the next street. Really adds a sense of conservation to the scenario.\n\nThe final gamemode is a survival thing and the name escapes me because it's just the usual "Survive as long as you can" which every zombie game must include by law right now. Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty World at War had the best Zombie Survival mode out of all the Call of Duty games and of course No More Room in Hell provides us with the realistic, sophisticated zombie game we've always wanted.\n\nDead Pixels is definitely fun and it's a bargain even when it's not on sale, I got this game for 50p and feel like I robbed the developers. But still, an extremely fun zombie game and a nice break from the first/third person zombie shooter games we're always playing nowadays.","October 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Name makes quite a lot of sense, huh? You're a survivor headed to a place where you'll meet other survivors to get out of the quarantined city. The difficulty determines how many "streets" you got to go through, all of them crawling with zombies of course. The further you go, the harder it gets. There are houses in which you can collect some loot and sell to vendors for money. You'll use that to buy ammo/weapons/items that you'll use. You don't have a lot of ammo so killing every zombie is a suicide. You can also buy upgrades.\n\nNow gameplay-wise, the game is fun and the style is even appealing. You could even play it in local co-op.

So why would I recommend Dead Pixels? It is a zombie-apocalypse 8-bit grindhouse shootemup with Survival RPG elements. Ugh..Gag me with a rusty spork. I'm surprised that there isn't any platforming, permadeath, and every other thing an indie game is required to have. But you know something? I don't mind it one bit. This is a game where every element works.\n\nBasically the goal is to escape the zombie-infested streets. You're told everything you need to know in the first 30 seconds: Press a button to shoot, another to melee, abandoned buildings have free stuff, and there are shops for all the necessities. After that you're on your own. Surviving is a simple enough task, provided you have the ammo. For the most part however you'll only be killing whatever is in your way. Even then, it's usually better to just move around everything. Zombies are (aside from a few exceptions) as dumb & slow as ever. You stick, you move, you juke a little, and conserve that precious ammo.\n\nBut you need money too right? Abandoned buildings are always good for weapons and valuables, but that stuff gets heavy. Also, depending on the difficulty, shopkeepers can become very scarce. This results in more decision-making, because you can't carry everything. To add to the "fun", once you reach a new street, you can't go back to the previous one. Yeah it's some BS about "Oh No it's too zombie-infested!" It doesn't really matter though. The undead spawn at a constant rate, so all you should do is move forward.\n\nAlong with being all-around terrible people, zombies only get worse as you progress. New varieties start appearing, and they've got all sorts of nasty tricks. The worst are the huge shirtless guys. They move quickly and take so much punishment. Usually I just try and move around so the big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s get stuck behing the slower zombies. The brain-chomping idiots tend to crowd together. It's nice because it makes them easier to manipulate, but if you're surrounded, then a Game Over is assured. Don't forget about the fireworks and adrenaline you have stowed in your backpack! They're easy to forget about on easy & normal, but the harder settings practically require that you take advantage of every possible resource.\n\nAlong with the main game, the "Solution" and "Last Stand" modes are nice additions. In the first mode, you select a prison in-mate. In order to earn a pardon, you have to set off an explosive. This is basically an arranged mode. You can order everything direct from the military, but your goods always arrive a couple streets away. There's no use holding onto junk, because there's no way to sell it. Also at the half-way point, you have to head back. So all those buildings you looted, probably won't replenish their stock, when you make your way back. Secondly there's the obligatory wave-based survival mode. Kill zombies, buy stuff, repeat until dead.\n\nThe mechanics of zombie killin' and dodgin' are pretty solid. The melee is pretty awful though. Even fully upgraded, it can still take several hits to put down one creature. Maybe if the survivors actually put some effort into their melee attacks, they'd be a little more effective. You can see it in-game. Their strikes are so weak-looking, they might as well be murmuring "ehh" and "weh" and "uh" instead of yelling "HAH!" "KIYAA!" and "RARRRRGHGHGHZZZ". Otherwise this game gets the fundamentals right, which makes the more intricate aspects (resource-management) all the more rewarding.\n\nAside from that minor annoyance, this game is really good. The difficulties and modes are nicely balanced, and the weapons are pretty satisfying to use. Plus it makes survival aspects appealing, even to someone like myself. Usually I write a game off as soon as soon as I see the word "conserve", but I like how it's handled here. For once it's fun to cross several zombie-filled streets and not fire a single bullet. The easier difficulties are fun in their own way, because it's much easier to load up on ammo and obliterate everything in sight. As good as Dead Pixels is, it's making the wait for the sequel absolutely brutal. I expect that Dead Pixels 2: Straight to Video will be the smash hit co-op sensation of 1991, or whenever it actually releases.","October 20, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The single player mode does get lonely. The catch is, after you play all 3 compaigns, this game is boring. All you do is play the same thing over again. One thing I do like is the reality of the comment on hard mode : "and the AI director hates you." , because that is true. 10 spitters, and a zombie hoarde, on both sides of me.... yeah.\n\nOverall, id give this game a 7/10\n","January 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

How well does this game pull it off? Not exactly great but definitely better than most zombie games I'm aware of.\nThe major flaw of this game is its backward difficulty curve. In the beginning I had only a crappy shotgun, a handful of bullets and a death wish. And that was great because when I inevitably run out of ammo, I had to run from building to building, praying that inside I'll find at least a couple of bullets before the horde of working class gentlemen chasing after me proceed to chew off my face. It was tense, stressful and absolutely awesome, just the way a true zombie game should feel like. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the last streets (a.k.a levels) I had so much money, ammo and medkits, I was practically immortal and all the challenge was lost. In short, the game is rather unbalanced.\nBesides the few times when the game crashed and cheered me up immensely, there isn't really anything to complain about from the technical side.\nThe music is pretty decent but definitely not memorable.\nCriticizing the graphics feels a bit awkward considering the fact it's written in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title what you are supposed to expect. Desperate lack of resources hiding underneath pretentious retro banner.\nHowever, despite my rambling, I enjoyed this game a lot. It's in no way deep, is a bit clunky, but it has a sense of style and what it does, it does well. It's definitely worth checking out.","January 26, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

What a blast~ It's quite simple and has very simple rpg elements such as buying and sellings goods as well as getting more money for selling something to a merchant that they really wanted. I have yet to try the local co-op unfortunately but the single player is simple blast your way through zombies goodness. It has a retro feel of course because of the graphics but I also felt nostalgia playing this game.\nUPDATE: I finally played local co-op with a buddy of mine and it makes the game much more intense and fun. For the simplicity of the game it really is quite strategic. If a merchant only has 2 boxes of handgun rounds and 1 box of shells and one player buys it all, there is no ammo left for the other player to buy. You can enter the menu and discard items; however it wont discard them, it will give your partner the oppourtunity to take it. So if you want to lighten your load by all means discard. But if your partner has a more powerful shotgun and you a stronger pistol but you each have the opposite ammo, you can trade and the great thing about it is you can select the exact amount of bullets to give, or just give all with the push of one button. This really added depth that I didn't even know the game had because you won't experience that in single player. This also goes for items such as medipacks and throwable items such as grenades and flares. This game is retro in every way, even in the sense of game like Double Dragon and more modern Super Smash Bros in the sense that they're amazing games made 10X better with a partner. I recommend this game absolutely. Especially if you're a fan of pick up and play and/or retro style games. It may become tedious in single player if you don't really use all it has to offer but in multiplayer it is non-stop fun. I cannot wait for Dead Pixels 2 as it promises 4 player online co-op but it's been so long and no news. For a price of $3.99 you honestly can't go wrong and it supports developers like this who create great content for a reasonable price.\n\nIt has great achievments as well such as 1968 which you get when you kill that many zombies. A reference to Night of The Living Dead.\n\nIt has tons of zombie media references including tons of Resident Evil references. From the Burton Magnum to the Redfield Carbine Rifle and the Valentine Bold Action. There is also a Weker somthing but I can't quite remember it. The premise is also similar to Day of The Dead in which they have to get to a helicopter and escapre. Although in the movie it's not much to get to the chopper. In the game however you have 30 blocks to go through and keep an eye out for any doors on the upper part of the screen as you can enter them for loot and weapons. Also be mindful you can go into garages which many people may not realize unless by chance. When you clear a building out it'll have a red painted X over it so you know. Also traders tend to have a green arrow pointing towards their door.\n\nOkay, ennough rambling about the game. Buy it and have a blast. I recommend using a gamepad however it isn't necessary. That will just be personal preference but it seems much better in my opinion with the gamepad. Right trigger shoot right.

It's basically another game riding on the barely living 8-bit trend, and the completely passed tense zombie trend.\n\nThe gameplay is repetitve and pretty dull.  It is not particularly challenging.   Avoid the slow zombies, loot boring random rooms for generic "treasure" that has no in game use.  Sell the treasure at other random shop rooms to upgrade and get ammo.  Conserve ammo by not killing anythign and running through the level.\n\nMost importantly, Dead Pixels is not in any way a simulation.  I was kind of fooled into purchasing due to the very positive review status and the descript "Zombie Sim."  I thought inventory and stat management, possibly exploring pathways and some stealth would be inolved.  Afraid not.\n\nTake this review from a guy who collects and plays a lot of games, and has a library of actual retro carts.

I wasn't expecting to put as many hours into it as I have since most of the people that reviewed it didn't even play the game for more than an hour, but it has some pretty cool features. There's a variation of weapons from pistols, shotguns, bolt rifles, grenades, fireworks to distract your enemies and so on, about 10-15 different zombies, an upgrade system for your character, and a few game modes.\n\nDead Pixels is basically a wave based campaign mode that gets harder and longer as you raise the difficulty and ends once you reach the extraction point. The Solution gives you the choice of a few characters to choose from with already upgraded attributes and your goal is to make it to the nuclear facility to trigger an explosion that will wipe out the city. This mode was my favorite because you have to make it all the way there, without traders to buy goods from, (you get ammo and guns from looting and calling in drop boxes from your commander), and then run back before the nuclear reactor explodes. It sounds annoying, but it's the best mode in my opinion. And survival. Would it really be a zombie game without survival?\n\nI only have a few problems with this game. The hardest difficulty mode is ridiculous. It should be called impossible mode. Yes, you can beat it, but when you switch from hard mode to hardest mode, you rarely get any weapons or ammo and traders really only appear at the beginning of the game and at the end. May as well just get rid of the traders and force the player to bash his way through. Hardest difficulty isn't bad because it's hard, it's bad because it's extremely cheap and significantly unbalanced. My other complaint is really a recommendation. Just add bosses and it will vary the feeling of the game instead of running constantly down streets shooting the same zombies. Also, the achievements seem buggy, so you could be looking at a few extra hours just to find ways of unlocking them, even when you already did what they said.\n\nIf you see this game on sale and you like zombies, pick it up. Otherwise, wait for Dead Pixels 2 or just let the game be.","July 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You walk through through the streets, gunning down randomized waves of zombies and using currency they drop to purchase weapons, upgrades and ammunition. The ammunition is life, because each street crescendos with thicker waves of zombies so they can overwhelm you.\n\nOn the surface, Dead Pixels looks like a blend between a pixelated throw back to the late 80s and a grind house cinema with its intentional film grain. It even starts like an old movie complete with the countdown of 4, 3, 2, 1 and now for our feature presentation. Both of which alienate it from its 8-bit style. In the game it looks like a cross between old school retro themed charm and cheap with its red lines painted on walls.\n\nThe objective is to make your way through dozens of streets to the end in three campaigns. There are unimpressive boss fights here and there. They tend to feel like standard enemies that look special. The issue with the bosses is that they take damage and draw in other zombies to attack you. Every so often you get a change of scenery, but its a long wait before you see something different.\n\nYour character moves a tad bit faster than zombies and you can still dodge them in even great numbers, but the screen can fill with the green undead. Even after you've cleared an area, if you backtrack, there will always be more zombies waiting for you so you need to pick a direction and stick with it.\n\nShooting zombies in the face looks good, but its a step down from the diversity of beating people up with punches, kicks and fancy moves. That's why this game fits in more with strategy than a cold beat'em up. The brawler genre wears thin on me after a short while and that's why so many of them are short. Dead Pixels with its three campaigns is a good long game.\n\nEven with guns, its a tough game, but any game that requires you to grind for more cash in order to upgrade will always be an uphill battle. You need to use strategy to determine if a zombie is worth the ammunition spent killing it. Weapons have penetration, damage, firing speed and range. They come in three types: rifles, shotguns and short range that fire quick, but do small damage.\n\nThe controls are set up beautiful and it recommends to use a controller. Left trigger and bumper to shoot or throw a projectile to the left and the right trigger and bumper to do the same thing to the right. This allows you to run left while shooting right. The left stick controls, the directional pad switches between weapons, items and throwables. Otherwise, you can hop in the menu to select something.\n\nAs you go through the game, you'll encounter a lot of doors, most of which have been spray painted over to mark that there's nothing inside. Other doors you can enter to collect random loot. Searching these areas is like looting a treasure chest. With everything that you collect, it increases your weight and in some rare cases, you can become over encumbered and move slower. To counteract this, you need to go into the menu and start dropping things and its always guns that have the most weight. Once something is dropped, its gone for good. Its always good to have only the best weapon for each type of bullet. Otherwise you can quick change to something weak and suffer wasted ammunition.\n\nFor everything extra that you have, there are shops about one per street that you can sell to. These shops have a lot of depth. They offer things for you to buy, sell you upgrades, save your game and they even want specific things that they're willing to pay big money for. If you have something they want, sell it to them. If you find it later, it will only cost more ammunition to go back and sell it to them.\n\nSo why is ammunition so valuable? You can find it in rooms, but other than that, you need to buy it and the problem is that once you buy it, then its gone. You need to keep pushing forward to find more ammunition and stores that sell it. That's why its best to have a weapon for each of the three types of ammunition. Sure you can melee enemies, but you can die trying too. Its best to keep zombies as far away as possible.\n\nIf you have big money, buy upgrades. They come in the form of more maximum health, more weapon damage, more melee damage, more luck, more speed, better bargaining at shops and more strength to carry more. I recommend better bargaining over everything else. Then more weapons to keep enemies at bay. After you've upgraded yourself into a supreme being, you can take out eight zombies with a single shotgun blast and become all powerful, yet still succumb to a lack of ammunition.\n\nThe game offers a diverse array of zombies with different characteristics. Standard zombies will get alert and give quicker pace. Elderly zombies that are slower. Smaller zombies that spot you from far away and charge at you. These are the ones that you'll need to shoot rather than dodge. Spitters launch a stream of green glowing goo. Soldiers can take a lot of damage and so on. They're all divvied out slow so you need to wade through a lot of streets before the game starts to ramp up the diversity.\n\nIn terms of cash and fun, you can get a kill combo going. The problem is you still need to collect the cash... before it disappears. So taking down a flood of enemies becomes meaningless if you never charge in risking your health for the coin. If you're at the top or bottom of the screen zombies can pin you, and they wait for others to hurt you.  There's no way to shoot them, because you can only shoot left and right rather than north or south.\n\nThere are plenty of med kits to restore your health. Some zombies drop antidotes to poison. Adrenaline makes you go faster. You'll get grenades and incendiaries to light a pack of zombies on fire. Fire crackers can be thrown to distract the enemies if you ever need to, but its just easier to walk around the undead.\n\nDying kicks you back to the main menu where you can either load a save for an auto save of the street you were on. It would have streamlined things just to have you chose rather than kicking you back to a menu. With a game that can box you in, its good to have a save in addition to your auto save. Since enemies are randomized there's always still a chance you'll make it through no matter how the odds are stacked.\n\nDead Pixels is well worth its dirt cheap price, even if you take a risk on a game that's a grind. There's a lot here, but its slow progress.","October 15, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Being an arcade style game, the story is nothing special, the character is bland, but it still has it's charms. The artwork is simple, but so appealing. The weapons are satisfying and conserving ammo is entirely necessary. The melee seems odd, and a bit too weak. Melee weapons could be an appreciated addition, if made right. The gameplay is what makes this game great. The weapons feel like they have impact, and you can choose to run and gun, take out the enemies in front of you, or save time and ammo by running through the mobs awaiting you. Looting houses is fun, sorting out the things you need and the things you dont need, but why not be able to explore the house? It could be a bit boring if it wasn't done right, but it would be more entertaining than a blank menu, and all the zombies stopping dead in their tracks until you get out. It's a good game, but a flawed one. I like it, especially the fact that there is 2 player local co-op. I give it a 6/10. It's worth a try, especially if you feel like a good arcade game.","June 14, 2014","true","10.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's a zombie survival action game where the goal is to get to the final street in the chapter. There are unlimited zombies and you have limited resources to deal with them. This can make the game intentionally tense, as you figure out if it's better to shoot or run. You do have a melee attack, but it's literally no more than 2 pixels large and I have yet to see any melee weapons, so you're stuck with slapping zombies or pushing your gun. (Melee does become more effective when leveled up, but is expensive and using melee is very boring). I like this game for its retro appeareance, rocking soundtrack, and resource managment. I hate this game because i'm always getting caught on zombie groups, melee is underwhelming. the streets are nearly all the same (RUN RIGHT! Same streets, different buildings), money drops from enemies disappear after a few seconds (which SUCKS when dealing with large groups of enemies and you need money for ammo or upgrades), and vendors that are willing to pay top dollar for a specific item always want something you just sold or won't get until you way past them. Nearly anything in the game that has a name is a reference to other zombie fiction, particularly Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead.  I like some of the core mechanics of this game, and somebody looking for geniuine action/survival/ammo management will like this, but it started to bother me after a good while.","August 19, 2013","false","2.8"," 28 of 55 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","28","55","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethal/recommended/222980/","sethal","Sethal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethal/","244 products in account","This is a run and gun shooter with a retro feel to it. The object is to make it through each level by getting to the end. On the way there you can kill the zombies, or avoid them. You can also raid the stores, houses, and buildings along the way. In these building you'll find ammo, guns, and items such as water that you can use or sell to traders that you find throughout the levels.  There's three different mods to play. Two campaign type, and one survival type. I flew through the first campaign in under an hour, and the second in even less time. Keep this in mind, as it is a very short game. The controls with a gamepad, such as the 360 controller, work flawlessly. I personally didn't use the mouse and keyboard with this one so I can't rate the control factor on that end. For $2.99 it's not a bad game, it offers local co-op, achievements and all that. If you can get in during a sale for like 66% off, as I did, then it's a steal. I had fun playing through the campaigns, but didn't much care for the survival mode only because that's not really my thing. All in all I enjoyed it, and think you will too. Just remember sometimes it's easier to hull ♥♥♥ than kill everything.","January 17, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethal/recommended/222980/","sethal","Sethal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethal/","244 products in account","This is a run and gun shooter with a retro feel to it. The object is to make it through each level by getting to the end. On the way there you can kill the zombies, or avoid them. You can also raid the stores, houses, and buildings along the way. In these building you'll find ammo, guns, and items such as water that you can use or sell to traders that you find throughout the levels.  There's three different mods to play. Two campaign type, and one survival type. I flew through the first campaign in under an hour, and the second in even less time. Keep this in mind, as it is a very short game. The controls with a gamepad, such as the 360 controller, work flawlessly. I personally didn't use the mouse and keyboard with this one so I can't rate the control factor on that end. For $2.99 it's not a bad game, it offers local co-op, achievements and all that. If you can get in during a sale for like 66% off, as I did, then it's a steal. I had fun playing through the campaigns, but didn't much care for the survival mode only because that's not really my thing. All in all I enjoyed it, and think you will too. Just remember sometimes it's easier to hull ♥♥♥ than kill everything.","January 17, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a much less polished and much more shallow zombie take on River City Ransom. You go around the city earning money from killed zombies and entering shops to buy weapons, items, and upgrades for your character. There are two different story modes, and one wave/time attack mode with Steam leaderboards. The gameplay itself is fun even though it tends to get repetitive about halfway through each of the story modes. This is not due to a lack of weapons and items. It's because once you learn how to approach the game, it becomes very easy to cheese your way through both campaigns without too much of a challenge. There is also the option of playing co-op, but it is only available locally, which is always a wasted opportunity. Overall, Dead Pixels is well done and offers a lot of content for its extremely low asking price.\n\nDead Pixels is good.","July 16, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They also said they spend eons of time troubleshooting customer's broken PC (and rarely fixing their own game)..\n\nIn light of that, all I can say is that if the devs are happy with the art style then its perfect :> Not for me, but for them, and that's cool :) I guess I'd personally call the game "under-fed".. Its a great base, and it'd be one I'd play often if the art were more gritty and gory.. A lot of nice pixel-explosions (of fire or gore!) or things like lighting and muzzle flash, could be added, and more variants of the current zombies.. Also more scenery (blown up/burning cars, dead bodies, more general damage and blood splashes..), maybe some random-gen ambush situations (doors, cars or garages that can release or hide zombies).. Some character customization, even a utility for editing and recoloring the player character and zombies..\n\nA game is worth its content, and regardless of business-related ups and downs, one fact that'll never change is: You can't stop a good game from selling.\n\nCan't. Can not :> Terraria goes for ten bucks when not on sale, and I don't think its a game that should even go on sale :| I would have paid 30 bucks for it, easy, because its had more time and care given to it than the grand majority of my Steam games, even among AAA titles..

I never thought it would be much of a game, it was on sale for 99 cents and I bought it just on the off chance it would be good, and because it was so cheap.\nRecently I was talking about one of my favorite old NES games, River City Ransom, and had asked a friend if he knew of anything similar that is on the PC. This is the game he mentioned.\nAnd while I do not think this game is better than River City Ransom, or even close to as good. It definitely scratches that itch I had for a similar game.\nThe controls are nice and responsive, the movement is fluid, and the gameplay is challenging enough. You can loot abandoned buildings, then turn around and sell the items you find to traders that have storefronts randomly throughout the game and use those funds ot buy weapons/ammo/health kits form them. The traders also have a 'wanted' option to click when in their store, and they name an item that they want and they offer high amounts of money in exchange.\nThe game also has level progression and slight RPG elements, skill upgrades, a nice assortment of weapons. Weapons which have stats that you can compare.\nOverall I'm pleased with the game so far, and although i havent put in a whole lot of time with it yet, i can see im going to enjoy it a lot. But i also see that it's going to get quite repetitive, which may or may not be a bad thing.\nI definitely would reccomend this to anyone whos into retro gameplay. at ANY price, the $2.99 price tag when it's not on sale is nothing, it's well worth that.\n\n7.5/10","June 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Money System and Skill System are bad. In the hardest difficulty, you just collected a few coins after you killed a large number of zombies(coins will be vanished after a while, I don't think you would risk your life to collect coins). In later period, coins were useless because the commodities were limited. Also your skill (the highest level is 5) and guns became useless too. Those things which can let you pass through the block quickly were the most important tools. A shoot game unexpectedly becomes a shun zombie game.\n\n游戏的背景音乐非常烂（就几首歌一直在那循环播放），金钱和人物升级系统做得很不好。在最高难度下，前期你杀了一大波僵尸才捡到几个金币（金币会自动消失，你不可能冒着生命危险去捡钱吧？）。而到了后期，金钱却一点用也没有（商店能买的东西都是有限的）。人物技能最高只能升到5级，到了后期简直就不够用。后期枪支成为摆设，能够快速通过街道的道具才是王道，一款横版射击游戏到了后期竟然变成了躲避向游戏。","December 14, 2013","false","12.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/222980/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account","While not some high profile release with an impressive story and hundreds of hours of gameplay, I enjoyed my time with this game.\n\nStory\nThe game has three scenarios, each with a different story. Dead Pixels is the first one, this is rather basic. The dead are returning from the grave, you must reach the airport to escape the town. The second is The Solution in which you are a convict sent to the town to attempt to do something about the zombies. The final one is Last Stand where you are a survivor who was unable to reach the airport, and must survive for as long as possible.\n\nPresentation\nThis is pretty good. Some basic blocky graphics, similar to the kind of images you would expect from a Sega Genesis / Mega Drive or Super Nintendo. They certainly work, you won't have any trouble noticing a zombie against the background. Each zombie type is different enough that you know what to expect from them when you get close.\n\nAs for music and sound effects, these are good enough. The music isn't memorable, but at least gets you in the mode for dealing with zombies. As for the groans, gun shots and other effects, they are fine.\n\nControls\nI played this with a wired XBox 360 gamepad, as the game was originally released for the XBox Live Indie library and had the controller in mind when released. Because of this, I can't confirm how good other control methods may be. What I can confirm is that it works great with the gamepad, using the triggers and bumpers to fire you current weapon and throw grenades in either direction. The left analog stick will move your character and the face buttons will perform actions like a basic melee attack and using doors.\n\nGameplay\nNow for the important part of the review. In this game, you will play a character who will keep going right past groups of zombies, traveling several blocks in order to reach his goal and escape, unless you are playing the Last Stand scenario, where you simply try to survive as long as you can. Obviously, the rotting corpses will do their best to prevent you from doing this, by attacking you using any method they can, some even spitting at you. Now, you do start with a weapon and some ammo, but firing madly into the groups will expend your limited bullets quickly. However, by entering buildings along the way, you will find various items left behind by the previous inhabitants. You can take weapons, ammo and other items from these buildings, but be sure to not overload yourself if you wish to continue escaping. In two of the scenarios, Dead Pixels and Last Stand, some buildings will also contain survivors willing to purchase items from you, as well as selling some of their own. They will also allow you to exchange cash in order to upgrade skills, like weapon damage, inventory size and movement speed. When playing The Solution, these survivors are no longer around, but you do have a choice of characters, each with their own skills already for you to survive.\n\nLifespan\nProvided you enjoy the game enough to continue playing, there is a good amount to do. The game has 4 difficulty settings, each of which extends the number of blocks you must travel to escape. It also supports co-op if you have a friend willing to play with you. It also has 30 achievements to earn if you are interested in collecting those.\n\nIn the end, while I admit this game isn't perfect, at the price of $3, you easily get what you paid for in terms of fun.","April 27, 2013","true","2.3"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","0"

Spare your ammo as much as possible, but use it for crowds. There is also a farming bug that I found to help me, but in the end I still had to sell all my guns for money and ammo. I ended up at one point with just my shotgun because it seemed more efficient and ammo conservative. I had thought initially that you would want to carry all three weapon styles to get you through the game, but perhaps I had misjudged. Overall, I still really like this game. It's a nice nostalgic 8-bit game. Reminds some people of their childhood on the NES, which I had never had. Although my nostalgia levels are lower than most, I still feel as if I can enjoy this game as much as they did. The game has you going upon many streets to escape "The City". Each street you pass has the next street escalate in difficulty. You get equipment on the way, too; that helps you survive, then collect more ammo and equipment, to survive. The game's streets are randomly generated, so at time the streets may become more helpful than not, but also vice versa. There's a lot more to explore in this game, such as different game modes, more guns, shops, character upgrades, replay ability, etc.; which is why I kept this review somewhat broad. I really hope you buy Dead Pixels and discover this game yourself.\n\nvvv If you are still unsure what you will be getting into, watch me do it! vvv\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5G7ejurOGLQ2DPIt5veVVWkilQ629Xy-\n\nDon't forget to prepare for Dead Pixels II !!!","December 5, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spare your ammo as much as possible, but use it for crowds. There is also a farming bug that I found to help me, but in the end I still had to sell all my guns for money and ammo. I ended up at one point with just my shotgun because it seemed more efficient and ammo conservative. I had thought initially that you would want to carry all three weapon styles to get you through the game, but perhaps I had misjudged. Overall, I still really like this game. It's a nice nostalgic 8-bit game. Reminds some people of their childhood on the NES, which I had never had. Although my nostalgia levels are lower than most, I still feel as if I can enjoy this game as much as they did. The game has you going upon many streets to escape "The City". Each street you pass has the next street escalate in difficulty. You get equipment on the way, too; that helps you survive, then collect more ammo and equipment, to survive. The game's streets are randomly generated, so at time the streets may become more helpful than not, but also vice versa. There's a lot more to explore in this game, such as different game modes, more guns, shops, character upgrades, replay ability, etc.; which is why I kept this review somewhat broad. I really hope you buy Dead Pixels and discover this game yourself.\n\nvvv If you are still unsure what you will be getting into, watch me do it! vvv\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5G7ejurOGLQ2DPIt5veVVWkilQ629Xy-\n\nDon't forget to prepare for Dead Pixels II !!!","December 5, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sim aspect is simplified but can feel heavy starting out while the arcade shooter aspect kick in late game if you play your cards right. But that's really what this game has going against it. It's a slow crawl to the point where you have enough ammuntion that you can go wild and actually actively fight your zombie foes, otherwise you're conserving ammuntion and running away from loads of fights. Oh, and going hog wild at the beginning is the quickest way to screw you over for later. Choose your fights.\n\nIt's just not interesting, unique, or terribly fun until you sit down and spend some time with it. After that, as if you're filling some sort of play time quota, the game becomes quite hectic and entertaining. So if you're interested, I'd wait until it goes on sale. If the sequel plays up the arcade shooter elements more (because it's looking a lot better so far) and plays with the difficulty to match it, you might have a fun retro-esque game on your hands.

The harder levels really are determined by your skill and prefered weapon types and every death feels very fair. You won't find yourself dying an incredibly amount especially with friends.

They wanted to make an "8-bit Zombie Sim" and they suceeded pretty well. Though it limits game functions, it can still look pretty well, especially with film grain effects on. 7.5/10\nGameplay:\nSuprisingly good. Menus are easy to understand, controls are great, and due to the pixellation, you will experience no framerate issues. It does feel kind of wonky with the aiming, but you will get the hang of it. 8.5/10\nContent:\nAmazing. At first it just looks like a game where you get 1 1/2 hours max, there are 3 modes: Survival, Final Solution, and Last Stand. In two of those you have around 5 difficulties to play in. There are tons of different zombies, regular stupid zombies, spitting zombies, military armored zombies, and boss-like burning zombies. Each of those two will probably give you a good 3-5 hours each. Last Stand is an infinite wave minigame that acts as you'd expect it to. You'll probably get another 6-8 hours. It gets pretty tough, the high score is only 36 waves. 9/10\nPrice:\nWorth it. 3 dollars can get you a lot of stuff, but You'll spend way more time with it if you get this. 9/10\nFinal Rating:\n8.5/10 If you're pretty tired of the whole zombie and/or survival game fad, you probably won't like this. Any other type of person, you'd love it. It's a fun, creative, and challenging game to get addicted to.","April 8, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simple and fun game, where you don't have a ton of different mechanics, just run and gun.\n\nIt a 2D game with pixel graphics, so you wont't too many video options. But what surprise me here is the sheer number of controllers you can use – xbox 360, ps3 or whatever you have and also you can rebind all the keys. This feature have to be in every game. And also you can play with mouse and keyboard.\n\nNext is gameplay. Basically you go from left to right, through 20 streets (levels) in the city, finding or buying new gear and blasting zombies. No complicated story, no crafting, just pure fun. I like simple games like this. You have standard weapon arsenal – pistols, shotguns, rifles,assault rifles and flamethrower. Visually they are the same, but there stas are different. The good news is, when you look up a weapon you immediately see if it's better from what you have. One stat catches the eye – Penetration. This shows if the bullet will pass through enemy and hit the standing one behind him. Larger the stat more zombies will be hit. It is awesome to gather a group of enemies and blast them.\n\nWhile walking through the streets you will search abandon buildings for bullets, weapons and other usefull and useless stuff. Everything you don't need you will sell it in the shops. There also you can save your game, buy upgrades, weapons, bullets and other items (i'll be writing about them  later).\n\nThe upgrades are standard – health, melee, luck, bargain, running speed, strength and weapon damage. And money is need it in the shops. How do you acquire them? By collecting coins from dead zombies and from selling useless stuff. I mentioned other items above and they are several types of granades, flares, molotov, anti-tank mine and others. There are also some passive things like jar of ooze (zombies can't detect you, until the shooting start), adrenaline (you move fast), my favourite fireworks – use the and all zombies freeze and you have a chance to kill them. There are few other items, but you will see them yourself.\nTwo things to keep in mind. The first is you can overweight, you can carry everything. This mean you will be very slow and this could be disastrous. The second is zombies respawn and the ammo is never enough, so don't waste too much time in a level. And when you are out of bullets you have two options – poke the zombies to death or run past them. Sometimes when searching empty building, alarm will go off and it will attract a lot of zombies and heated up the scene. The zenemies you face are generic. Slow zombie, fast zombie, spitting zombie, some are easy to kill, others take few shots more. My biggest disappointment is the lack of boss battles. Come on, how could you not include at least final boss? Such a shame.\n\nThe sound design is good. Zombies are making zombie noises, guns sound different, but the biggest star here is the music – it's amazing and it's free !!! Outstanding metal soundtrack, that never get old during my hole time with the game.\n\nThere are two modes beside the main campain – The Last Stand: stay alive as long as you can and Solution. Here you choose between several premade characters with different stats and you can't upgrade them. You can acquire weapons, ammo and others by finding them or by calling for support on a radio. When you use the radio you are buying from the military and they drop supply crate when you are ready. But you have limited calls, so choose wisely. I played The Last Stand and Solution just to get impressions of them. All three modes have co-op, but it's local only.\n\nSometimes you just need light and fun game. Dead Pixels is that and it have a lot of content for the price. Even if you play only the campaign, it's still worth buying. So the game offers a lot of content, amazing music, nice variety of weapons and items, nice pixel graphics, but it's lacking of online co-op and boss battles. I definitely recommend it.","March 4, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sim aspect is simplified but can feel heavy starting out while the arcade shooter aspect kick in late game if you play your cards right. But that's really what this game has going against it. It's a slow crawl to the point where you have enough ammuntion that you can go wild and actually actively fight your zombie foes, otherwise you're conserving ammuntion and running away from loads of fights. Oh, and going hog wild at the beginning is the quickest way to screw you over for later. Choose your fights.\n\nIt's just not interesting, unique, or terribly fun until you sit down and spend some time with it. After that, as if you're filling some sort of play time quota, the game becomes quite hectic and entertaining. So if you're interested, I'd wait until it goes on sale. If the sequel plays up the arcade shooter elements more (because it's looking a lot better so far) and plays with the difficulty to match it, you might have a fun retro-esque game on your hands. Right now it's just... not.","November 12, 2013","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the second mode you play it the exact same way you play the first mode but your connected to the goverment and if you press a button the goverment pops up and you can buy and sell stuff. In the third mode you do a survival round. They have waves of zombies and you only get about 10 seconds to go into the stores. You can also do Time Attack which gives you a limited time to complete one wave. The third mode is just a fun way to see if your ready to play story mode. I hope you have as much fun as I did playing this game because I highly recommend it.","January 20, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The various modes are fun but I have yet to try it co-op. That could definitely be interesting. While it does keep me entertained, kind of on the edge of my seat and allowing me to not have to sit and grind, it also can get repetitive and dare I say it boring with an extended play.\n\nThat being said, I recommend it for anyone in search of a good time-killer and give it a solid 8/10","September 17, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed this one! The game is fast paced and satisfying to play, there is a good level of progression and decent customization. As you move through the levels, you can enter buildings to loot them as well as find others to trade with. Money is spent on either guns/ammo/grenades etc, or on character upgrades (HP, speed, carry weight, etc). There is a good level of challenge in the game as I did find myself dead a number of times, and most of the time it seemed fair :) There were minor clipping issues at times where I seemed to get "stuck" in the environment, but I would say only a few times over an entire playthrough.

We must see at least one of these every week. But wait! This one is actually worth your time. The story and core gameplay are simple. Survive the zombie outbreak by running through several side scrolling streets, shooting or avoiding zombies. However, look a little closer and you'll find a surprising amount of depth. Killed zombies drop money, and buildings can be searched to find better guns, ammo, medkits, buffs and loot. Traders will buy and sell items, as well as permanent stat increases for things like health, movement speed, carry weight and weapon damage. This opens up several playing styles. I haven't encountered any bugs, and there's nothing major to complain about. Dead Pixels will only last a few hours, and it won't make any GOTY lists, but for £2 this is excellent value for money and definitely worth checking out.","April 5, 2013","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far, I only have about nine hours in-game, and I bought it in the spring of this year. But, recently, I have found a new respect for it! I was playing Trials with my friend while he was over, and I accidentally clicked on it, while scrolling through games we could play on local mode. I ended up playing it for a few hours with him, and even more on my own time by myself! My only complaint however, is that is costs a dollar on the XBLA, and three dollars on steam.But in the end, it wouldn't matter, as I bought it on both platforms anyway. Overall, great job guys!

You can tell the devs really loved zombie movies and poured thier heart and souls into it. Why do i say that the devs loved zombie movies? there are so many references to zombie and horror culture in general, its astounding! (not to mention, BOOMSTICK!!!!) There have been so many games that try and feel high grade even with a shoestring budget, and this is one of the few that genuinely got it right.Just be warned, the game is extremely difficult and ammo is sometimes scarce when you need it most.

If you don't have someone to play with in person, this will be a single player experience. (2) While there is scavenging, inventory management, and skill allocation in the game, your two major concerns in this game are still killing zombies and having enough things to kill zombies with. (3) This game has random level generation, but since all the modes are about going from left to right and sometimes left again, you're not going to notice this too much.\n\nOverall, for $3 (or less), this game is value for money when it comes to simple side-scrolling zombie-stomping action.","July 6, 2013","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself running around and dodging the horde many times in an attempt to save what precious ammo I had. Also, while concentrating on avoiding enemies you will likely miss quite a few unpainted doors; these signify an establishment that you can search for items.

Although it has the same old story that you normally would see within a zombie movie.\n\nART/MUSIC (8/10):\nThe art is a simple 8-bit style. The art gives this game a vintage or retro feel to it. Not only that, the developers also added some effects and styles that you'll remember from a 1980's horror movie. The music is pretty good. My favorite tune is the one that plays in the title screen before entering the main menu. The song was a great rock song.\n\nGAMEPLAY (9/10):\nThe game is really simple and easy to pick up as well. I played it on my keyboard and it was pretty easy to play. There are different difficulties and it will define your experience when you choose the difficulty. Plus, the game has multiple game modes which makes each experiences different. The main game mode has this economic system and an upgrade system that makes the game fun in exploration and powering up.

As any horror/survival game, you have to plan very carefully what to have in your inventory and when to use it, it has a limit of objects you can have, you can exceed that limit, but you'll walk slowly and eventually die because of the zombies.

It's a unique side scrolling shooter with a great managment system and a large variety of weapons and items. The harder levels really are determined by your skill and prefered weapon types and every death feels very fair. You won't find yourself dying an incredibly amount especially with friends. As a bonus, there is an alturnative "Survival" mode that allows you and your friends to survive in a mall for as many rounds as possible. Dead Pixels is totally worth the price and I would reccommend this title to anyone.","June 30, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your pixel hero runs across the screen killing zombies until he clears all the screens. Graphics and Sound are basic but fit the games style as a homage to the 8/16-bit eras. It's also full of of great references, mostly to Resident Evil but there a few other horror references tucked away (such as Ash's boomstick from Evil Dead).\n\nIn between all the zombie shooting and side scrolling there is the opportunity to visit shops (With bizzarely calm shop keepers in them. There are hundreds of zombies outside guys, runaway!) In these shops you can upgrade abilities, weapons or ammunition. This does add some much needed depth and replay value to the game as it lets you change the way you play.\n\nIn my case I stocked up on med packs, upgraded my health and speed and killed zombies only when necessarily. When I first started I was trying to kill everything but I soon realised what a drain on ammo this was! Judging from other playthroughs I've seen other people didn't let that put them off, buying loads of weapons and ammo and upgrading their combat abilities in order to massacre hundreds of zombies.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy considering its regularly available for about the price of a Freddo, and you're guaranteed at least 20 minutes more fun out of Dead Pixels.\n\nhttp://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/","February 6","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's a flat out lie.\n\nThere's 7 weapon types, and each weapon has maybe...3-4 varients in NAME and attack damage, but essentially do the same thing.\n\nFor example, Redfield Handgun, Chamber Handgun, Burton Magnum, Valentine Handgun, all use the same ammo and have the same sprite, and shoot the exact same way. Some just do more damage.\n\nEssentially, in the main game, you'll generally find your way up to having a valentine rifle, shotgun and machine gun, and that's literally all you need to beat the game every run except hardest.\n\nThat's not to say that the game is bad, but let's be honest, this game is no Left 4 Dead.\n\nI got it on sale for like $0.75, so I can't complain considering I've played it for 24 hours already in the few days I've owned it, but that's because I needed something for a livestream, and it worked like a charm. The demo for DPII makes this game look WAY worse in comparison, and you should definantly preorder that so that you get Dead Pixel + Dead Pixel 2 for a cheaper price.

It definitely has that trendy old school feel to it, but it just doesn't seem to be so self absorbed in its trendiness as a lot of indie games these days do. It is just straight up fun and challenging. You are basically running down a street shooting, bashing or setting fire to zombies. Killing the zombies gives you cash which you can use to upgrade abilities such as weapons, strength or melee. This increases your ability to defeat the monsters. You can also use your cash to get better weapons, health, ammo, etc... The game also has challenge modes which pit you against waves of zombies. For three bucks it's definitely worth the price.

Then play it. It works best in that order.\nOk, if you are still looking for more persuasion, try this. It's WAY deeper than it looks. You and your partner (if you want to have a really good time) have to make your way from street to street, kicking in doors, scavenging for supplies, using ammo carefully (no spray and pray here), deciding on upgrades vs. ammo vs items vs. new weapons and stay alive doing so while mashing the crap out of the undead and seeing what they had in their wallets. Markets change from street to street and not all vendors sell items for the same price or even sell the same items.\n\nWith all of this, there really isn't much micromanagement which is amazing. It's fairly quick and you stay in the action, but you have to use your head as much as your twitchy-twitchy fingers. At times it can be pretty tense in that awesome way that we all like to pay for tense experiences that we call SUPER FUN VIDEO GAMES.\n\nSo, go buy it. Then play it.\n\nM13","May 26, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just beat the game on normal mode for the standard story mode and I loved every moment of it (2.7hrs). It was nice to be able to invest in health and speed among other things instead of just equipment and it made a huge difference in the gameplay. There are a few different types of weapons, but I would have liked to see more. The zombies start off basic and you are gradually introduced to harder and harder types. I melee'd the crap out of most of them just to save ammo and money, but ended the game with way too much of both. I guess that's just the hoarder in me. I found that I didn't use a lot of the throwable weapons, but I did enjoy their effects when I did. I highly recommend this game for a few hours of fun if you have that itch to annhilate zombies. I wish I had someone to coop with!\n\n9/10 - Wonderful in nearly every way, especially for the price. Several game modes will have me coming back. The addtion of coop is great!

GET THIS GAME! This is one of the few games in a long time that has had zombies that ive enjoyed, and that is saying a lot. You can tell the devs really loved zombie movies and poured thier heart and souls into it. Why do i say that the devs loved zombie movies? there are so many references to zombie and horror culture in general, its astounding! (not to mention, BOOMSTICK!!!!) There have been so many games that try and feel high grade even with a shoestring budget, and this is one of the few that genuinely got it right.Just be warned, the game is extremely difficult and ammo is sometimes scarce when you need it most. Other than that and a few instances where the AI seemed th become superhuman and block me in, I have nearly no complaints!\n\nI rate 1968/BOOMSTICK!!!

The hardest difficulty amounts to a grindfest though, since stores never seem to spawn after the first one. Just to beat hardest, I had to melee kill farm all the zombies till I was maxed in all skill levels.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a cheap game that is also decently fun, then you should buy this.","November 6, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got it on sale for 74 cents, but most definately worth even the low normal cost of 3 bucks.  My only complaint on it is, that the bargain perk is completely worthless & I wish there was more upgrades & more levels of the upgrades.  Thats one reason why the bargain perk is worthless.  For the high cost of that skill VS what it saves you in $, youre better off ignoring it till everything else is maxed out first, & then maxing the bargain out just to get the achievment.\n\nAny way even those probs dont take away the overall quality & fun of this game.  And this game would easily be worth it even at 5 bucks.  Either way its one of the few games on here that gives the most bang for your buck for what it costs VS what it has to offer.  Solid 8/10.","October 30, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
