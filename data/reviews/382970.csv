Its still Risk, and Risk is always fun, but here are some of the problems and things missing that would make this a tolerable PC port.\n\n1. No save feature\n2. No resolution or graphics settings, options menu is bare bones with just sound sliders and the ability to turn off animations\n3. You cant skip through enemy turns, and if you click too fast to skip, it zooms in and out on the space and nothing progresses\n4. camera gets stuck when mouse is over a country\n5. turns take too long to animate through\n\ntheres probably alot more issues but I didnt have the stomach to sit through them all. the fact that there isnt a 4-pack deal for this game tells you that this developer doesnt know what theyre doing. This is like a watered down version of a Risk game i played on the original Xbox back in 2006. so basically in ten years, the video game version of Risk has somehow gone down in quality.\n\n2/10","January 5","false","0.2"," 307 of 326 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","307","326","11","0"

You can have up to 4 players any of which can be player or AI. (Actually not sure if you can have 4 AI, didn't try).\n\nGame options are just music volume, fx volume and battle animations on or off. The main annoyance with a game like this, playing it solo, as you might imagine is the tedium of waiting for the AI to take their turn and all the various animations to stop playing. Unfortunately, turning battle animations off only removes a small part of the animations you have to sit through: Each player's turn you have to sit there while they select troops, reinforce places, receive cards and attack. Even with battle animations off you still get the map zooming in to that area, dice being rolled and troops cheering or sighing; you just don't get them firing at each other.\n\nI didn't test multiplayer but I would recommend the game for single player if you like Risk or think you might. Maybe in the future they will add an option to skip more of the animations, but I suspect (no real evidence, but...) that this is a dump it and leave it alone release, as in there will be patches only to fix crashes.","January 5","true","0.5"," 88 of 136 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","88","136","11","6"

In the current state there are many neat features:\n\n1. Play with up to 3 friends minus yourself or you may play a game against 3 AI opponets with 5 difficulty options for them.\n\n2.The animations for me anyway are fun to watch and gives you something to look at while the AI is playing it's turn. What I like about the animations is that they use the proper models for troop numbers. For instance if you have 6 troops invading a territory it will show up as a calvary soldier (represents 5 troops) and a regular soldier (represents one troop). To me small things like that make the game more real to me.\n\n3.When attacking a region you have two options, you may do a standard roll the dice or use the auto resolve feature which is basically giving the battle up to fate to see who wins. The only major issue I have with this game is that the AI does not use the retreat feature when they are losing a battle, they just throw troops away and are not conservative players even on the highest difficulty.\n\n4. So far I've played two AI games and enjoyed both equally with the AI always keeping me on my toes. Some intelligence is shown should one player become to powerful, if you take a continent the AI will happily band together to take away that bonus from you. It shows some thought and logic, they want to keep the game moving and not let one person or AI become more powerful.\n\n5. I have no friends that own the game, so I do not know if you can save those games. But you may save one game at a time while playing against AI opponents, which allows you to return to the game at a later time should something come up.\n\n6. Also the game has a bunch of cool sounds for turn starts, conquering or losing a region, and sounds during the animated fights.\n\nI would rate this a 7/10, but I mean it's worth the buy, 7 bucks for a digital version of a classic board game isn't too much in my book. No matchmaking is in the game but the developers have said they are going to add it within the coming weeks.","January 7","true","9.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","3"

The Best being Risk 2, the worst:  Risk Factions.\nThe new animations in this Risk version are entertaining and look nice in HD.  It's solo AI game is a blast.  I've read so many reviews poo pooing the game that say "you can't click through the AI turns."  They attempt to imply that the AI turns last a very long time and that you have to watch AI dice rolls for hours on end.  Either these people never played the game or simply dont understand how to play.  THE AI USES FAST DICE MODE ON EVERY ATTACK.  Read that line again.  When the AI attacks another AI, you just see the victory of the Winning AI either conquering or defending the country.  So the AI turns go really fast, no dice rolls to watch what-so-ever!  Players can use fast attack dice mode too when attacking AI, so it goes really fast this way also.  In fact the only time you actually have to roll the dice is when you are defending against the AI or attacking/defending against another player.  I found the rounds go pretty fast.\nI'm reserving judgement on this game until they fix the net code for multiplayer, and add a solid player matching service.  But for the price you can't beat it as a solo game.  Perfect for long trips with a laptop in plane or a car.  For me its a 7/10 as is.","January 25","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
