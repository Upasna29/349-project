"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/243560/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","This game has you traverse 100 increasingly difficult dungeon floors, with a boss fight every 10 floors.\n\nEvery mentionable mechanic in this game is extremely shallow, from the side-quests (of which there are only about 20), to the combat which is basically just mashing the primary attack button before your enemies have a chance to fight back, to the loot... Very little of the loot is useful and none of it is interesting. It is usually either temporary powerups, health, useless subweapons or "tokens". You can choose two tokens at the start of a dungeon run and these will add certain effects. I found myself using the token that increases speed all the time, because the character I was playing just moved far too slow which added to the already existing monotony of the gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are simple and colorful, the sprites and animations of the 2D elements are particularly impressive. The audio is also good, which is to be expected considering they got the entire voice cast in to do the dialogue. You will find that the repeated lines and unfunny one-liners will get on your nerves quickly, though. The soundtrack is awesome, as is typical with WayForward games. Again, because they are overused and spread thin, you might find they lose their appeal after hearing the same loop 50 times.\n\nIs it Adventure Time? Yes. Does it have the weird things and the characters you love from the show? Yes. If you are a fan, you would probably find some entertainment in this game, but as a game on its own it is basically a flawed version of Dungeons of Dredmor or Recettear, both of which are far better and contain far more content, yet cost a fraction of the price. In the UK, at least, this game costs the same as Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider when they came out, an absolute joke. I can't recommend this game to anyone until the price drops to at least 75% off and even then I would say it's something only fans should play.\n\nEdit:\nThe game is also incredibly buggy. I had not encountered any on my first complete game, but going back later to get missing achievements caused a lot of issues. For starters, the game crashes a lot. In my case, it would crash at the hub world most of the time when a specific sprite came onto the screen.\n\nAdditionally, there are achievements for completing 50 floors all in one run for the end-game content (The Nightosphere). This takes many, many hours to do and I actually had to restart it several times because the game crashed (crashed at certain bosses, also crashed when using special skills). These do not appear to have been fixed, so my suggestion is still to simply avoid this game completely.","November 25, 2013","false","42.3"," 486 of 532 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","486","532","0","7"

It says on Steam, the box of the game, and everywhere online where it was advertised, that is is -local- multiplayer. Why the heck people thought it would be online is beyond me, lol.**\n\nThis is coming from someone who practically worships Adventure Time. WayForward's two little games that they made do the series NO justice whatsoever. Hey Ice King was short, easy, and overall just as bad as the game it was a clone of, Zelda II.\n\nExplore The Dungeon is a slow-paced, tedious rouge-lite. The floors are procedurally generated, yet still manage to all feel the same. The game itself is buggy, with enemies and background objects/lights disappearing and re-appearing at random, and some tiles glitching into eachother and giving off a static effect. Enemies and items often like to fall through walls, which can be annoying.\n\nThe characters have varying movement speeds, but even as Marceline, who is the fastest, I still feel dreadfully slow. The speed-up token, Speed Shoes, feels absolutely essential simply because without it the game feels like an even longer and slower monotonous grind than it already is.\n\nThere are only a handful of enemies, around twelve or so, and then a good four or five pallet swaps of each one. You enter the Nightosphere at one point but there isn't even anything new there; only another layer of palletswaps. They even rehash old boss fights in a lazy-as-heck effort to pad out the game! I know many games do that, but the bosses in this are story-specific events and not just super-versions of certain monsters. Susan Strong and her people have no need being in the Nightosphere; yet there they are, and you need to save them, again. Because reasons.\n\nThe only good factor about the game is the voice-acting; the original cast came in and delivered all the glorious voices we've come to love. Yet even that isn't much of a redeeming factor because of how utterly -repetitive- the lines get. I actually have to play with the game muted and my own music or videos playing in the background because the game gets so dang dry, so quickly. I'm not talking about when I grind either; I mean even just making progress through the game, only unmuting it during boss fights so you don't miss out on the actual new dialouge.\n\nThat's about it, really. The game is just a buggy, monotonous grind that is absolutely NOT fun at all to play. Even with friends, it's still just doing the same boring crap over and over, laughing awkwardly at the repetitive voice acting, trying to pretend like you're all having a good time. I get that the game is geared towards children, but even then, I can't see a child's simple mind being hooked on this game for very long. Either way, it's a game where you want to know how it ends, so you force yourself to keep playing. Then after that, you drop it and will never pick it up again because you don't want to re-experience that hell for as long as you live.\n\nThe only things we have to thank WayForward for here are a waste of time and money. Thanks guys, you made another cruddy game. *Slowclap*. I really wish Pen would stop trusting his beloved series to those goons. Shantae and Mighty Switch Force were OK, but nothing fantastic. Just simple platformers using breasts to sell themselves really. Other than that WayForward have nothing to speak for. I'm sure a small team of dedicated FANS could make a far superior game than Hey Ice King and Explore the Dungeon. Seriously, the bloody IOS games were better than these.","November 26, 2013","false","85.7"," 247 of 294 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","247","294","0","15"

Adventure Time: EtDBIDK is the premiere loot-em-up by the cash-in division of Pendleton Ward who brought you such classic titles as Adventure Time: Zelda 2 on the DS and Adventure Time: Mobile IAP simulator.\n\nThis title takes all of your favorite Dungeon Crawly tropes and dumbs you in the role of Marceline, who is a bit more fun to play as, or Jake or Finn, neither of which is fun at all. Fight through I think 50 floors of pallete swaps while the charming sprites and voice work bore you away! The tropes are the very most basic. You pick up the items, you perma-die but still progress somehow, and sometimes you fight a boss. Reading that previous sentence is more action-packed than the actual game though.\n\nWhile the gameplay may be the most bland and unfun thing ever, the voice acting is charming. 20-somethings who insist they are not hipsters and 8-year-olds alike will get a huge kick out of recognizing characters.

I have to say the graphical style works well, you really get the feeling of a retro arcade game mixed with the colorful world of Adventure Time. Characters and screens are well done and animations are simple but good.      Audio    6    Simple audio and effects, again the retro feel is very evident. Some nice voice acting by the cast of the show, but they feel a little overused.      Gameplay    4    You play through 100 randomly generated dungeons fighting the occasional boss along the way, all the time collecting keys which are used to unlock doors/chests and treasures which can be used to buy training or equipment. The problem is that the levels are very simplistic/repetitive and the game quickly becomes tedious.        Story    3    There isn't really a story, the characters from Adventure Time are all there and there are a few nice moments but overall the clue is in the title - there is no reason to be exploring the dungeons beyond "just because".        Replayability    4    Being randomly generated should give the game a decent amount of replayability but because so many of the levels feel so similar it doesn't seem to count for much. There is a form of character advancement in that you can upgrade your stats and skills and you can buy items from the "choose goose", but considering the gameplay why would you want to keep playing it?         Multiplayer    4    The Multiplayer is LOCAL only (dont expect to be playing with your steam friends), and is decidedly average. It is somewhat reminiscent of gauntlet in that it usually descends quickly into who can collect the most treasure/food before everyone else, except that in this game certain characters have a clear advantage over others in terms of speed / flying over obstacles (A good way to fall out with friends).         Overall    4.5    While this game may appeal to young players and some fans of the show, I find it very hard to recommend it. Once the novelty has worn off there is very little reason to play this game.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

You'll also be sad to know that it's only tangentally related to ANYTHING, and this is just a pretty average Gauntlet-style dungeon-delve with an Adventure Time lick of paint and far less action.\n\nIt's clearly meant to be played co-op, so your mileage might vary, but for the solo adventurer? Give this one a miss.  This thing is full of padding.  There's little to no variety in the dungeons which are over-large for your movement speed and biomes drawn out too long.

This game isn't even close to the hype that was generated for it. All you do is "explore" and (I use that term lightly) 100 floors of a dungeon and every 5th floor you can teleport back up with loot to use to buy upgrades for your character. There is no level up system in the least enemies do not drop EXP they drop money or healing items. Majority of levels you just wander through looking for the exit. There is no incentive to kill enemies because its just easier to slowly trod away.  Like I said before every 5th level you can warp back to the begining to talk to various AT characters to buy better stats or get new stuff. The problem is you can't save money after you warp back up. The minute you find out you are like 4 coins away from upgrade and want to grind for a tad more money you get hit with a "dungeon tax" that takes away a majority of your money when you enter the dungeon. The game hypes "randomly generated dungeons!!" but they just change where some holes are and where the exit is. There is very little changes to each floor just a diffferent layout there is nothing truly random about them or surprising.\n\nThis game is not even close to a dungeon crawler I really don't know how to describe it other than a rouge like dungeon crawler. When a game makes you sigh when you see how many enemies are on the screen and you just want to run to the nearest exit its defintely doing something wrong. Its like they didn't know if they should make the game a rouge like game or a dungeon crawler so they just combined both genres with little effort and hoped for the best. Do not buy this even if it was on sale trust me its boring, shallow, and not even remotely fun with friends.

It's so you can look into your child's eyes as they ask, "Mom, what's a half-orc shaman?", and then pull out your old dust-covered Red Box and show them yourself. Then, it makes sense. Wonderful sense.\n\nThis game should still be half-price all the time.","December 28, 2013","false","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCCL/recommended/243560/","SCCL","☂Space Cat(^◕‿‿◕^)™☂","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCCL/","222 products in account","This game is a fair bit of fun although the one downside to it is, it isn't a free roam world you're stuck in one area to get upgrades go shopping and then you enter a dungeon. On the upside it is a fun game for multiplayer mode and the weapons and cut scenes are fairly humorous. Also another positive thing about this game is all the characters have the actual voice actors voicing them so that makes everything better. They also should make it so that you can at least have computers help out in a dungeon.\n\nThere are a few concerns with this game though:\n-expensive for what reason i have no clue its a basic game\n-needs steam cards\n-must have an open world basically stuck in isolation\n\nI only recommend this game if you're a big adventure time fan and have the money to blow otherwise not worth it basic game only 100 floors or whatever to discover.","December 28, 2013","true","7.3"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","5","23","0","0"

Being older than dirt, I can appreciate its difficulty.  Yes, there is a Lot of repetition, and you Will die a Lot and get frustrated, but I still remember Dragon Quest on the NES and how you had to play for hours gaining levels just to survive in an area 3 feet from where you started.  So, listen to an audiobook while you play, or have a friend doing commentary, or just listen to a CD if you get bored.  This game isn't for everyone, but if you're super old and enjoy a good grind game, this is a good game.  ...but yeah, don't pay $40 for it.
