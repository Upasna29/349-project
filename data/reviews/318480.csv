But fire spreads in a very distinct way. Big objects spread fire further and light smaller objects on fire. Smaller boxes have a harder time lighting bigger boxes but there are exceptions that you have to learn and be aware of. This isn't the exact best explanation but that's part of the "puzzle" so I'll let you figure the rest out.\nBut while you walk around the level you're trying to assess the best way to spread fires throughout because the number of tools you have to start fires are limited. As you get further into the game you're going to have to do the above without dying from various level hazards, and that's when I really think it pulled me in. Light all this stuff on fire in the most controllled and fast way possible, but also don't die. (There's a really quick level restart button so failure feels like failure, but you're back in it before you've really gotten down on yourself.)\n\nOther stuff....There are four characters to choose from and each one has a unique ability, but honestly I just end up playing Burnstar because well...he's really fast and I like to go fast even if it means I die a lot.\n\nOh, there's actually a surprising amount of content here. The whole game has the like...I just bought an old N64 game feel where there's actually a ton of content shipped with the game..I guess what I'm trying to say is it feels complete. I've put quite a few hours in and I haven't even beat it yet. You have to work your way through all these worlds Mario style and I can't really remember how many more I have to go.","March 19, 2015","true","9.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/318480/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Bomberman meets puzzler, with a good difficulty balance in terms of easy to beat a level, but hard to 100% it. Controls are solid and the gameplay makes you really think about using your arsenal to the best of your abilities, in attempting to maximize the damage/coverage of the area and stars for you to get. The co-op is just a rehash of the single player however, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a different experience out of it. The problem will be the number of levels, while you have 60 levels and they all feel relatively compact and unique, and some replayability to 100% sections, that may not be enough for people at a 9-10 price tag.\n\nIt's for puzzle fans and completionist fans, but others may want to wait for a sale.\n\nFor more first impressions and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLYLaA0-BQY","March 19, 2015","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theindieverse/recommended/318480/","theindieverse","The Indieverse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theindieverse/","8 products in account","Indie in Review: Burnstar\nCheck out the video review at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0UohF4fjLU\n\nOne of my favorite things to do in a video game is blowing stuff up, and I’m sure there are a lot of you who feel the same way. Bomberman used to be a good option to scratch that particular itch, but after more than 40 entries in the franchise, they became rather stale. Enter Burnstar, an attempt to fuse the classic Bomberman gameplay with the elements of a puzzle game. And luckily for all of us pyromaniacs, this mix works surprisingly well.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Burnstar is heavily inspired by the Bomberman franchise. So much in fact, that you immediately become familiar with the controls: You run around while placing bombs that create new routes through the level. There is one main difference: the goal of each level is not to blow up your enemy, but to blow up the level itself. Each mission has two progress bars. You fill the first with blowing up crates, and the second with collecting stars that are dropped by the objects you blow up.\n\nThe most important aspect of Burnstar is strategically placing those bombs. You see, there is a certain hierarchy behind the crates. Three different sizes of crates, red, orange and yellow respectively, are scattered around the level. If a crate is set on fire, it blows up and burns smaller crates around them. This doesn’t work in reverse: a red crate can burn the orange and yellow ones, but yellow crates can’t set the red and orange ones on fire. This is an essential part of Burnstar, and mastering this mechanic is the key to completing the game.\n\nThe percentage of burned crates isn’t the only victory requirement. You also have to collect a certain number of stars, that are hidden behind purple goo or underneath the level. Blow these up via the bombs or crates and the stars will appear. If you’ve played Bomberman before, you’re probably thinking that this all sounds pretty easy. Well, it isn’t. In Burnstar, you only get a certain amount of bombs. Make one mistake and you  have to restart the level. Add that to the many times you’ll die because of an exploded crate or an enemy that appears out of nowhere, and you have the recipe for a challenging puzzler.\n\nMost of the difficulty won’t come from merely completing the levels. Completing Burnstar is no cakewalk, but finishing the 60 levels is definitely doable and will only take you a couple of hours. The meat of the game is perfecting every stage by blowing everything up and doing so in time. This  requires  a certain amount of trial & error, a mechanic that will appeal to some people but one that I’m not particularly fond of. What I like more are the various secrets you can collect. Based on the location you have to choose the right character, each with its own unique ability like dashing and teleporting, and then figure out how you have to reach the collectable in the first place. It’s basically a puzzle within a puzzle.\n\nAs you can probably tell from this review, I like Burnstar a lot. It takes the best parts of Bomberman and puzzle games and combines them into one great whole. Even though perfecting the game isn’t for me, I had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles and of course blowing stuff up. Whether you’re looking for a new puzzle game or a solid Bomberman alternative, you can’t go wrong with Burnstar.","April 8, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Pacing and the rate at which new elements were introduced was great, I never really felt stuck anywhere for more than a few tries. That said, I have not tried to gold medal everything as I go, just getting stars and burn %. As puzzle oriented as I am, I think there is good potential for doing speed runs, and they are interesting to me because the time-delayed nature of the burning mechanic means it will take planning beyond shortest-route stuff.\n\nDefinitely recommend it.","May 12, 2015","true","28.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Sale price of 8.99 (9.99 regularly) (And worth every cent!)\nPurchase link : http://store.steampowered.com/app/318480\n\nAuthor's statement:\nDon't worry it won't be super long, but it will be detailed enough to give whomever decides to read this to the fullest a basic to good grasp of the game in general. (Otherwise feel free to get popcorn and a drink this review isn't going anywhere for some time. It'll be here when you come back, I promise, unless you close it or something happens to cause this close.)\n\nPrologue:\nThe game is fantastically fun, addictive and challenging (sometimes even outright merciless), but in such a way you don't want to throw your controller or keyboard (the controller is recommended by the fine developers at Nerve Software) through the window or monitor, but instead take a breather and go "I know I can figure this out, it's got to have some sort of pattern to it. I'm just over thinking it."\nSome (myself included) just thought of this as a Bomberman clone, but after playing it. I will gladly take that back and say if it is a clone it is a definite thinking man's Bomberman. But really it's so much more than a clone, it has it's own flavor of a puzzle-action game that just so happens to have 4 way explosion bombs in it. Because once you get past that, the similarities stop to a degree.\nBecause the premise of the game is blow all the stuff up, burn all the things, and collect all the shinies!\n\nThe storyline:\nAn evil corporation (literally named Evil. Inc) has came to Burnstar's home, Fairway Island, and has laid waste to it with goo and boxes of goo everywhere! (Cue dramatic music here.) Enter Burnstar (and company) to save their island!\n\nThe Characters:\nBurnstar: The main protagonist and namesake of the game who can run short bursts at an accelerated rate.\nEmber:  His adoptive sister who has a shield that both blocks her from damage and drags stars toward her in a short radius, however leaves her stationary.\nColdsnap: A scientist who worked for Evil. Inc trying to develop a way to freeze the goo away and somehow stabbed herself with the syringe thus giving her Ice Man abilities! Okay that is a bit of a stretch, but does give her the ability to throw Sub-Zero freeze balls at obstacles and freeze them and as long as you're in a safe area (because you'll be stationary) control them! So take THAT Sub-Zero! (Please don't kill me, I'm only a writer.)\nAnd\nToxo: A clone of someone who wants to kill Burnstar (that's gotta be a bit of an awkward situation). Who has the ability to reproduce more clones, albeit a clone of a clone is bound to have some issues somewhere down the line so you get a purple blob clone who can attract baddies and be a very temporary shield or a button pusher for you on top of being an instant teleport back across a large map, but is stuck swaying back and forth in a single spot waiting for something to happen.\nEach have their advantages and disadvantages in each map, but the maps are designed in such a fashion that sure it may be easier for let's say, Coldsnap, to do a map. Burnstar would be able to do the same map as well with really not much more effort. And it gives the game an extra little boost so you're not just stuck with one option through out the game. To me, it makes the game a bit more replayable as well, because the way you solve the map for each character can change slightly or down right all together.\n\nGameplay:\nAs I stated before the premise of the game is to; blow all the stuff up (make sure none of the boxes are left standing because they contain the goo and the goo is bad, mmm'kay?), burn all the things (burn all the boxes of goo and the goo on the ground because, remember the goo is bad, mmm'kay?), and collect all the shinies (as you blow up all the stuff, and burn all the things, stars will appear and you're to collect all the stars). As you start out it is like you are learning to ride the bike and Nerve is holding the bike steady for you as you learn how to play (ride). But by level 4 they've now put training wheels on your Burnstar bike, they're just standing by watching you and all is right in the world of Burnstar, as you gleefully pedal faster and faster. By the time the midway point of the first tier, Nerve has slipped away while you ride your cute little tasseled Burnstar bike with the training wheels off, but they've never stop watching you. Because as they introduce new mechanics into the game you truly feel as if they're trying to help you understand it better and get used to it first before really pushing you to hard.\n(Now this analogy flies out the window if you can find the hidden levels. Because, the hidden levels they've not only ripped your training wheels off they've now put you in a skate park and told you to master riding your Burnstar bike, oh and just for giggles in the hidden level skate park they've thrown lava in random areas, spikes, you know the "fun" stuff for them to laugh manically about, while you try and maintain your balance.)\nAs I briefly touched on, Blow up all the stuff means blow up all the boxes. Boxes range in color from Yellow (they catch fire but do not explode), Orange (they catch fire and after a short duration explode in a four way explosion much like your bombs), and Red (they act just like the orange boxes but instead of exploding in a small 4 way explosion, they explode in a large 4 way explosion.) I won't tell you all the details of how to make stuff explode, as it is better to play around and figure the puzzles out for yourself. I will say this however, you only get a certain amount of bombs per level and there are more than one way to catch things on fire and blow stuff up. Next would be burn all the things, the goo and boxes. Goo is scattered throughout the levels and catches fire  by being touched be something on fire or explosions, and (hint) causes chain-reactions sometimes. And finally, collect all the shinies, collect all the stars that appear after stuff burns and explodes. And that's pretty much it.\n\nOverall:\nI highly recommend this game and it is a definitely worth the 10 dollar price tag.\nHave fun feeding your pyromaniac dreams everyone!","March 22, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"
