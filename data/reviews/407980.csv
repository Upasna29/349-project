You would think with it being a sequel along with it taking place a few months in the future that there would have been some development in any character between the first and second right? Nope. It is literally the exact same game. All the same jokes are used (and reused), it follows the exact same story, it takes place in the exact same location, the two original female leads are still abusive, and the main character learns from his mistakes about as well as a block of lead. There actually quite a number of choices in this game, but they all are completely pointless changing one sentence and sometimes they literally get ignored. I'm not kidding there are times where the main character or the person he is speaking to will literally ignore what you chose rendering your choice obsolete. That could be funny as a one off joke in the story, but it happens so often that I really want to ask why the choices were even put there.\n\nOn top of that this VN wasn't even entertaining in the "this dialogue is hilariously bad" sort of way like the other Sakura titles. While those were all incredibly shallow VN's at least they were unintentionally quite hilarious. This one on the other hand was just really painfully bad. While I am usually able to get quite a few laughs out of these games I couldn't even really laugh at this one. The only thing this VN has going for it is that it's short. I'm talking an hour shorter than the first Sakura Beach short. Pick this one up on sale folks.\n\nIf you're someone who genuinely enjoyed the first Sakura Beach then this was made for only you. For anyone other than that demographic look elsewhere for entertainment.","November 17, 2015","false","2.4"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanshaft/recommended/407980/","lanshaft","Lanshaft | TROWIN SHRAKS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanshaft/","206 products in account","If you're a fan of Winged Cloud's other games in the "Sakura" series, then you'll probably want to pick this one up too. If you haven't played any of the "Sakura" games, then let me brief you: these are basically short story VNs that heavily feature cute girls who often find themselves in compromising and sexy situations.\n\nThe two Beach games in particular are done by the other artist working for Winged Cloud, Inma, as opposed to what you may be used to in Spirit, Angels, Swim Club, and the like, which are done by Wanaca. Inma does have a different style, but I personally like it and think it's a good change of pace, and having more good artists on board allows Winged Cloud to tell more stories like this.\n\nOnto the actual VN though:\nBeach 2 picks up a couple of months after the ending of Beach 1, and lets you choose which ending you receiving in Beach 1 at the start of 2. It continues the story of the love triangle between the protagonist, Seiji, and his two lovely childhood friends, Momoko and Ayumi, as they take another trip to the beach from the first game. While I think reading the first VN helps a lot in setting up the characters, I don't think it's a hard requirement.\n\nThis time though, they meet a third girl, Nene, who is a bit of an oddball, and she gets tangled up in the complicated relationship the other three share. Funny and sexy hijinks ensue and are then brought to a conclusion at the end. This one does have a much more firm conclusion at the end, though I could still see the possibility of telling more stories with these characters, depending the direction the writer wanted to take.\n\nThis VN does give quite a lot of options and choices throughout the game, but from what I've played they just change dialog options, and in this particular one your ending is decided upon the last choice you make in the VN. I actually kind of like this style, since I'm the kind of person that likes to read the routes, but hate it when I don't know which choices matter or not. So when I hit the end and realized how they had done it, I was rather relieved that I didn't have to go back and decipher which choices affected what throughout the story. This is different from Beach 1, where depending on the choices you made you ending up with one girl or the other, or both.\n\nSome people may consider stories like this shallow, and honestly they kind of are. But for me, sometimes I just want short and charming like this. People might criticize the characters for being rehashed archetypes, but I personally find myself just laughing at their ridiculous behavior or the silly situations they get themselves into. These aren't the most inventive characters or story you'll find out there, but that doesn't mean they aren't enjoyable entertainment. I also wasn't a huge fan of Nene compared to the other main girls, but I appreciate the dynamic and shake up that she brought to the story.\n\nThe game does reuse character art, background art, and music from the first one, but I don't consider asset reuse a bad thing. They did obviously expand on it with new character art for the new girl, Nene, as well as 20 new CG scenes, so that is something to look forward to. The music from the first one still holds up as well.\n\nA side note: This game doesn't contain any explicit content like some of the other Sakura games that have outside patches, since Inma doesn't do that kind of art. Personally, I'm fine with this since I can appreciate and enjoy the art without having the girls being naked and showing all their bits.\n\nBottom line: This is another cute short story from Winged Cloud with lovely characters in it. If you want a short read (~3.5 hours) with some funny, sexy characters in it, you should check it out. I know not everyone may be into Inma's style of characters, but I think people should give it a chance, as its nice to see Winged Cloud using more artists to tell more of their stories.","November 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

There's no additional background artwork, no new music tracks, Momoko and Ayumi have exactly the same character models as they did in the last game...\n\nThe best that can be said about Sakura Beach 2 is that it is longer than the first one by about an hour and a half; however, this turns out to not be a positive thing as the story is apallingly bad. Somehow, Ayumi's character has gotten far more annoying than she was in the first game, and by the end of the game you will find yourself hurriedly skipping through her scenes just so you don't have to listen to her cringe-worthy dialogue anymore.\n\nFor some reason, the appearance of a new girl makes the choice at the end of the last game completely moot, as none of the characters act like Seiji is in a committed relationship.\n\nWhen you add in the numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes, it becomes clear that Sakura Beach 2 is the worst game Winged Cloud has ever made.","November 10, 2015","false","6.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Thats right masturbators, go find something else.\n\nAfter playing and finishing the first one yesterday, I wasn't sure what to expect with the sequel.\nAs far as I can tell there are 3 different versions of this game, each depending on what ending you got in the first game. (I got the "both of them ending" so thats what this review will be based off of.) I chose the ending i got and trudged on.\n\nNow I was curious to see what they would do with this sequel after the brilliant ending of the first one but in my opinion they chose a pretty good way to base this one off of. The story behind this one is that there's a perculiar girl named Neve (at least thats what I remember.) is at his stargazing spot and they become friends etc.\n\nI wasn't 100% sure how this was going to work out but I had a safe assumption. and it seems my assumption was correct.\n\nThe following part spoils the ending if you got the same ending I got in the first game. Read at your own risk.\nThe game ends the way I expected, choosing which one of the three you liked the most. So you had the three girls and also an option to keep going with the love triangle thing you have going on (did I mention Neve joined that.) Being the reasonable man, I make myself feel like but probably aren't, I saved the game (that'll come clear soon) and chose the "All of them" option and it was heartwarming to say the least. With the Momoko and <oh derp i forgot her name> endings, they turn out okayish but with the Neve ending, it just feels sad and makes me feel like an absolute dickhed (stfu guidelines)\n\nDone not reading that? Cool. As a sequel, it doesn't live up to the original but I don't think many sequels have. The first one will always be better but as a sequel, its not bad.","November 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The introduction of another character Nene is both interesting and conflicting for me as I was playing through it. Nene seemed more like a  chance to add more conflict and events to occur among the cast of characters as the two main female characters Ayumi and Momoko continue to fight over the MC despite what seemed like a solution to the problem of the first VN where both girls were fighting over the MC. I liked the way the story introduced her and her interactions with the other two girls, but the transition to her becoming an option seemed too rushed and convienent for the MC and the player to decide on her. The good thing that comes from this though, is the chance for resolutions of  some unresolved issues between the MC and both of the girls  from the first VN when one girl was chosen over the other.  The story starts out with asking you who you chose at the end of the first game which is a nice addition but only changes a few lines of dialogue and has no major choice effects. This urked me because the ending choices while nice, were also conflicting because the premise that is set up at the end seems to throw every build up event that led to the final scenes from the first VN seem completely irrelevant since you could just randomly choose specific choices at the end and everything would magically reset and be ok among the cast of characters. It all just seemed reather underwhelming.\n\nAsides from the writing / story quirks, the art and music are always a big highlight and are enjoyable from the many beautiful fan service scenes of bikini shots and some other amusing scenes to the relaxing and mischievous tunes that played during scenes. There are about 20 scenes to view in the gallery/extras and you can get them all in one playthrough since there are unfortunately no specific scenes for different routes. This made it unfortunate in stressing how insignificant your choices were since the end just seemed the same.\n\nOverall fans of previous Sakura games will still enjoy this in the standard quick fan-service pick up fare of most VN's in the Sakura franchise, but I would be wary for those looking / hoping for a change in the format. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite of some of the cons and look forward to the next VN in the Sakura series.","November 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I won't exxagerate. The Main Menu, the Backgrounds, Character Sprites, Music -- heck, even the settings menu is the same!\n\nThe only redeeming factor is that this Game wraps up everything pretty damn well. If you were heavily invested into the "plot" of Sakura Beach's first installment, I would reccomend getting this one for sure, it's worth sitting through 2-3 hours more of boobs, drama and boobs.\n\nHowever, if you were only in for the boobs, don't get it.
