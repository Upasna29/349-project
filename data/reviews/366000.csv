Congratulations.\n\nBut what if...what if I told you that there is an A-10C in space, cold and dark and ready for you to get it started? How does that make you feel?\nIf the answer is "excited", or at least "intrigued", then you've found the game for you.\n\nRogue System's ships are not quite like the A-10 yet, in fact what we have now is a support ship(with functional space claw, to boot!) and not a warship. But there are other two spaceships planned that are fighters and bombers, and who knows how much else if we get to the expansion modules.\nThe ships' system will be fully simulated, down to electrical buses breaking and leaving you with no power even though the reactor is still happily producing it. Orbital mechanics will be respected. Star systems will be to scale(yes, we do have time compression).\nIn short, this is sci-fi as hard as you can get without signing up as an astronaut.\n\nBe advised this is still very much in its early phase. We get some basic tutorials, a test mission to save a space station from uncontrolled deorbiting, and a free flight scenario where we play with the ship in a single star system. Start it up correctly and head to another planet, or mess the systems up until it explodes, it's our call).\n\nEventually we'll have a full single-player campaign with three different ship types and multiple star systems. This is guaranteed. Then there are Elite-like freelancer, first person combat, and multiplayer expansions planned that will come if the game has enough success.\n\nThe best part? All of this is currently being developed by one person(Michael Juliano), who has already done an amazing job. Think how better it can get once dedicated help can be hired!\n\nSo if any of this interests you, get this early release now. It's the best investment you can make :)\n\nWARNING:  The System Requirements in Steam specify this already, but just in case you didn't notice....\nIf you have an Intel video/graphics card, don't bother trying to run the game or complaining when it doesn't. There are technical limitations for it, the developer is aware and will eventually address the problem, but for now Intel Video = No Go.

No I didn't just accidently hit caps lock. It's in caps as this is the what the game is. It's more like DCS and Kerbal space program than it is space games like Elite, X series, Star Citizen and No Man's Sky.  There isn't a game like this and it fills a niche in the market for a realistic, highly detailed, complex and rewarding space ship study simulator.\n\n\nThe game is currently in Alpha so it's still in development. There's only a couple of tutorials, a mission and a sandbox to faff in. There's only one ship currently. Even so this is something special and if the game sounds interesting to you I highly recommend giving it a try.","May 16","true","3.5"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","39","40","2","0"

It's great to see it get more exposure on Steam. As a Space Sim fan since Wing Commander and I-war I can safely say this is the most immersive space ship flying simulator there is. The atmosphere the game evokes is perfect. When you hear the satisfying click of a button, you can hear the coolant flowing through the pipes, reactants being expelled and the ship comes alive.\n\nThere is nothing like this on the market at the moment. A first person KSP with pre-produced ships and a hard sci-fi approach to flying them scratches a nerd itch I didn't know I had.\n\nHaving said that the game is only produced by one developer and is a bit bare bones in terms of volume of content. The interactive systems are what you are going to buy this for now though. I cannot wait to see how the game grows from here.\n\nTldr: A certified reccommendation for Space Sim fans with a hardcore realistic streak.","May 16","true","8.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

The simulation is really accurate and painstainkly realistic, the physics are fantastic, and it tries REALLY hard to stick to current tech + what we realisticly think future tech will look like Ressonant Cavity Thrusters (check out this link if you want to learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_resonant_cavity_thruster).\n\nHowever, bear in mind that this game is in early access for a reason! it's currently rather feature slim and as of now there's not much to do other then mess around with your ship and do orbital flight + transfers.\n\nDespite this, I would like to say that this game is already REALLY fun and enjoyable, the developer (who might  I mention is extreamly active on both readdit and the offical forums) also has a fantastic and very detailed road map layed about about what he wants to do based on how well the game does on steam,\n\nI've had this game since a month after it was first purchasable on their site, and I must say the purchase was 100% worth it! You can see the love and care the dev puts into this title and the progress is extreamly visible and tangilble.\n\n--------------\n\nAll in all I recommend this game to anyone that wants a in-depth sim expirances of what future space flight could verry well turn out to be like and wants to watch this game grow into something amazing!","May 16","true","1.9"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Every button is clickable and serves a purpose, and if done in the wrong order will cause system failures. The orbital dynamics are spot on.

I spent about 40 hours in it.\n\nIf you want realism, clickable cockpit controls, logical manuver methodologies, orbital mechaincs, in your space game - look no further. Docking manually in this sim feels like the great accomplishment it is. The cockpits remind me of a DCS study sim for a modern combat jet. This has the right to be called a simulation - There are many proceedures and contingences to memorize and perfect, and there is are few 'magic' sci-fi systems - it all seems plausable.\n\nThere is not a lot to do yet except run though the tutorials and practice docking, navagation and manuver in a limited system, but seeing the developers progress over the last period prior to Steam EA release, I believe he will deliver a great space sim.","May 18","true","0.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

As of now the content is light. But the basis of the simulator implemented enough to play around with and the dev has been publishing frequent updates for almost a year.

This style of game comes with a steep learning curve, but rewards players that take the time to understand the game. Rogue System has you pilot a ship with near unlimited access to the systems it has, you will balance cooling systems and manage power and feel like some kind of spacecraft god whilst doing so. For now, however, I'll talk about what the game is currently.\n\nIs it good?\nWell.. coming from a KSP and ArmA fan.. yes, the orbital mechanics are accurate and managing the ship is satisfying when you have the hang of it. All controls in the game are rebindable and I have no problem hooking up various controls to my X55 Hotas. But it is hard to think of more that the game has right now that is good. As it stands there are few missions to participate in with a sandbox *fly around and do whatever* being most of the story for now.\n\nSo it's bad?\nNot strictly speaking.. it's in a very early state which is another way of saying barely any missions, one work-in-progress ship and infrequent updates. Rogue System has solid foundations for a hardcore space sim but it'll be a long time in development before we see any kind of final release. Bugs are present and most of the game is still concept art. Which make it hard to get you to pay the £23 price tag.\n\nShould I buy it?\nAt this stage most likely no for most people. Rogue System will become a great sim if it does what it says it will at the end of the road, but if you want to buy this game to enjoy a space sim. Wait untill it's finished, however, If you want to support the developer in their endevaours then feel free to purchase. I will personally be upvoting this game, as I feel that it has great potential given time.","May 18","true","0.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As the developer notes, it's slim on playable content content as of the current early access release (May 2016), but this is largely due to the "from the ground up" style the developer is currently employing; most of the patch notes in the pre-Steam phase have involved underlying ship systems and mechanics fixes that will make for an unusually detailed simulation base to build upon.\n\nAfter following the development for over a year, I can assure any potential buyers that the developer is firmly committed for the long haul to producing a quality product. If you decide to purchase, you can hop right in and get a feel for the various ship subsystems and experience truly being in the cockpit of a space vessel, then join us in awaiting the content to come.","May 18","true","0.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I love the idea of the game; but what persuaded me to commit was my perception of the developer, Michael. His intent is to make a spaceship game with integrity, based on real world physics, and technology that can be scientifically plausible.\n\nHe goes the whole way--what can only be described as the hardcore way--ship systems with actual functionality, interactions and dependencies, in space that is correctly simulated with actual full Newtonian flight and orbital mechanics. You need to learn how to operate your ship and actually pilot it. This is not an arcade game, and I love it for that reason.\n\nThis is a "game" that I can take seriously, and that is a great achievement. For me, it goes beyond fun. It gives me a satisfaction and enjoyment that only a hardcore spaceship game can bring; and I love it more for that reason.\n\nThis is early access and it is feature light at the moment I am writing this. Seeing how this game has developed, and is developing, I am totally looking forward to the finished Core Module and then the later Expansion Modules.\n\nI can only recommend this game to you. If you want to play a game that is unique, sets a very high standard for realistic space flight, and models spaceships with unrivalled functionality, then Rogue System is the game for you.","May 25","true","10.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

A lot of the foundation work is in, but there isn't too much as of this writing in the typical "gameplay" sense as the dev is still obviously in very early access stages.

Took about 6 hours. I enjoy these kinds of simulations, and honestly found this game to be quite amazing. I also play “Space Shuttle Mission Simulator” which has a similar complexity feel to it. Love the control panel look, find the space view graphics to be extremely good. Even in its early access state, the game is well worth the cost and I can't wait to see more content. This game seems to be EXTREAMLY stable, so my hats off to the developers for creating a complex game with amazing stability. Other Simulation game companies can learn a lesson from this one, for other game companies haven't obtained this kind of stability.\n\nSmall changes that would be cool are actual voice acting within the comms system. Buttons that "FLASH" to grab your attention. Looks like auto docking is already being considered. Maybe a “point and click” navigation map system. Problem is, if you automate too much, it will lose some of its realism, however, as a casual play mode, may be neat to have. It would also be pretty amazing to be able to travel a real world map of planets and objects. Perhaps docking with the ISS, traveling to mars to view real world visuals, etc.\n\nAnyway, awesome game.

Personally I love it development is slow but heading in the direction I want it to head in consistently. The dev doesn't change direction every five minutes but is quick to respond to issues while continually fleshing out the game and sim aspects of Rogue System.\nIf you like Orbiter Sim this is for you. If you like Kerbal Space Program but want something a bit more simulation focused then this is for you. If you like Elite Dangerous but want something more consistent and realistic (The NPC's will fly according to the same rules and using the same systems as the player) This is definitely for you. If you just want pew pew then maybe wait until it is a bit further down the line or get it now to make sure it gets there.\nI am hoping this game gets the exposure it deserves. I love it.

If Aurora 4x is space simulation's Dwarf Fortress then Rogue System is Space Simulation's Elite Dangerous.\nI highly recommend it.","May 19","true","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't be intimidated: Run through the power-up tutorial once or twice and you can pretty much do it from memory in about 5 mins.\n\nI usually go into early access games to get in early.  I purchased Rogue System early access because I wish to actively support these kinds of ideas.","May 28","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It boasts the complexity of hardcore flight simulators with the orbital dynamics of Kerbal Space Program. Simply turning on your spaceship feels like an accomplishment. I highly recommend this to any hardcore sim fans who are looking for an interesting space game.","June 4","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead you get a half complete gunless/bad looking ship. Apparently these have been put back to the drawing table due to a change. (this was a terribly terrible idea to release it on steam in such a state).\n\nI bought it instantly after seeing it was on steam since I remember seeing footage of people playing it.\n\nDon't do that.\n\nInstead wait until more of the game is released for everyones sake instead of encouraging this forever alpha trend in gaming.","June 5","false","2.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","9"
