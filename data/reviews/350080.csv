"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/350080/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","There's really not much to say here, but there's enough to bother writing a review. Ultimately, if you liked The New Order, you'll probably like this too, because it's basically the same formula, hence being a standalone expansion. If you didn't like The New Order, there's not a lot here to change your mind. If you don't know what Wolfenstein is at all (what are you, some kind of commie?), here's the scoop: You kill Nazis. Lots of Nazis. So many Nazis that there's a point in the game where Winston Churchill himself rises from his wheelchair, clad with sciencey robot legs, and goes "Damn, son, that's a lot of Nazis". That doesn't actually happen (or at least I'm assuming it doesn't; if it does then screw Machine Games for stealing my idea before I thought of it, and I'm sorry for the spoilers), I'm just giving Machine Games ideas for the next Wolfenstein. The Churchill part, not the Nazis part. You really do kill a lot of Nazis. You can sneak past them, you can gun them all down, nobody really cares as long as you kill them all, and pick up some gold along the way because Nazis are well known for hiding their gold in sewer grates in their prison facilities.\n\nSo what's the problem, then? That sounds great - how could any red blooded freedom fighter not like it? Well, the big issue is ID Tech 5. The thing about ID Tech 5 is that it was a fantastic concept for its time, allowing the underpowered PS3 and 360 to have decent looking textures by streaming them from massive single texture files with the idea that they could have unique textures for everything using that, instead of just repeating textures. For console owners, this meant RAGE was one of the better looking games on those platforms. The problem is, PC owners never had an issue with that, and even at the time of release of RAGE most games had generally better texture quality, because the megatexture approach ultimately means a sacrifice of quantity over quality for the sake of keeping file sizes down (not that it does much, since even this game is a whopping 30+ GB).\n\nWhat this means for The Old Blood is that while the game is perfectly capable of producing beautiful graphics when it's in control of the situation, the moment you start looking around and admiring the scenery you start running into things like this, even on the highest possible settings. http://imgur.com/a/TqWFA Now, these aren't necessarily "bad" textures, they're just underwhelming, and they ultimately completely undermine the purpose of megatextures. The idea is presumably that since everything looks "unique", there's more incentive to look around and admire the scenery due to the added realism. But what's the point if everything you see when you go off the beaten path just looks like it's still using textures that were taken from Doom 3? Nevermind the fact that if you play this game in the stealthy way you inevitably end up spending a lot of time hiding behind walls, giving you plenty of time to notice just how crummy they look (and in the third screenshot with the switchbox, you're frequently forced to stand there in a fixed viewpoint holding the Use key until the door activates, forcing you to look at those textures no matter how you choose to play the game).\n\nAnd despite the fact that the textures are so underwhelming, the game still has pretty bad performance issues, with people with GTX 970s and high-power processors struggling to meet 60 FPS (which the game is capped at, due to engine limits, from what I'm aware of - which is still rather silly since there are plenty of other engines that go well past made both before and after ID Tech 5). I personally manage around 40-60 FPS most of the time on a GTX 970 and an i5 3570k OC'd to 4.4 GHz with the game running at the highest settings (pushed a little further, since for some reason even setting the game to Ultra doesn't fully activate some of the graphical functions), which is passable, but doesn't really seem necessary. Ultimately, the graphics in this game aren't anything that couldn't be done more or less in an engine like Unreal 3 or 4 with double the performance, and ID Tech 5 just seems like a total waste that's only still being used because they don't want to admit what a failure it is. Now that we've entered the PS4 and the Xbone generation, these textures aren't even that spectacular by console standards. I don't know what engine I would recommend instead, but anything but ID Tech 5 would be fine by me.\n\nIn the end, this isn't a negative review, it's more of a rant. The game is still just as fun as it was in The New Order, and if you have the PC to handle it I would absolutely recommend it. But I really, really hate ID Tech 5 and I want it to die. It was awful in RAGE, it was awful in The Evil Within, it was awful in The New Order, and now it's still awful in The Old Blood.","May 5, 2015","true","11.9"," 439 of 496 people (89%) found this review helpful 166 people found this review funny","89","439","496","166","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/350080/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is an adventure FPS game, developed by MachineGames, and then published by Bethesda. This game was released in early 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. It was released as a standalone expansion pack for Wolfenstein: The New Order, which was released in 2014.\n\nYou play the role of a war veteran by the name of Blazkowicz, also known as B.J.  The game play has almost no changes from the New Order. You play through the game in the first person perspective, as you navigate through levels of Nazi bases, compounds and castles. As with The New Order, you have a health monitor, and armour monitors. You are able to increase these beyond their "Maximum" capacity by going into "Overload" mode, by collecting armour scraps and health packs which are scattered around all of the levels.\n\nThe Old Blood includes all of the weapons found in the first game, and the return of your trusty pipe. I really enjoyed that this game allows you to take a stealthy approach to a few of the levels if you so desired to; although that's not usually the Wolfenstein way. The badass mechanic of being able to dual wield certain weapons makes a return too, I just love carrying around two assault rifles, there is literally nothing more daunting than that for an enemy I can imagine.  Also as with the New Order, as you progress through the game you will unlock perks as rewards for completing certain challenges, for instance one of the challenges requires you to kill a specific amount of enemies with your assault rifle, once you do, you are rewarded with being able to carry more ammunition for the weapon, I find this to be a really interesting way of being able to upgrade your character without leaving the player to have to do it themselves - and also encourages the player to maybe change their play style a little bit too.\n\nThe graphics in The Old Blood are identical to The New Order, it's made in the same engine, and the realistic graphics are stunning, sadly though, we still have the same problems with texture poppins. All of the enemy soldiers are really nicely designed; the lighting is perfect throughout the whole game.\n\nThe story is a prequel to The New Order, you are sent on a mission to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein to obtain a document which has the location of General Wilhelm in it. You meet some intriguing characters along the way; one of my favorites would have to be the German brute, Rudi. This game sets up The New Order if you want to play them chronologically, but really I still felt the full effect of the story playing them in the order that they were released.  There is also an element of decision making in some of the scenes too; the games gives you choices as to who lives and who survives as you progress further - something which a lot of FPS games miss.\n\nThe Old Blood is fully voice acted with the same actors as the original game; you cannot fault any of it, it's just very well done. It was a little bit of a shame when doing a stealth mission that enemy guards don't really pay any attention to any noise you make when moving around though.\n\nI found the game to be pretty easy when playing on the medium settings; the hardest level I found to get past, would have to be level one, there is a huge amount of stealth involved, and you have to time everything perfectly or else you just get wrecked. I was quite surprised that they started out on such a high difficulty, but once you get past that level, there isn't any real tough parts to the game, the gun play is simple to get a hang of, and you'll be slaughtering Nazi’s with ease by the last levels.  However, there are options to ramp up the difficulty to absurd amounts, something which people may want to try out if they are FPS veterans.\n\nAll of the levels in The Old Blood have various ways of traversing and progressing throughout. There are also a large amount of collectibles to find, and plenty of documents, letters, and other little bits of interactive items to discover which adds another level of story and lore to the game. I was also happy to see a couple of Easter eggs included in the game too. You are able to explore pretty much everywhere on most levels, and there is reason to, whether it be for the above mentioned collectables, extra ammo or health packs (because you WILL need them).\n\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood only took me just under four hours to complete; granted this is a standalone expansion; and isn't actually priced as a full release title, I was still a little unhappy that it was only four hours long. However, there is a lot of replay ability in the fact that you can ramp up the difficulty; and you may even just want to start the game on a higher difficulty since you can always drop it down should you start hitting a brick wall - that may well get you another few hours out of it; and also if you start hunting for the achievements and collectables, you may be able to get around ten hours of content from this game.\n\nI had no major technical problems, but even my rig was not able to churn out this game on full settings on a 4k resolution. I dropped it down to 1080 and stuck the settings on full and was able to get a steady 60 FPS most of the time. There were moments where it dropped to around 50 fps in some scenes, however this is to be expected with the quality of graphics and how much it had to render such as water/underwater scenes.  There are a few guides online as to how configure the settings to get the best graphical display in comparison with performance which you should check out, since this game is a demanding one on your rigs.\n\nTo sum up, I had a lot of fun whilst playing The Old Blood; it does a lot of things right, much like The New Order and I really cannot wait to see what this series has next. The only downside I feel was the length of the story, so if you can pick this game up on sale, you have a real must buy, however I am still going to recommend it because it is just more of the same good stuff from the previous game. FPS fans should not miss out on this series reboot.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/350080/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","The Old Blood is a standalone title that is a prequel to the 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order. It can be considered by some an "expansion pack", but the DL size alone (almost 40 GB)  and fair length for its price point makes it a worthwhile purchase, especially if you enjoyed The New Order. If you're reading this and haven't played TNO, it's perfectly fine to play this first. There are no repeat levels from New Order and its an entirely new experience.\n\nOn the 3rd highest difficulty (out of 5), it took me 7 hours to complete the main campaign. I did not find all the collectibles, have not touched a challenge mode, and did not complete all Nightmare levels. I reckon I can get 10-20 hours out of this game and even longer if I decide to play on "Uber".\n\nPros:\n+ More New Order style gameplay.\n+ Challenge mode adds replayability.\n+ Technologically  and artistically sound. Graphics, sound, voice acting, music, are all well done.\n+ Nightmare levels are a great homage to the roots of the series.\n+ Level design is smart and encourages exploration.\n+ Stealth mechanics allow more options than just guns blazing.\n+ A fair challenge. Excellent FPS mechanics.\n+ Memorable characters.\n\nCons:\n- Enemies are samey.\n- While the stealth approach options are welcome, it lacks some fine tuning.\n- End boss is kind of cliche and an annoying fight, not b/c of challenge, stylistically speaking.\n\nIf you have not played/do not own The New Order, I would recommend picking this up in a package deal along with it. TNO is in my top 3 games of 2014 and while I can't see myself ranking this that high for 2015, its a great additional chapter to that story.\n","May 8, 2015","true","7.2"," 132 of 140 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","132","140","6","2"

Both episodes call back to previous Wolfenstein titles, with episode 1 being a one-man assault on Castle Wolfenstein, and episode 2 dipping back into the more occult side of the Wolfenstein series (Nazi Zombies).\n\nIt pains me to say that it ultimately feels like a bit of a step back from Wolfenstein: The New Order - sporting a less remarkable cast of heroes and villains, as well as a lack of interesting locales. Pacing at the start of the game also feels very off, putting a pretty big emphasis on stealth (far from the game's strong suit). If you can look past these points however, the game still offers tons of enjoyment in terms of Nazi-dismemberment and crazy suicidal dual-wielding gun-play.\n\nThe value proposition is also sound. My full playthrough lasted just under 6 hours (attaining about 50% of the collectables). Not bad for a £15/$20 game.\n\nIf you enjoyed The New Order, I can recommend it solely on the appeal of it's gameplay - but if you're new to Machine Game's vision of Wolfenstein, go with The New Order over The Old Blood.","May 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 85 of 101 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","85","101","9","6"

They're awesome.\n\nSo far, the story isn't quite as character-driven as the first game, and there's a stealth section that gets a bit repetitive early on, but once it's over, things get awesome.

If you have, The Old Blood can be summed up with a very large “yes, but” tag attached. Are the stealth sections serviceable? Yes, but they get tedious. Is the game good at making you hate the major antagonists? Yes, but they could have used a bit more characterization. What about liking your allies? Yes, but they're very underdeveloped, save for some letters and notes scattered about. Are the nightmare levels worth your time? Yes, but they drag on a bit too long and are devoid of entertainment after a while.\n\nIs the game good?\n\nYes, but there are far more flaws than The New Order.\n\nYou can read the full review here.[www.pixeljudge.com]","May 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 62 of 81 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","62","81","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Albatross8/recommended/350080/","Albatross8","¿Albatrossing?","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Albatross8/","1343 products in account","Similar to other standalone DLC, such as Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, The Old Blood offers the enjoyment of the original game in a smaller, cheaper, and slightly varied package. This game acts as a prequel to The New Order but it isn't necessary to play it before playing this game. The game is neatly split into 2 parts each with different locales and enemies. The second part especially changes how the game is played when more supernatural elements traditional to Wolfenstein come into play. The graphics are great to look at and the attention to detail is some of the smaller things like item placement and character attributes make the game for enjoyable to play through.\n\nThe game looks great and functions well in shooting mechanics that feel like you are causing mass destruction. The game helps this process by creating a lot of gore whenever you shoot someone with a truly destructive gun. Limbs go flying when you use shotguns and nothing is quite as satisfying as getting headshots with precision. There is also stealth elements that allow you to sneak past enemies and use silenced weapons or melee takedowns. Stealth is functional but nothing too amazing to preach about. The AI that makes the enemy soldiers tough to fight against doesn't apply in stealth and makes it a breeze to just headshot anyone even marginally in your way. Stealth is also skippable and not enforced at all, though it is encouraged at some points when you are up against supersoldiers with tons of armor. Overall I had fun with the gameplay and it is solid all around.\n\nI was able to buy this game for $4 from Green Man Gaming and based on my playtime and experiences I definitely reccommend The Old Blood for that price. It offers some of what made The New Order so great with some slight changes at a cheaper price. Even for a DLC pack it still took me 9 hours to beat the game on the hardest difficulty(which only added around an extra hour of retrying) so overall this game is a great deal for anyone looking into getting a shooter that also includes some light stealth elements. At $20 full price it may be a tougher buy but if this game ever goes on sale it is a must buy for any lovers of shooters.","July 20, 2015","true","11.8"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","35","38","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/350080/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Wolfenstein series has delivered some pretty impressive shooter experiences over the years, but in recent times, things haven't gone so well for the franchise, as it's swapped developers multiple times. As such, many people didn't have big expectations when Wolfenstein: The New Order arrived last year from rookie studio MachineGames and publisher Bethesda. Fortunately, the two companies managed to surpass even the wildest expectations by delivering a pretty amazing shooter experience.Instead of adding any new story chapters through DLC, MachineGames decided to bring forth a standalone expansion that acts as a sort of prologue to the events in The New Order. That new experience called Wolfenstein: The Old Blood  brings fresh adventures for protagonist BJ Blazkowicz, while offering new enemies, weapons, and more.\nWolfenstein: The New Order kicked off with a suicide mission against General Deathshead's compound, and then quickly moves forward in time, chronicling the victory of the Nazis after World War 2 and BJ Blazkowicz's crusade against them.\nThe Old Blood focuses on his adventures before the actual start of The New Order, as Blazkowicz went through quite a few interesting moments while trying to find the location of General Deathshead's castle. What's more, those adventures take BJ to the actual Castle Wolfenstein, while searching for information, and then to a few interesting German villages.Through the two main parts of the story campaign, which are split into eight total chapters, players can learn a bit more about BJ but also about the other leaders of the German military besides The New Order's Deathshead.There are quite a few interesting moments in terms of plot but its rapid pace makes relating to some of the other characters a bit hard to do. Even so, you're in for a good story that explores the universe even more.\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood keeps the solid shooter mechanics from The New Order, sporting an old-school, fast-paced movement system as well as responsive weapons that feel awesome to use. Some weapons make a return from The New Order, including the solid assault rifle or the quite potent pistol, but there's plenty of new gear that can be used by BJ to trim down the Nazi horde. One of the first things you get to try out is a versatile pipe that can be used as a single, long component, or be split into two and used to scale walls. This mechanic is used fairly often, and while it takes a bit of time to get used to its control system, it soon becomes second nature.\nThere's a powerful gun that fires explosive flares, a new bolt-action rifle, as well as a pretty powerful shotgun-like shrapnel hammer. What's more, most of the game's weapons can be dual-wielded. Towards the end of the campaign, you also get to use a very impressive sawed-off shotgun, which makes getting rid of the new enemies even more satisfying.\nSpeaking of opponents, while you'll mostly be mowing down regular soldiers, there are a few new types of foes, including prototype versions of the hulking cyborgs seen in The New Order as well as the special surprise from the game's end - Nazi Zombies. These undead are quite powerful, and while some will just shamble around, others will rush BJ, so make sure you have places to fall back to.\nLevels are quite varied, and while some areas might feel like rehashes of previous zones, especially towards the beginning, when you're making your way through the Wolfenstein prison, you'll soon reach some impressive environments, from cable car stations to the interior of Castle Wolfenstein, or a burning, zombie-infested German villages.\nWhile the game in general makes a pretty solid showing, there are some stages where it's unclear what exactly you have to do or where it's quite hard to sneak through without alerting guards. These moments aren't that numerous, but they do keep it from perfection.\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood looks very good and uses the solid engine from The New Order to bring detailed environments, great character models, as well as fluid animations. The Nazi Zombies in particular look quite spooky and the flames engulfing most of them are well done.\nThe soundtrack is quite good but doesn't stand out all that much. Even so, the voice acting makes up for this, as BJ sounds as stoic as ever, whereas the rest of the cast brings a bit more humanity. Special mention goes to some of the hilarious dialog between the Nazi guards, as well as the taunts from boss enemies like Rudi Jager.\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood is a great follow-up to The New Order, adding plenty of adventures for BJ, not to mention new enemies, weapons, and more.","August 23, 2015","true","139.1"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","35","38","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndriOdPanda/recommended/350080/","AndriOdPanda","AndriOdPanda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndriOdPanda/","436 products in account","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood’s narrative beats deserve a look in their own right, but not before the glue that holds them together is given its time to shine: the shooting. First-person shooters can exhibit a narrative deeper than Mariana Trench only to struggle beneath the tide due to weak systems for putting holes into the various limbs of your enemies. What Machine Games have managed to do here though is perfectly graft the art of turning Nazi opponents into a concert of puncture wounds from The New Order with a sprinkle of fresh death-dealing actions.\n\nRunning down the corridors of Castle Wolfenstein, blowing chunks out of wall and Nazi alike is a hoot in a hand-basket. Hours upon hours could be wasted detailing exactly how the art of riddling opponents with bullet after bullet is so enjoyable in Wolfenstein: The Old Blood but doing so would rob you of experiencing it yourself. Suffice to say that every round that hits or misses feels like it is doing so fairly, never becoming a tiresome slog even as the majority of the game is spent with your finger holding down the trigger.\n\nOr triggers if you’re a fan of dual-wielding monstrous assault rifles. If you aren’t, there are still enough weapons in The Old Blood to keep you entertained with the high caliber Bombenschuss and explosive Kampfpistole offering a more traditional shooting experience. Where proceedings slow down, however, come when you’re bereft of ranged weaponry and forced to use melee weapons and stealth to succeed. It’s not that these sections are inherently poor or anything, it is simply a little jarring to be thrust away from the fun of shooting with sneaking sections.\n\nThese silent approach areas are actually quite good fun on their own. New mechanics like the melee pipe, itself used for other actions like climbing or opening specific access ways, numerous power generators bring a fresh if unwanted aroma to events. However, while clambering up walls using an old piece of plumbing stays strong throughout the game, the intriguing arrival of super soldiers hooked up to electrical systems to keep them active becomes a fleeting memory after the initial stage. The game’s most interesting new mechanic then only returns at the very end, feeling more like a throwback to forgotten times than the intelligent use of a head-scratching foe.\n\nAs games have taught us since the beginning of time, combat should always come to an explosive crescendo in boss battles. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood however has been built otherwise. They are there, one at the game’s midpoint and one coming in for the final curtain, but their quality is far from consistent. Your first locking of horns with a boss is a difficult encounter where spacial awareness and effective movement are just as important as a good aim. The second is less so, leaving a bitter taste in the mouth with a combat situation that’s more suited to Borderlands or Diablo than the pseudo-historical Wolfenstein universe.\n\nThat’s not to say that Wolfenstein: The Old Blood fumbles massively in its closing hours. If anything, the final act feels absolutely perfect after chasing down the SS’s Paranormal Investigation team. We’re not going to spoil what actually happens here but it’s a bundle of fun wrapped up in excellent shooting mechanics. The latter chapters actually show that Machine Games aren’t afraid to focus on the fun rather than the fact. All through Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, the onus is placed on stretching a semi-psychotic grin over your face and not on creating a deep or thought provoking experience.\n\nIt’s not that this intention devalues the surrounding narrative, far from it in fact. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood’s tale grabs you by the throat and will not let go, dragging you by the neck through some joyous battles only to drop you on a somewhat unsatisfying ending after 6-8 hours. B.J. Blazkowicz has long been gaming’s most one-dimensional character after being presented to us only as a face way back at his first appearance. However in only a few hours, The Old Blood manages to help build the foundation for a character you care about more than in many other franchises.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the outwardly short-sounding time-frame though, as it actually helps the game more than hinders it. Nothing ever hangs around long enough to feel laborious or overused. Those strong-arming stealth sections can be tiresome on their own, but you always know that just around the corner is a chaotic dance of bullet-infused excitement. Often the combat arenas that show themselves in Castle Wolfenstein can become nothing more than shooting grey shapes in a grey environment filled with grey smoke. Aesthetically pleasing grey, but grey shapes all the same.\n\nSadly it isn’t all singing and killing through. Great segments frequently come across as rushed while the corridors joining them together feel like the same ones you’ve walked down before. B.J. ends almost every chapter by being knocked out with falling rock ex machina, leaving you with the sour taste of a severely overused mechanic to end sections. It’s actually funny when you think about it after completing the game, just a shame that this humor doesn’t come across as you’re enduring it again and again.\n\nThe PC version of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood isn’t exactly a shining beacon for quality either. It’s entirely possible to get the game running beautifully, just at the expense of some extra work in the background. The texture streaming system used falters as often as it succeeds in presenting a good-looking game. Terrible vertical sync issues also plague the game, often leading to scurrying through information posted online about this game’s bigger brother in order to get everything working.\n\nSounds and conversations regularly miss the mark on even the highest specification systems out there without you having to take to fixing it yourself. Everyone should be able to enjoy Wolfenstein: The Old Blood the way it was meant to be played, rather than the need to enter the developer console or creating your own cache folder for the game. Even when the sounds all sync up properly, the weapons’ fire often feels like it’s got the resounding strength of a sneezing shrew. Odd really when the gun in your hand fires rounds bigger than most rodents.\n\nAll in all even with these issues, The Old Blood is a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. If you run through the whole game in a single 6 hour sitting, prepare to be shunted into what is at its core an Indiana Jones movie, but replacing Indy’s trademark bullwhip/fedora combo with a pair of automatic shotguns and cybernetic Rottweilers. Machine Games broke the mold when they brought Wolfenstein: The New Order into the world to be one of last year’s surprise hits, or so we thought. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood proves that a little new blood is what was needed to keep the Wolfenstein series alive for many years to come.\n\nPros\n\n[+] Rip-roaring shooting\n[+] Utterly gorgeous\n[+] Perfectly paced for the most part\n\nCons\n\n[-] Technical issues plague some locations\n[-] Ends abruptly\n\nFinal Score 6.5 out of 10","May 7, 2015","true","8.0"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","46","56","3","1"

If you never picked up The New Order, this is a cheap alternative as well as a prequel to decide if you wish to buy the main game. Keep in mind that this review might contain minor spoilers\n\nThe Old Blood is definitely worth the 20 dollars on the steam shop (depending on where you live of course, i refused to pay $40 AUD so i got it somewhere else)\n\nThis Standalone Expansion/DLC is what companies should be doing instead of this stupid 3 maps or season pass setups and I'm glad that Machine games brought this system back.\n\nThe old Blood is 8 Chapters long, shorter than the main campaign of course but for 20 dollars its definitely worth it. While you don't get all the futuristic weaponry of the new order like the assault rifle combined with rockets, there are still a variety of weapons that make the game seem a little bit fresh. A useful addition is a rusty old pipe which can be split into two parts so you can climb cracked walls and use it as a melee weapon in silent takedowns as well as a open up doors, keeping them open while slide running to get past heavy doors. Although i did prefer a knife it was a nice alternative for a melee weapon. Theres also the addition of a bolt action rifle and another huge shotgun that i suspect alot of people will come to love if they go the shoot first ask questions later play style over the stealth approach.\n\nYour enemies of course are the Nazis, which include a vicious Dog handler who seems to spend a little to much time with them to be a people person, a stuck up commander who only cares about results and a rude, wine loving historic researcher high in the Nazi ranks, what's not to love. Oh and like RTCW you get some of the more... Non-Conventional enemies.\n\nThe perk system is a back as well although there does seem to be a perk that can quickly annoy you if you keep holding the sprint button while trying to go backwards.\nThere are also the usual collectibles, letters, gold and concept art as well as information on characters which when you go hunting for them will definitely give you more time to enjoy the scenery while exploring the areas of Castle Wolfenstein and the village of Wulfburg, a historic city that seems to have its own dark secrets that the Nazis wish to uncover and use for their own agenda. Your job of course is to stop them, stepping into the shoes of one William "B.J." Blazkowicz\n\nIf there are people who have played The New Order you will recall a bed that would let you play the first level of Wolfenstein 3D. Well The Old Blood adds to that by adding the ENTIRE first episode in hidden locations, 1 for each chapter and you even get to vs. Hans Grosse! This is definitely a welcome addition although for some reason the music tracks of the games are randomized and the first levels track doesn't even seem to be there at all (it might be there but when I did every level I did not get it) and I was a little disappointed that the SS soldiers in the Wolfenstein 3D levels didn't scream Schutzstaffel! (protection squad!) and Mein Leben! (My Life!) when you killed them. Those words made them a memorable enemy for me and it was a shame I didn't get to hear them here.\n\nThere are a couple of down sides though as well as a bit of confusion. A little bit into the game there were these super soldiers connected to electric generators hooked up on pipes that would deliver electricity to their battery packs. They only appear in this one area and then disappear till the last chapter which they really could have made more use for in later chapters. The confusing bit is that of the identity of your starting companion. Wesley. Now this could be a nod to agent one from RTCW and is a different character or he somehow (and there should be no way that he did) survived his electrocution in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. I believe that this game comes after the events of RTCW or 2009 chronologically. Kind of confuses you there but you can check the timeline on the Wiki page if you wish (although no confirmation as of yet).\nThe ending did feel a little underwhelming but did an alright job connecting the game to the new order.\n\nYou also do need to make another choice but the only thing this seems to affect is the concept art you get in a specific chapter.\n\nFinally there are challenges you unlock after getting to specific areas of a chapter which you can choose the difficulty for and will give medals depending on how well you did.\n\n\nI personally didn't have any issues with the game crashing, locking up causing any kind of problem with my PC. The game was easy to alt-tab out and in with no lag or frame loss whatsoever and automatically paused when you did so if you did hit that combination accidently you wouldn't just die offscreen. If you are sick of all these military like shooters coming out nearly every year these days. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a perfect choice to get off that road and try something different.\n\nI give this game a 9/10.","May 8, 2015","true","11.6"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","32","36","4","2"

It is very hard to get completely lost.\nWhile this might not be for everyone, the story is still amazing and with every chapter you just want to see more of what happens next.\nThe last chapter or two felt a little rushed to me from the story line perspective and I feel another 1 or 2 chapters could have been added to flesh out some of the characters you meet a little more.\n\nThe voice acting and atmosphere in this game is very well done and for me it was quite easy to get invested into the characters that fight on your side as well as wanting to know more about the bad guys in charge.\nHelga and Rudi are one example of great characters I enjoyed reading up the lore on.\nThroughout the game you find notes, diary entries or letters from main main good/bad characters or just some random soldiers/people, each containing interesting information, adding to the lore of the game, giving it more character with each note.\n\nYou are equipped with your standard silencer mounted pistol, a sweet machine gun and find a few more power guns along the way. You can dual equip your weapons for greater impact but make sure to keep an eye on your ammunition at all times.\nThough ammo is plenty and as along as you use the right gun for the right job you should not have many issues.\n\nEvery chapter can be played, either head-on fire fight or stealthed through, with the exception of the mandatory shootouts off course.\nEnemies are plenty and while there is not a huge amount of different enemy types, each special can be dealt easily ones you know their weakness.\nThroughout the game, when completing chapters you unlock some areas of the game as Challenge Mode playable arenas.\nThis adds great fun and a great way to allow you to kill more bad guys on demand :)\nPlaying an area in Challenge mode locks you into parts of a previous played map, arena style, in which you get rewarded with points for successfully rampaging through waves of different enemies.\n\nOverall the game was great fun to play and even though it took me, as a FPS noob, close to an hour to take down the final boss in the end it never got to frustrating to not wanting to continue.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys FPS games, the Wolfenstein franchise or simply enjoys shooting their way through waves of Nazi super soldiers.\n\nIf you read all this and want to know/see more you can watch my playthrough here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFasAOzXvCE&list=PLpd5HpREizQ3y5K2Dzz94ZJgshjDpi0mK","May 25, 2015","true","16.8"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","35","42","2","0"

All kinds of Nazis to kill from electro mutant nazi's, old school pixel nazis, and even grammer Nazi's.  This game takes place before The New World Order so play Old Blood first since it leads right into TNO as the cool kids say.  Awesome story with great voice acting really makes the game feel alive compared to other games.  Price is right for this budget game that is 6 chapters long which can last 6-8 hours on first playthrough.\n\nThe graphics are good?  Ended that with a question mark because this game has the same fatal flaw as doom, no flashlight to see anything.  Not sure why they spent so much time upping the graphics when most of the game is dark as in cant see anything, or everything is grey, theres really no variety of color at all.  Seems the artist chose one pallet of colors and used it for the whole game which makes even great graphics very boring to look at.   There also isnt any music which is odd, makes the game really feel dead and less fun without colors and music.\n\nThere are zombies in this one, nazi zombies, but their nothing special since only a few appear on the screen at the time.  These Romero zombies go down with one shot to the head too making them even less challenging.  Has anyone seen a zombie movie?  One zombie is not to scary but tons are, and this game only has a couple on the screen at a time.  Making it easier is you are BJ Blazkowitz with grenade launchers dual machine guns, the zombies stand no chance against that arsenal so its not very fun, its just to easy.\n\nStory is solid with 5 levels from classic wolfenstein mixed in with this game.  There is a timeline to the game or Wolf Cannon, the Helga in this game is different Helga than in RTCW.  This is not a reboot of the series its all one timeline.  While Wolfenstein's roots are in the stealth genre this game features mostly stealth except for a few sections where the player can use the classic run n gun gameplay.  The stealth sections rely on a mechanic of taking out a commander, this can become repetitive which leaves this shooter without much diverse gameplay which can bore regular gamers leaving this title mostly for long time wolfenstein fans.  Oddly the game contains throwback gameplay to Wolf3d which features more action related gameplay because stealth slows it down, a lesson from then that seems to have been lost in this entry into the Wolfenstein franchise which over relies on stealth slowing down the game.\n\nRating:   7/10  Value:  $14.99\n*the Bundle containing TNO and Old Blood is worth the price at $45","May 7, 2015","true","55.1"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","30","39","2","2"

The best gunplay in many years, with cool new weapons (love the Bombenschuss) and more emphasis on melee with the pipe which got just a tiny intro in The New Order. Great combat scenarios are made even better with longer battles, more enemies, complex level design, more flanking possible by them, and when the zombies come then the dynamic changes where you can pit AI vs AI while you sit back. Even on the highest difficulty, enemies never feel like bullet sponges and there's always a quick solution to every big enemy.\n\nThe introduction of the challenge mode is something I've been wanting ever since I finished The New Order, because The New Order had excellent shooting mechanics and feel. It's awesome here because you get to play around with the multiple weapons and test your might on various difficulties while comparing your scores to friends or the world on leaderboards. Only thing that would be perfection like Mirror's Edge would be able to see how other players' runs went with a direct-to-Youtube situation or ghosts.\n\nThe game is absolutely hilarious from Blazko's commentary to Nazi conversations (graveyard talk in last chapter: "I liked Fritz. He made a very good strudel") to several memorable character moments ("you look like a BJ", Pippa's shirtless jokes, village drunkard). The Nazis are humanised even more here, like one Nazi crying about his wife in the tavern and another consoling him. There are enough poignant quotes in Blazko's narration, just like in The New Order. Even with a shorter length, all of the characters are interesting especially if you read all the notes which they'll acknowledge during gameplay rather than just a cheap way to fit more depth into the auxilliary stuff like in other games. Again, the women are great just like in The New Order here with Pippa, Annette, and Helga. I'll just say pay attention to anything about Annette. There's even a choice with two characters that changes the ending in a very cool way (you'll know when you get the "good" ending).\n\nIf there are criticisms, they're mostly down to this being made in 1 year so some of the types of locations are a bit too familiar like sewers, bridges, castles, and prisons. That's mostly chapter 1-3, after that with the cable cars, caves, and Wulfburg forwards, it gets more refreshing in the views and colour palette. I didn't particularly like the bridge cause it was too long-ranged of a fight and sticking behind cover, while I prefer to move around all the time.\n\nThis is the best expansion for a story-driven action adventure I've played since Alan Wake. The ending is really bittersweet, especially if you know what goes down in The New Order. Mick Gordon delivers the most epic and heartbreaking end credits song. FROM THE SHADOWS!!! ;_;\n\n(P.S.

It's not a bad choice; although the development in The New Order ran surprisingly deep for an FPS, sidelining character stories in The Old Blood gives you a solid block of game play rather than cut scenes and minor fetch quests.  It's a little unfortunate that, like The New Order, this game starts with a too-long quasi-tutorial sequence that wears out its welcome before allowing you to get into the meat of the game.  Happily, once you get invested in carrying around an arsenal and filling enemies with lead, you'll largely forget the earlier tedium of avoiding and depowering Nazi mech suits but it's a stumble the franchise has made twice now and I hate having to say "Just stay with it and it'll get better, I promise".\n\nThe game play is essentially the same as The New Order albeit with "earlier" technology with a bit of steampunk feel to it.  You have your usual silenced pistol, assault rifle, sniping tool, a fun twin-barrel mechanized shotgun and a new pistol that shoots explosive rounds for clearing out groups of grunts or hitting hard targets.  An abbreviated perk system allows you to expand your health & healing, armor, weapon ammo capacity and that sort of thing.  Often in the game you'll find yourself using a pair of pipes as a melee instrument, prying tool, climbing aid and more which feels a little gimmicky but not aggressively so.  Some people have complained that there isn't much of a stealth aspect but if I wanted a linear stealth game with assault rifles, I'd be playing Metro or something similar.  This is Wolfenstein and BJ Blazkowicz lives to kill Nazis, not creep around them.  Enemy AI is usually pretty sharp with opponents flanking, using grenades liberally to pull you out from cover, sliding and leaning from cover while they chip away at your own with an onslaught of bullets.  Later on the AI takes some hits when it throws new enemy types against you and the final boss fight wasn't anything great but, all in all, it was a solid ride.\n\nDo I recommend the game?  If you've played The New Order and enjoyed it then I recommend this one without reservation.  If you haven't, I'd really recommend waiting for TNO to go on sale and pick that up first.  It's a more rounded and longer, more comprehensive game whereas The Old Blood is made for people who ate the TNO main course and wanted dessert.","May 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

There is also challenges and collectables available so you can probably get a few more hours out of it if you wish.\n\nThe first levels in the castle is quite boring and repetitive, but once you get out of there the game opens up a bit more. The story is alright. The voice acting is good and the cutscenes too. You can also listen to a lot of guards talking to get more backstory and read different letters and notes that are spread out through the levels.\n\nA lot of weapons that are fun to use.

The castle escape, the village, Kessler, Helga, the excavation, it's all there. I, for one, love that game, so it's interesting to replay sections of it as seen through the eyes of this modern adaptation-of-sorts. I've read a few complaints that the story isn't as good as The New Order, but The Old Blood is a completely different animal. I also find it indicative of consumer ingratitude when, after being gifted a game that manages to have a rare balance of great gameplay, action, and story, critics immediately get their claws out when the expansion doesn't have exactly that balance regurgitated again. That's not to say the game fails in it's story, but that I believe the intention behind it was different - The Old Blood is clearly self-aware of the genre it's throwing back to. How can B.J's grim musings and the emotional connection that the first game gave us fit into a game in which a character comments that B.J is wearing no clothes, and then seconds later we are made to watch B.J remove half a dozen weapons off his person one-by-one? This moment is the most tongue-in-cheek moment in the game, and the most telling as to what the intention behind it was. If you want a dark narrative that muses on the brutality and futility of war, look elsewhere.\n\nIt's a shorter game than The New Order, and gameplay-wise it's a return to a much more traditional action-oriented format; you'll be thrust into large rooms or open spaces with no exit until you eliminate all the bad guys that come pouring out, and the gameplay favours player-mobility as well as a quick trigger-finger. There's also many secret areas, including playable Wolf3D levels in each level of the game.\n\nIn saying all that about the run-and-gun appraoch, the wonderfully flexible combat system of The New Order returns, and realistically you could play most of the game in stealth if the desire took you. I found that the maps were built to offer a higher level of difficulty when it came to the stealth approach - the guards cross paths more frequently, making eliminating them more difficult, and there are tonnes of commanders waiting around to call an alarm should anyone spot a corpse - so I found myself having to retry different tactics multiple times to find a method that worked. I liked this, and felt that I was unravelling a puzzle every time I managed a successful stealth run.\n\nBut this game really thrives under a guns-blazing approach - there are a few new weapons, new perks, and new enemies, that all beg you to go loud and let chaos reign. Explosions rip through the air, enemy body parts disappear in a pink mist, and if you turn your sound up, the guns thump and pound in a satisfying fashion.\n\nWhereas The New Order felt like wonderful blend of old and new, this leans more on the 'old' end, and I don't in any way mean that as a criticism. The Old Blood is a chance to get the adrenaline racing, rewarding players who like to move fast, hold their finger on the trigger and grind their enemies into powder, in other words, it plays like a classic ID game. I've read no confirmation that this was the intention of the developers, but the experience is uncanny, and if you grew up on shooters in the late 90s/early 2000s, it's a really satisfying nostalgia trip. The best part about it is that it's wrapped so competantly in a glorious HD package, that it doesn't feel like it's thrusting the nostalgia in your face, and it never feels like a one-trick-pony. It's a relatively short game, the term 'standalone' should alert you to the fact it is an expansion pack, but it's a solid game and a wonderful throwback that's worth the price, especially if you can get it on sale.","February 7","true","6.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/350080/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","*This review was written when the game was priced at $4.99\n\nMuch has been said about how New Order is a return to old school shooter greatness or is, at the very least, ushering it in, and while I wouldn't say that it's a pretender to the throne, based on what I've played of Old Blood, this series is far closer to an interim king until the real deal comes along.\n\nWolfenstein has been rebooted before, surprisingly both times hitting their marks in 2001 and 2009 respectively, but never has it been done before without id's involvement. I mean sure, it uses an id engine, but the company logo is nowhere to be found on retail boxes or store descriptions. This is without question a Bethesda and Machineworks baby, but unlike when Bethesda usually slaps their less than pristine name on IP's they purchased and act like they created something, they actually earned the right to do it here.\n\nOld Blood is a prequel to New Order, seeming to reference very little about NO as far as I've found. The story here is a basic "kill dem gnatzies", with your antagonists as a bunch of Hans Landa copycats providing "tension filled" moments which just remind me again to watch Inglorious Basterds more than anything. Not that what the developers are doing is bad or anything. It's framed well and is borderline spectacular in its production design when it comes to voice acting, animations, the way the camera moves, etc\n\nIt's just that I rarely get enough time to spend with the characters for me to care or even remember their names, but that no doubt comes from the games production and general goal of being a low priced budget shooter that still has an "engaging enough" story, where they have to get you to move along to the next skit, pushing you from set piece to set piece. It works and rarely gets in your way in its storytelling outside of the opening forced stealth stuff, where contextually, it makes sense, but it still kind of sucks to be forced to play it as a stealth game.\n\nIt's a shooter though. Who cares about the story? The meat and potatoes of it is that it's great and plays well and features the right weapons to compliment it. Dual wielding ridiculous weapons that nobody could realistically ever dual wield is great stuff, and if you ever wanted to see armless nazi's, headless nazi's, or hell, giblet nazi's, this is the best it's ever looked. Playing on the fourth hardest difficulty, UBER, the game was still lenient on the player rushing crowds, where I would just barely survive the encounter, but you'll seldom find yourself in a position without armor or health to juice yourself up back to full afterwards. The game never feels punishing to loose and headstrong playstyles as a result.\n\nThe problem is, that too many modern day shooter conventions have snuck in and have potentially ruined an actual classic in the genre. Why do I have to manually pick up ammo? Why am I grinding challenges to unlock perks? Why can I slide along the ground despite it never actually being more useful than just running and gets me killed more often than not? Why do I have to stop running to "run and gun"? Why can't health pick ups work automatically if I'm below a certain threshold instead of me having to take focus from the shooting and scrambling to hit E on something while I fumble around trying to not get killed by a huge robot? There's not a single good reason for any of this crap, and some of this stuff was THIS close to ruining this game - but where the game truly could have faltered was its implementation of stealth.\n\nMany games that have tried to include stealth before can range from boring to disastrous trash - Old Blood hits the right mark in that outside of the opening, you're never forced into doing stealth again. Stealth becomes an either/or. Either you do stealth or you don't and engage in the firefights you want to be engaging in. Nothing is better than taking the silencers off the lugers, then dual wielding them and going to town. What surprised me though was how well the game let's you play both ways. At one point, there was a section I didn't really want to have a shoot out in because it was disadvantageous to me in everyway, so I just stealthed it. Stealth is simple and not at all complicated, but best of all, it's there if you want to do it.\n\nThe only gameplay aspect that truly sucks are the dream sequences. They take place in old Wolfenstein 3D maps, and while they're well represented (minus the great sound effects of the original), they don't gel at all with how the game plays. You're far too slow in maps that are far too big, and don't get me started on when you get your hands on the mini gun. It's absolutely painfully slow and just overall terribly designed. I don't know what the hell they were thinking with this other than "HUR NOSTALGIA". Maybe it was to prove a point to Bethesda or gamers that want classic Wolfenstein. Other than that, it adds filler to a game that's a little emaciated but wears thin real fast.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game is built on id Tech 5, or as the damned know it, "the RAGE engine". At this point it's a little outdated, but it's a serviceable shooter engine at its heart. The problem is the megatextures nonsense that bloats this games size up to a point that never feels justified, in that it looks good, but it's never truly amazing that you think that this was worth the bump in the games file size, especially in regards to the games length. The textures look fine for the most part, it coming down more to design and style more than technical, with tin cans lacking that blurry text some games usually have, although rarely, a fuzzy looking texture will sneak its way in, but you usually have to go out of your way to find stuff like that.\n\nOverall though? Old Blood justifies the "stand alone" title it was advertised as. The game works by itself and features a standard modern day shooter length (6-8 hours) and does its best to not bore you and rarely ever feels like it's rehashing itself. So as a paid demo to not only see if your rig can run the far more pricey New Order well enough, but to also see if you'll even like it, I think it's a success.\n\nIt certainly made me want to play it.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+Top notch shooter gameplay\n\n+Stealth mechanics that never feel obtrusive\n\n+Great gore effects\n\n+Great setting, atmosphere and style\nThe Con's:\n-This has no business being 34gb\n\n-The dream sequences are a poorly implemented diversion\n\n-Modern shooter conventions conflict with old school design decisions","July 24, 2015","true","9.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

But will you want to see how things began ?\n\nWolfenstein The Old Blood takes place before the events of The New Order. We play as B.J Blazkowicz as we are tasked to go inside the Wolfenstein castle and retrieve a folder that holds the place where a nazi scientists holds experiments on people. But you get captured and it's up to you to escape.\n\nGameplay is identical to The New Order. Stealth play's a bigger role in the game than in New Order. There are more enemies you can't fight with gunfire and have to sneak past. The run and gun option is still available but it's not as fun as in The New Order. There are a few new weapons which are cool to use like the pipes, cause the executions can get pretty brutal. Overall the gameplay is identical to The New Order.\n\nGraphics are the same as in the new order. It still looks great, the lighting effects are amazing. The environments are big and open and all look very nice. The textures aren't the best, but the game still looks very good.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, it really play's well with the game. Some of the music is intense during the more intense firefights and it could get emotional during the cut scenes.\n\nThe game is pretty easy on the lower difficulties, but the higher ones will provide a bigger challenge and trust me they are very very hard. If you are not new to Wolfenstein you can try out normal, but if you want a real challenge then try out the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe game itself is pretty short, it took me 3 hours to finish the entire thing and like Wolfenstein there is a choice you can make that will change the outcome. Tons of collectibles, upgrades and secret Classic Wolfenstein levels you can find.\n\nThere isn't many bugs, the game runs very smoothly, maxed out I can get 60FPS  no problem.\n\nOverall this is a must own to any FPS game fan or even a Wolfenstein fan. The game is not as good as The New Order, but this is still a very good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/350080/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Rating - 84/100\nIn a sentence - As a much tighter-structured whole, this game is a must-buy for fans of The New Order, and should be on the shortlist for anyone who doesn't flat-out hate FPS games.\n\nMuch like Farcry Blood Dragon (which is also fantastic, if you haven't tried it yet), The Old Blood is a standalone expansion for its parent game. In this case, Wolfenstein: The New Order. Old Blood is a prequel story, so the 2 are only barely related, but I would still recommend playing New Order first, for a few reasons.\n\nTaken as a whole, Old Blood is an extremely solid experience. It moves along briskly, leads you where you need to go without being intrusive about it, the action is visceral and exciting, the weapons are satisfyingly familiar and all useful, the campaign is just about the perfect length (5-6 hours, plus unlockable leaderboard challenges to repeat later), and the story is a nice blend of lighthearted nazi-killing fun and the brutal horrors of war.\n\nThe story this time around is about BJ and his team sneaking into Castle Wolfenstein in order to get the location of Deathshead's compound (where New Order took place). Naturally, things don't go quite according to plan, and you have to fight even harder to get out than you did to get in. I'm not going to spoil anything, since the experience is the most important thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. It IS a 5-hour prequel game, though, so don't expect them to throw the canon on its head.\n\nThe graphics are about what you would expect if you played New Order, in that they are extremely similar. You'll be treking through shiny, gleaming nazi castles, dank and musty sewers, destroyed towns, and ancient ruins. All of the environments looks pretty, but I was disappointed to find very few stop-and-stare-in-awe moments like I had with Rage (another idTech5 game). The texture work here is a little lacking, as well. Characters look phenomenal, but the world is somewhat lackluster when you get up close. In a game where so much time is spent hiding in small corridors/rooms fighting and hiding from nazis, you start to notice it. Once again, though, these are small problems, and were the same with New Order. If you didn't mind it there, you certainly won't mind it here.\n\nOne thing that I don't remember being a problem with New Order, though, is performance issues. I had a lot of framerate issues here at 1080P that I don't have in other, prettier games at 4k. I also had this weird recurring problem where the game would run in slow-motion, and I'm not talking about low framerate or stuttering. The framerate never once dropped below 30fps, but every once in a while the game would slooooooow down, like someone just activated Max Payne's bullet time. Weapons would fire slower, enemies (and BJ) would move slower, and the environment would react slower. Turning off Adaptive VSync helped with that, but it introduced HORRIFIC screen tearing. Absolutely awful, unacceptable, I-don't-want-to-play-any-more screen tearing. If the performance had been maybe 20% worse, it would have been a serious problem for me, but I stuck with it. For reference, I have a QX9650 and a GTX980.\n\nThe sound and music in here are well-done, too. I wish the weapon sounds had a bit more weight to them (why do id games, more often than not, have guns that sound like toys?), and some of BJ's little under-his-breath aside moments feel shoehorned in, but all in all, sound and music lived up to the challenge. The music in the Wolf3D "nightmare" sequences gets tedious, but it's the original music, so send your complaints to Bobby Prince in '92.\n\nOh, speaking of the nightmare sequences, remember in New Order how awesome that little one-off easter egg of the best-known Wolf3D level felt? Well, now there are about 5 of them, and they're all really obscure, forgettable levels (other than the boss fight). You never have to do them, although there is an achievement for each one you complete. I'm not happy about them milking such a special concept, but you're never forced to do them, so I can't be too harsh. I did them all, but by the last one, I was simply sprinting to the exit.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely worth a play. The action is fast-paced and addictive, there are very few annoying segments (the forced stealth in the beginning was a big let-down), the game length is just about perfect, and there is replayability in the form of challenges. If you enjoyed New Order, you can't miss with this one. If you haven't played New Order yet, well then play them both, but do New Order first. It's the main course.","November 23, 2015","true","12.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Now those looking for the same storytelling from TNO, this game isn't going to bring it like it's predecessor. The writing, while still good,  isn't of the same quality. But the core gameplay is still a good mixture of run and gun action and stealth. Some of the additions that the game brings with the Challenge mode and more explosive weapons were definitely appreciated, and as a level pack overall, it's a good time. The aesthetic is there, and the feel for the overall game is pretty excellent overall. There's still a great amount of little touches that the game has, such as Doom easter eggs. When it comes down to it, if you wanted more gameplay like TNO, then The Old Blood does the job. It's not going to blow you away while doing it, but it's still worth the price of admission.\n\n\n\nLists:\n+:\nGunplay from the series is still excellent, especially compared to other games in the FPS genre. It's more of what the TNO brought, and that's perfectly fine for me.\nGood combination of fast FPS action, but adds the elements of smart tactical shooting as well. Felt like of the modern day FPS, it's one of the ones that gets the formula down to something that I enjoy.\nStealth is rewarded still, which is nice to see. Not forced in certain sections (which I enjoy), but gives you a good reason to actually go quiet.\nLike the original, still love the tiered health system. A good mixture of new and old.\nAI still a good challenge, even on lower difficulties.\nThere is still good writing here. Again, it's not the best of the genre, but there's some new characters that I did enjoy. It's more sparse.\nLike the challenge system. Added some replayability to the game.\nAesthetic comes through loud and clear, and definitely has the Wolfenstein feel to it.\nGood level design overall.\nLike the small easter eggs that you can find in the game. I want a doom demon plushie/stress ball.\nMore explosive weapons this time around. Who doesn't like Explosive weapons?\nPrice seems appropriate for the stand-alone DLC type gameplay.\n-:\nThose looking for the extension of the Wolfenstein: The New Order gameplay may find that they've got a couple of surprises here. The gameplay is more straight forward, with less opportunities for stealth, and the gameplay in my opinion has become less dimensional.\nIt's more of the same. If you're looking for innovation, it's not here.\nThe narrative for the game just doesn't compare to the original. Not to say that it's bad, it's average in the FPS genre, and had some alright moments. But compared to TNO, which was one of the best in the last several years, it just doesn't compare.\nThe game to me had a weak opening. It was hard to get into compared to the original game.\nMore turret sections. Never a fan.\nTarget Audience:  Those looking for more gunplay/action similar to The New Order, but are not expecting innovation.\n","January 24","true","8.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Namely, the expansion pack. Remember the expansion pack missions for games like Quake I and II and Starcraft? That is what this is. It's a 7/10 contractual obligation for fans who want more of what The New Order was.\n\nI don't say this to slag it off. I enjoyed The Old Blood. It's a lot like The New Order, except the game is set in 1946 and we've gone back to the hoary old Wolfenstein cliches: Fighting Nazis inside a castle, ♥♥♥♥ing with the occult, robotic super soldiers, dogs, secrets, all that ♥♥♥♥. As a Wolfenstein game that plays with all that crap, it's a nice effort. Compared to say, Wolfenstein 2010 (the one published by Raven Software).\n\nMy problem with The Old Blood is that beyond improving dual assault rifles and kicking the engine up a notch (up a notch to the point where my graphics card freaks out and starts putting flicking textures everywhere so that the game resembles a VR sim going haywire), there isn't really much improved with the game. The perks are still kind of bland, and the game tries to dissuade you from stealth to GO SHOOT SOME MORE NAZIS. This game kind of throws off its storytelling to get you to SHOOT MORE NAZIS, but I found that to be okay. Shooting Nazis is cool.\n\nThere's some boneheaded plays from MachineGames here, though. The game makes another bid for old-school cred by tying nine achievements to the secret Wolfenstein 3-D levels you get to play when you find a bed and go to sleep! The problem is, Wolfenstein 3-D doesn't really hold up, and MachineGames' treatment of those levels sure ♥♥♥♥ing doesn't help! They got the levels exactly right, but there's a fundamental difference between how Wolf 3-D and The Old Blood/New Order plays, and MachineGames didn't change anything from their game for those levels to accomodate an entirely different school of level design, so it plays like a poorly done mod! Hooray!\n\nSpeaking of poorly done mods: Who loves ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombie levels? Because there's one chapter in The New Order that is all about moving forward and shooting shambling Nazi Zombies in their brains. Just walk through with a stompy robot and dual assault rifles, scoring headshots on all the zombies! It's like mowing the lawn, but WITH ZOMBIES! It's like doing the dishes, but with ZOMBIES! It's like sitting through a boring meeting, BUT WITH ZOMBIES!\n\nSo if you liked The New Order and need more, The Old Blood is there. If you haven't played The New Order, play that instead. Otherwise you're going to be wondering what the hell is so great about this new set of Wolfenstein games.","May 9, 2015","true","8.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","2"

Being a big fan of Wolfenstein 3D/Spear of Destiny I was thrilled to hear it would play like it's predecessor. The only real complaint I have about Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is that it is a incredibly easy game even on 'Uber' difficulty.\n\nAs always, you play as William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz. The voice acting staff for this title should be pleased with themselves for the excellent job they did. Personality traits really shine and characters are wonderfully expressive throughout gameplay and cutscenes.\n\nGameplay is, as I mentioned, in the grain of good old fashioned Wolfenstein. There is Nazi gold, secrets and even a playthrough of a full episode of Wolfenstein 3D through a not-so-secret levels. Some changes are, of course, the ability to use/destroy cover, stealth takedowns, throwing knives/silencer and duel wielding pistols, rifles, shotguns and knives. There is a minor amount of 'QTE' but they are brief and entirely worth being present. There is some seriously unexpected brutality in this title but very fitting for the situations you will experience.\n\nEnvironments are fantastic and never feel out of place. This is a title that is just as fun in corridors as it is fighting outdoors or at range. Environments will range from prisons, villages, caves, graveyards and crypts. This expansion definitely focuses more on Wolfenstein's history with the occult.\n\nAll in all, this is a stellar shooter that looks gorgeous with a excellent nod to the ways of Wolfenstein 3D.\nIf you are a fan of, or even just enjoy, shooters you should pick this up immediately and enjoy some excellent entertainment!","June 16, 2015","true","9.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And by it I mean a bloody good game.\nStory-wise a prequel to TNO, this game will take you (finally!) to and around Castle Wolfenstein and Wulfburg, and re-introduces the occult side of this alternate universe's Nazis.\n\nFirst half of the game is getting to and from Castle Wolfenstein and is basically the same thing as the early parts of Tne New Order. There are a couple new weapons, notably the pipe which will become your best friend as you use it to climb, open stuff, fetch stuff and (of course) savagely kill Nazis. I thought there were more situations where you could go all stealthy and eliminate the commanders to avoid alarm, but that could've been the location of an ancient castle just feeling more like a place where you'd want to sneak. You can go loud anytime you want, of course.\n\nIn the second part, in Wulfburg, you'll be introduced to zombie Nazis just as the 'clear one area of Nazis and move to another' might become a wee bit stale. Also they're on fire. Killing a Nazi will make him burst in fire and turn into a zombie, which sets you up for one really great area where you snipe Nazis who then turn on those that still live, keeping the heat off you. For a large part of one chapter you control a sort of a Nazi mech and go berserk on the helpless master  race, alive and undead alike, turning them into a glorious clouds of gibs and blood.\n\nThe game consists of 2 parts, each with 4 chapters. The boss of the first part is technological in nature and the second part ends with a boss of occult origins.\n\nThere's a plenty of secrets, gold bricks hidden out of sight and whole rooms alike. If you liked the retro dream sequence in TNO, then you'll be glad to find quite a bit of beds in Old Blood, some on the main path and some in secret areas.\n\nI'm really a big fan of this new rebooted Wolfenstein, and The Old Blood is an expansion/'dlc' done well.\nSloth Academy rating: 3.5 golden sloths.","November 14, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

With the videos I'm doing, I actually feel like I'm there with B.J, trying to rescue his friend.\n\nThe idea of mixing stealth and run-and-gun into a game is phenomenal. However, in the case of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, you will not be able to Stealth your way through it. If your run-and-gun the whole time, it will be a great challenge. The philosophy of mixing the two with your gameplay style makes this game one of the best of this year. The story is super rich, and just the idea of an alternate reality where the Nazis are winning is something of a "what if" we have all thought and talked about. In the game you will find pieces of paper that really dive into this alternate reality of a world where the U.S failed D-Day, and weird scientific experiments that will make your skin crawl.

Wolfenstein is one of those games when killing enemies is so damn satisfying and the game first of all shows how brutal the world your'e playing in is so that you want to kill them even more lol ... There are tons of collectibles and all of the sheets of paper are very interresting to read because they give you more detail about whats happening and even shows clues for hardcore Wolfenstein fans about whats gonna happen later. One thing that really is amazing in this game is the music and the sound design. It has alot of variation and fits the mood and atmosphere your character is in perfectly. On the hardest difficulty it takes atleast 8 hours to beat but can take much longer if you take all the achievements and collectibles together and I recommend to play on the hardest just because it's longer and a much more satisfying and enjoyable experience ( though can be frustrating at times but doesn't take away from the overall game) .\n\nOverall this is a great standalone expansion/DLC , deffinetly worth 20$ for all the people who enjoyed TNO and all I gotta say that we need more standalone or just simple DLC's like this one :)","May 5, 2015","true","15.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/350080/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a 2015 standalone prequel and expansion to the critically acclaimed and underrated game, Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014). A solid and terrific first-person shooter at its own right, The Old Blood doesn’t change much from The New Order in regards to gameplay mechanics. However, I personally enjoyed the gameplay mechanics even though it is, obviously, recycled from The New Order. The review applies to people who never played MachineGames’ vision of Wolfenstein or people who already had The New Order on the Steam Library. The question remains: Should I get The Old Blood and why?\n\nThe Old Blood takes place in Castle Wolfenstein (yes, literally) around 1946. The Nazis are winning the war over the Allies and you must stop them from declaring decisive victory. You play as William “B.J” Blazkowicz, an OSS agent who must infiltrate the Castle to gather intelligence on Deathshead’s Compound (where your arch nemesis resides) and assassinate him. Interestingly, the Old Blood takes place just before the prologue chapter in The New Order. There are interesting characters in The Old Blood, including notables such as Helga Von Schabbs and notable references from previous Wolfenstein titles. The story is pretty good and has great homage to Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2002) and the developers respectfully placed references that old school gamers would recognized.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: shoot and kill Nazis. That’s it. Nothing else. This may sound so typical for a first-person school and it is, but every Nazi you kill feels very satisfying. The weapons and character movement are great and highly outstanding. The walkthrough would last you around 4-6 hours, but there are some replay values on getting achievements or finding secrets. The best part in The Old Blood is revisiting Wolfenstein 3D by sleeping on a bed (which the beds are in secret areas). Finding the secrets will bring you great rewards and nostalgia. Alongside with the storyline to fulfill MachineGames’ lore on Wolfenstein, Old Blood offers “Challenge Mode” (or challenge maps) and it is really great. Kill the Nazis and accumulate points on reaching certain criteria for bronze, silver, or gold.\n\nWhile The Old Blood has great merits, there are some negative attributes that has to be taken in consideration. First, the content doesn’t seem much but the storage requirements is insanely huge (all thanks to the iD Tech 5 engine), taking around 38 GB of your hard drive or SSD. This is roughly the same storage space as The New Order, but has fewer content. Individuals who have poor internet connection or low download speeds will have to exercise caution on installing and downloading the game (and wait for hours). The game engine is pretty and impressive, but the engine suffers frequent popup textures or objects were blurry and takes a few seconds to adjust itself to its proper graphical design. In my experience, this happens more often in The Old Blood than The New Order.\n\nThe Old Blood (standalone expansion/DLC) is outstanding and I really enjoy it. Even though there are many similarities for The New Order, there are some games that shouldn’t change gameplay mechanics and The Old Blood is one of those games. Game reviewers or critics gave The Old Blood some solid reviews (or “mixed” with many won’t recommend the “full price”). In my personal point of view, The Old Blood is absolutely worth $20 or your regional equivalent. MachineGames broke off the common trend of expensive DLCs (with little content) and gave a full fledge expansion that is reasonably priced and justified. I commend the developers for making the right choice. For those who have The New Order, but didn’t get The Old Blood, I strongly encourage you to get the game. For the gamers who have not experience Wolfenstein, get The Old Blood first for the story, then get The New Order. The Old Blood is my personal favorite for 2015 as one of the best expansion (or “DLC”) to the well-established, 2014 game – The New Order. On a good discount or full price, this standalone expansion is worth your money. Without a doubt.","May 18","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/350080/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","The Old Blood was entertaining; I won’t deny that. But it feels like it belongs in 2003. It isn't old school enough to have the charm of 90s shooters, and isn't as forward looking as the shooters of 2004/2005 were. It's somewhere in the middle, where I don't think anyone would want to be.\n\nThe combat in The Old Blood is simplistic in a way that starting to feel unacceptable. I’m glad it isn’t Call of Duty, where the action is only slightly more sophisticated than Operation Wolf. But this is way behind F.E.A.R. and Crysis 1, which are still unmatched in “realistic” singleplayer FPS combat. The problem in Wolfenstein is that enemies aren’t capable of doing anything interesting. They run at you and sit behind cover, but don’t do much beyond that. This crude system works against the weaker enemies, who go down in 1 hit. But more powerful enemies provide the least interesting challenge possible, as all they do is take more hits to die, as if this was an RPG. This kind of design feels like the videogame equivalent of a Steven Seagal movie. Films where you can’t even expect to see interesting action choreography, let alone a good story.\n\nSpeaking of the story, The Old Blood doesn’t do much of anything interesting. You’re on a mission to retrieve some documents, and on the way to them you have to murder hundreds of Nazis and their pets. This story lacks the surprising humanity and warmth that The New Order exuded during its quieter moments. I guess because it’s a prequel, there was no room for any character development at all, as that was all present in the original game. You do meet some characters, but they don't get much room. It's only been a couple hours since I finished the game, and I can hardly remember any of them.\n\nI don’t know what it is with ID Tech 5, but it seems to encourage the kind of art direction I enjoy. I played the DLC for The Evil Within just before diving into this, and as both use the same engine it was nice seeing the same qualities reflected in both. The use of lighting and color great. Even if the textures might look a bit rough, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The result is an image that looks almost better than it “should”.\n\nWord leaked a while ago that a sequel is in the works. I hope they aim a bit higher than “the same, except better looking”. I mean I had reasonable fun, even if the story had loads of logical inconsistencies, and things like the climbing and swimming irritated me to no end. I just want more. I shouldn’t be thinking back to something I played in 2005 wishing I was playing that instead.","February 18","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You may expect it to simply be a "DLC" of sorts and it kind of is, however unlike most DLC's it actually improves upon certain aspects of it.  For example, load times are much improved.  In the original game if you died you would sometimes have to sit through a rather lengthy load screen, in the Old Blood load times are practically instant if you die.\n\nThe Old Blood removes a lot of filler from the previous game as well with more of a focus on action.  There aren't many characters in the game that you'll get to know and for what characters there are they don't stick around for long.  You wont really feel any attachment to any one which ultimately means every character feels like a throw away.  Not a big deal since, after all, this games focus is more on fluid FPS combat.  However the Nazi antagonists are VERY enjoyable.  Their sadistic natures and wicked personalities lend themselves quite well to this more action oriented game because you want to feel the satisfaction of putting them down.  If there are future stand-alone games I would like to see more of this.\n\nAll of the visuals are amazing as well.  From the introduction to Castle Wolfenstien, to the local city, they're all beautifully detailed and makes rampaging through the world an immensely enjoyable experience.\n\nCombat, while basically unchanged, has actually seen some balance changes in a way.  Armored Nazi shotgun wielders don't feel as godly and the giant humanoid machine Nazis are more easily handled thanks to the introduction of a new weapon.  Combat still has some "weight" to it as well.  Firing weapons, of which there are a few new additions, feels great and dual wielding slows down B.J.  So weapon choice can actually effect how well, or not so well, your battles go.\n\nMuch like the first game there is an uncanny amount of collectibles in The Old Blood.  So much in fact that a guide is almost necessary if you want to find them all without spending hours looking in every single nook and cranny.  This problem is compounded since they also brought back some classic Wolfenstein 3D levels.  These levels are also apart of the collectibles and if you're a completionist these may be worst aspect of the game.  While novel and nostalgic at first these levels take an absurd amount of time to complete.  This is because B.J can't run through these very quickly.  Somehow the transition of these classic levels to a more modern age has made traversing it a sluggish and dull experience.\n\nAnyway, The Old Blood is rather short.  It can be finished within 5 hours, assuming you're not going for full completion.  Regardless, it was a very enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend it.","June 2, 2015","true","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

(TNO)\nA Small game but different and fun enough with the original formula to make it worth buying at the retail price point.\n\nTOB, takes place directly before TNO as you infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein to find documents revealing Deathshead's Location. All of this takes you on a adventure that has you blasting and on occassion sneaking your way through enemies. If you've played TNO then your not missing much here, the weapon system is roughly the same except about half of them are completely different weapons, one of the most useful being the pipe. (Which is almost a character in itself, with the amount of time you'll be spent looking at it.) There is a small perk system, but its nothing again too huge and it doesn't become distracting either which is alright.\n\nThe enemies are roughly the same, with different asthetics for the time period. Except for the last 3 chapters of the game, which i won't spoil. (There are tons of clues, in particular if you look for a letter behind a bookcase then you'll see it from a mile away.) For example, your not going to see the Nazi Technology to the extent that they have in TNO, but it'll be prevelent. The gameplay remains tense and fast paced with the same if it aint broke, don't fix it attitude which i appreciate because the TNO's gameplay was slick and well polished. Shame about that underwhelming boss though its nothing compared to the boss of TNO. (The adds are honestly the hardest part of that fight.)\n\nIn terms of the story, it is on par with the level of quality you get from TNO and depending on your perspective its slightly more or less crazy as TNO too. You'll meet a few characters with pretty interesting backgrounds if you go out of your way to read them. B.J's classic badassery continues as he spends basically half of the game shirtless. I sh*t you not. He spends half of TOB fighting people half naked, which is awesome. His signature monologues from TNO return with a vengence, which this time reveal a bit more into his background story because TNO was so light on it.  The main antagonists are decent, and you get the occassional tense brush with them but they are just a part of the experience, just like the original.\n\nSo, in terms of game length i beat the game on hard in 5 hours and a half. Which for the price point is a really good sell for something i had an absolute blast with. I'd also like to mention you can get TOB bundled with TNO, so if you for some reason don't have them both, you can get them at the same price of retail TNO on steam. Which is a steal.\n\nIn Conclusion.\n\nSolid and Fun, Recommended if you liked the original or if your curious at the price point.

The ability to utilize a lead pipe section to scale walls adds another element of interaction with the world, as well as the ability to play a unique difficulty; "Mein Leiben", which will challenge you to complete the game on one life.\n\nHowever, the lack of a multiplayer reminiscent of Enemy Territory is one element that needs to be touched upon. With disregarding an element of gameplay that would translate to a larger fanbase and unique dimensions to the game is almost a self-inflicted injury for the franchise so far.\n\nNonetheless, Just like TNO, The Old Blood is a raw, visceral experience that plunges you into the world. The game's plot is dependant on the fans that have played The New Order beforehand, as the character depth and interaction seems sudden and stilted for the new players on the scene.\n\nThe active choice whether to proceed with stealth or all-out violence has always been a great mechanic to allow critical thinking for certain situations.  Unfortunately, Just like TNO, Old Blood gives a very linear path despite the attempt to create depth with height variability and chokepoints.\n\nMaybe Machinegames is doing what they feel is natural for the franchise, as the 2009 Revamp of Wolfenstein left a lot of fans by the wayside with the free exploration concept: Maybe a bit more in the exploration department may make up for the lack of a multiplayer element, and may add to an overall satisfying experience.\n\nThey attempt to mitigate it similar to a boy sticking his finger in the dike with the Challenge mode: A brand new concept: Throughout the campaign, you encounter certain maps that require you to survive before advancing. Challenge mode takes it a step further and pits you against the clock in an attempt to finish the section in the fastest time. A competative element allows you to compare times with your friends and check your ranking not only in your circle, but in the world as well.\n\nIn conclusion, for the diehard fans of the game, it's well worth the time to find all the secrets, finish the perk tree, find the easter eggs and Nightmare beds, Top the Challenge maps and remain content that there is still plenty for Machinegames to produce for the Franchise.","May 8, 2015","true","121.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Same atmosphere and feel, although character development is a bit lacking. I think they are relying on the carryover from TNO for you to invest in BJ and his enemies, but as an prequel-expansion it is superb for the price. Do yourself a favor and go exploring, read the letters, they really make a difference in how much of the story is communicated as the audio narrative is much shorter.\nIt feels like the player has more choices to go stealth instead of guns blazing most of the time, a solid addition. AI is still a bit wonky, pay attention to their verbal cues as they may not have seen you(even though you'd be dead to rights in any other game). If you loved TNO, pick this up.

It's Wolfenstein done right, and I played many Wolfensteins. 1946 setting of the game (which we catched a glimpse in Prolouge in TNO) is very nice. You have those retro-futurisctic WWII weapons, by which you kill retro-futuristic nazi troopers, ubersoldaten und zombies. Weapons themselves feel powerfull and gunplay is just like in TNO, but smoother. The story is well presented and there are some interesting characters, thou sometimes I felt the story wanted to be something more emotional but played out... wierd... funny... IDK, maybe you'll get that while playing. And you should play it. I even recommend playing it before TNO (if you haven't been playing it). The game took me 10 hours to beat (67 % completion of game, so I guess there's still couple of hours to grind). Just like in TNO you have kilograms of gold to find, letters, secret areas (some neaty easter-eggs await you ;D). Another good thing is that there's less interactive cutscenes, more mowing down (or sneaking on) nazis, something which I did not like in TNO. There is nice addition of Challenges, in which you replay some big fights, but you get timer, points and combos, so the game may keep you for a while longer. It's also a very stable launch. I have never encountered any crashes or bugs, no framerate drops on medium-high settings even while shooting hordes of enemies. Overall Machinegames again gave us a great grame to experience and I think Wolfenstein franchise is in good hands.\n\nGG Machinegames.\n\nTalking about GG's.

The price also seemed very appealing, as it was considerably cheaper, compared to its predecessor.\n\nI am now writing this review, after just having finished the game on über difficulty. This took me about 8 hours to do, without really being in a hurry, as I did take some time to enjoy the scenery, and searching for the games many secrets.\n\n\nStory & Gameplay:Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is in my opinion a very well thought out game, and while it doesn't have as much of a story, or as many developed characters as the New Order did, it certainly served its purpose and delivered the story very well.\n\nThe game is described as being a standalone prequel to the New Order, and I would without a doubt say that it is worthy to this description, the game can certainly stand on its own, and yet it leads very much up to what happens in the New Order.\n\nSince this is a Wolfenstein game, you will without a doubt encounter alot of action, there will be alot of shooting, killing, and did I say Nazi killing? Yes this game is no different from its predecessors and certainly lives up to its name. However there is a few twists, but I rather not spoil it for you here, but I will say that this game is worth it.\n\nYou don't need to have played, Wolfenstein: The New Order prior to this game, as it stand very well on its own, and since this is supposed to be a prequel, I would even go as far to recommend that you play this game first.\n\nPros:\n+ Blazkowicz\n+ Good variety of weapons\n+ Added replayability if you wish to unlock all the challenges, and find the hidden gold and letters.\nCons:\n- The AI is still quite stupid, but this cant be said for most FPS games.\n\nThe Game:If you were able to run and play Wolfenstein: The New Order, then you should definietly be able to play this one too, and don't worry if you can't play the game on the highest graphic options, because this game comes with alot of settings, that you can adjust.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphical pleasing ( but then again, I am not very hard to please ).\n+ The game is very well optimized, and runs good on my PC.\n+ Loading screens are quick, on my PC.\n+ Lots of graphic options in the menu.\n+ The Game is less blurry than Wolfenstein: The New Order\nCons:\n- The mouse in the menu is acting weird.","May 11, 2015","true","21.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But with a shooter as phenomenally solid as The New Order it's hard to pick a single bad thing about more. Once again the shooting is the tightest and the story and progression is a welcome surprise of quality. The only negative thing I could possibly say about this is that if you played through The New Order and loved its intense unrelenting firefights you may find some disappointment in The Old Blood as the highs are never quite as high octane as the previous incarnation. That said, it's still an incredibly solid shooter that shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys shooting dudes.","January 24","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a solid 10+ hours long campaign, new weapons, new characters, new locations, new enemies and a completely new theme (supernatural), Wolfenstein The Old Blood feels more like a "small" full games then a big expansion.\n\nStill, don't think that W:TOB is as great as W:TNO, there are differences, like: it's shorter, there are less "innovative" weapons, it's a more linear experience, enemies are reused a lot, it has less unlockable "power-ups" and mods for your weapons. It also include the whole first episode of Wolfenstein 3D as hidden easter egg.\n\nDefinitely a good game you should play, if you liked Wolfenstein: The New Order.","January 29","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this might be the game for you. Accuracy not guaranteed.\n\nOnce again we take on the role of BJ Blazkowicz and see just how many bodies it takes to stop the Nazi war machine dead in its tracks, and let me tell you if my gameplay is anything to go by its an awful lot. With more guns than you thought anyone was capable of lugging around you shoot, cut, bash and blast your way through thousands of suicidal fascists, armoured hell beasts and supernatural ne'er-do-wells.\n\nThis game allows you to play it in one of several ways, no you don’t get a dialogue option to weasel your way out of fighting but what you do get is the choice to go quite, loud or ear drum burstingly psychotic. The guns themselves are a pretty standard lot ranging from silenced pistols to lead belching heavy machine guns and everything you would expect for an FPS in-between, the grenade pistol is a particular favourite of mine. The stealthy knife and pipe weapons, yes pipe, are great too and deliver very satisfying executions to anyone who has the misfortune of getting to close to you.\n\nThe enemies are not very diverse what with it being predominantly made up of Nazi grunts and a few odds and ends thrown in, at least in the first act, the second act offers some more variety and the particular satisfaction of setting one half of the mobs against the other before watching the ensuing firefight and chortling to yourself about how clever you are. There are also weak spots on a few of the enemies that lead to new and funsplosive ways to get rid of them, another joy of mine.\n\nThe world in which the game takes place is pretty great too. Starting off in a huge grandiose castle and ending up in the dank crypt of a rundown half destroyed German city with more horror in its history than most bio weapon corporations can dream of. I had a great deal of fun on my first playthrough exploring everything and making sure to find all the little secrets I could.\n\nSpeaking of secrets this game is riddled with collectables, logs and hidden levels. I enjoyed finding every one of them and the hidden retro levels were a joy unto their own. The other part of the game worth noting is the challenge arena. After progressing through enough of the game you unlock arenas allowing you to fight Nazi’s for a high score. Whilst initially I thought little of it I soon became obsessed with my gold medals and found that part to be almost as enjoyable as the main game itself.\n\nThe gameplay is great, snappy controls, fluid animations and awesome set pieces add up to a title you should get, especially if you liked New Order, FPS or just want to kick some evil ♥♥♥.\n\nHave Fun ^_^\n","January 13","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is a throwback to older Wolfenstein games, Return to Castle Wolfenstein in particular. It's less alternative universe (though there's a touch of that, with mention of the Allies failing to take Normandy on D-Day) and more supernatural. So if you loved TNO for the story, Old Blood may not scratch the same itch.\n\nBut if you loved the gameplay in TNO, Old Blood is a great expansion. Plenty of content for an expansion and the new weapons are fun. The ability to stealth your way through sections is back, though you will have to fight your way out of many.

This game was excellent and EASY to pick up on even if you don't own "Wolfenstein: The New Order" Perferable if you even dont have that one i get this one because i imagine it fills in the gaps between the storys. Anyways onto the review.\n\nI have beat the game playing it about 6 Hours without looking for all the Letters, Gold and other secerets On the Starting Diffculty (The one two below "UBER")\n\nPros:\n1. Good Story, i was engaged in it and wanted to see what would happen.\n2. The Gun Play, oh god the Child Hood memories i love this game its gun play is a mixture of Old School and new School its really rewarding and the guns act like they pack a punch.\n3. Wolfenstein 3D Easter Eggs, There are one or two in each level. (Sence i suck at this game horribily i haven't completed them.\n\nCons:\n1. Im sorry, but i abousetly hate zombies. Don't get me wrong i know this is a Wolfenstein game were talking about and the zombies are done well and all but im just getting tired of seeing zombies after zombies after zombies in each game.\n2. Few little bugs here and there, i had to restart to the last Auto-Save due to getting glitched into a wall and such.\n\n\nBut overall this is a AMAZING GAME and is worth the 19.99 US Dollars, this game is worth it.","May 6, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

I'm sure I will return for many more episodes and play as I think it was intended and that is before 'New Order'. This I would strongly suggest as the ending takes you to an introduction of what lies ahead. It is after all a 'Prequel' as you will find out.\n\nGraphics are great as is the sound and the characters are all believable, the added mechanical beasts are a sensation and have you thinking how to get rid of them very quickly. The plot is solid with genuine storyline that will keep you entertained and offer up surprises regularly as well.\n\nTake the time to look for treasures and secrets of which there are numerous, not always easy first time through but make the effort when you can. Lots to see and do which all add to the playability and gameplay enjoyment factor. Oh and make sure you take the time to have a sleep in one of the beds you encounter, you will find out why when you do.\n\nLets talk about 'Zombies'.....I hate 'Zombies'.....Well I did up until this game came a long and now I love 'em!.....Well, not actually love them but they add excellent content without seeming to appear just because everyone these days seems to think a game isn't a game unless it has them!\n\nThey are damn great fun and how they appear and come looking for you is well, a bit of a blast!\n\nI have uploaded screenshots for both of the new 'Wolfies' so have a look and you will get a bit of an idea of what to expect and hopefully not spoil it for you.\n\nGame took approx. 10 hrs to go through first time but I missed lots of items. Will take longer next time and will make sure to collect more. I would rate this game 7.5/10 and my screenshots will give you an indication of gameplay.\n\nConclusion, for all old and new Wolfenstein fans, buy it....Buy it....Buy it!....Pssst and don't forget 'New Order'!","June 12, 2015","true","64.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My father said if I done wrong it'd creep out at night and come for me. I tried to do no wrong. But the monster came all the same."\n\nFinal review update after finishing the game.\n\nThis stand alone DLC, or expansion, took me around 8 hours to beat while playing on the 2nd hardest difficulty. This was playing leisurely, or "normally", which means not rushing through by any means, but also not spending extra huge amounts of time hunting for secret areas or other collectibles.\n\n-\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are great, but nothing absolutely spectacular. There are several presets for the graphics: Low, Medium, High, Ultra, and then "Custom" if you crank the few settings that it lets you past their Ultra presets. Things like shadow resolution, and AA can be turned up past ultra. I am able to hold 60fps with all settings custom cranked past ultra on my GTX 980 and hold 60fps with the exception of AA. If I want to play past the Ultra preset I need to tone down AA from x8 to x4 or x2. Comparably, the graphic quality looks pretty much identical to Wolfenstein: The New Order (which is a good thing, as that game looked great). Interiors of the prison/castle are drab, dark, gritty, claustrophobic, and atmospheric. The later parts of the game in the old town/village look very fitting for a small little mountain setting as well. Fire effects and explosions at a distance look really good, but up close they can look grainy/blurry.\n\n-\n\nGameplay:\nIts Wolfenstein! In case for some reason you don't know what that means, it means you are an awesomely stereotypical American hero that can impossibly dual wield machine guns and mow Nazi's (and their creations) down in waves and waves with blood everywhere in action packed sequences. The action is broken up by some stealth portions of the game. Most of the stealth is optional, but some is not (more on that further below). This is exactly what you would expect from an expansion for The New Order. Its just plain simple fun action packed Wolfenstein gameplay. The gun-play is fluid and satisfying as ever. There are around 8 unique weapons, and that's not counting grenades/throwing knives/temporary guns that you can pick up. Each gun has its use, be it extreme close combat, medium range, long range, explosive, etc. I can honestly say that throughout the entire game the gun-play never got tedious or boring for me.\n\nThere are also several beds in which you can sleep in that take you into the old retro "Escape From Castle Wolfenstein!" type levels. These are a fun and nostalgic 'game within a game' that appear throughout the story.\n\n-\n\nSound/Music/Dialogue:\nThere is no real fast paced action/bass pounding/metal oriented music that plays during the fighting that was present in The New Order. It seems like they are going for more of an old school approach with the music, and this is apparent as soon as you get to the menu screen. This isn't a bad thing, its just noticeable when you are coming from The New Order which had the menu music that pumped you up giving you the feeling that Wolfenstein was back but in the modern day. The sounds/music that are in The Old Blood is more ambient and moody as you move throughout the prison/castle/town, and definitely give you a more claustrophobic and desperate feeling as you progress. The scripted dialogue is about on par with what you would expect from a Wolfenstein game. Very vanilla goals with very stereotypical enemies and a very macho protagonist. What is new in this game however is the sort of "deep thought" dialogue that B.J. talks to himself with. This can range from really cool or "deep" little quotes, to overly cheesy and almost intentionally cringe worthy ones as well.\n\n-\n\nOne thing I didn't like was the awkward forced stealth sequence during the beginning of the game in the prison. It's not that stealth in general is bad, some people might even play the entire game stealth (or as much as is possible outside of scripted action sequences). But towards the very start of this game, you are forced into a very linear and repetitive stealth sequence that leaves you doing the same actions over and over in order to avoid automated guards. During this sequence you have no guns, and the check points that separate progression are spread out a little too much, so if you die you have to start the sequence(s) over. This sequence leaves you in a sort of "Okay, can we get to the action now?" mindset after you've been in it for a bit.\n\n-\n\nOpinion:\nAt the time of this writing, the game's full price is $20. I picked this up during the Steam summer sale for about $13. I definitely think it was worth it at $13, but I cannot say for sure that at $20 I would have bought it. It is definitely a solid 5-8 hour action packed DLC/expansion, and it definitely is fun, but I don't know if its worth $20 with how short it is. However, I loved The New Order, so if you liked that game, then getting this one should be a no brainer.\n\n-\n\nAlso, I absolutely loved the nods and easter eggs related to other Bethesda games that appeared around the game as well.\n\nAll around a solid Wolfenstein game that sticks safely close to the New Order's style and gameplay.","June 27, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Seems to be a bit of a RtcW homage or perhaps even retcon. The campaign should take you from five to six hours on a first playthrough, which is some decent value for the price. Finding all collectibles, earning the highest possible medal on the challenge maps (short survival-type sections of the main game with extra enemy spawns plus a scoring and combo system) and collecting all "Old Silver" pickups during the optional "Nightmare!" (the entire first episode of Wolfenstein 3D, with some minor modifications, is playable as an easter egg) bits can easily translate to an extra 20+ hours of playtime.\nA solid and well-crafted FPS, significantly above average.

I think the game deserves a "neutral" rating rather than a negative rating, and since the game certainly isn't BAD and UNPLAYABLE by any means, I'll go ahead and put this under a positive rating.\n\nThe first half of the game is tedious and grindy. The first couple of chapters (there are 8 total) you barely do anything, and it's the same repetitive stuff over and over... literally! It's half-♥♥♥♥♥ stealth where you wander around hallways that all look identical. The first two chapters is some of the worst level design that I've seen in the last decade of videogames. It's just an uninspired copy & paste mess with no direction, and nothing of interest. If you're not sneaking through hallways, you're crawling through vents.\n\nIt takes so long for the campaign to "get started" that I really lost desire to even want to play. Halfway through it really picks up and starts to be enjoyable. I was pretty into the game at that point, but it wraps up and is over a few hours later. Quite a shame, but at least they didn't drag the game out in the second half. While the level design of the second half leaves a lot to be desired, it's pretty acceptable and interesting compared to the first half. The gameplay also ramps up a bit, along with the intensity (no more stealth.)\n\nI swear the game is also less optimized than The New Order was. If I have VSync on, the game sufferes from unplayable microstutters and mouse lag. With VSync off I get horrendous screen tearing constantly. I don't remember this being an issue in TNO. Visually the game looks good but there aren't as many visually awesome and creative areas as in TNO.\n\nI think I can only recommend The Old Blood if you were addicted to TNO and needed more. There's some enjoyment to be found here, but it takes a while to get to it, and you're not going to get an as polished and as immersive experience as The New Order. Ultimately it's up for you to decide, but if you played TNO and you're on the fence about TOB, perhaps you should hold off instead.","June 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Confusing references aside, BJ swims like a cripple. "Nightmare" levels are a tedious bore. Wolfenstein sucked back then and it sucks now, the only relevance it had was as a stepping stone to Doom. Still, this is hours of Nazi-killing mayhem, with New Order's awesome combat mechanics and intriguing storytelling fully intact, resulting in an involving, self-contained adventure. The attention to detail here is quite laudable.

Though I feel somwhat disappointed by the game, I would recommend buying it anyways, especially if you liked the New Order, - it is still a good shooter with lots of explosions, gore and a little stealth, but taking into account the little the game has to offer it would probably be better to wait for a discount.","May 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm talking about the fact the The Old Blood is an expansion like Blue Shift and Opposing Force were to Half-Life. It is well written, full of action and a complete addon to the original game. This is how downloadable content should be presented. The Old Blood, like The New Order, presents old fashion shooting with today's graphics. The gameplay is engaging, dynamic and never once did I feel bored. I think I might actually like The Old Blood more as it leans towards the paranormal side of the Wolfenstein franchise like Return to Castle Wolfenstein did, and that makes it such a good game. That is what The New Order missed in my opinion. The only con is the IDTech engine, well its graphics mostly. The game looks gorgeous but this texture thing while making swift turns breaks the immersion a bit. Otherwise I like the engine and works well for shooters such as these. It makes me look forward towards Doom 4.","May 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whilst TNO looks great and plays OK, it feels sluggish and drawn out, reminiscent of Wolfenstein 2009. The Old Blood on the other hand is more than a return to form, revisiting the scenes from Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The ID Tech5 engine means it looks amazing, I found myself spending far too long admiring the scenery. With great pacing, ET ready weapons, plenty of Nazis to shoot, sneak em up gameplay for those less trigger happy and some great retro original 1993 Wolfie sections, I cant recommend this highly enough. Only criticisms are that the bosses are a bit too easy and there just isnt enough content, I know the price reflects that, so Im holding out hope for some DLC.\n\nFingers crossed that this will spawn a new era of Enemy Territory,  it has all of the ingredients to do just that.

Being a stand alone budget priced title it doesn't have quite the length, but it still felt good to me. I just wrapped up the campaign as I type this, and my Steam library shows 13 hours played. You still have the ability to dual wield nearly any weapon in the game save for a few, and there is the option for stealth or run and gun with most levels. New Order really surprised me with it's emotional impact juxtaposed with the over the top combat and set pieces. The Old Blood has some of all of those but to a lesser degree. The ending of the game ties in very nicely with the beginning of New Order and leaves me wanting to replay that one immediately afterwards.\n\nAs far as technical issues go, I had no problems until I updated my AMD drivers and the AMD (Raptr) Gaming Evolved app installed itself. This title would simply not run until I uninstalled that. Other than that minor hiccup, it ran at a solid 60fps. For reference, I'm running an i5 3570k, 16gb RAM, and an R9 270x card.\n\nAgain, if  you liked New Order then I definitely recommend giving this one a close look.","August 20, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Usually, when a simple call of duty style game comes out -- I simply won't care. Yet this game is charming. And the shooting -- It feels fantastic. I'm more of a bethesda open world rpg kind of gamer. I prefer stats and weapon mods and random loot and branching stories. Yet this game has absolutely none of that. With it's perfectly feeling weapons, great impacts, smooth movement, and fantastic and snappy animations this game brings back what you loved about first person shooters from the 90's and 2k's. And it does it better. Then inject a story that's far better than a game like this usually attempts, and you are left with something remarkable in the degree of excellence of it's execusion.\n\nThe grephics engine annoying, if you don't meet a certain spec, the game will stutter to keep things flowing, due to the open gl based idtech engine used in rage. One thing to pay attention to while setting the game up is that the extra effects, really don't make much of a difference. If you disable a lot of them the game won't look that different on low as it does on high. The reason is that one of the positives of id tech is that everything is pre baked. That's why the file size is so high. A lot of original streaming textures. This allows for a much more smooth, organic looking world than the usual dx11 titles with realtime engines. It's a different visual experience, with it's own pros and cons. Yet it's refreshing in a world where everyone is reusing the same handful of engines to have something truly new. Even if that new brings with it quirks.\n\n\nI would highly recommend this game. It's extremely simple. Yet feels damn near perfect.\n\n\nPerhaps we can get some rpg mechanics in the next one. I'd like just a pinch of depth next time. Keep those shooting mechanics though. Few games reach those heights.","November 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you think a tighter retreading of last year's TNO that expands slightly on the mechanics and world would be up your alley, then you should definitely buy this. Lacks the overall charm of TNO and has far fewer "wow!" moments, but is still better than most shooters put out nowadays. At twenty bucks, should be a no-brainer for anybody considering it. Held back by some minor technical issues.\n\n(incredibly minimal spoilers, nothing that the final trailer didn't spoil)\n\nDo you like classic Wolfenstein? If yes, you'll more than likely enjoy this game. Did you like last year's The New Order and want to basically retread it again in a somewhat stripped-down version that introduces new mechanics and gameplay concepts? If yes, then you'll love The Old Blood.\n\nIt's a very polished game, for twenty bucks I feel very satisfied with my purchase, despite feeling somewhat let down by the game. It's nowhere near as character driven as TNO was, resulting in less personality, less funny moments, fewer remarks from BJ and fewer moments where I was left saying to myself "this is so ♥♥♥♥ing cool!" But that doesn't make this a bad game, definitely not. It's less than what I expected given how much I found myself enjoying TNO, but it was nice to see the game return more to the series' supernatural roots.\n\nThe first half of the game is somewhat slow, but has better level design despite feeling like it was straight out of TNO. The second half of the game is quicker paced and more interesting, but has more linear level design along with having smaller levels overall. Overall, there's a lot of emphasis on stealth, even though you can still play through guns ablazin'. Gameplay options are always a plus in my book. The story is decent, keeping you interested and attached while lacking the raw emotional power that TNO had, which is to be expected in a twenty dollar expandalone, and BJ remains the best character in modern shooters. The gunplay is as solid as ever (the challenge maps are incredibly fun to play, though some more variation would have been a nice way to extend the game's lifespan), the movements fluid and the game looks great overall, but I had a consistent problem with stuttering playing on any settings (specs: i7-3770k, gtx 760 4 gb, 16 gb ram. Not the most impressive, but I should have had zero problems with this game period), which is understandably annoying but I still enjoyed my time with the game.\n\nThe music is something I have to make special mention of, it was unbelievable throughout. Lots of games have good music direction, but the orchestrals throughout this game perfectly complement the gameplay and narrative. I'm a sucker for a cello, but every single recording in this soundtrack is excellent.\n\nI will say that the game is seriously easy. I don't enjoy shooters, I don't play them frequently and so it would stand to reason that I pale in comparison to most shooter fans. However, playing this on medium was a cakewalk. I'd recommend hard at the minimum. I ended up having to bump up the difficulty because the game was simply far too easy. Hardened fans of the genre beware, anything below hard and you may be wasting your time.\n\nI feel it was worth the money and my time, even if it had a slower feel than the trailers made it seem and couldn't match TNO in personality or direction (or scope obviously, but that doesn't count given what this is). Buy it if you think you're at all interested, kill some Nazis, some zombies and some Nazi zombies and have a good time.\n\n7.5/10, would have been an 8/10 had it been better optimized. I will still buy any future dlc or sequels day one, which I never do. Hopefully we see another little expandalone soon, if not a full sequel.","May 6, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a bundle with New Order? It's a friggin steal.\n\nThis makes for an excellent gaming double feature. I personally suggest playing Old Blood THEN New Order for a more cohesive narrative, and while they don't change much between the two titles gameplay wise, they both offer vastly different experiences. TNO has a MUCH stronger script and characters while TOB has much faster paced gunplay and level progression. In terms of content the story is less substantial (about 6-8 hours for most people as opposed to 12-15 in TNO) but it makes up for it with tons of secrets, choices, bonus modes, and tons of easter eggs you'll want to find and explore (Like a Skyrim Helmet and Wolfenstein 3D stages... no seriously).\n\nThis game is just a ton of fun and while TNO is better imo, as a straight shoot 'em up TOB is an amazing time that should keep you happy for 10-20 hours minimum if you love exploration or are completionist.","May 24, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

New Order had several occasions where you'd go back to a hideout between missions, and be able to talk to the other members of the resistance. Old Blood has nothing like that. Just a couple of quick conversations with characters you never see again, and never feel any emotional connection to.\n- Too short. The save file displays your playing time.

I want to fight the boss but instead I spend most of the time shooting endlessly respawning minions, wasting my ammo, and distracting me from the boss' powerful attacks?

You still have the ability to dual wield nearly any weapon in the game save for a few, and there is the option for stealth or run and gun with most levels. New Order really surprised me with it's emotional impact juxtaposed with the over the top combat and set pieces. The Old Blood has some of all of those but to a lesser degree.

However, for those unfamiliar with it, playing TNO isn't mandatory since it's a prequel.\n\nThe game is a FPS, that takes place during WWII along an alternate timeline, where the Nazis have perfected robotics, cybernetics and weapon-tech. Meaning you will find yourself battling robotic super soldiers, cyborgs and well equipped soldiers eager to tear your head off.\n\nWhile the game is a FPS, it does have many stealth elements. Sure, you can run in guns blazing and possibly survive. However the safer, and in my opinion way more fulfilling, is stealthing your way through certain locations. Why blast a heavily armored super soldier when you can sneak through some air ducts and get behind him to shut off his power? Why run through a kennel and battle cyborg dogs when you can sneak up to them while they sleep and silence them quickly?\n\nNo matter which route you go, if you are a fan of W:TNO, or FPS games in general you will probably love this game. It's not without it's faults though which I will list below, but first allow me to tell you what it does well.\n\nProsFlawless controller support\nIncredibly long for a 20 dollar game\nBreathtaking graphics\nExcellent voice acting\nFantastic Storyline\nVent Crawling!\nGood variety of enemies\nChallenging gameplay with adjustable difficulty levelsConsNo Multi-player\nInadequate Tutorial\nNot much replay value.\nOccasionally the AI can be a bit dimwitted\nNo manual save\nRATING: 7/10","July 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once again B.J. is deep behind enemy lines, and has only his wits and few good allies to guide him on his mission.\n\nSimilar to Wolfenstein: The New Order, game has decent variety of weapons: knives, pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, grenades, turrets that you can carry with you, etc.. You can carry a lot of firepower, as well as use almost any kind of weapon in both hands. It's possible to kill enemies silently, with rusty pipes, knives, throwing knives or silenced pistols.\n\nThere's good amount of secrets, collectibles and lore bits scattered throughout the levels. Near dozen challenge maps to test out your Nazi killing skills. You also unlock different kinds of "perks" by completing combat objectives, that grant you some boost to equipment, ammo count, health and armor, etc.\n\nGame is around 15 hours long if you care to invest time in challenges, achievements and collectibles. Graphically game is decent, with some low resolution textures here and there. It's same engine as Wolfenstein: The New Order, so expect some texture streaming. Animation quality is good, with occasional ragdoll glitches. Voice acting is on level with Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nYou kill Nazi soldiers, robots and zombies.. what's to hate.

Most of the games coming out were complete ♥♥♥♥ing disasters like Assassin's Creed Unity and The Crew or horribly disappointing like Watch_Dogs and Destiny, the latter I'm still kind of mad about. It was a very underwhelming year, to say the least, but there were a few games from big devs that managed to be good, one of which was Wolfenstein: The New Order. Wolfenstein: The New Order was a glorified shooter that has shamed pretty much all and any shooters from the last year or two with awesome gunplay, extremely gory Nazi killing, and characters with actual personality, which was a welcome break from whatever Call of Duty came out that year, which had... Kevin Spacey I think. I guess they decided they wanted to do a prequel story, so they made it and sold it for $20. How was it? Well, we're here to figure that out, aren't we? So let's see.\n\nSTORY: You are once again B.J. Blaskowitz, a red, white, and blue blooded soldier who, along with his associate Wesley, infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein, a German controlled castle that contains plans on where General Deathshead's compound is. The files are held by archaeologist Helga Von Schabbs, who is looking for something related to King Otto I. ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, both are arrested, and B.J. has to escape, get Wesley, meet with their contact, and get the files from the archaeologist. Oh yea, and Nazi Zombies come in somewhere halfway through the story. It's nowhere as good as The New Order, takes a lot of elements from that story like that choice in the beginning that everyone who played the game knows what I'm talking about, this time happening in the mid-late game, but it isn't really that bad. Not as compelling, bit sillier and harder to take seriously than TNO, but it's still alright. Kept me interested long enough.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Still the same great gunplay from the last game. Can dual wield a lot of weapons and it's fun to shoot Nazi's in the head. This time around, stealth is actually a viable option for these levels, which is nice as well. Weapons are good, we have a few new guns like the kamphpistole, which is a pistol with explosive rounds, and a pretty kickass sawed off shotgun. Overall, I can't complain.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Game looks good as always, didn't notice any differences between New Order and this one. Castle Wolfenstein looks nice, as well as the other places. Does the same performancewise, I'd say, ran fine enough, even my ♥♥♥♥ PC can run it fine enough.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: B.J is back, he's kind of the monologuey guy that he was before, but he's fine. The villians and the Nazi's are decently voiced as well, they speak German for the most part, so bonus points for authenticity there. No bad performances, so nothing to complain for it really.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Not as flashy or impressive as The New Order, I recommend picking that up before this. Still, it is a decent game, not a must buy like TNO, but still alright. 7.5/10, pick it up if you liked The New Order or if it goes on sale for a really good deal.\n\nIch bein ein 'hot dog'","November 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/recommended/350080/","bioarmored","Ecchi Gotei Heka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/","109 products in account","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is the prequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order. You play as William "B.J." Blazkowitz again, but this time you will be placed in a environment very similar to Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Wolfenstein 3D. In fact, I shouldn't say similar, as some part are 99% similar, since its basically a reimagination of what happens in Castle Wolfenstein. From the beginning until the middle part of the story, if you are familar with the lore of Wolfenstein, you will know what happens to BJ.\n\nGameplay wise, it's exactly the same as The New Order. You are a one man army, carrying many, many big guns while gunning down Nazi goons. Nazi soldiers, armored Nazi soldiers, Nazi dogs, Nazi officiers, mechanical Nazis, heavily armored Nazis etc, just like The New Order. Some area you may have to pass through by force, but some you may stealth through them, though you can also do it guns blazing, until you reach your destinated checkpoint area.\n\nWeapons here are very similar to The New Order, though since it's a prequel, the weapons here are the World War 2 variant, with some weapons having secondary modes. For example, the pistol (Luger) here can be made into a silencer by putting on the silenced barrel. You can duel wield them as well for more firepower, though you will be slowed significantly. You can also take some heavy machine guns to use as well, though your movement here will be even slowed and some actions are restricted.\n\nMovement here, again is very similar to The New Order. You can sprint, slide, croutch, fire behind cover and so forth, while single or dual wielding. As mentioned earlier, some actions like sprinting cannot be used while wielding a heavy machine gun. Perks are back in this game as well, though not in excessive amount as in The New Order, and they are fairly achievable at a relatively quick rate. These perks will enhance your capabilities for certain weapons, more ammo pickup, or even allow you to hold a heavy machinegun permanently.\n\nEnemy AI here is the same as in The New Order, which is shoot you until they die or you die. They are relatively accurate, though a bit slow on the pickup on dead bodies (though occasionally they will notice it somehow). Nazi officers or kommandant are placed in relatively safe spot, so getting to them without raising the alarm will be a bit tricky. Their accuracy here is deadly, no matter which difficulty you play in, as they will tear you to shred if you are not careful (and apparently they have unlimited grenades, so be prepared for the grenade spam on higher difficulty, though you can throw it back to them, its really risky as a grenade can outright kill you if you don't have any armor). This is where the cover fire comes in. ABUSE IT. It will save your life, in fact it can help you survive the onslaught. Strafing in and out may help as well, but cover fire is a much safer way. Do be careful on breakable objects though.\n\nThe story here is similar to Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Wolfenstein 3D, which is to say, quite alright for me. Halfway through the plot, there will be a slight twist in the story, where you may have to alter your play style a bit (though you still have to retain how you fight in the 1st half of the story). However, the biggest crime here is that, the story is really short. it's about half (at most 5/8th) of the length of the story in The New Order, so replaying campaign is either for unlocking perks, or finding all the collectibles. If you count the secret levels per map then the story is approximately 3/4th of the storyline of The New Order, though these levels don't contribute to the story line.\n\nIn order to compensate for the short story line, there is a challenge mode, where you replay certain encounters, but now they are scored based on your performance. You scored based on kills and other performances. Though there is a timer for these challenges, it doesn't really contribute much other than the fact that your time may be faster than others, for a similar score. Finishing a map in a longer time is no difference than speed running it. The best and worst part of these challenges are the playstyles they impose on you. In order to score high, you need to kill EVERYTHING. These challenges also include the stealth sections, so stealh here doesn't reward much, as you will lose out some points due to the lack of goons to kill, as compared to raising the alarm here. This doesn't really matter if you are playing the combat maps though, since you just need to kill all of them, as they already know your existance.\n\nAgain, like The New Order, this is a single player game only. There are no multiplayer modes here, so sorry to people who want to frag others with the Bombenschuss. Bonus mention here for nudity. No, there are none here, unlike the New Order. Sorry to disappoint.\n\nOverall this is a great single player FPS game, like The New Order. If you are a fan of Wolfenstein, or the New Order for those newcomers, or even single player FPS game, get it, especially when it's on sale. It will cost slightly more then The New Order even on sale, but it's worth it. Multiplayer fans will not enjoy this game at all.\n\nAuf wiedersehen, mein leben.","February 6","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fans of the franchise loved it and, as I am evidence of, it drew a significant number of new people into the shoes and crew cut of Blaskowicz. With the strong footing of The New Order as its backbone, the stand-alone The Old Blood seeks to expand upon the pseudo-reboot's immersive world and cast of characters.\n\nThe events of The Old Blood, without giving too much away, take Blaskowicz through a host of different areas, each with their own distinctive tone and color palette; large stone structures feel cold and foreboding, burning cities fill the player with increased levels of panic and stress, and underground caverns and ruins pluck the strings of the wary explorer that all gamers have within their hearts. However, no environment feels out of place in the alternate timeline. The art design and graphical fidelity maintain the quality presented in The New Order, making the stand-alone game feel like a cohesive part of the larger experience.\n\nAlong his journey Blaskowicz encounters a host of new characters, but since this is a cheaper experience and therefore shorter, none of them are capable of being developed into people you care about or truly fear. There are definitely moments where the game screams, "YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD THAT THIS IS HAPPENING" but there simply isn't enough time to form a significant bond with any of them. The same goes for the villains. Their appearances are few enough that tension has no time to build, and your hatred for them is nowhere near smoldering, despite them being interesting enough. Although the characters themselves may have been lacking, the ridiculous and criminally badass events that unfold more than make up for it. The end of the game even ties in directly to the opening events of The New Order which, as a fan of the game, I very much appreciated.\n\nRead the rest of my review at http://casualsgaming.com/2015/05/18/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review-type-a-positive/","May 18, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, for those unfamiliar with it, playing TNO isn't mandatory since it's a prequel.\n\nThe game is a FPS, that takes place during WWII along an alternate timeline, where the Nazis have perfected robotics, cybernetics and weapon-tech. Meaning you will find yourself battling robotic super soldiers, cyborgs and well equipped soldiers eager to tear your head off.\n\nWhile the game is a FPS, it does have many stealth elements. Sure, you can run in guns blazing and possibly survive. However the safer, and in my opinion way more fulfilling, is stealthing your way through certain locations. Why blast a heavily armored super soldier when you can sneak through some air ducts and get behind him to shut off his power? Why run through a kennel and battle cyborg dogs when you can sneak up to them while they sleep and silence them quickly?\n\nNo matter which route you go, if you are a fan of W:TNO, or FPS games in general you will probably love this game. It's not without it's faults though which I will list below, but first allow me to tell you what it does well.\n\nProsFlawless controller support\nIncredibly long for a 20 dollar game\nBreathtaking graphics\nExcellent voice acting\nFantastic Storyline\nVent Crawling!\nGood variety of enemies\nChallenging gameplay with adjustable difficulty levelsConsNo Multi-player\nInadequate Tutorial\nNot much replay value.\nOccasionally the AI can be a bit dimwitted\nNo manual save\nRATING: 7/10","July 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason why it's not the best is because it is too short. Unfortunately, there is nothing to do (except challenges which are pretty short) once you beat the campaign. However, the campaign was really amazing. There are two parts in the game, and each of them has their own story, characters and location. I prefer the first part, because it was more fun, and it was way longer than the second part, which feels kinda rushed. The first boss, Rudi Jäger, was very easy to beat and kinda disappointing. It just took a few shots to damage him, then all you had to do was finish him a couple of times. And the reason why he sends a whole army in the house, and comes with a heavy armor himself, is because you killed his dog. Another thing I didn't like, is the "choice" between saving Annette and Kessler. It is not even a choice because you randomly have to choose the path you will take, without knowing where each leads. Unlike most games these days, the final boss battle was actually hard to beat, and it didn't take like one shot to destroy it. I really loved the nightmare levels, which are hidden in each chapter. The nightmare levels are actually levels from the original Wolfenstein 3D, which were fun to revisit, except the final level, which contained only one room, with a "boss" that you can kill within 5 seconds.\n\n9.5/10\n\nChallengesChallenges are great to play when you finish the campaign. They're actually random parts of the campaign, except your goal is to get a high score to earn the medals. It's good, but they are a little bit repetitive because it's like replaying the campaign many times, in order to get the gold medal.\n\n6/10\n\nOverallTo be honest, I didn't pre-purchase DOOM because of this. But somehow, I'd choose this game's campaign over DOOM's, which is also great. You should get this game, there's no doubt you will like it. The only problem with it is that it's a bit too short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2K25/recommended/350080/","2K25","2K25","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2K25/","54 products in account","Product received for free\n\nCampaignThis is probably one of the best single-player campaigns I've ever played in a videogame. The reason why it's not the best is because it is too short. Unfortunately, there is nothing to do (except challenges which are pretty short) once you beat the campaign. However, the campaign was really amazing. There are two parts in the game, and each of them has their own story, characters and location. I prefer the first part, because it was more fun, and it was way longer than the second part, which feels kinda rushed. The first boss, Rudi Jäger, was very easy to beat and kinda disappointing. It just took a few shots to damage him, then all you had to do was finish him a couple of times. And the reason why he sends a whole army in the house, and comes with a heavy armor himself, is because you killed his dog. Another thing I didn't like, is the "choice" between saving Annette and Kessler. It is not even a choice because you randomly have to choose the path you will take, without knowing where each leads. Unlike most games these days, the final boss battle was actually hard to beat, and it didn't take like one shot to destroy it. I really loved the nightmare levels, which are hidden in each chapter. The nightmare levels are actually levels from the original Wolfenstein 3D, which were fun to revisit, except the final level, which contained only one room, with a "boss" that you can kill within 5 seconds.\n\n9.5/10\n\nChallengesChallenges are great to play when you finish the campaign. They're actually random parts of the campaign, except your goal is to get a high score to earn the medals. It's good, but they are a little bit repetitive because it's like replaying the campaign many times, in order to get the gold medal.\n\n6/10\n\nOverallTo be honest, I didn't pre-purchase DOOM because of this. But somehow, I'd choose this game's campaign over DOOM's, which is also great. You should get this game, there's no doubt you will like it. The only problem with it is that it's a bit too short. However, the campaign is still outstanding, and I recommend it to any shooter fan.\n\n9/10","May 14","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/recommended/350080/","bohlingc","Kahless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/","322 products in account","NOTE: This review contains some information about one of the boss battles in part 1 that might be considered a spoiler - I talk a bit about how to beat the boss in the contex of discussing a bug. I don't spoil the story or anything about the level.\n\nTL:DR summary at end\n----\n\nI really loved the New Order and thought it was probably the best single-player shooter since the first Crysis. The Old Blood is more of the same style of gameplay, but assembled in a less interesting manner. I really struggled whether to give this a recommended or not recommended, but ultimately the good just barely outweighs the bad.\n\nThe Old  Blood tells the story of what B.J. Blaskowicz was doing immediately before the assualt on Deathshead's compound that opens The New Order. B.J. has to infiltrate Caslte Wolfenstein to steal a folder that contains the location of this compound. Of course, things aren't that simple and B.J. has to escape the castle and fight his way through hordes of human, robotic, and supernatural enemies to survive.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-The shooting is great, actually better than TNO. They've added a "mash r to reload faster" mechanic which really gives the firefights a frantic tension. You can still dual-wield everything, which is awesome. I also liked using the pipe as a weapon and really enjoyed the grenade-lauching pistol, which is ultra-powerful but has scarce ammo. Just like in The New Order, the shooting is so much fun that it makes up for the significant problems with the game.\n\n-Excellent voice acting and characterization. The two main villans are especially compelling and better-written than Deathshead from TNO.\n\n-Stays in first person the entire time (excepting the very beginning and ending) which helps with immersion.\n\n-NPC design and the overall art design of the game is fantastic - Castle Wolfenstein has never looked cooler.\n\n-Good AI. Enemies will flush you out with grenades and try to flank you. You can't just stand behind some cover and take pot shots because they will sneak up behind you.\n\n-Great music, just like in TNO.\n\n-The difficulty is less spiky in this game. I beat both this and TNO on the "I Am A God of Death" difficulty, but while TNO felt like long stretches of very easy (but fun) sneaking around combined with occasional near-impossible boss fights, TOB is more consistently difficult run and gun (at least on the hard difficulties).\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Level design. This is the biggest area in which TOB falls short of the standard established by TNO. While the levels in TNO were all open environments that you could approach with a mix of stealth, sniping, and full frontal assault, the levels in TOB generally consist of a linear path between shooting gallery-style arenas. The arenas themselves are usually big and open, but you typically can't avoid getting detected within a few seconds of entering, so you're forced to use a run-and-gun approach nearly all the time. In the final level, I even kept getting "detected" when I was hiding in a cave out-of-view of any enemies, and I hadn't even killed anybody, so there weren't any bodies to find. It felt like it was scripted. There are a few areas, such as a cable car station and a graveyard, where you're able to be stealthy, but these are few and far between.  There's also a very linear stealth section at the beginning that's finicky to the point of annoyance.\n\n-Performance is considerably worse than TNO. I was able to play TNO maxed out on my i5-3470/970 system and get 60 fps 95% of the time. This game has more PC options (like various levels of AA and SSAO) but I wasn't able to keep a constant 60 even with AA X2, SSAO on medium, LOD Bias on medium, and PPF at minimum. I frequently saw drops to about 50 fps when lots of NPCs were on the screen, and during the final boss fight things got so intense it dropped below 30 and I had to knock everything down to medium just to make the game playable. This is extra frustrating considering the Id Tech 5 engine has terrible textures and looks 5 years out of date.\n\n-Several frustrating bugs. Most notably, I had a bug where I couldn't get out of the first area because a scripted ladder drop repeatedly failed to occur. I had to reboot the whole system to get it to work.\n\nI also had what seemed like a bug with a boss fight near the end of Part 1. This is part of a sequence where you fight a Supersoldier and then immediately fight another boss. The game auto-saves between the two bosses. After you fight the super-soldier, you can pick up his heavy gun and use it to fight the other boss. I didn't do this during my first attempt at the second boss, because I thought I was going to just be able to run around the second boss and escape. Then, when I re-loaded at the beginning of the second boss fight, the supersoldier's heavy gun was gone. I tried to beat the boss about 60 times without it, but failed. Then I looked up several playthroughs on Youtube and saw that the boss could be beaten fairly easily with the supersoldier's gun. It seems like that's what the game intends for you to do, so why doesn't the game give you the heavy gun when you respawn?\n\nI ended up having to turn it down to easy to get past this particular section. By contrast, I was able to get past all the other bosses and minibosses on "I Am A God of Death" in 5 attempts or less, so I don't think it's me sucking.\n\nTL:DR SUMMARY\n\nBetter than your average Call of Duty campaign, but much less fun than TNO. If you can only buy one, buy TNO. You'll appreciate TOB more if you've already played TNO.","May 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story itself is great but there are moments in the story/main campaign that feel a bit dull, luckly there aren't that many dull moments that detracts people from the main points of the story. The developers have even added hidden 'Nightmare levels' within each level of the campaign for a nostalgia trip back to the original 2d version of Wolfenstein. The only short comings I have with Wolfenstein: The old Blood is some replayability with the game and missed oppurtunities from the developers. The replayability in this game narrows down to replaying the story mode and challenge levels where story mode is the same thing over again, some people may enjoy this more than I did, and challege levels that don't feel rewarding to players who want to achieve Uber gold medals. The developers could have added Return to Caslte Wolfenstein and the original 2d wolfenstein games after completing the main story giving more replayability and even discovery for people who haven't played either of the two. I would recommend this game on a steam sale, free if you pre-order Doom, more than a full $20 (US) price because the short comings and amount of replayability the game has to offer will have some players feeling a bit of buyers remorse.","May 5","true","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed Wolfenstein the New Order and this is more of the same awesome game play with new areas, guns, enemies and textures. Been playing on a headset and the voice acting and sounds are very immersive. There are a variety of guns all of which feel really good and offer a variety of game play... the stealth mechanic in this game actually works very well if you want to play that way and sneak around. I however am a run and gun player and prefer rolling in with 2 assault rifles equipped, glad to have the options though, some situations require more stealth. A new add is the pipe wrench which is used a lot to climb walls and access various places. Graphics on the Id Tech 5 engine are my favorite out there, loved them since the release of Rage, textures and character models are top notch. Plenty of secrets, tidbits like a Doom Cacodemon in a laundry hamper and documents and things lying about to read and add some depth and story. Loving it, would definitely recommend to any gamer that is a fan of shooters.","May 5, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As TNO was suspiciously lacking in the Castle Wolfenstein department, TOB fills in that gap.  Gameplay is largely the same with Machine Games' modern take on classic FPS gameplay style and it still works great.\n\nTOB is a step backwards in some areas, but also brings the game closer to the classic Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  Gameplay is not as varied as TNO but still retains the same high quality.  Most of the game takes place in the castle or very similar locations as opposed to the variety of locations found in TNO.  This game is also lacking the large story choice offered in TNO.  A similar choice is offered late in the game here but has almost no impact on the game.  TOB does add one new weapon, a sort of explosive flare gun, as well as revamping the upgrade system so thankfully previous upgrades are no longer required to make progress on later ones.\n\nAlong with largely taking place in Castle Wolfenstein and the surrounding area, TOB brings back the nazis' persuit of the occult.  I probably shouldn't say more at risk of spoilers.  The story is written as well as TNO, though it is significantly shorter as expected for a release at 1/3 the price.  It still manages to be as long as the majority of full price FPS releases (depending on how you play of course,) putting them all to shame again.  In addition there is a new challenge mode which lets you replay some larger fights throughout the game to try to get the best score.\n\nThe one big problem this game has is performance.  Compared to TNO, I find myself needing to turn a few more settings down to stay at 60 fps and still drop below that during cutscenes and in a few specific places.  The final boss even dropped me down to about 35.  This by itself wouldn't be THAT much of a problem, just a bit of an optimization problem, but just like TNO the game stutters badly any time it drops below 60 fps.  I have yet to figure out what causes this or how widespread it is, but the general performance problems are very common and do not seem to be lessened by more powerful video cards.\n\nCompared to TNO, this game isn't quite as good but it still shines compared to other FPSs.  Do yourself a favor and play them both.","July 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

If anything, the supernatural take on things later in the DLC takes away from the serious tone set from the start, and just makes the calculated slaughter of Nazis just a little more fun.\n\nJoking aside, I've been playing the game on Uber straight from the start, which happens to compliment the games stealth areas quite nicely. Adding the risk of being caught potentially meaning a quick death, or making a split second decision to go all guns blazing, feels just as good now as it did before.\n\nDuel wielding has been met with some criticism by some, but I'm quite fond of it. Nothing fancy, nothing flashy, just a second pistol/rifle/shotgun/whatever. Just the same as before, and it doesn't really need an improvement.\n\nIt runs like butter. I'm not sure how the game runs for others, but on a GTX 670 and i7 3770k, it's an absolute treat. No stuttering, minimal manual tweaking of the game settings, it just works well.\n\nI'm probably missing quite a bit, but without getting into spoiler territory with story notes, it felt like something more than a coat of paint on The New Order. If you're looking for a 7-10 hour compliment to the base game, the DLC is a welcome treat to fans craving more.\n\n(P.S. This is a rare case. Story wise, you could play The Old Blood before The New Order, and not ruin either games story! If you want to try The Old Blood before The New Order, it's a cheaper way to prepare for an incredible game!)\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

You now can use a pipe to take down enemies, climb walls and open hatches. That's pretty much the only new addition in terms of gameplay - everything else is pretty similar. The weapons you get are mainly the old versions of your set in TNO, so there are no dual fires, which makes sense. You do get some new weapons like the Kampfpistol - a single-fire pistol with a grenade projectile, Bombenschuss - sniper rifle, and Schockhammer - shotgun. All enemies encountered in TNO are currently in their prototype stages here, which is also cool to compare.\n\nThe game again gives you the choice to play through the chapters stealthily or balls to the walls, however it does highly encourage stealth gameplay. It's all in how you want to play, though, so don't let the stealth-themed introduction throw you off. It contains eight chapters and five difficulty levels. Plenty of perks to aquire that add to the replayability.\n\nIf you enjoyed any other previous Wolfenstein title, it's a must-buy.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10","June 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The gameplay is incredibly addictive and fluent and nothing ever feels buggy. First of all, I would like to say that The New Order and The Old Blood has easily made their way into my top 10 games. This is what I would call SOLID games.\n\nHere's what The Old Blood has to offer:\n- Unlockable Perks\n- Challenge Mode\n- Collectibles\n- A few new guns\n- New characters\n- Old characters\n- Nightmare levels\n- Backstory\n\nThe two games play exactly the same, with one or two elements changed or added. Playing The Old Blood made me long for The New Order. This is because the game lacks story depth and character developement, but I suppose it's only fair since it's a DLC. It's certainly not as well versed as The New Order, but it's one of the best DLCs I have ever experienced. Most DLCs just feels like add-on content that should have been in the game but wasn't because it was unfinished. I would recommend playing the prequel first if you are looking for chronological order, but playing it second has a bunch of perks as well.\n\nBottom line: If you loved The New Order, you will most probably love The Old Blood as well!","May 26, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is incredibly addictive and fluent and nothing ever feels buggy. First of all, I would like to say that The New Order and The Old Blood has easily made their way into my top 10 games. This is what I would call SOLID games.\n\nHere's what The Old Blood has to offer:\n- Unlockable Perks\n- Challenge Mode\n- Collectibles\n- A few new guns\n- New characters\n- Old characters\n- Nightmare levels\n- Backstory\n\nThe two games play exactly the same, with one or two elements changed or added. Playing The Old Blood made me long for The New Order. This is because the game lacks story depth and character developement, but I suppose it's only fair since it's a DLC. It's certainly not as well versed as The New Order, but it's one of the best DLCs I have ever experienced. Most DLCs just feels like add-on content that should have been in the game but wasn't because it was unfinished. I would recommend playing the prequel first if you are looking for chronological order, but playing it second has a bunch of perks as well.\n\nBottom line: If you loved The New Order, you will most probably love The Old Blood as well!","May 26, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For those of you wondering, despite being a standalone game, The Old Blood does lead directly into The New Order, and given the oppurtunity I would absolutely recommend playing through The Old Blood first.\n\nThe Old Blood is an 8 chapter expansion that is suprisingly lengthy. My first playthrough took around 8 hours total to beat, though my second run took about half that time. During development, MachineGames took two individual ideas they had for expansion content, and combined them into one, giving us the two parts of The Old Blood: "Rudi Jager and The Den of Wolves" and "The Dark Secrets of Helga Von Schabbs". The first part is by far the more standard of the two, whilst the second part veers into the occult elements that were amiss in The New Order for the most part.\n\nGameplay-wise, you're getting pretty much the exact same core mechanics, expect with a technical downgrade. As the game takes place 10 years prior to The New Order, BJ Blazkowicz has a significantly more aged arsenal to utilize. Thankfully, it's pretty much just as effective, and features some interesting additions such as a bolt-action sniper rifle, a grenade pistol, and optional dual-wielded pipes. Combat is arguably tougher then The New Order, as BJ is more restricted in how effectively he can tackle opponents, though it's still as fluid and enjoyable as it was in The New Order.\n\nThe Old Blood suffers most in the story and visual design elements. Don't get me wrong, the game looks fantastic and provides a number of beautiful vistas that double as challenging levels, however the level of environmental storytelling has decreased significantly. As has the effectiveness of the story. If The New Order told a fantastic story, The Old Blood tells one with similiar ambitions, but it's restricted in its length. Characters here still possess a similiar amount of notable traits and witty and passionate dialogue, the problem is there really isn't enough in it to truly engage the player. I only found the game getting particularly heavy at the very end, during the transition into The New Order.\n\nDespite it's somewhat crammed and less effective story however, I still recommend it as a precursor to The New Order. The combat and overall flow of the game is excellent, and very reasonably priced for several hours worth of content. If you enjoyed The New Order, you'll likely just as much enjoy what's on offer here.","June 23, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So if you haven't played Wolfenstein: The New Order I suggest you play it first (YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED) and then come back to The Old Blood!\n\nIf you happen to look in my library you will not see Wolfenstein: The New Order... That is because I played it on my PS4. When W:TNO was released I was in the middle of reparing/uprading my gaming rig. Wolfenstein: The New Order looked so promising thast I bought it for my PS4... I wasn't in the least bit dissapointed as Wolfenstein: The New Order ended up being one of my all-time favorite games that I have ever played (sorry PC only people, but W:TNO looked pretty damn good on the PS4)... FPS or any other genre. The voice acting, graphics, level design, in-debth campaign, available weapons, character perks and everything else about the game are extremely incredible in every way! The character creation is so good that I can easily believe that every character that is in the game is a genuinely real-to-life person... Some of which I grew to care deeply about durring the course of the game. The devs doing this ables me to obsess over achieving victory and gives me a clear sense of urgency and what I am fighting for unlike any game that I ahve ever played. W:TNO gives me a sense of immersion unlike any other game I have ever played which is unbelievable for a FPS! The total experience and success that Wolfenstein: The New Order gave me is exactly why I bought Wolfenstein: The Old Blood!\n\nIt is extremely ashame that I am just now playing Wolfenstein: The Old Blood as I have had it in my library for a very long time now... For some very strange reason the game would not play on my rig. Well it played but not very well. I decided to wait a couple of months and then give the game another go around. Sure enough the game now plays up to standards and I can now reclaim the immersion that I experienced in W:TNO Although I have only polayed the game for about 4 hours I already know that I am gonna experience the same debth of immersion and feeling that I had with W:TNO. How do I know? Because I just do... It feels the same and plays the same and gives me that same sense of urgency to achieve victory. With new weapons, new and stranger enimies and new levels and enviornments I know that this game is gonna be great and I am gonna get my moneys worth and more!\n\nIf you played Wolfenstein: The New Order and totally loved every heartbreaking minute of it (heartbreaking because the ending was a tear jerker) you will definitely  enjoy Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. The only thing bad about the game is that you already know the fate of the hero... But although he dies, he dies for one helluva cause!","May 31","true","18.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On one hand, it is a mostly  enjoyable experience but on the other it's tough to justify its existence. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a major step back in every way from The New Order. It manages to be more linear, have less engaging combat, seemingly only has 4 or 5 different enemies & pointless stealth. You can run past every fight without a second thought. In fact, I managed to just run by several massive fights without an issue.\n\nThat being said, the guns feel great and the environments are so well designed that I found myself stopping just to observe and gawk at the scenery around me. The Old Blood is a very beautiful game. The game itself is also over before it truly begins. I managed to finish the game in around 3 and a half hours on normal difficulty (Bring it On). I guess that's to be expected for a $20 title but even so, it still felt way too short. Another major problem is that the final 2 chapters felt incredibly forced and underdeveloped. They seemed so out of place considering how the first 6 chapters and The New Order were handled. It left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI'm stuck between giving this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down. On one hand, I just listed a ton of problems I had with it but on the other I can't say that I had a terrible time either. I feel like if you want a very basic linear shooter that maintains the weapons and mechanics of The New Order, buy this. You won't get much in terms of lore & variety but you will get some dual wielded assault rifles & robo dogs. If that's all you're looking for then it does its job well. If you're looking for something even half as good as The New Order then you are in the wrong place.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game. It's just not a good followup to "The New Order". Not even in the slightest.","May 5, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"

The action is the same high quality shooting found in New Order and the map design is for the most part pretty decent.\n\nNow, before I get fuhrer into this review let me mention that my biggest gripe with this game was how it was marketed versus how it actually is. The trailer makes it look like a more lighthearted, kampfy experience. In truth, EVERY scene like that is shown in the trailer. All the other scenes and dialogue are the same broody New Order stuff including rehashed set pieces like being grilled by nazis while undercover and a prison break. They even have a pointless "Pick who to save" scene that is determined by whether you decide to wander down a left or right corridor with no real indication as to who is down either.\n\nOn to the technical stuff that bothered me. I did nazi much imporvement in the weapon diversity. Aside from the Kampfpistol nothing new really comes to the table and the older variants of the New Order gear are not particularly interesting.\n\nEnemies are basically identical to the New Order crew including those obnoxious shotgun heavies. The addition of the zombies really doesn't add much to the game though the way they interact with the power loader is pretty cool. I also want to give a special shout out to the developers for the most uninspired, ♥♥♥♥ boss fights I've seen in an FPS for a good while now.\n\nThis game is a decent pickup on sale just because it's a solid shooter in its own right. Would I recommend it for full price? Heil no.","January 9","false","6.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","7","15","5","1"

This game's a brilliant and... er, somewhat brutal... FPS by the people who know this series best.  As a prequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order, this game takes the story blurbs from Wolf3D and turns them into a full 2015 AAA release.  All I can really say about this reimagining is that they flippin' nailed it.\n\nComplete with excellent writing, villain introductions that would make Bond jealous, and gunplay that's a perfect mix of modern and retro, combined with excellent map design and a well-paced storyline, I simply can't recommend this game enough.  At $60 I could even recommend it, yet this game has been priced as a budget title from the start.\n\nThe only complaint I can really make is the final boss.  I won't spoil it, but it's a trope from the linear-shooter-fest days I would have rather seen gone, and it will probably take you several attempts to take down a Nintendo-style boss with only one weak point that's constantly moving.  I'm indifferent to it, but it's going to ♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off.\n\nPart of what this game does best is the tie-ins as a prequel.  Aside from the final cutscene, which pretty much leads directly into TNO, most of the story elements tie directly into last year's game, and there are even several reference you can really appreciate if you've played TNO already.  The easter eggs are also great, but it doesn't try to distract you from the game itself.\n\nYou're doing yourself a disservice by letting it sit untouched on the store page.  I'm not one for number scales, but if I truly had to this would be a 9/10.  It truly is excellent, one of the best games I've ever played in fact, and there's only so long you can go without giving it a shot yourself.  It loses a bit of steam in Part 2, sure, but it doesn't change the fact that it honors the famous franchise and further settles MachineGames in their place as a trusted developer for id's classics.","December 2, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The challenge mode is a bit lackluster as it only contains combat-heavy sections from the campaign itself.\n\nIt is more of the same really and I wish they had put in some interesting ideas or mixed things up a bit like what Blood Dragon did to Far Cry 3.

First of all, it really reminded me of RTCW, the atmosphere is there and going inside the castle one more time was a wonderful experience. Second, every chapter in the game has a hidden Wolfenstein 3D level....fully playable. Goose bumps?\n\nYou will see....just get it. It lasts about 10 hours without rushing the game. Play it on max difficulty. It really felt old school, you can die very easily, especially in the Wolfenstein 3D levels if you are not careful. Yes it felt kind of old school.\n\nYou can play this without having played The New Order. It is a prequel and it almost looks like a remake of RTCW (it is not).\n\nThe main difference with The New Order is the fact that 10 challenges (shooting challenges with hitpoints, combos etc) are there. If you played Call of Juarez: gunslinger, well the challenges are more or less exactly like the challenges in Gunslinger.\n\nGreat, great game.\n\nPro:\n- everything\n\nCon:\n- some bad textures due to the not so great graphic engine","June 15, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","6"

In many ways I actually prefer The Old Blood to The New Order.\n\nEverything that was good about The New Order is still here: solid gameplay, good combat, nazi killing fun, and enjoyable secret hunting. Quite a fair bit more stealthing sections than before, and they're better all around, which I consider a plus since I found the stealth sections in The New Order too short, and many of them largely inconsequential. Shooting your way through them is, of course, an obvious option as before (and required to get high scores in the one or two that return as combat challenges), but I appreciate the attention that has been given to the stealth sections.\n\nIt's a good deal shorter than the New Order, even if you spend time secret hunting, but for once the story is a coherent narrative - rather than just individual, albeit cool, set piece levels without any rhyme or reason. It pays considerable homage - and is essentially a remake of - the first quarter or so of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but the supposed supernatural is connected to the super science elements of The New Order: most people miss this though, since it's only confirmed in a few places (the letter in Helga's room at the tavern, for one).\n\nSure, nazi zombies as a game concept is scraping the bottom of the creativity barrel these days, but they're visually interesting - if not especially exciting to fight, without some live nazis to confuse the action thrown into the mix. Sometimes there are some live nazis as well for a good three-way fight, but the levels where you mainly find zom-zoms are 90% them and only a few live nazis. If nazi zombies is not your cup of tea, super science explanation or no, then stick with The New Order. The end boss isn't anything to write much home about, although I do love the Lovecraftian vibe - and, again, nothing much explicitly supernatural going on here, it's a man made construct though a lot more harder to swallow than the 10th century gas and the undead. Overall, I liked it all, but your mileage may vary.\n\nI preferred the combat challenge maps, the quick ability to replay those specific sections, and the scoring system therein that The Old Blood has to the game modes that the enigmas could unlock in The New Order. The weapons are largely the same as in the 1946 prologue of The New Order (obviously), with a few new ones thrown in - the pipe and Kampfpistole I find thematically interesting. The addition of the entire first episode of Wolfenstein 3D I loved, although the conversion does have certain lacks (the AI there can't open doors for some reason?!) - most noticeably how pitifully weak Hans is; still, enjoyable retro stuff if you're into it or for the nostalgia goggles (like me).\n\ntl;dr: Liked The New Order and nazi zombies aren't a deal breaker for you?

Shooting your way through them is, of course, an obvious option as before (and required to get high scores in the one or two that return as combat challenges), but I appreciate the attention that has been given to the stealth sections.\n\nIt's a good deal shorter than the New Order, even if you spend time secret hunting, but for once the story is a coherent narrative - rather than just individual, albeit cool, set piece levels without any rhyme or reason. It pays considerable homage - and is essentially a remake of - the first quarter or so of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but the supposed supernatural is connected to the super science elements of The New Order: most people miss this though, since it's only confirmed in a few places (the letter in Helga's room at the tavern, for one).\n\nSure, nazi zombies as a game concept is scraping the bottom of the creativity barrel these days, but they're visually interesting - if not especially exciting to fight, without some live nazis to confuse the action thrown into the mix. Sometimes there are some live nazis as well for a good three-way fight, but the levels where you mainly find zom-zoms are 90% them and only a few live nazis. If nazi zombies is not your cup of tea, super science explanation or no, then stick with The New Order. The end boss isn't anything to write much home about, although I do love the Lovecraftian vibe - and, again, nothing much explicitly supernatural going on here, it's a man made construct though a lot more harder to swallow than the 10th century gas and the undead. Overall, I liked it all, but your mileage may vary.\n\nI preferred the combat challenge maps, the quick ability to replay those specific sections, and the scoring system therein that The Old Blood has to the game modes that the enigmas could unlock in The New Order. The weapons are largely the same as in the 1946 prologue of The New Order (obviously), with a few new ones thrown in - the pipe and Kampfpistole I find thematically interesting. The addition of the entire first episode of Wolfenstein 3D I loved, although the conversion does have certain lacks (the AI there can't open doors for some reason?!) - most noticeably how pitifully weak Hans is; still, enjoyable retro stuff if you're into it or for the nostalgia goggles (like me).\n\ntl;dr: Liked The New Order and nazi zombies aren't a deal breaker for you? Buy it.","May 17","true","27.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Fun Nazi Shooter with excellent shooting mechanics. The music for this game is excellent as well. Only downside is Nazi Zombies entrance 2/3's of the way through making it less enjoyable and satisfying due to stealth pretty much impossible. I loved the game its very fun returning to Castle Wolfenstein again was a fun and enjoyable experience just let down by the Zombie segment. Would still recommend this to ANYONE wanting to get into Wolfenstein but doesn't want to pay the huge cost of the original (although The New Order is superior story wise).\n\n7/10","May 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Repeated failures had soiled the franchise, and I doubted it could ever wash away the taint of what it had become. But after an impressive trailer, I gave Wolfenstein: The New Order, a shot...\n\n... and I was blown-away by it. Tight gameplay, amazing graphics, compelling characters, an imaginative and thought-provoking story,  great dialog, great enemies, enjoyable tools and weapons with new and interesting game-mechanics, The New Order is one of the greatest FPS games in recent years.\n\nBut of course, this is a review of The Old Blood, not The New Order, but I wanted to give some context before diving in.\nThe Old Blood is a prequel to The New Order, released as a stand-alone. But its different in several key areas. The biggest, deviation comes from the Nazis. Wolfenstein seems to ping-pong between two varieties of Nazi: Tech Nazis, and Occult Nazis. Your personal preference will probably inform your preference between Old  Blood and New Order. Both are fantastic games, with amazing writing, gameplay, and characters... but the type of story, the tone, and the overall "feel" of the Wolfenstien world hinges on this. I personally prefer Occult Nazis, because it makes backstory so much more interesting, and I like the idea of the Nazis meddling in weird supernatural things that make them even more evil and sinister.\n\nAnd so, I give Old Blood a 9.5/10\n\nNow the specifics:\nExcellence Revitalization and re-imagination of an ages-old cherished IP, I think The Old Blood has succeeded in lengthening and reinforcing the Wolfenstein franchise's place in gaming history\nExcellent tight gameplay. Very responsive and natural controls removes barriers between the game the player\nExcellent graphics with nice immersive feel\nSatisfying weapons that the player will have fun using\nClever level design gets players to see epic events unfolding without needing to take-over the camera and perform a cutscene.

I think that having one (like in New Order) was fun, but they went overboard.\n\nConclusionClose to a perfect game. My only 2 major complaints are: too short, and Endgame needs to be better.

Everyone can kill more Nazis\n2.	Wolfenstein series fans will get an insight on what happened before the Return to Castle Wolfenstein\n3.	Drummers can play on Nazi skulls using a pipe\n4.

It is a bit short but there's enough content to justify the $20 price point.\n\nThe main complaint I have about it is that the story is both less interesting and less well presented than it was in The New Order. The "headquarters" chapters in The New Order where BJ does little fetch quests for the friendly NPCs are completely missing and that lack means that you don't get as drawn into the world, there are only a handful of friendly NPCs and you never get a chance to really know them.\n\nOverall this is a decent FPS and the combat does have a few minor improvements over The New Order so for that I think it's worth getting but it could definitely have done more with the plot.","May 19, 2015","true","29.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked New Order, it's more of the same. If you're new to the series, this is a great sampler to whet your appetite for the full title. Even better, it's a prequel. Old Blood ends right before the intro of New Order, so if you like it, you can pick up the full game and continue the storyline without skipping a beat.\n\nGameplay is a good mix of arcade shooting with grindhouse sensibility and some modern innovations. You can be a ghost and go through the map undetected with stabby stabby and shooting from cover with silenced weapons, or you can go in with blazing akimbo shotguns and rocket launchers. The transition between carnage and caution is seamless. There's something here for every kind of FPS gamer.\n\nPlus, like New Order, this game is surprisingly poignant. Old Blood is only a third of the length of New Order. It took me 12 hours to finish on the hardest difficulty with all ability upgrades and collectibles. However, you may find yourself caring about the characters despite only spending a few moments with them.\n\nIf you're already a seasoned vet of New Order, there are some cool new mechanics to interest you. You also get more Wolfenstein which is certainly nice. If you wanted to try New Order but the price tag was too much, Old Blood is a nice way to get a sampling for what's in store for you.\n\nGreat way to spend a weekend.","May 20, 2015","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked The New Order, you'll surely enjoy this.  The story and characters don't feel as tight or personal this time around, but they are still well done and all the voice acting is great.  A few new weapons help keep the combat fun and interesting to play with.  I had a lot of nostalgic moments both from the games "retelling" of the events inside the castle as well as the nightmare levels from Wolf 3D.  This game touches on a lot of story points from Return to Castle Wolfenstein in a much shorter game.  I played on the 2nd hardest difficulty and felt it was a good challenge.  I would recommend this to fans of all shooters as well as those wanting more of TNO style gameplay until Machinegames (hopefully) comes out with the next entry.\n\nA few notes:\n-Game ran perfect (never below 60fps) maxed out on my mid-high range system with a GTX780.\n-Stealth or Rambo, your choice!\n-Some funny interactions that I don't want to spoil.\n-Brainnnnnnnsssss...","May 17, 2015","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some improvements over The New Order, namely, no more unskippable intros before levels, and no more annoying quests like finding someone's toys or running similar errands. Gameplay is fun, just like in TNO.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe graphics have taken a giant step backward. W:TNO has much better graphics and runs perfectly smoothly on my system (4770K/GTX 680/16GB), without any texture pop-in. The graphics in W:TOB are significantly inferior (which would be understandable if there were a lot of complaints about the system requirements for TNO). The strange thing, however, is that now the texture pop-in is horrendous. It's really, really bad. I launched TNO just to see if it was a driver issue, but that still runs perfectly. I'm not the only one having texture pop-in problems, so something has gone very wrong in the QA department.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that the developers have removed the open, extensible nature of the engine, which is a large part of what made id games so much fun. I would have loved the ability to mod weapons, enemies, etc. But the console is artificially restricted - you can't change the values of cvars easily, i.e. you can't do set cvarname value. This makes no sense, because you can still do cvaradd cvarname value to change cvar values. I don't get the point of this.\n\nI still recommend this game, because it's still leagues ahead of most single-player FPS games today. But I really hope they fix the graphics glitches in the next installment, and make the game more open to modding. Modding is what keeps a game alive, long after people have grown bored of the vanilla version.Why would you not want that?","May 18, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You never get bored as the stealth/massacre/exploration/gag elements of gameplay are being constantly rotated. And it's possible to complete the story in about 7 hours at one breathtaking sitting.\n\nThe graphics are probably the same, but the game is way better optimized: no weird glitches or bugs. Even the infamous textures problem of the New Order is mostly fixed (it still surfaces from time to time, but it's nowhere as annoying).\n\nThe atmosphere of grotesque and dark yet somewhat funny alternative history permeates everything: it's in the brooding gray architecture, steely character design, theatrical antagonists, and NPC dialogues. The attention to detail is stunning, everything from posters to cigarette packs to historical artifacts contributes to this unique balance of grim and humorous.\n\nAll in all, it is the perfect tongue-in-cheek epic bloodbath, reminiscent of the games of old.\n\nWe definitely need more games like that.","May 17, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

One of the few games in recent memory I've played all the way through. Only have a few complaints. The stealth sections. Hate them. The whole stealth aspect feels forced in these types of games and not sure why developers feel obligated to include it in every game nowadays. Would rather it have been left out completely. I don't buy Wolfenstein games to crawl around and hide behind boxes just to throw a puny knife at my enemies. Give me shotguns and rocket launchers and mayhem please! To be fair, there is plenty of run and gunning. There are only a few sections where you really have to stealth. Also as others have mentioned there are a ton of items to be picked up in this game, unfortunately you have to press "E" to pick up every single one of them. Should have just automatically picked up the ammo for you at least. Other then that though the game looks and plays great.

(which could be fix by randomnes hey look i find a gun trope) so you have to turn off power generators to turn off robots. not exactly fun, and it over stays it welcome. and never really comes  back.\n\nafter that the stealth becomes more about taking out targets carefully, but  problems araise as guards don't protal to far from where you see them, making it really easy to kill off everyone.\n\nand loud\nthe best i can explain for this is you are constently moving for new cover and coming out to kill 5 or 6 people and running to new cover and grabbing medikits or ammo.  any thing you can get your hands on. while running over to a commander to try and  shoot him in the face so that he stops telling more nazi to come to the location........ which i just realize how backwards thinking that must be for B.J\n"I GOING TO KILL ALL THE NAZI'S" says B.J\n"♥♥♥♥ THEY FIND ME I MUST KILL THE NAZI COMMANDER,  SO THEY FORGET ABOUT ME!"

When I played New Order I quickly fell in love with its mechanics and story so I had high hopes for this prequel.  Old Blood really does improve on things in many respects -- better weapons, better stealth, improvements to the engine and a cool twist to top off the ending of the game make it a worthy prequel.  Only two minor negatives in my opinion:\n\n1) Not enough time with the supernatural elements of the game.  Most of the game is spent hearing bits-and-pieces about the "occult" elements within the game, but very little interaction until near the end and then it feels over rather quickly and abruptly.  Would have been nice to have a little more time with that part of the game...but, frankly, what's there is pretty great. Maybe they'll explore in additional DLCs or games?\n\n2) Sometimes the game isn't completely clear on what to "do" next.  There were a few times I found myself scratching my head over what the next step in the game or level was.  Usually didn't take more than a moment or so to make sense of what to do, but it wasn't always evident and brought an otherwise fast-paced game to a short halt.  But, again, didn't really ruin the overall experience.\n\nOne of the great things about this is how it literally bumps right into the beginning story of New Order.  It's a great device because I found myself wanting to jump right back over to New Order and play again (which I likely will soon) to keep the gameplay and story going.\n\nAll around, great DLC expansion/prequel and worthy of the franchise MachineGames and Bethesda have established.  I look forward to more (hopefully) in the future.","May 21, 2015","true","86.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It added more meat to the first game and brought back some occult themes that I had missed. On completion, I jumped straight back into the New Order where I noticed something that had been niggling me.\nMy 4790K / GTX980 rig easily maxed them both, and upon landing on the beach in the New Order my niggle was confirmed. In addition to the Old Blood having some instances of poor graphics early on, it is very devoid of lighting effects making it very "flat" and dated looking. The New Order is full to the brim with post processing effects and it shows, looking much better than the Old Blood. Sure the models & engine are the same, but the absence of those level of effects is clear to see.\nThe game also tends to play a bit too much on the lines of entering an area then being swamped by enemies before progressing to another area.\nThe game feels rushed and lacks the production polish of the New Order, however it does thankfully do away with the pointless finding objects levels and annoying cut scenes.\nDefinately worth getting though, it extends the New Order story by about 6 hours so playing right through both back to back is a much more rewarding experience.","May 15, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paskill/recommended/350080/","Paskill","Eoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paskill/","510 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order was one of the best games I played last year. It’s rich world, over-the-top style and fast-paced gunplay was second to none in a way shooters haven’t been in a while and with the lack of a sequel in sight, Wolfenstein: Old Blood is there to remind us why MachineGames made killing Nazis feel new.\n\nThe story takes place months before the events of New Order in two parts, with returning protagonist BJ Blazkowicz infiltrating a rebuilt Castle Wolfenstein to obtain the location of General Deathshead’s base. Though told in two parts, the story isn’t necessarily a tale of concurrent events, but is progressed through in a linear fashion. Old Blood’s story is pretty solid and while its five hour length doesn’t exactly lend itself well to the character development and pre-mission interactions in The New Order, it’s made up for in good dialogue between characters, as well as call-backs to other titles in the series and the excellent monologues that the main character delivers. Blazkowicz himself is again in the habit of talking to himself, but more about the things that remind him of his home and family, giving a closer look at how Blazkowicz possibly deals with the atrocities he witnesses and inflicts on Nazi forces.\n\n\nDespite Old Blood being a smaller game, its scope is huge for a downloadable. The game is chock full of set-pieces, but does a good job of balancing player agency within the set-pieces themselves. There’s a huge variety of environments that allow you to explore different pathways, coupled a huge amount of collectibles, in-game lore to read and more stealth or combat choice sequences. The issue with these sections performed in stealth is something I feel New Order suffered from; it’s too simple, therefore too boring. It again feels like a tacked-on option for players who want to choose a sneaky approach, but there isn’t enough depth to the stealth for it to feel satisfying. There are no vision cones, the AI is too docile to be any kind of challenge, nor is there great enough of a reward versus taking things loud for it to be anything more than it to feel like a last-minute addition, especially in certain sections where it becomes flat out repetitive and dull. Other than that, the combat still feels slick like its predecessor as well as inventive with new mechanics like using your new best friends; the pipes, to scale walls to get better vantage points and the ability take down bigger enemies without the need for bigger guns. I think overall the new mechanics don’t necessarily improve the game in any meaningful way, but are still adequate for what they try to do.\n\nThe weapons in Old Blood are a somewhat mixed bag, especially if you’re someone coming  from The New Order. Returning weapons like the assault rifle still feel great to shoot, but the new-old weapons feel exactly what they are – Old. Being weapons from the 40s rather than the 60s, they feel obviously inferior to the ones featured in the original game in retrospect, but do the job fine in this prequel setting. To name a few examples, the sniper slash assault weapon in New Order is replaced with a jacked up Kar98k, the rocket launcher assault rifle attachment is replaced with a pistol version of a grenade launcher and the double barrel shotgun from the intro of New Order is featured and at one point turned into a sawn-off, reducing its range. None of the new weapons offer anything besides the feeling of using old-school armaments and I feel like there could have been a bit more invention in creating something that only would have worked in the Occult-adoring confines of Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nOn the subject of the Occult, Old Blood introduces a new enemy that has shambled its way back from 2001’s Return to Castle Wolfenstein; Zombies. While they have been covered in the series before, this time zombies can come from simply killing a living Nazi soldier. It allows you to try and turn attention away from you to get in a quick shot at bigger enemies by turning a guy in the middle of a squad, but doesn’t last too long. As the story progresses, you’re forced to fight bigger waves of undead in tighter environments, but it becomes less of a challenge and more of a chore to keep pulling the trigger as you pretty much walk through small hordes using headshots or cut through them with shotguns.\n\nCriticisms aside, Wolfenstein: Old Blood is still a fine game, especially a fine downloadable. It doesn't really set out to reinvent the wheel, but being a smaller title for the price point, it’s certainly more than serviceable. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as The New Order fans probably will. For newcomers, this is definitely a slice of the new Wolfenstein experience you could use as a great jumping off point; just expect the tone to be a little less spooky when you start The New Order. Bottom line, if you’re looking for more Wolfenstein - this is more Wolfenstein. And that’s fine with me. I give Wolfenstein: Old Blood a 3/5.","May 15, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Blazkowicz's BACK again and his thirst for Nazi killing is never satiated!!!\nThis iteration of Wolfenstein is a direct standalone prequel to last year excellent Wolfenstein: The New Order.  As a huge Wolfenstein fan, I jumped into this new game right away! It is still being made by MachineGames, which the new studio composed of a few ex-developers from Starbreeze Studios (responsible for the critical acclaim hit "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay" and "The Darkness").\n\nThe Old Blood has you going into the infamous Castle of Wolfenstein! From there on, you're on a mission to steal information and well, things doesn't really go well for B.J.! He gets incarcerated and has to find his way out of the Castle! Further on, he has to save the faces of the town from those crazy Nazi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!\n\nSince the game is about halfway long compared to TNO, it naturally has less value to speak of. But the 25$ price tag for a standalone game, not requiring you to own TNO is a big plus!\n\n\nPROS:+Gameplay is still as good as it get!\n+Visually impressive (same engine as id Soft's RAGE, id Tech 5).\n+Castle Wolfenstein is the star in this game. Really ominously gorgeous!\n+Wolfenstein 3d Easter Egg levels.\n+25$ Retail price tag at release for a 10 or so hours, depending of the difficulty level. Took me 15 at second hardest setting.\n\nCONS:-No Quick-Save / Quick-Load function. Stuck with checkpoints and restarting whole level.\n-Difficulty spikes at some firefights.\n-Lackluster story and characters.\n-No replay value if you started the game on hard mode.\n\nOVERALL:TOB still doesn't have multiplayer just like TNO but not every game needs a multiplayer. The game has decent playtime for its budget price and should keep you entertained from start to finish. Compared to TNO, it is lacking in many aspects but at 25$, you can't really whine too much about that!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:If you liked Wolfenstein: The New Order, then you have to get this game. To all old schoolers, this game is a must in your library. Newcomers, you may get this game as well and then pickup The New Order to see where the story unfolds!\n\nRATING:7.5 / 10","May 18, 2015","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

(which could be fix by randomnes hey look i find a gun trope) so you have to turn off power generators to turn off robots. not exactly fun, and it over stays it welcome. and never really comes  back.\n\nafter that the stealth becomes more about taking out targets carefully, but  problems araise as guards don't protal to far from where you see them, making it really easy to kill off everyone.\n\nand loud\nthe best i can explain for this is you are constently moving for new cover and coming out to kill 5 or 6 people and running to new cover and grabbing medikits or ammo.  any thing you can get your hands on. while running over to a commander to try and  shoot him in the face so that he stops telling more nazi to come to the location........ which i just realize how backwards thinking that must be for B.J\n"I GOING TO KILL ALL THE NAZI'S" says B.J\n"♥♥♥♥ THEY FIND ME I MUST KILL THE NAZI COMMANDER,  SO THEY FORGET ABOUT ME!"

When I played New Order I quickly fell in love with its mechanics and story so I had high hopes for this prequel.  Old Blood really does improve on things in many respects -- better weapons, better stealth, improvements to the engine and a cool twist to top off the ending of the game make it a worthy prequel.  Only two minor negatives in my opinion:\n\n1) Not enough time with the supernatural elements of the game.  Most of the game is spent hearing bits-and-pieces about the "occult" elements within the game, but very little interaction until near the end and then it feels over rather quickly and abruptly.  Would have been nice to have a little more time with that part of the game...but, frankly, what's there is pretty great. Maybe they'll explore in additional DLCs or games?\n\n2) Sometimes the game isn't completely clear on what to "do" next.  There were a few times I found myself scratching my head over what the next step in the game or level was.  Usually didn't take more than a moment or so to make sense of what to do, but it wasn't always evident and brought an otherwise fast-paced game to a short halt.  But, again, didn't really ruin the overall experience.\n\nOne of the great things about this is how it literally bumps right into the beginning story of New Order.  It's a great device because I found myself wanting to jump right back over to New Order and play again (which I likely will soon) to keep the gameplay and story going.\n\nAll around, great DLC expansion/prequel and worthy of the franchise MachineGames and Bethesda have established.  I look forward to more (hopefully) in the future.","May 21, 2015","true","86.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

While clearly different games, the atmosphere of terror (especially on the hardest difficulty) and the emphasis on stealth gameplay is very similar. I'm absolutely loving it.\n\nOld Blood performs incredibly well on my high-end rig and feels like something fresh (as an expandalone) to a game I already loved! Fantastic so far. So much content for such little cost, and I know pricing reviews are useless, but I am impressed for the content / cost ratio right now.\n\n105 min - some stuttering experienced, which should not be happening. Otherwise, game continues to fascinate with great environments and slick gameplay.\n\n3 hours - the only thing I have left to comment on is the stellar sound design. Especially obvious during stealth, boards creak, boots thud and soft, creepy music lurks in the background. Use headphones for this one, it sounds amazing.\n\n6 hours (finished) - what an incredible feeling this is. An emotional, serene ending to an incredible game. Stuttering seemed unique to chapter 3, which featured some odd level design. All 7 other chapters were incredible, with gorgeous visuals, amazing characters and disturbing music.

One of the few games in recent memory I've played all the way through. Only have a few complaints. The stealth sections. Hate them. The whole stealth aspect feels forced in these types of games and not sure why developers feel obligated to include it in every game nowadays. Would rather it have been left out completely. I don't buy Wolfenstein games to crawl around and hide behind boxes just to throw a puny knife at my enemies. Give me shotguns and rocket launchers and mayhem please! To be fair, there is plenty of run and gunning. There are only a few sections where you really have to stealth. Also as others have mentioned there are a ton of items to be picked up in this game, unfortunately you have to press "E" to pick up every single one of them. Should have just automatically picked up the ammo for you at least. Other then that though the game looks and plays great.

It added more meat to the first game and brought back some occult themes that I had missed. On completion, I jumped straight back into the New Order where I noticed something that had been niggling me.\nMy 4790K / GTX980 rig easily maxed them both, and upon landing on the beach in the New Order my niggle was confirmed. In addition to the Old Blood having some instances of poor graphics early on, it is very devoid of lighting effects making it very "flat" and dated looking. The New Order is full to the brim with post processing effects and it shows, looking much better than the Old Blood. Sure the models & engine are the same, but the absence of those level of effects is clear to see.\nThe game also tends to play a bit too much on the lines of entering an area then being swamped by enemies before progressing to another area.\nThe game feels rushed and lacks the production polish of the New Order, however it does thankfully do away with the pointless finding objects levels and annoying cut scenes.\nDefinately worth getting though, it extends the New Order story by about 6 hours so playing right through both back to back is a much more rewarding experience.","May 15, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paskill/recommended/350080/","Paskill","Eoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paskill/","510 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order was one of the best games I played last year. It’s rich world, over-the-top style and fast-paced gunplay was second to none in a way shooters haven’t been in a while and with the lack of a sequel in sight, Wolfenstein: Old Blood is there to remind us why MachineGames made killing Nazis feel new.\n\nThe story takes place months before the events of New Order in two parts, with returning protagonist BJ Blazkowicz infiltrating a rebuilt Castle Wolfenstein to obtain the location of General Deathshead’s base. Though told in two parts, the story isn’t necessarily a tale of concurrent events, but is progressed through in a linear fashion. Old Blood’s story is pretty solid and while its five hour length doesn’t exactly lend itself well to the character development and pre-mission interactions in The New Order, it’s made up for in good dialogue between characters, as well as call-backs to other titles in the series and the excellent monologues that the main character delivers. Blazkowicz himself is again in the habit of talking to himself, but more about the things that remind him of his home and family, giving a closer look at how Blazkowicz possibly deals with the atrocities he witnesses and inflicts on Nazi forces.\n\n\nDespite Old Blood being a smaller game, its scope is huge for a downloadable. The game is chock full of set-pieces, but does a good job of balancing player agency within the set-pieces themselves. There’s a huge variety of environments that allow you to explore different pathways, coupled a huge amount of collectibles, in-game lore to read and more stealth or combat choice sequences. The issue with these sections performed in stealth is something I feel New Order suffered from; it’s too simple, therefore too boring. It again feels like a tacked-on option for players who want to choose a sneaky approach, but there isn’t enough depth to the stealth for it to feel satisfying. There are no vision cones, the AI is too docile to be any kind of challenge, nor is there great enough of a reward versus taking things loud for it to be anything more than it to feel like a last-minute addition, especially in certain sections where it becomes flat out repetitive and dull. Other than that, the combat still feels slick like its predecessor as well as inventive with new mechanics like using your new best friends; the pipes, to scale walls to get better vantage points and the ability take down bigger enemies without the need for bigger guns. I think overall the new mechanics don’t necessarily improve the game in any meaningful way, but are still adequate for what they try to do.\n\nThe weapons in Old Blood are a somewhat mixed bag, especially if you’re someone coming  from The New Order. Returning weapons like the assault rifle still feel great to shoot, but the new-old weapons feel exactly what they are – Old. Being weapons from the 40s rather than the 60s, they feel obviously inferior to the ones featured in the original game in retrospect, but do the job fine in this prequel setting. To name a few examples, the sniper slash assault weapon in New Order is replaced with a jacked up Kar98k, the rocket launcher assault rifle attachment is replaced with a pistol version of a grenade launcher and the double barrel shotgun from the intro of New Order is featured and at one point turned into a sawn-off, reducing its range. None of the new weapons offer anything besides the feeling of using old-school armaments and I feel like there could have been a bit more invention in creating something that only would have worked in the Occult-adoring confines of Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nOn the subject of the Occult, Old Blood introduces a new enemy that has shambled its way back from 2001’s Return to Castle Wolfenstein; Zombies. While they have been covered in the series before, this time zombies can come from simply killing a living Nazi soldier. It allows you to try and turn attention away from you to get in a quick shot at bigger enemies by turning a guy in the middle of a squad, but doesn’t last too long. As the story progresses, you’re forced to fight bigger waves of undead in tighter environments, but it becomes less of a challenge and more of a chore to keep pulling the trigger as you pretty much walk through small hordes using headshots or cut through them with shotguns.\n\nCriticisms aside, Wolfenstein: Old Blood is still a fine game, especially a fine downloadable. It doesn't really set out to reinvent the wheel, but being a smaller title for the price point, it’s certainly more than serviceable. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as The New Order fans probably will. For newcomers, this is definitely a slice of the new Wolfenstein experience you could use as a great jumping off point; just expect the tone to be a little less spooky when you start The New Order. Bottom line, if you’re looking for more Wolfenstein - this is more Wolfenstein. And that’s fine with me. I give Wolfenstein: Old Blood a 3/5.","May 15, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You once again play as Blazcowicz as you try to infiltrate the infamous "Castle Wolfenstein" in search of intel on the nazi war machine. I think that its a little better than the new order, because its very fast paced. The thing I did not like is the fact they abuse stealth sequences, I mean you can either take that aproach or go completely "Rambo-mode",but the fact is that they sometimes force you to be stealth or you have to restart the level and it gets plain annoying (unless playing on mein leben difficulty). The fact is that some enemies are not meant for stealth sequences. Like the shotgunner for example. Shotgun soldiers are a great idea in FPS games so it makes you feel that your not the only one using a shotgun. I see it in HL2 with combine shotgun soldiers for example, but this is where they screw it up: THEY GIVE THEM TO MUCH HP!!! IT MAKES THEM A PAIN TO DEAL WITH, plus you can't do a take down on them which really sucks, plus in my eyes the shotgun soldiers look more like the pyro from tf2 then shotgun soldiers. Here is something with the AI that sucks too (Well of course Bethesda made this so the AI is going to suck), When you are sneaking around and you are right in an enemy's field of vision they just sit there and act like you do not exist. HOW UNREALISTIC IS THAT... Word of advice to Bethesda: Improve your AI. Surprisingly though, because its a bethesda game I expected it to be like Fallout 4 and have tons of bugs and glitches, but instead the only bug I came across was a "Panzerhund" not attacking me and standing still. Otherwise it was a smooth playthrough and I expirienced no bugs or glitches. Good work on that devs. Combat like the new order is still very, very smooth which makes it easy. I like FPS games with smooth gunplay, plus just like new order the muzzle effects and recoil of your gun seems so real. Its feels as if you are actually shooting it. Which I enjoy the realism. The game also included a bunch of minigames which made you find other routes to the end of the level in a set amount of time which gives the player a challenge to have them beat other players in these minigames, and I like that idea. There are and abundance of easter eggs too, like a skyrim helmet, doom plush toy, and much, much more! The weapons are nice as well. The minute I kill one of those murder bots. I pick up his weapon and I'm like: "MG-42 MINIGUN!!! SWEET!!!" the assault rifle is a pimped out STG44, and\nthere is a jacked up Kar98k. The weapons were awesome and made me guess what real life ww2 weapons they could have originated from. One of the weapons I really like is the lead pipe, because not only can you smack people over the head with it (obviously) If there is a damaged wall you can use the pipes to climb it! I loved this aspect and thought it was pretty cool. Over all the rating I give Wolfenstein: The Old Blood on a 1 to 5 scale, a 4/5, because while it has sweet mechanics to it. It still needs work in areas like AI improvement, nerfing of certain enemies, bug fixing of that Panzerhund fight at the checkpoint to Castle Wolfenstein, and less stealth sequences. Thats my opinion of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. I hope Machine Games and Bethesda continue to make expansions to there single player games as it tells a bit more of a story to the base game...","May 8","true","14.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For those who are continuing the franchise, definetly get it but I suggest waiting for a sale. However, it is a game I would recommend anyone to get who enjoys World War II variants and killing Nazis.\n\nPrimary Mechanics: Gameplay and AIAfter completing this game over two playthroughs on the hardest difficulty "Uber" I can say that the enemy mechanics are much more polished than the predecessor in some regards.\nThe enemy takes advantage of flanking routes much more often. There would be many times where advancing down one path to root out an enemy defensive emplacement would end up on the other flank quickly relocating to get behind me, and in many cases manning defensive guns if they were there or throwing a fury of grenades to cover their comrades. This is a trait I haven't seen in many shooters and actually provides a much needed challenge to the game.\n\nOfficers no longer call in an endless stream of reinforcements and actually have a delay before calling in additional soldaten compared to The New Order where the instant they became alerted to you, they started raining down fresh soldaten like it was a sales pitch.\n\nEnemy variation is much more mixed on most levels. Where most of the time you would face either only light infantry or heavy infantry, now they almost always come in a 2:1 ratio of light to heavy. Heavy shock infantry now seem to tank damage for the light unarmored infantry to advance allowing the entire force to spread over a wide area to pin you down, again another mechanic I haven't seen in many first person shooters and well done.\n\nMAJOR SPOILER!!!! Zombies have a mixed agro of charging attacks and stumbles unlike most versions where they only have a single form of attack move adding some additional challenge when in close quarters.Another welcome addition is the overall improvement to the stealth feature. While again there are some unreal moments where killing someone/leaving a corpse in front of a patrol and them not even noticing is still there, the overall detection of the enemy is much improved making it more of a challenge and forcing a player to always be aware of their every movement.\n\nOne thing I would say I did not appreciate though was only one "new" weapon which takes place of a dual knife, the pipe. You find this very early in the game and it sticks with you in addition to the game relying heavily on its use. Sure it's a decent weapon and a requirement to complete every mission but for a prequel inside of a GIANT RESEARCH BASE there was a massive lack of new weaponry.\n\nThe perk tree overhaul is different from the last one in some perspectives and not a complete rerinsing which meant some new mechanics were introduced on a fully upgraded player but many of them over very little to the player to use so accomplishing the tasks is often not recommended unless you want the achievements. Compared to the predecessor, the perk tree was a dissapointment because it had no real benefits. Also the grenades are very underpowered and unless you plan on baiting a bunch of enemys to try and melee you, hard to kill three with one grenade.\n\nThere's added humor if you listen to every conversation between each pair of soldaten you meet so I suggest not killing anyone who has a speech line until after they finish. Particularly the two soldaten in the wine cellar, if you play the game you will thank me for not ruining this moment.\n\nThe StorylineThere were many emotional moments added by the developers into this storyline much like in The New Order which were well done. I won't list them for spoiler reasons but those of you who have played the game would probably agree that they leave mixed feelings despite being well executed. The overall mission changes slightly and moves smoothly with little to no major setting changes which is nice since it matches the story of being a Castle Wolfenstein game and remaining in Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nFor those that never played the pre-sequel, there is a lot of information and character building that helps you understand events that happen in the seq-prequel in addition to covering up any "oopsies" that might have happened in making a previous timeline from an already compelted one. It also does a nice job of not really spoiling anything if you again didn't play the other title so job well done.\n\nThe VerdictDefinetly a must have when on sale and a good challenge for those who like the franchise. There's a lot more fun in using the old flashbacks for the nightmare which is essentially a game in-of-itself.\nCategoryScore out of 10Graphics8Storyline9.5Voice-Acting10Difficulty6.5Overall Score8.5-9","September 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only you, the last of the Blazkowicz bloodline, have the power to wield the holy might of the legendary gun, the Nazi Killer, and with its power you must infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and put an end to the menace, banishing it for another century.\n\nOr something like that.  Look, there were Nazis and guns, alright?  The game just sort of assumes you know how to combine them the right way.\n\nThe GameVery straightforward shooter with a small cast of weapons and enemies.  On your team you've got the usual culprits: Pistol, Shotgun, Machine Gun, etc.  If you're feeling frisky you can really go off the rails with Bolt-Action Rifle.  The enemy will field against you almost exclusively Nazi With Machine Gun but will occasionally throw you off by deploying Armored Nazi With a Shotgun.  In classic Wolfenstein fashion Dog makes an occasional appearance too.  To the game's credit: in the last quarter of it they finally loose something particularly new (to the game, not to the lore or genre), and it's nice.  Environments, at least, get some good variation.\n\nFor the most part you proceed room to room to room, and through most rooms you are given the option to either stealth it out or just blast your way through.  Objective markers helpfully direct you to point B to point A along the straight line that is the path you must weave.  There's no need to burden yourself with worry over the usual health/armor/ammo system; turns out in the 1940's they used to build castles not out of bricks and stone but out of medpacks, ammo crates, full suits of kevlar.\n\nSo, more or less: everything old is old again.  Not that it's any bad.  The game does nothing poorly.  The situation is exactly as I said in the start: it gives you exactly what it says it's going to and no more (or less).\n\nThe SummaryIf you got it for free with DOOM, like I did?  Recommended.  Otherwise, not really recommended unless you are an unquenchable fan of storing your bullets in warm Nazi bodies, have a WWII-themed action hero fetish, or you find a bargin bin discount.","June 5","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You know what you're getting into with this game. If you haven't I suggest playing that first but if you decide to jump into this standalone expansion, prepare for solid idTech graphics, punchy guns that feel great tearing through zombies and lots of gibfests with the more powerful weapons in your arsenal. It's mindless fun with excellent shooting and a solid story that you'll want to see through to the end. To say that's it's relatively brief is not in context of others games. You'll easily get 8+ hours of a good time and that's without searching for all the gold collectibles. Which honestly, add nothing to the experience. All in all, you could do worse spending a 10 spot on this and I recommend it to anyone looking for a predictable (gameplay-wise) yet quite fun shooting gallery of Nazis. And let's be honest, everyone's favorite thing to shoot is Nazis.\n\nMy one gripe is that you know when you enter a large room, it turns into an arena of shooting all the bad guys to progress to the next area. Minor but it is a relic of gameplay's past that I'd prefer was more elegantly folded into the flow of the game.","June 3","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Old blood is a prequel to wolfenstein new order, that was my favourite fps in years and game of the year of 2014 and I have to say Old Blood satisfied my lust for more nazi blood. The levels are more complex and the enemies are plenty, it's a first person shooter fans dream. The chapters/levels are nice designed and every location is highly detailed. The new guns are fun to use, especially the bombenshuss, which is a step son for sniper rifle in new order and the handy rocket launcher is a total blast to play with, quite literally I might add :) The story is somewhat lackluster when comapred to the original, but it is satisfying enough if you pay attention to the letters and dialogs between various nazi soldiers, especially the grammar nazi :) There are lots of easter eggs hidden in the old blood, the exploration is really well done, there are a ton of collectibles hidden around the chapters and overall it's a complete package. I paid 19.99 euro for it when it was available for preorder and I don't regret it. I loved it so much that I even bought a boxed copy along with a nice set of BJ's dogtags. I finished the game on my first playthrough within almost 10 hours, but that's because I like to explore and search for hidden treasure and enjoy the beauty of this marvelous game.\nI would recommend this game to any fps fan most definitely and without a doubt. Iam off to play the game again to find collectibles I didn't manage to get on my 1st playthough and to earn some achievements and I will also try the new challenges that seem like fun.","July 5, 2015","true","18.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

One of the main appeals to The Old Blood is that many of the lengthy, cinematic sequences of The New Order have been cut down; the game is almost in a "Half-Life" style now: Meaning, apart from BJ's embarassing tendency to get re-captured, most of the game is a continuous first-person viewpoint, with no "mission briefing and flight to ZanziSchtungWhateverVille" to get to the next mission. I expect the main storyline will be a little bit short, but even so it has plenty of setpiece moments and even an array of Perks to aim for (completing special combat challenges to get little advantages; ie, if you ever kill 3 enemies with one grenade, you can carry more grenades)\n\nThe game also comes with an "arena mode" that involves fighting through a particular room of the game; I've tried it once, but it might have limited appeal.","May 7, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game goes back to that feeling and I loved it. more shooty less feely. though this game feels weird when sticking to the lore of RtCW. (BJ acts like he has never been to the Castle, nor does anyone acnowlege is first escape. Super Soldiers seem downgraded for some reason)\n\n7.5/10 short but a lot like RtCW\n\nPS.

The plot in this one is kinda similar to Return To Castle Wolfenstein. The game is packed full of easter eggs and nods to other famous games, and it is more lighthearted than New Order, in a good way (plenty of jokes and humour, while retaining its credibility thorughout the whole run. Don't get me wrong, i loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of New Order, this one is just awesome in a different way). The gameplay is solid, the guns look and sound awesome and they really all pack a punch, unlike its predecessor (now the shotgun is actually quite useful, and there's not that bloody boring laser-cutter thingy). The bad guys look as bad as B-movie bad guys should look. The soundtrack is cool and the settings really well made and with loads of details. As everyone says, it's not a very long game but it's well worth its price, and i will recommend it to everyone who loves old school fps games and shooting nazis (and mutant nazis and zombie nazis and dog nazis and so on).","May 8","true","28.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Somehow the style of writing and what was said told me to not to buy The Old Blood. I forgot and went ahead in the last sale.\n\nThus far it is just generic. Nothing interesting has happened.

Thirty of those minutes had me feeling like I was playing a console game: very predictable gameplay; action events like "Press E to pick up the radio microphone" (this actually happens) make me sick in 2015; and everything kind of looks like garbage because it's the Id Tech 5 engine which was a recent flop—the engine is capped at 60 FPS by design and just about nobody has developed games for it.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, as I actually enjoyed The New Order. This just feels way too familiar, and maybe that's a good thing for some players. However, not me, at least not right now, as I have a lot of other games from Summer Sale 2015 that I'll spend time on instead.\n\nIf you see my gameplay time rise above the 30-minute mark, I played it in Big Picture mode in my living room, with a controller, and with some adult beverages.

The kills come too easy to be satisfying.\n\nBut that's no worry in the short term because there's a very long starting sequence where you "stealth" around giant armored robots while activating switches. It's slow paced and pretty damn boring for quite some time before the action starts.\n\nThere's also a new clinbing mechanic where you have to worm your way up specialy marked walls by alternating right click and left click. It's easy, it's slow and it's everywhere. I don't know who thought this would be fun... he was wrong.\n\n\nI'm farily disapointed in this game.

It's half long as it's predecessor and double boring. The storyline is very weak and almost doesn't make sense. The finale is atrociously pathetic and has nothing to do with the pseudo-story. The sound and music ambient are one of the little things that the devs got right. The graphics ambient is also very good, BUT again they used a crappy graphics engine. I can't avoid talking about the ID Tech 5 engine. A very old graphics engine that has nothing to offer these days compared to many other outstanding ones! The fact that this engine doesn't even support SLi leaves no chance on running this game on full detail with ANY GPU. AA option destroys the framerate as weird as it works (only 30FPS or 60FPS jumps, no middle ones). The developers tried to polish a  little this engine filling the graphics options with a lot of tweaks that can't be used at full, and it almost shines, but it fails and ends ruining the experience. It's a shame they hurried and again used this crappy engine... So why the devs took the work to make an excellent graphic detail on a game that uses this engine and cannot experience it at that detail? I don't know... at least is somewhat cheap...but it doesn't justify the monstrous size of the game!","May 13, 2015","false","11.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I've pre-ordered the game so it cost me less and I would definitely say that it's worth the cost. Here's my mini-review:\n\nLike Wolfenstein: The New Order, The Old Blood merges modern military shooters with old school single player FPS and the result is a glorious FPS gameplay that both feels fresh and nostalgic.\n\nGood:\n-More of the same. If you loved TNO, you'll still love this.\n-Delves deeper into the occult. Whereas TNO is about Deathshead, this about the SS Paranormal Division last seen in Return to Castle Wolfenstein.\n-Oh, if you love RtCW, have recently played it, or just remember it fondly, you will LOVE THIS. I won't spoil anything though.\n-There's a minor branch in the story that's integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, so that's kinda cool\n\nBad:\n-Not enough character development this time around. However there are still memorable characters around\n-ENDED TOO SOON!\n\nVerdict\nIf you love TNO, or looking to buy TNO but want a taste of what it's about first, get this!","May 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

There is nothing, absolutely no content of this game that would make it qualify as an 'old school fps'. This is a forced stealth section, regenerating health, cover based, corridor crawling, perk system, trinket collecting, sequence pattern bosses, bosses with constantly respawning mobs, quick time events, full of zombies, meaningless choice system having modern fps. This game is up to it's eyeballs in every bad modern fps idea and even worse most of these bad ideas have been executed better in cheaper products.\n\nThe Blood Dragon expandalone was at least funny. There is no humor in this, it's dryly written and performed by a disinterested cast. And it's 6 hours long, not 8. It also has broken multimonitor mouse support and you will want to winlogo+P and run the game on a single screen otherwise it will keep minimizing on you.\n\nYou can tell this is a rushed product because the pathfinding on enemies is completely broken. When you reposition you will often run into 8-10 Nazis all piled up in a hallway because they can't even navigate the arenas properly. I paid $10 for it and it wasn't worth free.

All those doors and gates that are locked could have made for some nice secret searching for switches while maybe a naxi or two respawned behind you.\n\nMy runner up grief is that this game smells like,, tastes like Return to Castle Wolfenstein but it's more like a Pepsi 0.35. Some parts of the game are straight ripped out of RtCW, while some things are dearly missing. It's little stuff but that made RtCW so fun to play and replay over and over again.\nLike for example the harnesses of knights, could you topple them over and even get hurt by them in RtCW, now they are just backdrop, stunning but non intractable at all. Same goes for the houses in the old town. Remember snooping around off the written path in RtCW, unpossible in the Old Blood.\n\nAnd as written the "secrets" are spoon fed. "You've found a secret room!!" Yeah, golly (rolling eyes), how could I missed it in this pipe that only goes from 'A' (begin level) straight to 'B' (end level).\n\nBut my biggest gripe is that there is an auto save but no personal saves are possible. Skip the next part between the "==="if you like, it gets tedious quick:\n===\n(I play stealth mode if a game allows me to)\n\nI stand before a grate with the wrong weapon in my hand, I switch my weapon to the stealth gun and crawl through the grate. It's some sort of Library I'm in need to find some place to hide. I hide behind a bookshelf and try to peak around the corner. F*! I'm caught, with 2 commanders somewhere still alive this is going to be messy and not stealthy at all so I exit and try again.\n\nI stand before a grate with the wrong weapon in my hand, I switch my weapon to the stealth gun and crawl through the grate. It's some sort of Library. Hiding did't work last time so I keep moving while crouching. F*! I'm caught, with 2 commanders somewhere still alive this is going to be messy and not stealthy at all so I exit and try again.\n\nI stand before a grate with the wrong weapon in my hand, I switch my weapon to the stealth gun and crawl through the grate. It's some sort of Library. There's a stairway up, let see if I can make it up there without being caught. Made it!. Ok peak around the corner and see a soldier walk up and down. Wait, wait... ok sneak behind him and kill him silently. Oh Sh*t almost got caught by one commander that is *behind* me. Ok, no panic, crawl back and sneak up to him. Ahh, gotcha you dirty rotten.... Ok, sneak around, no secrets, check behind the door... F*! I'm caught, with 2 commanders somewhere still alive this is going to be messy and not stealthy at all so I exit and try again.\n\nI stand before a grate with the wrong weapon in my hand, I switch my weapon to the stealth gun and crawl through the grate.\n===\n\nYou probably get the point, in the end I made it but was frustrated. With a personal save system it would had been less and less annoying. Not everybody is a l33t gamer and I certainly am not one. Games should be fun, not frustrating, right?\n\nLast things, once you alert the bad guys, there are no bad women (just 1 old one) as in RtCW (are we going PC here?), the AI knows exactly where you are, even if you hid and tossed a grenade, bouncing of some walls before exploding, it knows exactly where you are.\n\nAnd then there is the absolute ":meh" ending, a monster like we have seen in FEAR 3, Dead Space 2, Mass effect 2? 3? (I forgot) that's for some reason born without anything below the chest. No wonder they're grumpy! I'd be too, stuck in there with no way to get out, then some idiot starts shooting you, and don't get me started about the sudden spawning in naxi's who should have more on their mind (a huge 1/2 monster perhaps?) then just perfectly spotting/shooting poor little me.\n\n\nThe Old Blood looks smashing, runs great on older hardware, is great fun (for a short while) if you want to mow down row upon row of naxi's, but ultimately lacks in depth, with not much we haven't seen before, and little left to do else on your way out of the level moving almost in a straight line from 'A' to 'B'.","May 19, 2015","false","16.1"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","16","39","2","1"

I am already over the entire game just because there are these ridiculous power-suit armor guys with miniguns that patrol the halls back and forth. All you have is a pipe. They incorporate these stupid platforming methods where you have to find their generator that powers each super soldier, and power it down to get past them or kill them. All this does is slow down the gameplay and consists of hiding behind stuff, waiting for the patrolling dude to turn around, power down generator, then kill move on and oh another one!

So what did I think of The Old Blood?\n\nIt fell flat on its face and failed to deliver.\n\nThe game started off really strong, it had all the aspects I loved in The New Order: Great enemy design and distribution, intense and tactical gunplay, decisive combat switching between man-mode and stealth and level designs that actually felt improved with several different routes and hidden secrets. It built up the foundation for a good story, a main villain to target and a secretive project.\n\nThe new weapons added were also fun to use, just like in The New Order firing them had a realistic and satisfying weight and feel to them (with the exception of the sniper rifle, that one didn't seem to do it for me) making the gunfighting all the more attractive.\nSo where did it go wrong?\n\nIn the 6th or so chapter, those intense and hardcore technologically advanced Nazis you were fighting? Forget them, the devs decided to brush them aside and bring in something else. Something that seems to be popular these days. Zombies. (Are you f---ing kidding me?)\nThat isn't even a spoiler, because they're right there on the store page screenshots. I saw that and was hoping in vain they would be in some alternate gamemode. But nope, the stupid things came literally out of nowhere, they aren't even that fun to fight. With the Nazis I had to think my movement patterns through, stick to cover and keep track of their troop movements. With the zombies I just had to stand still and pop them in the head, no matter how many there were I could wipe them all out with a single clip of my assault rifle and I wouldn't even get a scratch. Trading quality of enemies for quantity was a foolish design choice, turning the challenge curve from intense tactical FPS to a child-friendly carnival shooting gallery.\nIt's not that I have anything against zombies, games like Killing Floor did them right by focusing the game entirely around them while still keeping a focus on challenge curve. In The Old Blood, they were easily the most boring thing to fight through, presenting little to no threat. They would have been at least tolerable if there was any sort of build-up or hinting that the game was going to take this turn, but in the 6th chapter it turns into a far worse game in an instant. Literally, the chapter starts and then there are suddenly zombies, no explanation, just zombies. There were hints in letters throughout the game mentioning something hidden within the mountain, but if anything I would have expected one of those Jewish technology cache plot-devices that were in The New Order, and that would have made sense since it fits with the established world of the game. Instead we get magically reanimated corpses with a few small specks of actual Nazis dotted around from then on out, as if the game is taunting me with what it could have been.\n\nIt's from this point on that the game takes a complete nose-dive downwards to an uncontrollable disaster. Even the final boss, if I can take the liberty to say, was underwhelming.\n\nIf you've read this far in and you're still considering buying this game, don't read ahead as there may be spoilers for the end boss:\n\nThe final boss was terrible. It's a giant, blind monster that looks like it was taken directly out of Dark Souls and operates it's attacks purely on sound, like the Tentacles in Half-Life. The problem is that this thing flat-out sucks, you shoot him once in the weak spot, move to the upper or lower level of the arena to avoid his attack, repeat. Just like the stupid zombies, the boss came out of nowhere and presented little to no challenge. After playing this far in my brain started to go numb from not having to think at all, and that is not what anybody wants with an advertised prequel to the brilliance of The New Order.\n\n\nIn final consideration: The Old Blood was built up with a seemingly solid foundation that not only collapsed, but shattered under the weight of trending themes, tragically so because it started off so good then became frustratingly simple. A shameless, disorderly mess that is best to be avoided by any fans of The New Order.","May 27, 2015","false","7.2"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","17","42","0","12"

After the first 3 hours I'm not really impressed. It suffers from almost every single problem that was present in The New Order; Still no way to turn off Depth of Field or the absurd amounts of glaring from lightsources and most blurs types. Constantly you go through points of no return when you wanted to search area's for collectables or equiptment. No way to manual/quick save to not be locked into the PoNR checkpoints.\n\nIt practically opens with a Forced Stealth Section that's a hour long right out the door, being this is a prequel and you learned how to hack/pick locks in the future you don't do any of that, also your cutting laser is also future-tech and not appearing in this game, instead you get the new climbing mechanic is more dull then any mechanic it replaces because never is it anything more then rotating left and right click.\n\nThe silly Perk upgrade requirement's are back but there mostly meaningless now, unlike The New Order almost all of them are slight buffs to ammo pickup or health regen so there doesn't seem to be anything huge like the previous game that you need to work for. Also your basically garunteed to get all of them just from playing normally and shooting everyone, since their all rather simple things like kill 200 guys with a mounted gun, well there's a half dozen turrent sections in the first 3 hours alone.\n\nOverall if you played throught The New Order, both sides, and still wanted to play more of the exact same game but with different minigames, then this is for you. If your like me and did a single side and got bored and quit part way through the alternative timeline then your going to get bored here really quickly.\n\n***\nEdit 8/10/15:\nAnother 2 hours later, (because I have nothing better to do.) Still sucks ♥♥♥♥. Still just walking though the same castle, with the same weapons, doing turret sections fighting the exact same 3 guards types for the last 4 straight hours.\n\nThere is still no exciting locations, Moonbase? London? Underwater jew... lab thing?... ♥♥♥♥ all that, you get none of that, you got boring ♥♥♥ stone nazi castle for the entire thing.\n\nWhat about the cool robot dogs, the 10 story high tripods, sharks with laser beams attached to their heads? Nope, 3 types of guards, and a drone I seen twice in a cutscene that shot a plot device at me.\n\nOverall after these 4 hours I feel this Pipe you find in a sewer prison is the real hero of the story, cuz BJ does every ♥♥♥♥ing thing with this pipe. He climbs with it, he plot device gets out of boss fights with it, opens doors and hatches with it, stealth kills with, it's honestly pretty ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. If Nazi's had these pipes, why the ♥♥♥♥ would they need to make anything else, the world would fall to these things.\n\nOverall game remains ♥♥♥♥. God help me because I'm still atleast 3 hours from the end and I just want the credits to roll so I can delete this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and atleast say I beat it.\n\n***\n\nEdit 8/11/15\n\nBeat it, Of the 8 chapters this game has the only somewhat interesting ones are the last 2. Because their the only 2 not in the same boring ♥♥♥ castle. The end boss was also a joke.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/telopots/recommended/350080/","telopots","telopots garg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/telopots/","404 products in account","The Old Blood is a disappointing expansion to a flawed game whose problems could have easily been fixed.\n\nThe problems present in TNO are still present to a lesser extent, namely having to wait for a character to finish talking in order to move on, unskippable first person cutscenes, and more importantly, pacing issues, boring sections, and the game generally wasting your time.\n\nThese last three sins are what kill this game.\n\nI can name three parts that serve no purpose whatsoever :\n\n-The "stealth" sections with the Ubersoldiers, where you have to hold down "E" in front of electric panels, then go up to the stunned Ubersoldier and melee him before grabbing his MG and killing the others.\nIt lasts way too long and is neither challenging or fun.\n\n-The boatride. It's a turret section.\n\n-Every time you have to fight zombies. Zombies are slow. They die very fast. The ones with guns can't shoot in full auto.\nWhat's the point ? They don't even slow you down as you can just run past them.\nThey're useless.\n\nAbout the pacing. The game has got magnificient combat, great weapons, and nice arenas.\n\nSo why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to run around, do nothing, play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth sections, play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mech sections, in between the shootouts ? This is not a good way to design a game. The pacing in TNO was a bit bleh at times, but it was mostly fine because the fights were close to each other most of the time.\nIn TNO you entered a level, walked a bit, fought some dudes, moved on, fought more dudes, etc until the level ended.\n\nIn the old blood, you enter a level, fight some dudes, walk, sometimes you get another fight, watch something scripted happen, and the level ends. Most are very short, with the exception of the castle.\n\nThe fights themselves are as good as in TNO, but occasionally way too short, and there just aren't enough of them.\nThis is probably due to the way the levels are built. TNO had nice long levels with a lot of fights in them.\nThe old blood has short levels that always build up to something before being brutally interrupted.\nI have two examples of this happening :\n\n-In the first level, you get spotted by nazis and fight in an office, and as the fight ends with you having to escape, you're probably thinking "It's nice to finally get to play after all this unskippable crap! I sure hope the rest of the level is as good as TNO !"\nBut right after you press "E" to go through a vent you get spotted and taken to the "stealth" section mentioned earlier.\nThe game just loves being a boner killer.\n\n-Later on, you enter a house to meet some character with barely any personality that dies very shortly afterwards. He hides in the cellar as you prepare to defend the house against the nazis ! Finally, some action !\nI started thinking about where they were going to spawn, where I'd have to ecape in case I got destroyed.\nThey started to shoot the windows and I quickly pulled out my Bombenschuss.\nThe fight that ensued consisted of me clicking m1 while looking at straight lines of nazis.\nThe a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss fight happened, where I just had to hide, shoot its shoulder lighbulbs, melee him, do that 3 times in a row, then finally kill him.\n\nThere was no sick house firefight. I just shot a bunch of braindead germans that came for me in a straight line.\n\n\nNow on to the timewasting. TNO was guilty of this as well, but nowhere near that much.\nEverytime you open a hatch you have to watch Blazko very slowly pull out his pipe and open it, then slowly climb inside.\nEverytime you have to climb up a wall (scripted wall climbings you can't avoid, they serve no purpose yet were introduced as a new mechanic) you very slowly pull out your pipe, break it in half, and climb the wall at a snail's pace.\nHalf the cutscenes are unskippable, even the one THAT IS AT THE START OF THE GAME.\nHalf the doors are electrified and you have to hold "E" in front of a panel for a small amount of time.\nWhy? What purpose does this serve ? I killed everyone, I just want to move on, why wouldn't you just put a door I can open instantly by just pressing "e"?\n\n\nTo not completely bash this, the new weapons are pretty fun, and I complained about not getting to use WW2 guns in TNO, so I was especially happy. Except about the shotgun, which is just a reskin.\n\nThere is one level that stands out amidst the ocean of poor pacing : The castle Wolfenstein. It's like a concentrated TNO level.\n\nThis is such a shame. It has TNO's flaws made ten times more annoying and adds a bunch on top of them, but shares very little of its greatness.\n\nGame finished in ~3.4 hours, without rushing.\n\nMachinegames seriously needs to get their ♥♥♥♥ together.","May 7, 2015","false","5.0"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","2"

Can't even hold 60 FPS (which I gotta mention is the LIMIT, being a huge letdown for anyone with a 120/144hz monitor). Often dipping below 40 FPS for no apparent reason, but at full GPU usage on an overclocked GTX 980. Not even running max settings, very far from it actually. YOU NEED A MONSTER GRAPHICS CARD FOR THIS GAME. And don't get me started on the damn field of view. It HAS a slider that ranges from 80 to 100. Sounds good, right? Except it's not TRUE FOV, even at 100 it barely feels like 70-ish, and lowering it to 80 makes it feel like 50 at best. Nausea and disorientation inducing to the max.\n\n-Story: very boring and doesn't even feel like Wolfenstein. TNO had a properly immersive and suspenseful story, where the other characters actually felt like they mattered. TOB is just a joke.\n-Level design: very linear with no exploration or alternate routes to play your own way. The game holds not only your hand, but ♥♥♥♥ing chains you onto the path it wants you to take.\n\nAt this point I'm wondering why it's even called Wolfenstein. It's got a few fun moments of nazi killing, but not in the style that defines Wolfenstein. Every enemy now apart from the regular grunts are weird and all have their own bizarre weak spots. They're only difficult once you (quickly) learn how to exploit them, and from there on it's the same boring and tedious task over and over again.\n\nI bought this game because I enjoyed TNO, but this iteration is just an insult to the Wolfenstein franchise. I guess the only silver lining is the low price, and surely you can't expect a big chunk of content at such a low price, but even for the experience of a prequel story this really didn't fill in any blanks or put the story of TNO under a new perspective.\n\nSkip this game, and play The New Order instead.","May 7, 2015","false","5.6"," 18 of 49 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","18","49","0","0"

At least, it's the first third of that game, padded out to six hours, with later game stuff like supersoldiers thrown in anyway. You start by infiltrating Castle Wolfenstein, then you get captured, your buddy gets killed, and you make your escape. After a trip down cable cars, you make it to a village where a friend puts you on an underground railroad to find totally not Helga von Bulow and her documents. She finds you out and casts zombies on the place, but you follow her to some catacombs where she summons a monster that kills her and tries to kill you.\n\nThe main difference, aside from the obvious omissions after that, is that it's designed the same way The New Order was designed (except for cutscenes, which are rare). Lifeless segmented hallway levels for consoles, along with the occasional big room where a bunch of bad guys patrol and their commanders call in reinforcements. It's padded out to six hours by a lot of repeated setpieces, like fending off an attack on a building or crappy but really easy stealth against supersoldiers. There are also plenty of scenes where a Nazi has you cornered and twirls his or her moustache for a few moments to show that Nazis are evil and all that...\n\nUber difficulty is slightly more challenging than in the previous game, but still pretty easy. Mostly I died because I didn't bother trying too hard or didn't play the way the game wanted me to. Other times are really hard to shoot through, but they're doable with some really stupid stealth exploits.\n\nThey've slightly improved the base game, but not by much. Just play Return to Castle Wolfenstein instead.","May 5, 2015","false","14.8"," 16 of 46 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","16","46","2","0"

It's up there with Bioshock in story and gameplay. It ended so well and I'm glad to have bought it, even if a year late. A day later, I start this stand-alone.\n\nThe first hour is probably the most boring "action" game I've played in a while. The game's story has yet to pick up 3 hours in and as far as the mechanics,\n\nthe pipes are far inferior to even the beginning unique weapon The New Order had (the laser cutter thing), let alone the epic version you get later on.\n\nThe weapons are still older versions, since this is a prequel and takes place in 1946, so no cool lasers like in 960 New Order style.\n\nThe stealthing is still balls at best. Nothing got better with it since New Order.\n\nThe perk system is worse, though much easier to level up.\n\nThe guns can still be confusing to use (no changes to the way gun switching works since New Order, so if you didn't like it, too bad).\n\nThe characters are less memorable and the story is almost nonexistent. The maps are pretty though, but still nothing compared to New Order.\n\n\n\nNew Order was a NEIN/10. They should have left it there. I was hoping this would be a cool extension like Far Cry 3's stand-alone, Blood Dragon. This is a disappointment to Wolfenstein.\n\nThat's just me though.

Thankfully, I didn't buy it when it first game out. First off, this game is basically the new Doom game for the modern casual, with a different setting and modern, generic, fps mechanics. This may be good news to some, but for me and people like me, it would probably make you suicidal. Also, it suffers from the same bug the new Doom game suffers from, the ability to not unbind pre-binded key bindings. On top of this, I find it funny how it gives you several advanced graphical & texture settings for textures that are no better than an old Call of Duty game. What the hell is the point of that? Huge guns are silent, melee kills are louder than said huge guns, but are still silent to enemy AI for some reason, character models are copied and pasted and I just couldn't play this game anymore because of all these reasons.\n\nI expected this game to be bad and generic and it was, but I did not expect Bethesda to carry out the traditions of The Old Blood and games like The Old Blood, to the new Doom game, for the new Doom game has very similar menus and interface, some of the same bugs, etc.\n\nIf this game did anything for me, it was allowing me to remember how poopy Bethesda currently is as a company.

There is very little story so you don't feel connected with the characters but you're not weighed down by them, either. The game is shorter but that means you progress much more quickly. I agree there were more stealth that suited my taste but nothing is stopping you from breaking stealth and just killing a bunch of Nazis. Plus, there are plenty of awesome "loud" battles to keep you sated. Overall, this point-and-click FPS is quite enjoyable.\n\nKind of a side note is the game includes levels 2-9 of episode 1 of the original Wolfenstein 3D, if you can find them.

It has some subtle throwbacks to RtCW (killing commanders before they sound alarms, optional stealth play style, a level about a dig site) and some not-at-all-subtle throwbacks to original Wolfenstein. As a huge fan of RtCW, I wasn't too disappointed, but the game has its flaws.\nSound quality is medocre, with often good tension music and good voice acting, but almost nothing else in terms of ambient effects and gun sounds. The gunplay is passable, with clever enemies to keep it interesting. They will use cover and throw grenades at you at the right time (although not before holding it in the air and yelling to the world about what they're about to do). It's fun to solve literally every obstacle BJ encounters with his lead pipe.\nAlas, the game is short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/recommended/350080/","magusx777","[KoS]DarkProphet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/","568 products in account","Since Wolfenstein: The New Order concludes in such a way as to be open to a sequel, and as its campaign accounts for BJ's whereabouts the entire time, only two options were available to Bethesda and Machine Games: either an entire spin-off with a different lead character taking place whenever they wanted, or a prequel starring BJ. They went with the latter, and aside from the issue of knowing everything would end okay for the hero, as is always an issue with prequels, this game was quite good. Unless they do make a spinoff, we won't know if this was the better choice, but I'm glad they made this game. That said, it just felt inferior to WTNO in most ways: the story above all else...\n\nThe actual storyline itself was just boring and uninteresting. You're sent to get a file with the location of a Nazi general. Obviously you fail a lot to stretch out the runtime of the game, and something supernatural happens very late-game which makes things interesting for a few minutes, then you realize there's not really going to be a legitimate explanation for it, and everything predictable happens. There are only two significant villains and they're fairly forgettable. I can't remember the name of the Nazi woman on WTNO, but I will -never- forget her or the scenes she was in. I would love to see her in another Wolfenstein game as she had a real presence. The WTNO villains weren't extremely deep, but they worked well, while WTOB villains were just disappointing.\n\nWTNO takes place in an alternate history 1960, with a significant number of characters who have dialog between missions and you really develop a "relationship" with them, to the best of a not-that-long first person shooter's ability. In WTOB, however, you never really feel like you knew a character long enough to care that they died. I cared when characters died in WTNO; not heartbroken, but it was sad or got a reaction out of me. In WTOB, someone dies and you're just like "Meh, okay." There's another "choose who dies" option in this game, very near its end, and it's rather irrelevant and actually difficult to tell which character you are trying to save. You go left to save one and right to save the other, and the game does not tell you which way is for which character! I had read someone else's review and knew to expect this BS, so when I heard "I need to save them," I looked up a walkthrough to find out which way to go to save the character I wanted to live. I'd recommend you do this as well. Randomly saving one character over the other isn't player choice; it's bad game design.\n\nThe setting is another point of inferiority vs WTNO. Alternate history 1960 is a lot more interesting than alternate history 1946. 1946 was a good starting point for WTNO to give you a feel for what's going on, introduct characters, and set up the plot, but they quickly put you into 1960 as it's so much more fun and engrossing. WTNO took a WWII shooter and turned it on its head by moving ahead with this alternate timeline, making story actually a thing of relevance, while WTOB just sits on its hands by taking place in a year nothing -really- interesting is going to happen concerning the overall war effort.\n\nYou've probably noticed that I have almost exclusively said negative comments about this game thus far. However, the truth of the matter is that everything I just discussed is executed better the average game. It's all just awful -compared- to WTNO, which raised the bar so high that this game was set up to underwhelm right out of the gate. Of course, "the average game" is a steaming pile. The actual number of good games in existence is a tiny fraction of the mass of stinkers out there. The story and setting of this game are just "okay" and too cliche at times. Why then, do I recommend this game? It's all about the gameplay.\n\nWTNO was a great game because it had a story and characters presented very well with combat and stealth that gave interactivity to an interesting plot. The action/shooting and stealth in WTNO was its own reward, and characters and storyline that I cared about for the most part were just icing on the cake. Many games have pretty interesting storylines, but the gameplay is so dull that the only way to get through is at the promise of more story. If WTNO's combat and stealth didn't greatly entertain you on their own, you might not want to pick this game up, because if you're "suffering" through the action and stealth for the plot, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you're like me, the uninteresting storyline of WTOB isn't why you want to finish the game; it's because the action and stealth are a blast. WTOB comes with 4 new weapons I can recall, 2-3 new enemy types, and far more stealth-viable encounters per minute than WTNO had.\n\nTL;DR buy this if you're interested in more Wolfenstein The New Order combat and stealth but don't mind that the story and characters are very weak compared to WTNO.","June 20, 2015","true","48.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmodasw/recommended/350080/","gmodasw","A. T. Sparkle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gmodasw/","185 products in account","Well here it is, the much hyped prequel to The New Order, one of the best FPS games to come out since Half Life 2. In the vein of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, this is set up as an "expandalone", mechanically it's just about identical to the previous game, a bit lighter on the content, but with a different setting and a considerably lower pricepoint (an aspect that some people *coughEAcough* don't seem to quite get the importance of *coughHardlinecough*). For the most part I'd follow the rule of "if you liked TNO, you'll like this" it plays very much the same with the exception of a few different weapons and mechanics.\nAll in all I would say it was enjoyable, but some of the aspects teased as being new are a bit underwhelming, the pipe climbing is used in very specific situations, all highlighted for you, the new shotguns perform identically to the two from the previous game, with the main exception being that the double barreled one is available for more than two levels, the sawed off version being unlocked just shortly after the halfway point and keeping with you to the very end, and the machine shotgun lacking the entertaining shrapnel mode, and the new rocket launcher is in every aspect a direct downgrade to the underbarrel one from TNO, lacking the multishot or dual wield capacity with no upgrades to potentially counterbalance that. Although technically not a new weapon, another feature somewhat over advertised was the capability to keep the heavy machine guns in your inventory rather than dropping upon switching, however this is locked behind a rather difficult skill to obtain, and without considerable grinding I'd consider it unlikely for you to get it before the end of your first play through. The only new weapon I enjoyed entirely was the bolt-action rifle, which you can choose to use either a scope or iron sights on, it's hard to deny old school bolt-action fighting is fun, of course unlike TNO's semiautomatic marksman rifle this one cannot be dual wielded.\nThe collectibles and the nightmares also make a return from The New Order, however again these feel like they could've been a bit better, collectibles are now relegated to nothing but gold and silver bars, and the nightmares, while expanded on greatly to the point where there's now one in every chapter, get old rather quickly, something I would like to attribute at least in part to the old level designs clashing somewhat with the new mechanics (mainly how slowly you move in such large mazes, making exploration and backtracking more tedious than they needed to or should be). The New Order was the first game in a very long time that I was compelled to 100%, a compulsion that I couldn't get from this game.\nFor the most part the enemies are the same variety you got used to in TNO, with a few changes here and there. Supersoldiers now have an exposed weakpoint, the normal ones can have their power generators targeted to knock them down, allowing you to pull open their armor, which enables you to take them down much faster, while the tethered version (which are only seen in one or two levels, both in stealth segments) can be killed by either disabling their external generator and then cutting their wires, or simply shooting their wires if you have a gun to shoot with. You also have the occasional encounter with flying combat drones, which unlike the machine gunning ones seen in the previous game now sport rocket launchers and much larger hulls.\nStory-wise The Old Blood takes a different Direction than The New Order, going back to 1946 with the raid that allowed the allies to launch their suicide assault on Deathshead's compound in the opening level of The New Order. Here you'll instead find yourself in Castle Wolfenstein and the nearby town of Wolfburg fighting the SS occult research division and their experiments. While many were hoping for Wolfenstein to go more into the occult themes, and I did definitely find this game's two main villains entertaining, I would say the story themes felt rather watered down, but this was a gripe I had with The New Order's story themes as well so I may be the odd one out here.\nDespite these nitpicks and gripes though I'd still highly recommend this game because when it gets down to it none of these flaws are fatal ones, the basic game mechanics are very solid, although in some ways the level design of The New Order was superior, this is still one of the best shooters to come out in recent years. The basic gameplay is the same style as TNO, combat is very satisfying. It doesn't really try to do a hole lot more than The New Order, but at the same time, it doesn't really have to, what TNO did was show how to make a good singleplayer FPS in this era, and The Old Blood delivers a lite version of that, for half the price.\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood, is a good game, I'd hesitate to call it a great game, but I'd hesitate even more to hold that against it because it's not trying to be anything more than what it is, and what it is is satisfying enough for me.","May 13, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of levels are long, there's lots of secret places to find and those not only containing some treasure or ammo but also some interesting info. Pacing is great......chapter 4 is the greatest segment in the game, it is almost perfect! The later part of TOB is  somewhat different since it throws you back to ocult and supernatural stuff it's a little bit repetetive and not really that well thought, but nether the less it brings enough fun to keep you enjoying the process. this part reminded me a little bit of NecroVision wich is just simply ♥♥♥♥ing awesome shooter.\nLevel design is excellent, visuals are fantastic.\nSO it is a MUST HAVE for any true FPS fan and of course a Wolf fan, with never ending gameplay and without  unnecesary story telling!))","May 7, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The nazis were overwhelming and the mazes were just soaked with nazi decadence I was so used to seeing growing up in the post-war central Europe, where it's all still a relatively fresh memory.\n\nI am so glad this game exists. Though this is an expansion pack technically to the already excellent Wolfenstein: The New Order, it is also a worthy reimagining of the Wolfenstein 3D saga. Its story fits the plot well. I remember when I first saw the original loading screen for Wolf 3D, where Blazkowitz hides behind a wall and the soldier approaches, it reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy actually briefly dresses up as a german to infiltrate the submarine docking station in Act 3. That always made me think of Wolfenstein and I dreamt of a Spielbergian Wolfenstein film with Harrison Ford as Blazsko.\n\nBut along came this game instead, with all its subtle naunces and historically accurate(ish) feeling design.\nIt delivers on some primal aspect that made the original Wolf 3D (1993) work. Just the fact that you can always pick up food is such a satisfying improvement. And the subtle references that you can catch, you can geek out about them for hours. The elongated skulls, displayed along a wall, natural curiosities...subtle references to the past and other related titles, the excellent writing and subtle plot... Yes, this game is obviously fictitious, but it grasps quite well what Nazis were and are, not just as antagonists but historical figures and puts it into probably the most enjoyable FPS I've played in a decade. This game, this specific stand-alone 'expansion', is one of those games you'll remember, like Wolf 3D or Duke Nukem, because it follows principles of good design throughout. And that's TREMENDOUS these days.\n\nThough killing nazis in a dystopian alternative history future is a bleak feat, and the authenticity of the filth and horrible energy Nazis had is conveyed not just through environments and interactions but even music in such a masterful way it leaves a lasting impression. But don't worry, there are bits where Blazsko is the anti-hero everyone wants him to be and even bits where he could be rubbing shoulders with John McClaine we wanted to be in all the Die Hard movies, not just the first. Whoever wrote for this game and held it together, hats off sir (or madam), and Thank You to the whole team and highest commendations, there is so much greatness in this game it's impossible to compress into a short review.\n\nBuy this, you really won't regret it. At $20, it's like we're back in 1993 and you're borrowing your friend's floppy disks with Wolf 3D scribbled on with sharpies. Go on, have a great time.","May 9, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there are only sparse links between the two, so no spoilers or need to play both in any sort of order.\n\nComing from the New Order, it's generally more of the same. And that's a good thing. Good shooting, decent story/pacing. Overall, without exploring every nook and cranny for collectibles that I don't care about, it took me around 10 hours to finish. And it feels about right.\n\nIf I had some criticisms:\n1) The Graveyard could have been longer.\n2) Some of the later levels felt very small/clausterphobic when they didn't need to be.\n3) A lot of the NPCs don't stick around very long. In The New Order, you were with the same "crew" most of the game and it helped develop a relationship with the characters. In The Old Blood, they just come and go and you never get much time with them.\n4) A lot of the levels felt as if you HAD to sneak around in them. I understand that you don't, but it would be extremely punishing otherwise.\n5) The diffculty ramped up HARD after Chapter 3/4. Up until then, on "Bring 'Em On" difficulty I was thinking I had chosen too low.
