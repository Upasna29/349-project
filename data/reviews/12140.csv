I have provided the FIX at the bottom of this review and I do hope it helps.\n\nTL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Max Payne is the first title to the highly acclaimed Max Payne franchise. Originally developed by Remedy Games back in 2001, it has then received multiple awards for its story telling, gameplay and graphics from critics and gamers alike.\n\nMax Payne is a third-person action game where the player takes the role of a hard-boiled, no non-sense New York City cop named, you guessed it, Max Payne, who is on a mission to avenge the death of his wife and infant daughter in the hands of vagrants who were high on a street drug named Valkyr. He sets of to find the people responsible for the production and distribution of Valkyr who he holds responsible for his family's death.\n\nPROS:+ Story: - At first glance the story seems to be a cliché cop drama, and, yes I would agree, HOWEVER, it's the presentation, execution and overall delivery of the story that makes the original Max Payne a gem on action drama story telling.\n\n+ Gameplay: - This was the fist game to incorporate the now popular 'Bullet Time' effect where time basically slows down allowing the player more accuracy for combat while at the same time adding theatrical spice to the gunplay. This might not be relevant to the current generation of gamers but back in 2001, it was one of the game's highest selling points.\n\n+ Voice Acting: - Fantastic voice acting from the cast specially on the character of Max Payne with his dark humour and gritty personality.\n\n+ Atmospheric: - The graphics for its time is top notch and delivers a very dark and depressing world that reflects the slowly changing personality of Max. From the dank and cold city streets to the surreal nightmarish realm of Max's dreams, the game stands tall on atmosphere and immersion.\n\nCONS:- Bugged Sound for Windows Vista/7/possibly 8: - Being 13 years old, the game does suffer from compatibility issues. Gameplay wise, it functions well enough but users will encounter a bug that renders no audio in the game. (Note: LINK TO THE FIX IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW)\n\n- Replayability: - Linear story is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace but Linearity does sacrifice replayability at degree because after finishing the story there is little reason to play it through a second time around. Like a good action movie, it's best to be played again after some time has passed.\n\n- Facial Animation: - Max has a permanent facial expression where the devs tried to give him a gritty look but they just ended up making him look smug and/or constipated expression through out the game. Good thing the Comic Book cut sences are there to save the day.\n\nCONCLUSION:Max Payne is a GREAT GAME that started a great franchise. It brought us the mainstream Bullet Time effect that most action shooter gamers has come to incorporate and embrace as a core game mechanic. It showed us a perfect blend of action and storytelling in one single game without sacrificing gameplay and mechanics.\n\nIt is a fast paced brutal 3rd person shooter that fans of the genre should not miss out on. Sale or full price, this game is worth the money and worth the time.\n\nSOUND FIXMax Payne Sound Fix by DarkjeThe2nd:\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215\n\nYouTube Instructions on how to install and use the Fix by MrMario2011:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri2lWK_SKAc\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The final gunshot was an exclamation mark on everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger, and it was over.\n\nStory Max Payne is your everyday New York cop. That is until one day, his loving wife and newborn daughter are murdered by three drug addicts. The drug addicts were using the "V" drug, a hostile and dangerous drug, which is getting bigger and bigger in New York City. After the dead of his wife and daughter, Max becomes an undercover DEA agent, working on the "V" drug case. Three years later, the city of New York finds itself in the biggest snow storm in history, and the "V" drug rempant the city. Max gets a tip from another DEA agent. An old friend of Max, knows something about this "V" drug. Finally meeting each other, his old friend Alex Balder is shot right before Max's eyes. Now, Max is framed for the murder of his friend, and is more than determined to break the "V" case.\n\nGameplay Max Payne is known for it's great bullet time, and its smooth third person action gameplay. The basic gameplay is actually pretty easy to master. There are three parts in the game, every part has around seven to nine chapters. In every high detailed chapter you mostly walk through the chapter, killing every enemy in your path. Even though this sounds easy, Max Payne is a fairly difficult game. Which will take the average gamer around 9 hours to complete the main story. Max Payne is iconic for it's amazing bullet time, your stamina meter slowly fills up, which will allow you to dive or run in slow motion, easily picking off enemies.\n\nConclusion The first Max Payne in this amazing trilogy is a joy to play. Some people might back away from it because of its outdated graphics. The amazing and complicated story is a very fun ride, while the great gameplay really takes the cake. For any fans of great third person gameplay with an amazing story, here you have a great game for your collection.\n\n8.5/10\n","November 13, 2014","true","15.3"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","75","83","2","1"

The gameplay holds up, has the old school bullet time feature, and really hasn't dated too badly. The game is storyboard led, which means you don't have to deal with out of date facial animations!\n\nYou should be aware straight off the bat that the game is playable but has issues. You will need to download a patch which can be found in the Community Hub which changes a few audio files in to recognisable files - takes less than 2 minutes and makes the game work smoothly.\n\nMy Suggested purchase price = $3 -> $5\n\nNotes\nNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Controller Support.","November 25, 2013","true","19.0"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","64","67","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/12140/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","This review is essentially a reminder....to myself.\nMost of the time when I write a review, it's not just preserving a memory, it's putting a time-stamp on it.\nEventually I'll play through Max Payne again, or maybe I'll play through its sequels. When that time comes around, I want to have something to compare and contrast with. This is also so that I don't fall into making the same discussions, or focus on material that I've already covered in a previous review.\n\nIt's my personal Hell.\n\nSpeaking of Hell, Max Payne sure went through some ♥♥♥♥ didn't he? He was practically touching the American Dream, but then it all fell apart in a New York Minute. His blood-soaked tale of revenge is about as good as 3rd-person shooter storylines need to be. The plot is great, the characters are memorable, and the writing is artsy...well the good kinda artsy. It's enough to make you care, enough to make you imagine, but not so into itself that it comes off as pretentious trash. Max Payne is a bit more cultured than you'd expect from a homage to John Woo films and Noir comics.\n\nBut let's focus on the game itself. Max Payne 1 is a classic. Despite being released nearly 14 years ago, it still holds up and is great fun today (grab the widescreen fix). These days we tend to demand more from our videogames. When we pay however much it is that we're willing to, we expect our videogame to do a lot. The third-person shooter is no longer allowed to just be about shooting people, aliens, robots, mutants, or all of the above. There has to be stealth-elements, a vehicle, some turrets, and a segment where you walk slowly and wait for the exposition to finish.\n\nMax Payne 1 is almost quaint by comparison. There's some platforming, a moment where you don't have a single gun, and stupid pet tricks (shooting switches & trip-wires). Otherwise all you're going to do be doing is shooting people. Walk into a room, bad guys appear, and you shoot them. All of the encounters are scripted, and if your eye is quick enough you can sometimes see thugs appear out of thin air. Shockingly, this standardized approach manages to maintain its high level of quality entertainment, for the 7+ hours a first-playthrough is likely to take.\n\nWhere similar games fall to the depths of mediocrity and banality, Max Payne rises above. This is precisely because it gets the primary form of interaction (shooting people) absolutely perfect. Let's start with the bullet. Your mission is to put bullets into enemies while trying to keep them out of Max Payne. There's none of that hit-scan nonsense in this game. While you can't always see the bullets as they travel, you know where they're coming from, and where they're going. These bullets travel at the same speed, cut through friend and foe alike(always a plus when bad guys accidentally shoot each other), always leave an impact. This isn't something you're liable to notice when you start the game, but over time you will acquire a new-found appreciation for bullets and the mechanics that revolve around them.\n\nThe most important strategy is to keep moving. Enemies tend to aim for your head/chest, so you're most vulnerable when standing still or getting up from a dodge. Gun-battles are short and to the point; either you die in a couple seconds, or the bad guys die in 10-15 seconds. Making shots count is important, especially if you're using the slow-motion dodge. Bullet-time can also be very effective when used properly. It's not free, and you'll get yourself killed trying to play Neo, but it's good for those times where you need a moment or two to figure things out, even during a gun-fight. Otherwise, your best strategy is liable to be F5/F9ing your way to success (though it's not so effective on the hardest difficulty).\n\nThe most interesting aspect of Max Payne is that once you think you've finally grasped how the game works, it's about to end. This is where you move onto the next difficulty, and see if you've really learned anything. When a game focuses almost entirely on one element, you will find yourself focusing on that same element as well. With every firefight you learn something new, you calculate how many shots you can make with each gun while dodging, you mull over every situation and what you could do to not only survive it, but to own it. The controls, mechanics, and everything else that makes the genre work is done in spectacular fashion.\n\nI'd write more, but I think you should play this game and see for yourself. Although I would be shocked if you haven't played it already.","April 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","38","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/recommended/12140/","HeavyWeaponsBaby","Diana Night","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/","209 products in account","Let me tell you why this game is so darn good. And why it has dated oh so well.\n\nMax Payne, I don't know where to start, I love this trilogy so much (Even though I love two first games much more)\n\nMax Payne centers around...well..Max freaking Payne, a tragic character who's family has been murdered in cold blood. Max decides to go for a revenge, and one good revenge at that.\n\nSounds cliche? Well, things are not as they might seem, the game knows it, heck, Max knows it, the game is self-aware while still taking itself seriously, this strange blend of humor and drama makes the game date better. Max himself is a very likeable chap, you'll hear his voice a lot, and he monologues quite often.\nThis helps the player to understand Payne more, his personality, his feeling at that very moment. He tends to speak in a very monotone voice.\n\nStory is being told through gameplay, comic artworks and cut-scenes, cut-scenes are not used very often, they don't tell the story most of the time actually, they're there only to show you the place and some enemies coming to get you. The game rarely takes the controls away from you.\nYou get to also play Max's nightmares, and nightmares they are indeed, they are most likely one of the creepiest levels you encounter in non-horror game. And yes, this indeed is quite genius. This makes us think about Max more, trying to make up our thoughts about the visuals before us.\nGame has amazing voice acting, every character is voiced perfectly, the only problem some people might have is strange acting which can be seen in comics. They look silly most of the time; Sam Lake really knows how to make the weirdest faces. But then again it is most likely intentional, I wouldn't be surprised, the game really doesn't take itself too seriously, well, it does, but at the same time it laughs at itself, at its cliches etc. Not to mention Max's model has this smirk throughout the whole game, Max is most likely thinking like this:\n\nHe knows how his quest silly sounds, he knows how cliche it sounds, he knows his quest is impossible, that self awareness is what makes the game date oh-so well.\n\nSoundtrack is top-notch as well; the main theme is truly heaven to ears as it pretty much presents Max Payne's personality.\n\nGameplay is extremely fun and addicting, the main mechanics this game explores are bullet time and shoot dodge. They work well and smoothly, you will not find a franchise which does this better. Even Matrix games got it wrong. The game IS challenging when you start, you'll need to learn how to use these mechanics to your own good.\nSpamming shoot dodge won't get you anywhere; you can't spam it, if your bullet time runs out Max cannot use it anymore. So you better thing before using it.\nMax Payne can heal himself using painkillers; he can have up to eight painkillers which he can use whenever he wants. They encourage the player to explore for them.\nGame has 3 difficulties, only one being avaible at the beginning, that being the easiest one, which is still not quite easy. Luckily the game has quick saves, if that's too "cheap" for you then play on the hardest difficulty which limits your saves. Even with quick save though the game is no cake walk, game will spam a lot of enemies at you, but the game is fair, it is not unfair.\n\nLevel design offers the player to explore a lot of areas, there are many weapons painkillers to be found which make Max's journey through madness much easier.\n\nThe game never feels repetive, even though you do just shoot guys in the face, it's most likely the levels, they're done so well.\n\nAt the end, Max Payne not only has dated well, but feels quite refreshing, this is no cover shooter, it's quite the opposite, this is not about hiding, this is about going into the open, shooting everyone up, quick thinking.\nThe game can be completed around ten hours, depends on your skill level. But the fun doesn't have to stop there, there is a "New York Minute" mode for the speed runners who wish to run through the game as quickly as possible, it has a timer on every level, you score more and more time the more enemies you kill. The mod community offers quite a lot of content to enjoy, complete game changers, minor changes. And it's really easy to install them.\n\nGuys at Remedy, I love you.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n10/10 I am biased? Maybe, probably, most likely. Do I care? Nope.","January 24, 2014","true","45.7"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","5"

I often find myself in a serious need for painkillers(the health pickups), and it feels so good to find some in a secret place. You don't really see these kind of games anymore.\n\n+High quality voice acting(especially the narration and cutscenes, which I'll talk about later) - nothing much to say here, just that the first time I heard the narration, it was so good that I thought it was recoreded about  2-3 years ago.\n\n+The gameplay - I've never played the game before untill now, so I didn't know what to excpect from a game this old, and I have to say that I genuinely enjoy the gameplay. Of course, the animations are a bit clanky, but it still feels good, the weapon variety, the shooting, the bullet time, everything.\n\n+The comic book-ish cutscenes - I really love the way the story is told, instead of  advanced animations with crazy effects, each cutscene is a comic book "page", beautifully drawn and narrated.\n\n+The story - I haven't finished the game yet(I don't think I'm even close, only 5 hours in), but so far the story is quite good, right at the beginning the game throws at you some powerful and sad scenes. My expectations are high, I'll update this section when I finish the game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Illogical enemy spawnings - the enemy spawnings are pretty weird in the game, most of them are activated by you reaching a certain point, but sometimes after you clear an area, and later need to backtrack, enemies spawn from no-where(of course not in front of your eyes), no doors openings or anything.\n\n-Bugged sounds, but it can be fixed anyway.\n\nOverall, I can easily recommend this game to anyone, don't be afraid of the old age, it plays perfectly fine, and anyone can really enjoy it.","September 17, 2014","true","9.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

And so opened this innovative action adventure for me: I had a weekend to kill, it was snowing outside, and I had no heating. I didn't want the intellectually intensity of a strategy game, nor did I want to frenetic multitasking of a RTS. With a blanket on my legs, I sat down and completed this game in 10 hours without even a toilet break. And the first thing I did? Began again. After a toilet break.\n\nMax Payne pitches perfect progressive difficulty. Action games shouldn't - in my busy world - kill you more than three times at the same point more than three times. You shouldn't be slugging through a game with a face as pained as Payne's permanently constipated expression. Instead you should be smiling appreciatively at just how awesome it feels to burst horizontally through a door (in slow motion) and expertly twisting through your hips as you innerringly shoot three baddies with your John Woo pistols before time jolts back into the present and all three baddies fall down at the same time. Whump.\n\nThis is not a serious game, but it is seriously evocative. The weapons, even now, feel powerful. I can remember a scene where a baddie hideing behind an apartment door unfortunately proclaims that he intends to shoot you as you come in. He doesn't, but you should, expect to leap towards him while simultaneously opening said door while unleashing a full shotgun blast to his chest that lifts him several feet in the air. You can almost hear Chuck, I mean Max, saying, "not today bozo."\n\nThese scenes occur tirelessly throughout the game. Face an impossible situation. Engage bullet time (copied from the Matrix). Shoot all enemies. Read film noir comics.\n\nWhile the game itself is not so serious, what should be a series consideration is the known (and ongoing) compatibility issues with steam. Unfortunately the download can open fail to name the weapons file correctly which can result in the game simply not starting. While I managed to get it work (on occasion) you cannot expect Steam to help you out on this one. Much better to buy on amazon.\n\nFortunately the game gleefully leads you on a deeply humorous (if a little silly) adventure once you have got the thing working. The dialogue between the baddies is priceless. Not to mention the subplot of the Lords and Ladies TV series - "My Lord! My Lady! My Lord!" - which goes on for about twenty minutes if you halt your carnage to watch the many analogue TV sets scattered throughout the game. Take this game for what it is - a romping film-noir - and you'll find an outstandingly crafted adventure that is also a piece of gaming history.","December 30, 2014","true","11.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","29","31","4","0"

The gameplay consists of mostly running-and-gunning, although there's one mission where you should use stealth to your advantage. The difficulty is high enough to give you a real challenge, and you must conserve painkillers to survive, and there's no cover system either. However, you can dive around in slow-motion gunfights and dodge bullets.\n\nThe story centers around a man, Max Payne who has lost his meaning of life after his family was killed in a mysterious home invasion. 3 years after the incedent, Payne is framed for murdering his best friend. Now on the run, to prove his innocence Payne must find the perpetrator, all the while uncovering a government conspiracy in a world of darkness. The story is told through various comic strips, Max's internal monologues and surreal nightmares.\n\nThe only two bad things about the game? A lack of an autosave feature and the game's audio is broken when you download it, but there should be a fix somewhere on the Steam forums, just look up "Max Payne audio fix" or something. Other than that it's easily the best third-person shooter I've ever played.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","13.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Unfortunately for him, he's been burned and framed for the murder of his best friend, a DEA agent... His rage will be unleashed on New York City criminals while evading the police. What secrets will he uncover?\n\nDon't look at the minutes passed in Max Payne here on Steam, I happen to own the retail version. And also an italian version offered by a magazine when I was on vacations back then.\n\nSo, you may bet, I loved the plot of the game. You're going from surprise to surprise and the noir ambiance is really showing Max's state of mind. Everything is done by night or underground or in dirty buildings. Even some side characters are well-written like Mona Sax, though you should play Max Payne 2 for more secrets about her. Eeer, what? Yeah, yeah, I like Mona. But I prefer the Mona of Max Payne 2 than Max Payne. Besides, you find alliances with people you would have never thought...\n\nThe gameplay is simple: you shoot, you cover yourself, you shoot, you take painkillers to ease your pain and you use your bullet time feature to slow down time to avoid bullets and to kill more enemies. Anyway, I can't say that there is really more in Max Payne apart some puzzles (well, mainly to find your way but not the puzzles like you see in casual games). You have also a lot of weapons, interesting anyway to see Max carry so much of them. From shotgun to sniper rifle with grenade launchers, don't ask how he does. But the best is perhaps the nightmare sequence, that is separating each act.\n\nThe graphics, while looking a little old today, are also very very good. The only problem I have is the fact that Max is having always the same smiling face. I mean, this is weird at the end. But really, each level is well builded and creepy in its own: from Ragnarock to the subway, passing by the Aesir Corporation so futuristic and by the docks.\n\nThe soundtrack is also quite good. The main track is quite sad.\n\nBut the best also with Max Payne, is that the story is told as a comic, with excellent voice actors. It's allowing the story to be darker and also to have subtitles.\n\nIn other words, Max Payne was an excellent title, with an excellent plot and an excellent gameplay (the bullet feature was really helpful). It's not a wonder that it got turned into a trilogy. If you like action, you have to play Max Payne. Never regretted it back then... I should replay it on Steam too....","December 3, 2015","true","9.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

If you're here feeling nostalgic, skip reading reviews and just buy it :) If you haven't played Max Payne previously, please keep its age in mind when judging it for the first time.\n\nThough the graphics may not, the story, however, will always stand the test of time. Your wife and daughter are murdered within the first ten minutes, which is the basis of the mystery you must now unravel. Meanwhile, outside, the worst blizzard in years envelops New York City. The atmosphere matches Max's desperation, breathing life into otherwise usual settings like rooftops, or the docks, as you mow down foes in winter coats huddling around a trashcan fire. There isn't a dull moment in the game, whether Max is fighting armies of baddies, interacting with memorable villains (and allies) or losing himself in his own nightmares. The story gets an A+ in my book and an A+++ when compared to the trash passed off as game plots nowadays.\n\nThe dialogue can be both fantastic and cheesy. Fantastically cheesy? Whatever you think of it, it is fitting to Max Payne's comic book style. There are cutscenes, but more often there are panels with speech bubbles and illustrations. I'm not sure if this was a budget or style decision, but it quickly became the series' trademark. There are lines, both funny and serious, which my friends and I quote to this day ("As in... you cry a lot?").\n\nThe shooting mechanics are fine. At the very least it has aged MUCH more gracefully than other old shooters. You don't have to aim precisely, just point in an enemy's general direction and shoot. It's not realistic. You can snipe people with dual submachine guns from across a rooftop, and carry 10 guns, 5 Molotov cocktails, 5 grenades and a grenade launcher all at once. You get a great arsenal by the way, and new weapons are steadily introduced throughout. Ammo is abundant. Painkillers are plentiful. I truly believe Max Payne was designed in a way to let you enjoy its story without getting stuck on this or that.\n\nI've also played Max Payne on several platforms: first on PS2, then original Xbox and finally PC. I play it every few years. PC is the definitive version. In addition to not having to dust off your questionable old system, which is stuffed in a closet somewhere (or at least in my case it is), it runs smoothest on PC, and there are little things you will notice (for example, the cool, comic book font used in the PC version was converted to a generic font in the console versions).\n\nIt's worth the $9.99 Steam is asking, and it's on sale all the darn time so there's no reason not to revisit Noir York City, as Max calls it.\n\nAlso note: there's a slight compatibility issue, and the audio won't work with Windows 7 initially. Check the workshop for a simple sound patch that takes moments to install and works flawlessly. Just follow the instructions exactly and you're good to go!

He found out his Wife and Child have been murdered. He becomes a vigilante to hunt down to those who killed his family. Hunted by both the cops and the mafia.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nThe shooting mechanics are the main part of Max Payne that makes it great. It has a bullet time system that is very useful in tight situations. The guns in this game are also decent. They are not to Overpowered or too Weak. The enemies have a good amount of balance. Enemies can be very easy to kill but Max Payne too. Enemies that hold Desert Eagles, Shotguns or Ingrams (Uzi's) can easily kill you in medium to close range. There is 3 Chapters in the game. Each of them have missions. It depends on the players skill that these missions can be very short or long. All in all the Gameplay is amazing and does not have a lot of negatives. The only negatives I can point out is that unskippable cinematics and some parts of the mission that is confusing. Great gameplay\n-------\nSound: 8/10\n\nThe sound in this game is tremendous. It has a great soundtrack, especially the theme. It fits the Noir setting of the game. The other soundtracks are also good. There is some 80s vibe music in some action scenes that reminds you of those Fun 80s action flicks and there is also some dark music in some parts of the game to make you feel either uneasy or expecting something thats coming. Good soundtrack\n---------\nGraphics\n\nFor its time (Early 2000s): Very Good!\nRight now (2014): Decent\n\nThis can be judged either way. If you expect the same type of Graphics as Max Payne 3, You will be a little disappointed. The Graphics are old but you can't judge it as it came out in an era where Graphics where still being improved.\n\nIf you do not care about Graphics (Which is me) you wouldn't mind it at all. It will be a fun experience even with the old Graphics and doesn't make it bad.\n-------\n\nStory: 7/10\n\nThe story is amazing. It sounds like those simple revenge films but takes a step further with the action mixed into it while keeping the thriller and noir feeling. It has great characters and it is well paced. Story is shown in a Graphic Novel styles to show the plot progressing. It is a sad story about a man who lost his family. Nice and well done storyline. There is a few negative things though. "SPOILERS""SPOILERS""SPOILERS". The ending is has a Cliffhanger feeling. The Valkyr is not really explained and some characters are just taken down easily. Specially the main villian who is introduced half-way but then wasted into a helicopter crash. No boss battles or anything, just some explosion and WOOP! villian is gone. It should have gotten a boss battle at least.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10\n\n+ Good story\n+ Very good Game Mechanics\n+ Good price if you ask me\n+ Nice soundtrack\n\n- Short gameplay time if you are skilled enough leaving you a little for more\n- SPOILERS< Ending is leaves a few questions unanswered, also disappointing villian end\n\nThanks for reading!

Back to the night the pain started."\n\nWhile Max remembers what happened 3 years before we need to go back 15 years. It was in 2001 that Remedy released an action-pack video game that was the first utilising the slow-mo we got to like so much after Matrix came out. I remember it was not long after the first benchmark software, 3DMark 99 was released - one of the graphics tests included the lobby scene from the Matrix recreated spectacularly thanks to the Max Payne engine.\n\n"He was trying to buy more sand for his hourglass. I wasn't selling any."\n\nThat's right. Max goes after the entire underworld of New York as some junkies kill his wife and baby girl. The game is pretty linear - we go from one area to the next. Everything is pretty straightforward but while making progress the action is almost constant and it is very easy to die unless we regularly turn on the slow-mo effect. Making things slower around us allows for more precision-shooting, too. I like how Max uses painkillers to make the pain go away - not health packs but regular painkillers.\n\n"A bomb went off, turning snow into liquid gold."\n\nThe game aged a lot but still looks pretty cool. At the time Remedy's software was revolutionary in every which way. The accompanying music is a classic one - the game's theme was later on used in its sequels and became one of the signature elements of the franchise.\n\n"I was in a graphic novel. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of."\n\nThere are dozens of cutscenes between the various stages but these all appear in the form of comic book pages. The narrator, Max, is actually played by the guy who wrote the game's screenplay, Sam Lake. We follow Max's internal monologues - his struggle with New York's evil and at the same time with his memories; the memory of losing his loved ones, something so painful that eventually set him on this dangerous path he can never leave.\n\n"You piece together a jigsaw and the final picture is you finishing that same puzzle, a mad green-eyed killer standing behind you. An urban legend come true."\n\nThere you have it: a classic 3rd person shooter that still matters. A game that has all the ingredients to give birth to an excellent action flick: Italian-American mobsters from New York, amazing dialogues / monologues and all this touched by a little - if not too much - film noir.\n\nI do not think there are many brands out there whose sequels became really good. If you like trying out classic games this is a must have for you especially since almost everybody who appreciates the modern technology graphics have - probably - already played the 3rd and last episode. You'll probably have a sound issue once the game starts up for the first time but thanks to the many guides available on Steam this can be solved immediately.\n\nPS: Steer away from the film adaptation released in 2008. It is the epitome of how bad video game adaptations can turn out.","March 31","true","6.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I picked it up in a bundle with The Fall of Max Payne for a ridiculously cheap price, somewhere in the region of £2.50 or something. While I haven't played much of it so far, due to not having much time, I can tell you from console and PC experience that this is a solid port of a solid game. The cutscenes are great, in the form of a comic book strip which blends very well with the dark storyline.\n\nThe shooting is awesome and the bullet time is so much fun, the only problem I have with the game is the quick saving. It was originally binded to F5, but on a HP Envy, you can't use any of the F keys without holding CTRL or something. Makes it very annoying to save, however that was easily fixed in the options menu. However, I found myself saving after I killed any enemy in fear of going too far back.\n\nOther than that small nitpick, the game is great. A good story, good mechanics and the sound quality is good. Bravo on a  good PC port Valve!","October 12, 2014","true","1.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","4"

The depressing storyline, the gameplay itself, the comic like "cutscenes" now and then, the ambient. I actually remember that this game had a nice soundtrack, but sadly, the steam version's (I guess) is not optimized for newer operative systems, so, there is no music for almost the whole game. ( I'm aware that there is a fix, I just tried it, failed, and got too lazy to keep on fighting). One thing is for sure. This game, as you can see from the first paragraphs of my review, is stupidly hard and unforgiving.

Not from the specific one, but its sequel but that's the reason i know the series anyways. I am lucky that someone gave me the fall of max payne on PS as a gift, which was a significant part of my childhood. I recently bought this one and finished it for the first time. The fact that i have finished the sequel numerous times while knowing absolutely nothing about the original felt awkward. Well, it's about time i wrote a review.\n\nStory(No Spoilers)\nThe plot follows Max Payne, a NYPD cop in the '90s, who was living the "American Dream" before his wife and child were murdered. Three years later,he is working undercover in a drug case, which is connected to the death of his family, when he is framed for his partner's death. Now he has to work alone to uncover the truth.\n\nGame Time\nIt takes about 8 hours to complete\n\nIn detail\nTo begin with, it's a classic third person action ***(-adventure)*** shooter, with a great storyline and interesting action sequences, considering the year it was made.\n\nPros\n+ Mainstream story but with a very interesting plot, but unfortunately, it seems that it's a small part of the game\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ Graphic novels replace cinematic cutscenes, but not entirely, since there are still some.\n+ Bullet time\n+ Shootouts are too many to handle (dayum)\n\nCons\n- Almost the entire game consists of shooting, shooting and shooting except:\n- The prologues of each part which are not only kind of pointless but can also become really frustrating.\n- ***Concerning the gameplay, there was no serious effort on map creation since they usually become boring, and simple. Not to mention the fact that they sometimes cover more than a chapter. Comparing them to the sequel's, they are not good, and deprive the of its potential of being consider an adventure game. Someone can easily assume that, at some points, it is like a hack 'n slash. game***\n- Also, i was disapointed by the small variety of weapons. Commiting a genocide with berettas, deagle and occasionaly an M4 can get really boring. Additionally, the ammount of bullets it takes to bring someone down (excluding headshots) is ridiculous.\n- Last but not least, the ability to save the game whenever you like makes the game less challenging, since this function can be abused, but no one, since the experience is ruined.\n\nConcluding, i recommend grabbing the game only on sale (usually ~75%) since i dont think it's worth full price.\n\n7.5 / 10.0\n\n1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].\n2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].\n3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]","October 19, 2015","true","27.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I wasn't selling any.\nMax, Max, Max.......Where did it all go so wrong? You had the American Dream and now look at you. The dream lies dead on the ground and you releasing your finger from the trigger. From "Golden Boy" to a wanted man, no angel could have fallen so far.\n\nThis one is very high on my list of all time favorites. Even though there have been sequels, the original is the best as far as I am concerned. An early adopter of "bullet time" and pulled it off with more than a little panache. Like any rogue *insert profession here*, there must be painkillers involved. Think House with a bigger grudge, dipping into every stash he finds. Medkits are too bulky anyway, pills can be tucked into a jacket pocket. And guns, so many guns. Or should I use a grenade launcher. Would that be overkill? Better to be safe than sorry.\nA big draw for me was the art style of this game. It was like finding a diamond in the rough; the lack of polish, the roughness was what made it better than any of the subsequent games. It is dark, dreary, lonesome and this game conveys how gritty Noir York City is when you are on the wrong side of a badge. Cut scenes are set up in still panels, giving it a Grendel or Crow anti-hero comic book feel.\n\n"My whole life was just frames, words hanging in the air like bubbles. I was in a graphic novel. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of."\n\nSome of the mechanics aren't great, but you have to take the bad with the good. Opening cupboards and closets consists of running into it with enough force that it just pops open. Jumping in this is a bit of a chore. But if you manage it properly, there are a few Easter eggs to be found. And there have been occasions when I bullet time'd against a wall or onto the subway tracks.\nFor the money, there might be other games to be had. But none of them will have the desperate need to go on, rather than safely log out and crawl into a nice warm bed with that loved one that Max can never have again. It's the little extras in the game that keep me playing. There's always a few seconds to spare after a fire fight to catch up on some TV or your newspaper comic strip after fighting your way free from captivity.\n\nThe verdict my Lords and Ladies?\nThe story is compelling, the style is dark, your fortunes are bleak, you have nothing to lose.

I'll just say 12/10 story :)\n\n\nThe gameplay is just so amazing. The game always manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. It gives you just enough ammo and painkillers to stay alive as long as you don't make any mistakes. The slightest slip up can send you back to your last save.\n\nSpeaking of saving, let me introduce you to the F5 key. This is my best friend. As you could probably guess, it's the quicksave button. You will probably die A LOT in this game, depending on how good you are. Just remember to press F5 before you open a door and you won't have really anything to worry about.\n\nAlso, have a walkthrough open while you play this. There are some levels where to progress, you need to do the most RANDOM thing, such as shoot the top off of a propane tank, try to open a locked door, or even break a few boxes. Just be warned.\n\nAnyways, 9/10, one of my personal favorites, definitely worth the buy.","December 24, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even if it hasn't aged the best, the copious helping of noir style and dead-serious melodrama mixed with weird humour make this one still worthwhile, and I recommend running through it as part of a full trilogy run.\n\nIt comes from a simpler time where shooters could just be about shooting everyone, with no vehicle sections, no hacking minigames, no rpg elements, no sandbox elements, no moral choices, no collectibles, no quicktime events, no... well, you get the idea. It can seem like a relic today, but I appreciate the simplicity and devotion to doing one thing and doing it well.

Max Payne 1 is a third person action thriller video game that was developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001. You play as Max, who is a NYPD detective who comes home one day to find that his family has been murdered. He then attempts to avenge the murder of his family.\n\nThis game has a very gritty neo-noir style and it also uses a graphics novel to tell the story in full detail. This game comes with incredible atmosphere that is very depressing and goes along perfectly with the ambient soundtracks. This is also one of the first games to feature the bullet time affect that was popularised by the matrix. I fully reccomend playing this game even today, this is just one of those games that never gets old.\n\nIf I was to pick a game that I had the greatest experience playing, it would be this one. I remember being around 9 years old, having a computer that could barely run this game. I bought this game for just £2 at a used games store without knowing anything about this game. I got home and holy ♥♥♥♥ I was suprised. This game just seemed to be utterly perfect to me and before I knew it I found myself getting deeper and deeper into what some gamers call "the zone" I have had this with other games, but never like I did with this one. Everything other than this game started to fade away as I was playing it in a dark room. it got so strong that it was almost like this game became my entire reality and it was the only thing that existed in the universe. It was so strange, but it was probably one of the greatest experiences of my life.","January 30","true","61.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FromOuterHeavenWithLove/recommended/12140/","FromOuterHeavenWithLove","Centurio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FromOuterHeavenWithLove/","215 products in account","My Personal Score: 4/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]\nIssues: has sound problems on Windows Vista and onwards. Fix and instructions on the PCGW page.\n\nMax Payne is one of those classic games that's really hard to forget because of the unique experience that it delivers. The cinematic gameplay, the gritty story, the noir-inspired aestethics - the game has a timeless quality to it that you rarely find in old titles. There's something about playing as a rogue cop who guns his way through crazy mobsters and corrupt government agents that I can't quite put my finger on which makes it so memorable. Maybe its Max's inner monologues about his sense of right and wrong. Perhaps it's the difficult gameplay and the "shoot first or get shot" attitude of the combat which really brings out the rush in the player. Whatever it is, there's no denying that Max Payne is still fun to play, years after its release and still holds up pretty well on all aspects.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=677196561\n\nYou play as the titular Max Payne, an appropriately named cop turned undercover DEA agent who lost his wife and daughter to drug-crazed addicts. The events of the game starts three years after his family died, at a time when Max is deep inside the Punchinello crime family, one of New York's biggest mafia organizations and a major distributor in the drug trade. On a snowy night, he recieves a call from one of his partners telling him to meet up at a train station and from there starts the ball rolling into the world of crime and corruption.\n\nNow, why in the world would you want to spend both your $$$ and time on this really old game? First of all, it's literally a John Woo action flick in video game form. The game features Bullet Time, slow-mo mechanics, and chaotic gunplay that Remedy, the developers, have admitted to having been inspired by the acclaimed director's movies. If you want to play a difficult action game without the constant hand-holding and the hassles of modern game mechanics, then this game is for you. Second, it has a mature noir story that's full of twists and turns. The game shows Max as an anti-hero, a man with nothing to lose who will go to great lengths to bring the people who killed his family to justice. He spends a night in New York getting tangled with the city's most ruthless individuals who plays each other for their own ends.\n\nAn interesting detail with the game is how involved the world around Max Payne is. TV and radio shows report about the people of New York's overwhelming support for Max's vendetta against the mafia. The police are constantly on his tail as they try to stop him from causing further damage. As Max moves up the food chain, so does word of his presence. Small details here and there but it improves the immersion of the player in the story in a huge way. To top it all off, story segments and cutscenes are presented like a graphic novel starring the people who made the game. A tight budget forced Remedy to be as creative as possible and made the game stand out as a result. Sam Lake, head writer for Remedy Entertainment acts as the face and body of Max Payne with James McCaffrey serving as the memorable monotome voice.\n\nHow about downsides? Well, as stated above, there are issues with the sound on modern operating systems which can easily be fixed. Other than that, I haven't experienced any performance issue or game-breaking bugs. There's also the fact that this is an old game, meaning that your tolerance will be tested if you're accustomed to modern titles. No health regen, no cover, an easy mode that kills Max in 2 hits - It's going to take a very patient player to finish the game.\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","May 6","true","51.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/recommended/12140/","Paddles93","[TPZ] Cereal Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/","219 products in account","About The Game:\nMax Payne is a 3rd person shooter based around mobsters, drug addicts & drug dealers that run rampant in the streets of New York City & you as Max Payne the cities "Ex Cop" which put most of them away for their crimes.\n\nA rather large & compelling story with major plot twists around each corner. You'll need a lot of clarity in your head to grasp the reality of this well written and planned out story that is "Max Payne".\n\nThe Story:\nMax Payne's story is set around the player Max Payne who is a Police Officer in the New York Police Department, you're 1 of the biggest cops in the department because of how many cases you've solved and how many criminals you've put away, of course with all the popularity from the good guys the bad guys also see it fit to use you as their scapegoat for a very chilling & deep story.\n\nMax Payne is stuck centered in a mob hit which has his Wife & Baby murdered in cold blood, this leaves Max with a bad case of depression & drug abuse, While Max is on his first job back at the force, Max ends up once again getting stuck in another situation that has his partner killed & him being framed as the gunman, this causes him to lose his job at the police force & leaves him on the run as a wanted criminal.\n\nWith major twists around every corner and a very dark and unnerving story you're going to need to experience every second of it to understand truely how the protaganist feels.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nMax Payne's gameplay is set around shooting, shooting and more shooting, there's not much sections in the game that don't rely on you killing someone or something. But of course if you were in Max's situation you'd be out for revenge for who set you up & murdered your family too.\n\nThe gunplay in Max Payne is very iffy & doesn't feel the best, at times the guns feel too useless & you spend more time retrying sections till you get them right! This gets really frustrating & will often have you quit every half an hour or so.\n\nThe use of Bullet Time in this game is one of the cooler features in the franchise.\nThis game is where "Bullet Time" started for the gaming community only after the Matrix movies started it for the movies. (Props to Remedy for bringing this awesome feature to reality).\n\nMax Payne is one of the few games that doesn't use Quick Saves & Checkpoints so make sure you save frequently or you're going to be starting from the beginning of the game quite a lot!\n\nThe Verdict:\nMax Payne 1 it self is not a bad game, it's quite the opposite, Remedy is one of the best companies i've ever seen when it comes to story telling gameplay, from Max Payne to Alan Wake they're flawless in story with very little to no plot holes & they also have very solid gameplay to boot.\n\nThe problem i have with Max Payne 1 is that it's quite frustrating that the weapons feel useless & the NPC enemies will generally rush at you in order to kill you rather than duck behind cover & wait for you to come to them. It feels a bit cheap and because you have no defence when they get in close to you, well you often die fast.\n\nThe controls for Max Payne are really REALLY clunky, movement is restricted to only running so don't try to take your time because you can't walk, this was an issue on the Playstation 2 version as well so it's not just PC.\n\nCombat is very nice with Bullet Time but without Bullet Time it can be quite hard to kill the enemies so make sure you save it for when you need it.\n\nHang onto as many "Pain Pills" as you can because they're your source of health & they're quite scarce and of course without them expect to die alot.\n\nMax Payne is such a great game from it's seriously dark and grim story to it's fantastic Bullet Time & Character Development to the enemies having very interesting and creative dialogue, nothing in this game feels like it's out of place.\n\nMy main gripe is the weapons being weak and the enemies being cheap.\n\nThe Rating:\nI have to give Max Payne a 6/10, it would be higher if there wasn't so many down points for the clunky controls & the weak guns.\n\nThe Story & the strong character development is what makes this review stay strong & without these key elements being 100% top notch this game would be one i would warn people to steer clear from, however i just can't say that to such a great franchise,\n\nIf you don't like Max Payne 1 for the reasons i mentioned then you MUST play Max Payne 2: Fall of Max Payne because everything bad in this game has been fixed in that game!\n\nRelated Reviews:\n\nMax Payne 2: Fall of Max Payne:\n\nWritting in progress.\n\nMax Payne 3:\n\nPossible for the future but not owned.","October 13, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is one of those video games that makes us question what a video game truly is. Almost all the cutscenes are done in a graphic novel style literally going from one page to the next after the charecters have spoken. It is very interesting and unique to the point where I wanted to play just to get to the next scene sort of like how I would want to play MGS games just to get to the next scene. However unlike MGS the gameplay is extremely unique. It is a third person shooter that places Max in the middle of the screen with a crosshair in the very center of the screen. Most people who play this game rave about how fun it is to use the bullet time effect to take out enemies. I agree that it is extremely fun and sometimes difficult to do. You use quick saves in the game which you NEED TO USE unless you are a god at the game then you will not be getting through that many levels without dying. Ofcourse there is an autosave feature but it is pathetic how often it is used. With quicksaves you will find yourself saving before a fight then going into the fight and most likely dying in which you will rethink everything like where you aimed, how you entered the area or what gun you used.\n\nLet me just put it this way. I was up late exausted playing this game just desperatley wanting to get to the next scene.\n\nI think the only bad things about the game (gameplay wise) really are the underpowered weapons or not knowing where to go or what to do at times.\n\nNow the bad things about the game in general that are not really related to the gameplay is how Max just all of a sudden becomes a mass murderer after his family is killed. Max never talks about how hard it is to shoot and kill people just to get to the person responsible for the murder. There is also quite a lot of blood and very sexual things in the game but I think that is to be expected when the game is advertised as a Noir story.\n\nOverall this game is fantastic and if you are not bothered by anything that I have mentioned in the last two paragraphs you are crazy not to be playing this game as soon as humanly possible (Unless you are one of those unfortunate enough to have a computer that will not start this game up due to the direct X 8 requirment)\n\nUPDATE: After updating my driviers to catylyst 14.12 for my AMD 6670 graphics card and running the game in compatibility mode Windows 98/ME I have got the game to work on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. I had to use the audio fix afterwards and I was running the game fine.","November 10, 2014","true","36.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Having just recently started getting into video game franchises, I decided to give Max Payne a try (it was bundled with Max Payne 2 for only a few bucks!). Boy, was it a good choice.\n\nDue to my being accustomed to third person shooters like Uncharted, it was definitely jarring going into the game and realising there's no cover and the enemies have no propensity for self-preservation. And Max is very easy to kill (meaning in the gameplay, not in the storyline). This made things extremely interesting and fast paced. The AI could be dumb a lot, but I mean AI wasn't what it was now. Nevertheless, these elements made for very actiony gameplay. Although the game is set in the 90s, the atmosphere, the vehicles and the dress of some of the characters made it all seem like a proper film noir. The storyline is intricate and very entertaining and the graphic novel scenes are very well-voiced (for the most part).\n\nAnd of course, I can't do this without mentioning bullet time. Springing forward or sideways in slow motion to take on your enemies is so satisfying. Best of all, the bullets are all rendered, even shot from your shotgun, meaning it's not just hitscan and you can see the bullets  land. It's really cool.\n\nAll in all, the game is cheap and very much worth it, even after all these years.\n\n9/10","September 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember playing the demo years ago when it was new, but I thought the theme was too dark and didn't play it.  I figured it would be easier to play now, but the beginning of the game is as dark and creepy as ever, although it does provide you with strong motivation.\n\nThe game makes liberal use of bullet-time from The Matrix.  Heck, it even steals the hotel lobby scene right out of the movie, which is a blast to play.  The effect is done masterfully.  At first, it seems like this may make the game too easy, but before long,  you realize you'll need it to survive.  There is no health regen, only a limited supply of pain pills you have to hunt for.\n\nThe game was released in 2001, so the graphics look dated now, but you can tell they were very good for the time.  The game supports widescreen resolutions, but it stretches out the picture.  You'll be better off picking a 4:3 resolution with the same height as your monitor.  If you have sound problems, setup the game with Alchemy (SoundBlaster only) or look for a user patch.  The game clocks in at "only 10 hours", which was short for back then. It makes you wonder if this started the trend towards shorter, but more action packed games.\n\nAll-in-all, a great game.  Better games may have been made since, but Max Payne raised the bar and left its mark.","January 27, 2013","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At the time of release there was just nothing else like Max Payne. The Matrix was fresh in the minds of the masses. System Shock 2, Half-Life, Deus Ex, had all been released. PC gaming couldn't get any better. Or so we thought.\n\nControls may seem wonky to youngins raised on the buttery smooth engines of late. Mechanics may seem unpolished if you're used to a skill ceiling in reach of "everyone". Max Payne can both challenge and frustrate you. Gameplay-as-story was new and had only been woven succesfully into a handful of titles. It stands as a great example of a "pure" game, hitting all the highs the medium has to offer. It hasn't aged quite as gracefully as other classics, but strap into a comfy chair with at least a few hours to spare, turn the lights down and your sound up and prepare to enjoy an excellent affair of cinematic gaming in the dark underworld of a frozen New York City.","February 1, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The noir feel and the confession of the character is very believable, he tells his monologue through the comixes in the game. The voice acting makes it all the way more enjoyable as a ride through one of those thriller movies..\n\nI really enjoyed this tittle.

At the time of release there was just nothing else like Max Payne. The Matrix was fresh in the minds of the masses. System Shock 2, Half-Life, Deus Ex, had all been released. PC gaming couldn't get any better. Or so we thought.\n\nControls may seem wonky to youngins raised on the buttery smooth engines of late. Mechanics may seem unpolished if you're used to a skill ceiling in reach of "everyone". Max Payne can both challenge and frustrate you. Gameplay-as-story was new and had only been woven succesfully into a handful of titles. It stands as a great example of a "pure" game, hitting all the highs the medium has to offer. It hasn't aged quite as gracefully as other classics, but strap into a comfy chair with at least a few hours to spare, turn the lights down and your sound up and prepare to enjoy an excellent affair of cinematic gaming in the dark underworld of a frozen New York City.","February 1, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Max Payne is a shooter way ahead of it's time that takes you through a long, dark, well written adventure.\n\nEach level is long with lot's of work and detail put into it. You have a slow-motion meter and you can watch each bullet hit its target in your firefights and every item in this game reacts differently to bullets and shotgun shells(Televison sets explode with electricity, walls spark and spit out debris, metal clunks and sparks, fire hyrdrants emit foam and the list goes on!) making for some EXTREMELY satisfying gunplay.\n\nPlenty of humor and detail thrown into the game, if you wait before confronting certain enemies, they'll have different (and oftentimes, hilarious) scripted conversations that are worth listening to. As the sh** hits the fan later on in the game, the enemies and levels get crazier and more menacing all the way to the final level taking place in the heavily guarded and delightfully long and huge(very funny) Aesir Corporation building.\n\nAn all-around great game. My only beef with the game on Steam is the fact that when I play it, there is almost always no sound while playing. There is a patch you can download, but being the pc noob that I am I don't know how to do it and make it work ):\n(However Max Payne 2 which, in my opinion is almost as good and better in certain aspects, works just fine. And as Max Payne 1 and 2 are both ten dollars on Steam, I highly recommend you purchase the 15 dollar bundle that includes both games.)","November 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even after so many years it still remain one of my favorite games ever. It's just perfect. So why did I fall in love with Max Payne?\n- Shooting.\nThose weapons are really made well. If you are using shotgun it feels like shotgun, it can send bad guys flying for few meters, but you also can fly pretty high too. Throught whole game you use all of the weapons in game. Shooting in Max Payne is pure fun.\n- Slow motion.\nProbably the best slowmo in history of gaming. I mean it. Even Matrix games never had slowmo this amazing. Jumping from the corner to surprise your enemies, jumping throught the doors to surprise your enemies, and slowly falling on the ground, but faster their dead bodies.\n- Story and characters.\nThere are great and memorable characters in this game. The story in form of comic is interesting as the story itself.\n"Clear as vodka."\n"No Payne, No Gain."\nAnd of course full of specific humour. Narration is perfect too.\n- Music.\nJust at the very beggining you have hard time starting game. Why? Max Payne have this amazing theme music. It makes you wait for the whole thing, it's playing, and playing, and you can't stop listening to it. When I heard it first time I had chills. It's perfect, it describes perfect, without use of any words, what kind of game Max Payne is. You will want to hear more of it as you progress with the story.\n- Difficult level.\nMax Payne isn't a easy game. Even while playing on lowest difficult level the bad guys can pack whole shotgun shell in your head, or something on your back, and kill you without any problem. Same with them throwing grenades or molotov cocktails. Once they will get better stuff than pistols you will need something more than just slowmo to get rid of them. It's easy to get hurt and there aren't enough painkillers to get rid of all this Payne...\n\nTo be honest, I could praise this game all the time. Don't mind that it's an old game. It aged very well, graphics still looks great (at least for me) and it's full of things that you won't find in gaming nowadays. Even people playing Max Payne for the first time, so many years after release, are surprised how they could miss something like that. If you haven't played it, you must do it. You won't regret it.","May 23, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/12140/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rv5_R4nfv8\n\nMax Payne. Maximum pain. His name hides his destiny, never to find peace, to lose everyone he cares about, constantly to be in pain and always be on the edge of life and death. This is the tragic story of the title character of the revolutionary Max Payne.\n\nIn one faithful night, everything he loves is gone in a blink of an eye and the world around him crumble. Arriving home he find his baby daughter and wife killed by junkies, under the influence of a new found drug on the streets of NY, called Valkyre or just V. After the funeral Max transfer to DEA and goes undercover, determine to find where the drug comes from. Only two agents, Alex and B.B. knows who he is. Three years later, Max finally have break on the Valkyre case. He recieve a messege from B.B. to meet Alex. Max have a bad feeling about this and he wasn't wrong. Alex get killed and he takes the blame for the murder. With nothing left to lose, Max takes the path of vengeance. He is been chased by everyone – police, mobsters, freaks and so on. This wild chase is happening in the middle of huge winter storm, as if it comes end of the world. From here follows twist and turns, betrayls, meeting with insane villians, bad guys helping you with information, corruptions, blackmail and so on. The story is one of the best things here. It's written by Sam Lake, who is the face of Max. The script is full of metaphors and references to scandinavian mythology. It's brilliantly written.\n\nCutscene are great and original. They are looking like graphic novel with neo-noir vibe and the voice of James McCaffrey make them even more memorable. Because of the moderate budget, Sam Lake is the face of the main characters and friends and colleagues are other people in the game. The cutscenes are filled with the inner monologs of Max, from which we find out the story and his mental state.\n\nEven so many years later all this is still kind of impressive. But what is most memorable and revolutionary is in the gameplay section. The thing i'm talking about is bullet-time. It gives you more time to react and make more accurate shots. You can see to the silhouette of Max an hourglass. There is shown how much bullet-time you have. With a press of a button everything slows down and you can even see where the bullets fly. If you dive in it takes little part of it, so you have to decide how to use it. The hourglass drains quickly and the only way to fiil it is to kill enemies without using bullet-time. You have to use it wisely, because slowing down time is essential for reaching the end. The game is highly inspired by Hong Kong action movie, especially those of John Woo.\n\nThe game is old school and doesn't have regenerating health. You restore it by the most logical thing for the game – painkillers. You find them in spread around the levels. Sometimes they are not in obvious places.\n\nThe feeling of using bullet-time and blast through small group of bad guys is awesome.You are almost invulnerable. But you are not. Max life is fragile and even on the lowest difficulty, you can die in a blink of an eye. The game is hard, but fair. She will  kick your ♥♥♥ right from the start and ask do you want more. Most of the times when you die, it's player fault. Some enemies are cheaply placed and you don't have enough time to react. So quick save is alway an option. I don't want to know how is in the higher difficulties.\n\nMax have substantial, but fairly standard arsenal of weapons – pistols, shotgun, double barrel shotgun, assault rifle, uzi, granade launcher, granades, sniper, Molotov and my favorite – Jackhammer. In close range is irreplaceable. The only weapon i don't like is the shotgun. The reloading speed is slow and i often die, when i use it. Here you can find one interesting and innovative thing. When you shoot with the sniper, the camera follows the bullet. Sound familiar? Few years later this will be the main feature in Sniper Elite.\n\nThe level design is awesome. They fairly diverse – abandone buildings, harbor, mansion and so on. Some places are even turn in to a brothel. There you can see, especially in the abandon buildings, the darkside of NY. The atmosphere is dark, grimm and depressing, particularly when you see the consequences on people using Valkyre. Death is above them and waiting to collect their souls. There are other more bright places like mansion, skyscraper and so on. But there heavily armed men are waiting for you. There are two different level. Little anoying to navigate, but they are not long. They are dreams, representing the mental state of Max, his fears, desires and the guilt he feels all the time. Dark and confused like himself.\n\nThe graphics are bad, but it's 14 year old game. This is the biggest problem here. Human models are not pretty to look at and not different enough. When you take in account release date, modest budget of 3 milion dollars for four years and the small Remedy team, it's not suprising. But in the end the game sold 7,5 million copies.\n\n14 years later the sound design is still impressive. Guns doesn't sound bombastic, they are not too loud. When using pistol, you hear pistol.\n\nThe voice acting is fantastic. Even people with small roles are doing great job, but most memorable is of James McCafferey. There is an actior voicing one of the bosses, lunatic using V, can make you shiver, when you hear him talking.\n\nYou will remmember the music in Max Payne, especially the singnature music theme. Deep beat, followed by piano and little bit later guitar and drums can be heard. All this sets the mood for the sad and dark story of Max. The others are also good. Energetic tracks with pinch of tension in the style of 80's action movies. Some places don't have music playing and this just adds to the atmosphere. Phenomenal soundtrack. When you consider the budget of Remedy, all of this is incredible. Modern games should take a notes.\n\nThis game is classic and everyone have to play. It even run great on Windows 7. You have the feeling you are in John Woo movie, where hero pour a rain of bullets and skillfully avoid them. Despite that the graphics didn't age  well, every person have to see the roots of this series and the beginning of bullet-time. It doesn't matter how other games call it. The foundation is laid here. The story and gameplay are still great. Fantastic soundtrack, great and inovative gameplay, original and interesting cutscene, superb action. Here is also laid the foundation of one of the most beloved games from me – Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. I highly recommend it.","May 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nothing","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053588824/","11 products in account","Even though published already in 2001, Max Payne still keeps on rocking. Max Payne offers an interesting and dark twisted plot which keeps you quessing until you reach the very end of the game. As a side note, the developers of Max Payne had decided to create easter eggs and other interesting visual appearences, which combined with the awesome story the game has to offer leaves you willing to play the game through yet another and maybe the third time.\n\nGameplaywise Max Payne is basically a run and shoot game with a very little variation between the firefight scenes you encounter. The range of usable weapons in the game is pretty small and the amount of bullets you will have to consume to kill the enemies is absolutely ridiculous. Also the enemies have a bad habit to come out of the blue or suddenly throw grenades which are almost impossible to evade within the given time. With that being said the gameplay of Max Payne is quite fast-paced and needs to be played with a great amount of concentration.\n\nDespite the negative sides of the gameplay, there is also something good to say about it. The level design of the game is pretty unique and really one of those things which arouses the original Max Payne-like feelings in the player while playing the game through. The voice acting in the game is great and the facial expressions the enemies as well as Max have on their faces are rather funny. Also the controllability of Max's moves is very well done and the fact that there is so much awesome mods made for Max Payne gives it some added value.\n\nOverall when you get used to playing Max Payne, it isn't that hard to beat on any level. I have played Max Payne through once before I owned it on Steam. After I got the Steam version, I made three more playthroughs, with every given difficulty option. And guess what? I just cannot regret the time spent playing on this obvious game. After the first (Steam version) playthrough I found myself enjoying outdated graphics, some visual appearences and the certain things in the actual gameplay the game has to offer.

Released in 2001, Max Payne exists in a time so close to the height of 90s bravado that it hasn't quite dissipated yet, but we might finally be ready to start talking about how silly it all was. For a fifteen-year-old Playstation port, the game itself has held up surprisingly well, perhaps even gaining a bit more accessibility in the move to the PC. The interface is clean and intuitive, the transition between shooting gobs of interchangeable mooks and the fastforwardable/rewindable cutscenes is smooth, and the bullet time mechanic is game-changingly useful without entirely dominating play. Other than the platforming elements - that have no business in this game in the first place - Max Payne is still a joy to play. Even when being encouraged to abuse the quick save function to solve cheap instant-death scenarios, it doesn't stop being fun. But what makes the game memorable are the little touches: the casual nature of the conversations between enemies before you burst into a room, the sensible placement of guns and painkillers, the way Max looks towards and mentions cutscene-inducing items but lets the player activate them on his or her timescale. Where Max Payne shows its age is in the flat, pasted on faces of its character models. Everyone is made out of sharp-edged boxes and Max himself is caught in a perpetual squint that never fails to decimate his dramatic creditability. This weakness only highlights the brilliance of the graphic novel styled cutscenes though, as they can be relied upon for any moment that wants to hold on to its pathos. And that's what Max Payne is made of: a handful of brilliant choices that leave its equal amount of flaws mostly ignorable.","March 28","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Max Payne bleeds noir and is oozing with style, like a cross between a John Woo and Quentin Tarantino movie.  The story is pretty standard ho hum stuff, but the way it is delivered is phenomenal.  The comic strip cutscenes are particularly nice since they still look good more than a decade after the game has become graphically outdated.  Payne's narration is great stuff; describing the world and ongoings around him with a surrealistic, morose style in typical noir fashion.\n\nThere are a few problems though.  For one, if you have Windows 7 or beyond you'll have trouble getting the game to run.  You'll need a community made sound patch for the cutscenes and you'll need to be sure to run this game in compatibility mode, otherwise it won't work.\n\nTechnical issues aside, Max Payne is a really hard game, but that difficulty is often unfair and it can be a source of frequent frustration.  The enemies don't have realistic reactions and will literally snap towards you the milisecond you appear in their general vicinity, shooting at you with pin point accuracy to the point where a guy with a sawed off shotgun will snipe you from across the room.\n\nYou'll find a lot of guns becoming useless for you while the enemy still often uses them to great effect, which is a real bummer.  The signature dual berretas become really useless really really fast, and the shotgun becomes equally useless later on since you cannot blow anyone off their feet not even in melee range, and they'll gun you down while you get a second shot in since they barely recoil to a shotgun blast to the face.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with quick save/quick load and try to strategize your approach to difficult encounters with bullet time, but really, Max Payne puts it best; "It wasn't about how smart or how good you were. It was chaos and luck, and anyone who thought different was a fool."\n\nAlso, the nightmare scenes are cool, but the platforming is... well, a nightmare.\n\nAnyway, none of that is enough to deter me from loving this game and that in itself should be a glowing testament to the quality of its other areas.

Even after so many years it still remain one of my favorite games ever. It's just perfect. So why did I fall in love with Max Payne?\n- Shooting.\nThose weapons are really made well. If you are using shotgun it feels like shotgun, it can send bad guys flying for few meters, but you also can fly pretty high too. Throught whole game you use all of the weapons in game. Shooting in Max Payne is pure fun.\n- Slow motion.\nProbably the best slowmo in history of gaming. I mean it. Even Matrix games never had slowmo this amazing. Jumping from the corner to surprise your enemies, jumping throught the doors to surprise your enemies, and slowly falling on the ground, but faster their dead bodies.\n- Story and characters.\nThere are great and memorable characters in this game. The story in form of comic is interesting as the story itself.\n"Clear as vodka."\n"No Payne, No Gain."\nAnd of course full of specific humour. Narration is perfect too.\n- Music.\nJust at the very beggining you have hard time starting game. Why? Max Payne have this amazing theme music. It makes you wait for the whole thing, it's playing, and playing, and you can't stop listening to it. When I heard it first time I had chills. It's perfect, it describes perfect, without use of any words, what kind of game Max Payne is. You will want to hear more of it as you progress with the story.\n- Difficult level.\nMax Payne isn't a easy game. Even while playing on lowest difficult level the bad guys can pack whole shotgun shell in your head, or something on your back, and kill you without any problem. Same with them throwing grenades or molotov cocktails. Once they will get better stuff than pistols you will need something more than just slowmo to get rid of them. It's easy to get hurt and there aren't enough painkillers to get rid of all this Payne...\n\nTo be honest, I could praise this game all the time. Don't mind that it's an old game. It aged very well, graphics still looks great (at least for me) and it's full of things that you won't find in gaming nowadays. Even people playing Max Payne for the first time, so many years after release, are surprised how they could miss something like that. If you haven't played it, you must do it. You won't regret it.","May 23, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a really fantastic experience from the beginning to the end!\n\nJust over a decade ago a friend gave it to me as a gift on Retail CD for PC. I played it for a bit but never had a chance to complete it back then. Unfortunately the CD stopped being recognized and I gave up on it. But coincidentally 4 years ago I was gifted on Steam by another friend.\n\nThis time I decided to play it again. I never had any issues running the game on my Windows 7 system. The only issue I had was the sound being messed up. There was no sound in some parts of the game and other sounds disappeared. It is a compatibility issue with the latest operating systems. But luckily this problem was easily fixed by a Max Payne: Sound Fix! patch that is found in the Steam Community Hub Guides tab. After that the game ran flawlessly!\n\nAnyway, the graphics aren't up to par with the latest computer technologies, but they are of a high standard and exceptional for its time. The story is compelling, if sometimes a little difficult to follow, and once you start playing it, you don't want to stop! You want to know what's around the next corner and where the story will turn next, it really does get you hooked!\n\nLevel designs are varied and the gameplay is not repetitive. There are a total of 25 chapters in the game and each and every one of them is different so it constantly keeps you engaged. You can also manually save and not rely on checkpoint savings like some of the older PC titles. This is particularly important for a game like Max Payne where you'll come across difficult enemies. Enemies range from street thugs to military commandos. The first few stages of the game will present little problems for players, as enemies will rarely engage you and create life threatening situations. The latter stages of the game present much more complex situations, bombarding you with enemies in very close quarter areas. Enemies are pretty relentless throughout the game, so it's wise to sniff out painkillers and keep plenty in stock to top up any lost health and to also make sure to manually save each time you overcome difficult enemies or scenarios!\n\nYou also have a variety of weapons to choose from. Whether a baseball bat, handguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers, snipers, etc. You have full control over the enemies. Not to mention that in every particular scenario of the game you'll find that you'll need to choose different weapons for different situations! You cannot rely solely on one weapon only, that's what I like about this game. In one situation you'll need to throw grenades and in another you'll be requiring to use the sniper to kill enemies that are shooting from far above you.\n\nMax Payne is also the first game to introduce bullet-time effects (like those seen in the Matrix). During a gun fight Max can slow down everything around him to allow him better aim and an edge over his enemies. You could instigate the bullet-time parts of the game over and over again and they would still be as awesome to watch as the first time.\n\nIt's just great fun to let loose with any weapon and reap the benefits of destruction. Not everything is about killing, as some moments will call upon Max to solve mini puzzles, or even traverse hazardous routes in order to progress.\n\nOverall Max Payne is a fantastic third-person shooter, full of action and energy. The story is dark and backed by immersive film noir attributes. The graphics depict New York City in a stark fashion. The gameplay is highly entertaining and a complete bullet-fest from start to finish!","April 28","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfie_cairns/recommended/12140/","alfie_cairns","CairnsyMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfie_cairns/","218 products in account","Remedy's first Woo/Matrix inspired, action packed, third-person shooter in the Payne franchise delivers on what you might expect yet is somewhat limited in scope compared to their future efforts. People might remember the Max Payne games as a moody homage to noire detective thrillers, interrupted by bouts of exaggerated slow motion action but the reality on both accounts is surprisingly different.\n\nThe story (although creatively executed through comic book panels, expressive art, and some iconic musical themes) couldn't be more generic but that's OK because of the unique tone that remedy has struck and are now somewhat known for. From the outset it may look like a dire tale of a cop whom's family is murdered, framed for the death of a fellow DEA agent and on the run through an abandoned New York City (by way of that good old excuse, a dire blizzard) killing his way up a chain of endless wacky criminals and mob families to eventually discover a deeper conspiracy. Max Payne is remembered in part for its great story but the writing and structure themselves aren't particularly well executed, with far too many criminals, conspiracies, and betrayals for even Max's gravely narration to keep track of, and a fractured narrative structure that serves to confuse rather than contextualise the events of the story. Apart from some major Wikipedia plot points, if you asked me to tell you what happened in the first Max Payne I would draw a blank. The inherent character and tone that Remedy bring are what makes the story engaging. It manages to both take itself seriously and be incredibly self knowing, occasionally fourth wall breaking, and treading into pastiche territory upon occasion. There are some very funny in-game TV show's to watch and NPC conversions to overhear which break the tension of the story and combat, and give what is essentially an endless series of rooms to shoot though a sense of place within a larger world. The flavour of the story and the slow motion shooting mechanics and are't just the core of the experience, they are the experience.\n\nDespite the bevy of weapons (including duel pistols, shotguns, Uzi's, rifles, and some more ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ later on!) the gameplay loop consists of shooting your way through endless empty subway stations, hotels, office complexes, and gang hideouts, slow-mo launching yourself into a room filled with enemies while clumsily contorting your body into odd poses as you attempt to leverage your limited time to exert the maximum amount of payne. It's clumsy and unrefined but undeniably fun. A modern interpretation would feature better animations for jumping over cover and other contextual actions but this is mainly of visual importance. Only some occasional unintuitive environmental puzzle design hinders your endless slaughter.\n\nThe way the game is balanced is somewhat of a double edged sword. It's quite difficult and unforgiving (Max will perish in a few shots without downing a few dozen handfuls of delicious painkillers) to incentivize accuracy, the use of the slow-motion mechanic, and to make fights feel satisfying. The downside is that it prevented me from getting too creative with the tools they had given me. I ended up sticking to particular lines of sight and repeating consistently successful moves whilst fantasising about slow-mo launching myself down a spiral staircase or letting lose on dozens of enemies in the open, but I guess there are always cheats for that sort of thing. The levels are designed as a series of rooms with limited scripted events, it's all very simple (with only unlock-able difficulties and time trial modes offering replay value) and as such, can become repetitive although new weapons and drips of narrative context motivated me to continue despite this.\n\nThe first Payne outing is about establishing a tone and a gameplay rhythm that would later be refined upon as well as showing off some impressive graphical fidelity (if you can ignore Muppet hands and Max's permanently constipated facial expression) and slow motion technological accomplishments that were impressive for the time and still hold up today. Max Payne 2 is the superior game in every way, making the first seem like more of a proof of concept or a tech demo with a smaller scope by comparison, but all the ingredients are here and they still make for a fun game.","April 2","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sm0ker_/recommended/12140/","sm0ker_","Woozy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sm0ker_/","119 products in account","Max Payne is a very interesting game. It looks like it was made on a budget of 10 $5 footlongs and a cheap toaster. Max has a permanent constipated look on his face, the textures are really low-res, and the voice acting is sub-par. Those things though are part of what makes this such a charming game. Max's metaphors and similies are like poetry, and the game plays like a dream. The story is gripping, I had no problems getting through it, which I credit to the way it's delivered. The game's cutscenes are almost all in a graphic novel format. You get 4-5 pages of 2 - 3 panels each at the start and end of each segment, 6 - 7 pages of 2 - 3 panels at the end of each chapter, and 1 - 2 pages during gameplay. The shortness of these cutscenes means you're out of them and back in the game in a heartbeat, ready to shoot more mooks in slow motion. Max Payne plays very much like an arcade shooter, with short, frequent encounters and occasional bosses. It's only downfall in my eyes are the dream sequences at the start of each chapter. This is not a platforming game at all, so there's no reason for me to be walking narrow pathways over insta-death pits except padding. Luckily, there are only two of them, and the second one breaks the fourth wall in an amusing way.\n\ntl;dr, buy Max Payne. It's a great value at any price, and a very memorable game.","October 13, 2014","true","27.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Payne'',a third-person shooter video game\n,developed by the video game company Remedy Entertainment.\nThe game was published by Gathering of Developers\n(now known as Gathering,a daughter company of Take-Two Interactive) in North America\nand 3D Realms in Europe on July 2001 for Microsoft Windows.\nand released in Semptember 22 on 2006(in Europe).\nThe game can be run through Microsoft Windows,Playstation 2,Xbox,Game Boy Advance,Mac OS,iOS & Android.\nThe game uses the MAX-FX 1.0.\nGenre(s):Third-person shooter\nMode(s):Single-player\nDistribution:CD-ROM,DVD,cartridge,digital download.\n\nPlot\nThe game takes place in New York city,in December 2001,where you take control of a former NYPD officer and a renegade DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration),Max Payne,who's being arrested by the police at the top of a skyscraper.\nWhile he is being arrested he experiences a flashback which explains his life story and why he is being chased.\n\nOn August 22. 1998 NYPD detective,Max payne,just finishing his work goes home only to find his wife and his newborn daughter,Rose,brutally murdered.Max kills the junkies responsible for the murder of his loved ones but he is too late.After that incident he transfers to DEA in order to find out who is responsible and ultimately take revenge.\n\nThe game's content majority takes place during the last two days while Max is operating inside the Punchinello Mafia family,under the Don Angelo Punchinello(family's head),responsible for the trafficking of the Valkyr drug.After given a message to meet Alex(his Dea contact and Max's best friend) Max find Alex on the NYC Rosco Subway Station.His arrival at the Station results in encountering Jack's Lupino mobster group(Punchinello's crime family underboss)who were attempting an armed robbery.There he will come in contact with Aesir Corporation(just company bonds),a mysterious New York corporation,who is bound to play an important role on the story later on.\n\nLater on Max Payne will come in contact with Alex who informs him that Max has been exposed by a mole in the Punchinello family.Seconds later Alex gets killed by a possible Killer Suit(Aesir's corporation hitmen).To make things worse Payne becomes suspect because of the fact that he is still an undercover,therefore an enemy,and is now chased by both the Punchinello crime family and also by the Deputy Chief Jim Bravura.\n\n\nSucceding the Station's events he goes to a Lupino's motel where he finds and kills the Finito Brothers(Vinnie's Gognitti subordinate).After that Max travels in one of Lupino's bars,finds the diary of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,Candy,and the fact that he sends video tapes of her and a mysterious <<one-eyed Alfred>>(an important figure later on).Eventually Max finds and kills Rico Muerte(a former hitman working for Punchinello) and Candy.In the bar Max found the location of Gognitti.\n\nAfter chasing Gognitti from his apartment through the city and the subway,Max learns about a nightclub named Ragna Rok.There Max spares Gognitti and Max proceeds in killing the so called ''antichrist'' Lupino.After killing him and his men he encounters Mona Sax,Lisa's Punchinello twin sister and contract killer,who sedates Max by throwing something in his drink,telling him that she wants to kill the Don too.\n\nAfter a dream about his family's death he wakes up and manages to escape the Mafia base and after that he finds himself in the bar where he earlier killed Rico Muerte.There Max finds Frank "The Bat" Niagara who had captured Max and was going to kill him.After these events Max is approached by Vladimir Lem(Russian's mafia leader and Punichinello's prime enemy) and is proposed a brief alliance.With Vlad's help Max seizes the cargo ship Charon and kills Boris Dime,a Punchinello subordinate(former Lem's subordinate),and arranges a meeting in Don's restaurant,only to bee a set up resulting in the bombing of the place and the killing of the rest of Punchinello's men(by Max Payne of course).\n\nMax Payne,then,heads for Punchinello's residence only to find and kill the Trio(Vince Mugnaio,\nPilate Providence (AKA "Big Brother"),and Joe "Deadpan" Salem) Don's most feared hitman group.Max later finds the corpse of the Don's wife(Mona's twin sister) and discovers that the Don is just a pawn for the Aesir Corporation.The Don is killed by the agents of Nicole Horne,the Ceo,and Payne is being injected an overose of the Valkyr drug.Payne then suffers nightmares about his family but manages to survive the dosage.\n\nThe game now takes it's final course.Max finds out and underground military research complex where inside that complex Valkyr is being researched,an experiment that attempted to improve but failed to do so the stamina and morale of the U.S soldiers.The drug research was halted but Horne ,who was the leading expert of the so called Valhalla Project,after becoming the Ceo she restarted the research and used the company as a front for producing the Valkyr.Max escapes the complex after a successful destruction by the Aesir Corporation in order to destroy the evidence.\n\nLater on Max encounters B.B who admits that was bribed by Nicole Horne to kill Max and Alex.Max then chases the traitor B.B Hensley(Payne's other DEA contact) and kills him.After doing so Max gets a phone call from Alfred Wooden(''one-eyed Alfred''),asking him to come to Asgard Building.There he learns that Alfred is a part of the Inner Circle,a powerful society with strong ties to the U.S government.The Inner Circle want to stop Nicole Horne but they can't because of\nthe fact that Alfred was being blackmailed by the Punchinello family over the tapes coming from the Lupino's pimp club.They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping the charges against him.Suddenly,Aesir assassins invade the building and kill everyone except Max,who manages to run away,and Woden,who pretends to have died.\n\nIn the end Max arrives at the Aesir Corporation building,kills the guards and at the top of the building confronts Nicole Horne who boards a helicopter.Max shoots wires that holds the buildin's antenna,which breaks off and crashes onto the helicopter,successfully killing Horne.While these events Mona Sax dies from a shot in the head but her body vanishes unknowningly.\n\nIn the end Max,as said in Plot's section first paragraph,gets arrested by the policemen.Max has finally taken his revenge for the death of his loved ones.Max smiles satisfied while knowing that Woden will get the charges dropped and Woden smiles as well,satisfied that Horne has been stopped.\n\nGameplay-Themes\nMax Payne is a third-person shooter with neo-noir elements.You can use many weapons(9mm pistol,jackhammer,ingram,sniper rifle etc.).Unfortunatelly you can't use any means of transportation in the entire game.There's a useful thing you can do called Bullet-Time that you can use in order to slow time and dodge or fire at your enemy.\n\nAs for the themes the game's elements are named from figures and mythsfrom Norse mythology(Valkyr,Valhalla,Ragnarok,Woden which means Odin,Aesir,Asgard,Balder etc.).\n\nRecap\nI find this game an absolute work of art.The story,the missions,the objectives,the plot,the gameplay everything to be absolutely breath-taking and mind blowing.It has a little audio problems but can be solved in a matter of minutes.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's a 2001 game.Can easily compete in fun with modern 2013-14 games in my opinion.\n\nThank you Remedy Entertainment and Rockstar Games for this wonderful game.\n\nP.S Max Payne has only started his journey through the night.The pain has only just begun.More will follow.","March 16,

Fast-paced gameplay, a story with effort, and optional slow-motion. Max Payne is one of those games that challenges the "not art" debate with its comic book style,  unforgettable music, and story. There are three problems that hindered my experience, however:\n\n1. I had to download a sound fix (not complicated, but still annoying)\n2. Overcomplicated, frustrating dream sequences.\n3. Bad autosave system, as far as I know. The game doesn't let you change the quicksave keybind, and sometimes, if you save at the wrong moment, you will die immediately after loading.\n\nNone the less, I strongly recommend this game.","January 12, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashmaestro/recommended/12140/","smashmaestro","Smash!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashmaestro/","62 products in account","Max Payne is a game without a lot of the "advancements" made in the 3rd person shooter genre. The game features open yet often small levels, with very little cover or areas to hide behind. The game will often kill you suddenly and without warning, with enemies showing up out of nowhere and many blind entrances through doors walking you right into death with enemies already pointing guns at the door. And there is little to no checkpointing, with the player having to make their own with quicksaves, which they'll definitely need because as I mentioned the game will kill you suddenly and without mercy regularly.\n\nThe gameplay consists of utilizing the bullet time and dodge mechanics to outmanuver bullets, shoot more precisely and deal more damage in a short period of time to kill enemies before they kill you. The game has no cover mechanics and attempting to pick off enemies from behind cover rarely works. If you stand still in a fight, you will likely die. You must abuse horizontal movement and bullet time to your advantage to keep the enemy from getting a bead on you, because shots are often lethal.\n\nDuring my first playthrough, I was frequently frustrated by the game. When I reconsidered the trial and error battles as puzzles I enjoyed myself much more. Every abrupt and sudden death which was previously unfair suddenly became elaborate puzzles I had to solve using bullet time and focus firing priority targets. By the time I reached the end of the game I realized some techniques relating to the bullet time mechanic I could use to play more efficiently and immediately played it again on the next difficulty. The second playthrough was even more fun as things were more challenging but I felt like I had only just grasped the bullet time mechanics and was making full use of it at last. When I had finished the second run I was contemplating what I could do to play better for the next difficulty. Very few games new or old compel me to do that, and it was that hard "unfairness" that made me want to come back.\n\nThe game's plot is enjoyably campy. It's the kind of sincere corniness that games had before they tried too hard at being quirky and random. It's enjoyable and skippable which makes it easier to replay the game without playing through interactive cutscenes.\n\nBuy Max Payne if you like arcade-like 3rd person action games and trial and error difficulty.","February 28","true","24.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Definately recommending it. Epic dark themed story, full of sarcastic jokes of a cop that was in the bad place at a bad time, with his family paying the consequences. Now he has dedicated his life to seek the true responsibles for the loss of his loved beings. Secret government departments, greed and power addicted villians AND BULLET TIME!!!! Awesome game mechanics and the introduction (in its time) of this one (bullet time) in particular. Even though the graphics seem (and are indeed) old, everything else compensates it. If you are reading this DON'T MISS IT!!\n\nAfraid of the compatibility issues?? NO PROBLEM. I was afraid too when I tried my luck and bought it here praying for it to work with the simple steps I read about. In the Max Payne directory of steam: Right click to maxpayne.exe, properties, compatibility tab, select compatibility mode Windows 98/ME and Run as Administrator = MAGIC.\n\n-Sound problems? There's an easy fix online and it's a major thread (resolved) topic on the community hub of this game. Google the fix or just click on the link given in the forums, WORKS LIKE A CHARM.\n\n-People saying "NOT WORKING ON MULTICORE PROCESSORS" and "NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AMD VIDEO CARDS" or "NOT WORKING ON x64 OS SYSTEMS" HAHA NICE TRY!! I'm running it on Windows 7 Ultimate x64, Core 2 Quad 2.83 GHZ and an AMD HD5770 so :P DO NOT MISS THIS MASTERPIECE.\n\nAs an extra, there are a lot of GOD-BLESSED AWESOME mods out there.

Put a couple of minutes aside. Pay full attention to me, because this isn't just a review. I'm going to pour my heart into this because I feel that's what this game deserves. This isn't just something you can score.\n\nAt first, this game's story is exactly like your standard anime, but it very quickly becomes something far greater. In my 32 hour campaign, there wasn't a single second in which I wasn't enjoying the absolute hell out of everything the game had to offer me. The adorable characters, the amazing story, the graphics of all of the spells...there wasn't a single second where I wasn't entertained.\n\nIt got to the point where once I reached the end of the game, I wasn't crying just because of the way the story ended, but also because of the very fact that the game is over now. Sure I knew I could do a new game plus, but something about finishing the game was just so heart wrenching. I can't even remember the last time I shed a tear, and I am a rather stoic man, so it symbolizes a lot that this amazingly emotional game managed to make me cry in different ways at the same time.\n\nSomehow, the repetitive combat isn't a bad thing. The spell effects of each and every spell are entertaining and beautiful enough to keep you interested in seeing them forever. Getting experience and skill points is fun no matter what, to the point where even the slightly-mandatory grinding is even fun. That's saying so much.\n\nPerhaps the most touching, is that it's a fully realized PC port. A game built with a JRPG engine has full mouse and keyboard support. Sure it seems like it would be standard for PC ports to have such things, but seeing a lack of mouse control in recent PC ports like DMC: Special Edition, it's hard not to feel grateful that the developers worked so hard to make mouse and keyboard work everywhere in this game. The amount of love they must have for this game must rival mine. And it does not surprise me, because it's extremely easy to fall in love with this game. You will have to practice the keyboard controls a bit (it took me a little bit to find out that Page Up and Page Down helps you aim your spells in combat, and Page Up re-centers your camera when exploring dungeons) but it won't take long, and the game's turn-based nature is very conducive with this control scheme, ensuring you have as much time as you need to figure out how, and where, to aim your spells. Give it a while, and you won't notice any difference in speed from casting a spell at the right position using a keyboard or a controller.\n\nAnd to top it all off; my girlfriend gifted me this game and all of its dlc's. Even if it wasn't such an amazing game, it would be worth appreciating simply because she got it for me. But it turned out to be my personal game of the year. Deandra, I love you, and I can't thank you enough for giving me this art, and I can't thank Compile Heart and Idea Factory enough for creating it.","February 6","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The series is very balanced and every game is original and neat in it's own way. Max Payne is the start of the series, and kind of explains where and how he got to the second and third game.","October 3, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This title will become unplayable after trying the more improved mechanics of the sequels.\n\nMax Payne is a truly noire story with a very iconic dark and gritty narative of the classic hard-boiled city detective, who goes through trauma on a daily basis while half-drunk and shot up on pills. While there is absoloutely nothing funny about Max Payne's story, it's of couse a bit of a parody on the noire genre.\n\nAs a third-person shooter, the game employes bullet-time, basically matrix-like dodging maneuvers and is generally just very well made. The soundtrack and the story are both excellent also.","September 29, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics were awesome back in the day, same goes for the voice acting. I liked the little comic book-like story sequences and HATED the baby sequences (no, they weren't frustrating; the crying baby sounds were just creepy and annoying at the same time). The shooting in this game felt so good, and, in combination with the bullet time, made me feel like a badass. This was THE game to play in 2001. Forget the sequel, this first game paved the way for a whole lot of other third person shooters later on.

There's a level that has you running around Max's house towards a labyrinth and another that has you balancing on some beams that kind of take away from the pace of the game.","February 17, 2013","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/James_9000/recommended/12140/","James_9000","James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/James_9000/","402 products in account","This game is a gritty third-person shooter about a police officer called Max Payne. The game has bullet time elements which allow Max to pull of incredible kills and survive against the odds. The game starts with the murder of your wife and child, and doesn't ever get any happier, even at the end. The gameplay is decent but nothing too amazing due to it's age. The game is interesting, exiting, and fun as well as very engaging too. Though at points the grittiness of the game make it a bit horrible to look at, it was an artistic decision. The game has comic book style cutscenes which are nice to look at and read through and carry the story along brilliantly and much better than a "normal cutscene" would have been able to at the time of the game's release. The game is stands up to this date and you must play through it if you want to play the sequels as it allows you to not only see but feel the pain Max has been through to get where he is in the sequels. The AI in this game are difficult even though you start it on the easiest setting, but the quick save feature allows you to get round this difficulty with ease. The sound on the game isn't perfect but is bearable. It's level design is very good and allows exploring for any extra supplies such as guns, ammo, and pain killers if needed. The character of Max Payne and the story of his life full of pain and suffering are both brilliant and a real experience to go through. The graphics in this game are certainly impressive for the time of release and are no issue at all.\nThe game can be difficult at times and there are more engaging games out there that can keep you playing for longer sessions at a time but this game is overall pretty decent.\n\n9/15 - "Fairly decent gritty third-person shooter about pain and suffering"","July 7, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's pretty much unanimous that this game is a great one. The issue is that if you have Windows 7 IT WILL (most likely) NOT WORK. Neither will Max Payne 2 for that matter. If you look at the compatability it even says that it will only work on XP. I bought the bundle and was sorely disappointed to find out that I couldn't even run either of them in compatability mode.\n\nNow that I have said that, some people have been able to run these games no problem in compatability mode and there are a myriad of fixes you can try if that fails. The reason I am not recommending this game is because I spent an entire day trying to get these games to work somehow and tried all if not most of those fixes and nothing worked and now these games are just sitting in my library and I just sigh in sadness and regret whenever I see them.\n\nI mean you can buy it and who knows? Maybe you can get it to work? It's really just a gamble to buy this game. In my opinion it is not worth the headache and you're better off emulating it somehow or buying it for your PS2. Unless of course you have Windows XP, in which case go for it! I just wish someone had warned me that this game is so hard to run on Windows 7 and that's why I made this review, hopefully it will help you guys.","December 30, 2013","false","0.4"," 82 of 167 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","82","167","4","15"

Unless it comes as a gift, you are a hardcore fan of this series or in a bundle I would not recomend buying it. The gameplay is frustrating and stiff. There are games that are hard but in a just way, this game is unjustly, frustratingly hard (makes the game not fun). Storywise its a pretty bland one that will not stay with you or make any kind of impact. You are a cop, bad guys killed your family, you want revenge, consipiracy arises, you get revenge, end.\n\nMusic is terrible. You get two options (not really options) elevator music while nothing happens with the sound of your massive feet slapping over and over while you traverse the city or "tense" music when there are enemies nearby which you wont even be able to listen to since you will be ripping your hair out from the dreadful gameplay.\n\nBUYER BEWARE: Many gamers that have bought this game literally CANNOT play it because of compatibility issues, glitches, etc.\n\nNot recomended unless you are a fan of the caracter or series. Honestly I was bored out of my mind passing the halfway point in the game.\n\nThe only thing that brings any justice in the game is the bullet time which is basically the "power or ability" in which Max slows down time to be able to shoot while jumping, at many enemies. Still doesnt make the game fun or worthwhile.\n\nBTW: no checkpoints, terrible ai/animations, bad grafics, puzzles that make absolutely no sense.\n\n3/10 PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK","September 21, 2014","false","8.2"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

The Steam version has sound compatibility issues and there is no sound to either cut scenes or background music, even though the sound works with everything else for example bullet fire and npc dialogues. So why the developers continue to argue for $10.00 when this product is faulty on Steam is a criminal payne. The developers can be found here http://remedygames.com/\n\nI'm not sure why this was nominated as a game with one of the best stories. Its definitely a long stretch from that with its over the top corny pictures and cheap budget voice acting, however the game is definitely fun as a fps which harbors a unique cinematic matrix trick at your characters disposal.\n\nMade back in 2001 the graphics are somewhat dated, but the game is still entertaining and will give you a similar adventure feeling comparable to that of Half Life. It's the clever level designs and the many secret places and passages that they hide that make it a delight to explore. Personally I recommend the youtube walkthrough by countduncan if you want to find many of the secrets. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cSywp2PAPGempVYWo9CioXBQnRVWVDS\n\nThe game has 4 modes, easy, medium, hard and a time mode. Even easy is really difficult in comparison to some of the games of today and thanks to the F5 quick save at your disposal you will be practically using it after every gun shot. The time mode is just a get out of my way, mow everything down while you sprint, brandishing two uzi's or an automatic shotty. However even this is really, really, really tricky also.\n\nSo what is the story? The story involves Max Payne who 3 years ago arrived home to find his wife and child murdered by 3 addicts hyped up on a new drug called 'V'. After the funeral he takes up the offer of an old friend Alex Balder and leaves NYPD to work with the DEA and try and get this new drug off the streets. Working covertly undercover, Max Payne is set up as an operative inside the Punchinello crime family after they get a serious lead pointing their attention to an underboss known as Jack Lupino transporting the drug. This operation is so tight lipped that only Max's true identity is only known by 2 people, that is Alex Balder and B.B who is also an administrative DEA.\n\nB.B eventually gets a tip that something BIG is going down at Roscoe Street Subway station and informs both Max and Alex to get down there and investigate. Little do they know it's a trap which exposes Max Paynes true identity to the Punchinello family. Max knowing there is no where to hide and that a hit has now been placed on his head, decides to go all Humphrey Bogart and hunt down the Don of this family himself. On his journey he will meet a variety of colorful under-bosses and assassins which he will need to take out of the equation and cater for first.\n\nEventually he learns more about this V drug how it was originally designed and tested by the government to try and enhance the performance and morale of soldiers during the gulf war. However the project was quickly halted in 1995 when the test results showed damning mental side effects. Problem was certain high ranking officials saw potential in this drug and decided to keep testing and manufacturing it in secret. Not long after that Max learns what connection the 3 addicts had to do with his wife and why she needed to die. Armed with the new revelation of what really happened and slightly influenced with the invigorating power of V on himself he tracks down all those responsible and kills them.\n\nI guess in a nutshell because the story has some aspects similar to the well known and publicized MKUltra experiments the CIA performed unknowingly on many of the public, it often gets nominated as a 'great story', but seriously nothing still quite beats the original...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra\n\nSince the Steam version is completely broken you may want to download a completely working sound version for yourself here...\n\nmediafire/download/oa8aeji5j70lh8z/Max+Payne++1+No+Sound+Fix.exe (just put www. before mediafire and .com after media fire)\n\nJust create a steamapps folder named Max Payne and install it in that and then run exe direct or add it to your steam account.

I played the 3rd one before deciding to buy the other 2 so I could figure out what this alcoholic was narrating about.\n\nNow the first game in this series is good, I enjoyed it, even though the game is about 15 years old. I get through some of the parts in Chapter 1, and I get to Part 7. Now stuff escalates pretty fast through this game, with 2 dudes coming at you with dual Ingrams and stuff. So I'm chasing this sad sap on the rooftops and he goes to jump. The game cuts to a cutscene where the guy is supposed to make the jump, but for me, he misses the ledge and falls down. I know this is a glitch because when I go to that ledge, he is just literally standing there, facing the frickin wall, acting like nothing frickin happened. So I figure the guy will just reset when the game cuts to the next cutscene, but no. The game progresses until it gets to this certain cutscene where the guy is supposed to activate something but he's NOT FRICKIN THERE.\n\nSo, I give up on this game. I've tried about 4 times but the same thing happens. It probably has supposed to do with Windows 10, but hey, whatever.\n\nSo if you run Windows 10 and like advancing through game's that eventually glitch and break, this game is surely up your ally.\n\nIGN gave this a 9.3, and said "If this is what Payne feels like, then I'm a self-proclaimed masochist." If they were at my house and watched me while I played this, that statement would live true.","January 29","false","2.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Why is this topic not stickied? Why is this fix not installed on Max Payne in the first place?\n\nRockstar should of aready patched / edited the game to make it fully compatible with Windows 7 and 8. Bringing up an old title on steam, while charging a moderate price of 10.00$, I expect a certain ammount of effort in making the game workable. I see NO EXCUSE if your charging money.\n\nIn ANY game, this sortof issue would not be acceptable to consumers and grounds for a refund.\n\nIn retrospect, I should of requested a refund. Rockstar is treating customers poorly.\n\nThe game itself is awesome but try to get it not off of Steam.

I have written to Remedy asking if they plan on patching it and did not get a reply. It's not as if they can't fix it, since the patch does. I loved this game back when it came out for Xbox and would have written all the reasons why right here, yet instead I am warning you to avoid this unless you just have to play it.\n\nMax Payne 2 works just fine, so if you need to remember or are just looking for a great noire story, then head over there. The fix is easy enough to do, but that is not th point. I am sick of having to download stuff from sites I am just suppose to trust. When I buy a game, I do not enjoy having to fix it in order to play. So, avoid this and jump to Payne 2. If you need to know the story, it will fill you in on the second one. Also there is a really cool Mod for the second game that allows you to use stuff from Max Payne 3.

I played the game back in 2001 and I enjoyed it so I repurchased a new copy, having lost the other years ago. Check the documentation at Rockstar, windows xp has not been fully tested so there is no support, Steam is selling a game that is meant for windows 95, 98, and 2000. Who the hell is still running windows 95, 98, or 2000???? "Oh it's an old game uh yuk..." Morons, so are the original doom games by a decade but low and behold I install those and they run without making any changes, no compatibility for windows 95, 98, ect.. needed, no single core setting blah blah blah.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAccused/recommended/12140/","TheAccused","Mind Crushed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAccused/","370 products in account","Genre: Third-person Shooter\n\nSummary: One night, in December 2001, Max Payne, an undercover officer, answers a call to a lead that he hopes will to the murderers that killed his family. In his pursuit of vengeance, Max finds himself a embroiled in a conspiracy for power that stretches to involve criminal syndicates, pharmaceuticals, and the government.\n\nPros:\n- The game's level-design is thought-out with its placement of enemies, hazards, and painkillers.\n- The game's emphasis on strafing/dodging allows players to go in with guns blazing, due the generous amount of ammo, or strategically take out enemies with Bullet Time.\n- The game subtly provides hints on how to progress within cut-scenes and stage environment.\n- The presentation of the game is superb with its graphic novel cutscenes, noir-inspired narrative, and attention to detail (the amount of interactable, though limited, objects, A.I. conversations, etc.)\n- The overall voice acting is impressive.\n- The game has several gimmick levels that break up the action.\n- The tutorial is short, concise, and encourages the players to experiment on their own.\n- Completing game unlocks additional difficulty levels.\n\nCons:\n- The game's pace slows down mid-game and doesn't pick back up until the end (about 8-10 hours of gameplay).\n- The enemy A.I. approaches in a linear manner, repeatedly misses from afar, and occasionally kill themselves and their allies.\n- The game's models are ugly and the lighting is terrible.\n- The game has little to no music, what's there is average at best.\n- Despite the impressive narrative, the plot itself action is cliché and silly due to being a pastiche of hard-boiled action flicks (the developers openly lampshade this).\n- It is possible to get stuck in areas due to low ceilings or objects preventing backtracking.\n- Some events may not happen and prevent progress (Ex: Vinnie Gognitti)\n\nNeutral Points:\n- The lack of zoom-in, outside of the sniper rifle, and aim assist creates depth by advocating strategic use of slow-down and meter management, however, this results in difficulties with shooting when the player runs out of Bullet-Time.\n- There is a decent assortment of weapons, however, the majority of guns become obsolete as the game progresses due to either low damage or hit-stun.\n- The nightmare sequences are unnerving and possess a chilling atmosphere, thanks to the voice clips, however, the platforming bits feel forced and have silly aesthetics.\n- Save-scumming is possible.","May 28, 2014","false","11.8"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

The player however somehow can't manage to kill enemies with a dual barrel shotgun at close range. Go figure!\n-Uzi's do more damage close range than shotguns!? *scratches head* they can also take multiple enemies out so once you get the Uzi the shotguns become almost instantly unreliable\n-Bosses are just buffed up in terms of health, they don't provide any interesting mechanics or tactic behind them. Some of the bosses are so ridicolous that even with multiple headshots, blasts from grenades etc still won't kill them on the easiest difficulty.\n-Easiest difficulty is for some reason stupidly hard. I can't tell you how many times I've died and had my trigger finger on the quick saves.\n-No auto saves.\n\n\n\n\nSound pro's and cons:\n\n+Great gun sound effects\n+Narration is crisp and clear considering its age\n+Somewhat humerous death sounds\n+Memmorable Soundtrack\n\n-Lack of sound options means that you can't adjust the volume of the voice, sound effects and music seperatly\n-Voice during comic style cutscenes are louder than in game\n-No voice/music sound problems on Windows 7 and 8 requires you to go through the trouble of patching it.\n\nOverall this game offers what looks like a simple plot which is executed rather well and complex and the narration is on par with Alan Wake which is also made by Remedy, I wholeheartedly recommend you go play that game over this one if you're looking for a very strong voice narration driven game because while this one provides that, it does so at the cost of mediocre gameplay, fustrating difficulty, absurd bosses and unbalanced weaponry. I haven't played Max Payne 2 yet so I can't recommend that game over this one.\n\nWith all that being said, I give the game a fair score of 6.5/10. There's fun to be had here, just remember that this game has aged and not necessarily in a good way.","March 8, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 19 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","19","0","0"

Although I liked it alot, I never thought to revisit it or explore the series. With the games now being so cheap here on Steam I decided to give them a full playthrough each.\nTo sum up how I feel about this game, I'd find it hard to not recommend it. Yes the visuals have dated, but not to the extent that it looks ugly. The game offers all modern resolutions and run (at least for me) as smooth as butter.\nInfact the only real issue I had with the game in terms of running it was a sound bug with was easily fixed with a small player created patch, it's likely you'll have to do the same.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a run of the mill third person shooter. The real sell point of this game aside from it's story is the bullet time ability. One click of a button and you'll enter bullet time, being able to perform rolls, jumps and dodges. It's not just a gimmick either, the game's high difficulty means you'll have to make use of it, but that's okay because it feels so smooth and natural to pull off bullet time kills.\n\nThe story and character of Max Payne is the other real catch here. Max is troubled, his deep poetic self expression through the game is well placed and well wrote. You'll find him describing just about everything you come across of note with a clever, noir style of depressive reckoning. The story is one of vengence, it's not out of place and keeps the action following nicely.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this game ago. It's dated sure, but not to the point where you can't enjoy it.","December 25, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't play much of it because I remember having some difficulties.\n\nFast forward to 2 days ago- See Max Payne on sale for like 3 bucks. That's a deal for any game, I'll give it a shot.\n\nI got news for you, this game is incredible. It's one long action movie that is intricate and leaves you like a junkie looking for more Valkyr. Have you seen Max Payne the movie?? Yes? No? Either way, forget that movie- Play the game and you will NOT regret it.\n\nAs Max Payne, you get put into a tragic situation that only your guns can solve. You work your way up, and just when you think you've reached the top- You realize you've only scratched the surface.\n\nLike I said before, there's the incredible story followed by great controls that make sense. Slow-Mo feature that works like bread and butter. The game IS challenging, if you're thinking slow mo makes stuff easy- you're wrong. Great length- Not long enough where you just want to get it done, not short enough where you feel like you've been gypped out of your cash.\n\nThe graphics are dated- The game was released almost 14 years ago on the MAX-FX engine. It's what you would expect from a game released in 2001. The faces on these characters are also priceless- taking and giving damage yields grimacing results that has it's own charm.\n\nTo sum up- The game's great- About 75% of the way through the game, I turned it off- Went to the steam store and bought Max Payne 2 and 3. I couldn't get enough. If you're a fan of the noir genre, this is for you. If you're a fan of action, this is for you, if you play fps and think that third person shooters wouldnt suit you, you're wrong- this game is for you. If you want to feel nostalgic and get a warm christmassy NYC vibe- THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.\n\n9.5/10 Loses half a point for the lack of diverse weaponry- I feel like I only got stuff that got the job done, but on the other hand- I am just a NYC copper. You get pretty much whatever a cop would get. (With the exception of an M79)\n\nMax Payne 2 is done downloading- I wont waste any more time writing this up!","December 21, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A highly difficult third person shooter, that is extremely dark in it's gritty and noir atmosphere. The game would be nigh impossible if it were not for the bullet time mechanic; which allows you to dodge in slow motion to avoid bullets (and retaliate). Clocking into 7 hours, you'll be blasting your way through Max's bitter story. The movement and shooting mechanics are fluid and allow  freedom of movement during combat. The story and level is expertly woven together with intersections of narrated graphic novel in a truly noir fashion. The game certainly shows it's age in this time. Though the story and atmosphere is timeless, the game's graphics and stiff animations certainly show it's age. This deducts slightly from the overall atmosphere of the game and graphic-addicts may find Max Payne less immersive.\n\nOverall Max Payne is a excellent and unique experience, although the age may affect the immersion, the quality of the writing will never fade.\n8/10","February 20, 2012","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story focus on the title character, and that's who you play as. The story is about Max Payne is angry because his wife "Michelle Payne" and their baby daughter "Rose Payne" we're assassinated and Max Payne 3 years later has been falsely accused of commiting the murder of a DEA agent "Alex Balder." I have a physical copy of Max Payne for PC and a Steam Copy of Max Payne which I both beat, I have a PlayStation 2 Copy again because I got bored with the copy after I finished it, And I use to have 2 copies for XBOX which I beat and I got bored with it. It has a very good story in my opinion and I love the music to the game, especially the music to the Ragna Rock night club in the game that sounds like disco music. What is a great plot twist in the game is "Mona Sax" who was shot in the first game faked her death and you got to play as her in the second game. I have the 2nd game for PS2 but I haven't completed it yet. I love the bullet-time mechanics in the game to where Max and everything a round him are in slow motion, which means Max can dodge bullets and you can hear his heart beat while in the mode. I would say the graphics are very good for a game from 2001, especially with realistic looking characters and textures. I would reccomend this game on any platform except for the Mobile version and Game Boy Advance version which I haven't played yet but I plan on it. I give Max Payne 10/10 which is perfect in my opinion.","December 4, 2014","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a great story, fun gunplay accompanied with the awesome revolutionary matrix-esque gameplay mechanics, it's 10 hours game time is a joy to blast through.\nThe presentation of the game is quite stellar, especially with the comic-style storytelling, which I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this style of storytelling.\n\nMP has its flaws however. The frequent interactions of objects that initates a cut-scene can annoyingly break the adrenaline flow, and the saving system can be quite infurating, if you've forgotten to manually save the game by pressing a specific key.\n\nSmall flaws aside, Max Payne is still a great, fun game.\n\nRecommended for newcomers to the series indeed. You may have sound issues during gameplay using current Windows operating systems, but thankfully there is a great fan patch that fixes the issue perfectly, so definitely grab that.","January 26, 2013","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another thing to mention is that the game is incredibly challenging. Quicksaving is an absolute must (you will often be saving after every killed enemy), because it is very easy to die even on normal difficulty and "healthpacks" are very scarce. I consider myself a decent gamer and I was dying all the time (or loading, because I took too much damage and it would be impossible to finish the mission).

You play as Max Payne, a NYPD-turned-DEA. The reason why? His wife and baby daughter was killed by druggies in the opening act of the game. The game's story is intriuging, as it deals with gangster's, betrayed cops, a secret society, and a corporate conspiracy, as well as Max's ultimate battle of fighting for his own well-being, all in very stylized comic book cutscences. Gameplay is a bit rough around the edges. Max Payne utilizes a bullet-time mechanic (Which you slow down time to dodge bullets akin to the matrix). Which helps alot- because you will have problems playing this as a straight laced 3rd person shooter. The aiming reticule is a primary offender of this, due to it being a small white dot in the middle of the screen. While it does help with immersion, it also makes it hard to aim at times. Thankfully, the game does have auto aim option, so it helps at times. The graphics- It's a game from 2001 so I can't say anything much- except the max payne model is scary. If I had rate it, it's a 8/10","January 10, 2015","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stylistically, Max Payne is very engaging simply because you don't really see a lot of video games in a 'Noir'-kind of setting; I really have never played a game that is anything like Max Payne! If Noir is your thing and you love yourself some of those 'bloody revenge' stories in which one guy shoots his way through Mafia goons, you will probably not be disappointed by Max Payne...\n\n... That is, if you are sure that you can handle old-school shooters. For someone like me, this game aged very well actually, since I do not mind these older shooting mechanics which simply involve you evading fire rather than covering from it. It's a very simplistic game in that sense; don't expect any sort of depth. That's not a fault of the game, but I have talked to players who could not get into the game because they thought these mechanics lacked the intricacies of newer shooting games, like cover-mechanics and upgradable weapons. Not to mention, death is inevitable in Max Payne, mostly because Max can die in just a few gunshots (it's 'realistic' that way) and because he does not regenerate health on his own, so expect to be overwhelmed by enemies more often than not. Some may call it frustrating, but I call it challenging!\n\nPlayers who grew up playing games that force you to constantly quick save, quick load and just abuse the terrain to get cheap shots at enemies will enjoy this game no matter what, I would say. There isn't any variation in gameplay, all you do is search for ammo and health, and then shoot bad guys - Nothing more, nothing less. Either way, Max Payne is a classic.","August 15, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I liked it alot, I never thought to revisit it or explore the series. With the games now being so cheap here on Steam I decided to give them a full playthrough each.\nTo sum up how I feel about this game, I'd find it hard to not recommend it. Yes the visuals have dated, but not to the extent that it looks ugly. The game offers all modern resolutions and run (at least for me) as smooth as butter.\nInfact the only real issue I had with the game in terms of running it was a sound bug with was easily fixed with a small player created patch, it's likely you'll have to do the same.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a run of the mill third person shooter. The real sell point of this game aside from it's story is the bullet time ability. One click of a button and you'll enter bullet time, being able to perform rolls, jumps and dodges. It's not just a gimmick either, the game's high difficulty means you'll have to make use of it, but that's okay because it feels so smooth and natural to pull off bullet time kills.\n\nThe story and character of Max Payne is the other real catch here. Max is troubled, his deep poetic self expression through the game is well placed and well wrote. You'll find him describing just about everything you come across of note with a clever, noir style of depressive reckoning. The story is one of vengence, it's not out of place and keeps the action following nicely.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this game ago. It's dated sure, but not to the point where you can't enjoy it.","December 25, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stylistically, Max Payne is very engaging simply because you don't really see a lot of video games in a 'Noir'-kind of setting; I really have never played a game that is anything like Max Payne! If Noir is your thing and you love yourself some of those 'bloody revenge' stories in which one guy shoots his way through Mafia goons, you will probably not be disappointed by Max Payne...\n\n... That is, if you are sure that you can handle old-school shooters. For someone like me, this game aged very well actually, since I do not mind these older shooting mechanics which simply involve you evading fire rather than covering from it. It's a very simplistic game in that sense; don't expect any sort of depth. That's not a fault of the game, but I have talked to players who could not get into the game because they thought these mechanics lacked the intricacies of newer shooting games, like cover-mechanics and upgradable weapons. Not to mention, death is inevitable in Max Payne, mostly because Max can die in just a few gunshots (it's 'realistic' that way) and because he does not regenerate health on his own, so expect to be overwhelmed by enemies more often than not. Some may call it frustrating, but I call it challenging!\n\nPlayers who grew up playing games that force you to constantly quick save, quick load and just abuse the terrain to get cheap shots at enemies will enjoy this game no matter what, I would say. There isn't any variation in gameplay, all you do is search for ammo and health, and then shoot bad guys - Nothing more, nothing less. Either way, Max Payne is a classic.","August 15, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recently beat the game and am generally pleased with it.  For the time it was released (2001) It was impressive.  Playing it now some of the graphics seem dated, especially the character models, however that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game.  The story is excellent and is what kept me playing through wanting to know how it all ended.  The “cut scenes” were a nice change from typical video games, being done in a graphic novel type of way.  The cinematics we’re innovative at the time and to this day still hold up for some pretty cool moments (that final helicopter crash).  Game play was pretty fun, the main thing being the slow motion bullet time.  It had a very Matrix feel and made the game play that much more fun.  That being said the big problem I had with the game was the difficulty.  I don’t mind a games difficulty if it’s the players skill and not the games fault.  This was not the case, I found it extremely frustrating the amount of health lost when hit with enemy fire yet the amount of shots it took to take down that enemy.  It only added to the frustration when I would die having to start back at the beginning, even more annoying was the un-skipable cut scenes that I saw countless times.  I found myself hitting escape and saving my game after every group of enemies I killed.  This for me really ruined the immersion of the game which, for a game like this I felt was important.  Maybe not everyone had this problem and it could just be me.  That being said after thinking about replay value, sound, story, gameplay, graphics, everything I could think of I would give this game a 7.5/10","April 16, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game jumps from action to story with little fluff in between. Not a bad thing at all.\n\nI believe Max Payne bought about "bullet-time".

They do. In fact, they're even better, with me being a more mature gamer and properly appreciating the work of art that is the MP franchise.\n\nMP was the game which introduced bullet time to gaming in a way that worked. Not only as a gimmick, but rather as a core gameplay element. Without it, and without using is smartly on top of that, you'd get nowhere. And be warned, MP doesn't pamper you and take you by the hand. It kicks you in the butt and shoves you right into the thick of it. That is to say, the game is H-A-R-D. Very, very hard. Even on the lowest (and default) difficulty setting bad guys ambush you all the times, they shoot very straight, and can mow you down in a couple of well placed hits. The quick save button will be your best friend (and occasionally you'll end up using it more than the 'shoot' button). MP is truly an unforgiving shooter, requiring a tactical approach to every gunfight: where you have to pick your targets carefully, when to roll, when to evade, where you'll land afterwards, who'll be remaining standing... otherwise - GAME OVER.\n\nAnd then, there's the story - a hard-boiled noir crime drama told through comic book style panels, with superb voice acting and an amazingly well-written script. Even if the gameplay weren't so fun, MP would still have you in its grip solely because of the plot.\n\nTo conclude: an all-around amazing game, still incredibly fun even if its age does show. Despite that, it blows the majority of modern shooters out of the water. Needles to say, a must have title. I don't trust a gamer who doesn't like MP.","December 31, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A name that should be brought up when talking about great video games. Always.\n\n\n\nMax Payne is a third person shooter from 2001. You play Max Payne a NYPD detective that comes home to his wife and baby killed by a group of druggies. The only clue he has in a V symbol. Standing for Valkyr. He quits the NYPD and becomes an undercover detective. From there you get loads of shooting and running and great writing.\n\nI am still amazed that this game has aged so well. Sure it isn't as pretty as it used to be, but the gameplay is still solid and the challenge is still there. It's a fast paced run and gun kind of shooter. You get loads of ammo and have a very small amount of health. Depending on the gun you could die from five to two shots. The level design is linear, but put togfether very well.\n\nThe only complaint I could have is that there isn't a HUGE amount of replay value. Although I think this could depend on the player. If you don't usually care to go through a story multiple times then you will probably only get six to eight hours in this game. I bet there are other players that have put in 60 hours due to higher difficulties and modes like "A New York Minute" mode.\n\nMax Payne is still worth buying to this day. The price they ask sweetens the deal. Especially if you buy the bundle that include Max Payne 2.","June 1, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it definitely looks a lot better on PC now than it did on Xbox when I originally played it. But I must be honest and confess I did use my PS4 controller with it while using Xpadder. The controls were always smooth and transferred over from PC really well. The only technical problems I had were with the audio. Certain sounds wouldn't always work. and This game is definitely still the same ole' difficult game it once was. If it weren't for the quick save feature which I used abundantly, I would have been bald from tearing out my hair. The Story wasn't as straightforward and linear as the actually progression from one task to the next was. There was a couple of "twists" but none all too much, and I didn't ever feel any hate towards the main antagonist lady as I should've. But nonetheless, the story was enjoyable. Especially the few times where Max Payne was as high as a kite or hallucinating in his dreams. Those are the missions you will always remember no matter the years away from this game. I'm so glad I bought this game along with the other Max Payne's as part of the Amazon sale bundle. No regrets at all after spending the nearly exact 15 hours it took to complete this game. Definitely proud to say I played through the epic game that is Max Payne. 9/10","June 2, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over the last couple of weeks, I played both.  They were as good as I remembered them.  Really good games hold up.  The graphics certainly aren't up to today's standards, but the gameplay and plot are great.  If you never played the first two Max Payne games, I heartily recommend them.  The third one was just OK and can be skipped.  I was not able to download and get them running on Steam even though I tried all the forum fixes that you will find.

The game centers around a NYPD cop working undercover in the Valkyr-drug smuggling mafia seeking answers after he got his family killed. As the story unravels, Max becomes the most wanted guy by the mafia and the NYPD and discover what is hiding behind the drug Valkyr.\n\nThe story is presented to the player using comic novels artifacts which sometimes resembles Frank Miller's Sin City. Cutscenes are entertaining to watch and sucks you into it with a noir narrative. I wish Max Payne got his own comic book, because the writing is second to none immersive. There is a heavy influence of nordic mythos which adds to the bigger picture.\n\nI love the level design. Although is set mostly in a stormy, snowy and dark NY or inside some buildings, it nevers gets repetitive. You'll be looking all over the place for clues, guns and painkillers. Max Payne has one of the best level design I've ever seen in any game. You'll never forget about those nightmare levels and shootings at the Ragna Rock night club.\n\nThe music is beautiful. It has a dark and dense mood to it, the one you'd expect from detective stories. The synth sounds go really with the ambient sounds.\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely fun. The game introduces an innovative (at the time) bullet time and bullet dodge mechanics. This is a hard game, although there is some automatic health regen don't expect miracles. You'll be craving for painkillers through out the whole game. Also, a word of advice, DON'T save if you're not sure if you're still in the middle of a bullet fest.\n\nI can assure you the game aged gracefully.\n\nWriting a positive review about an award winning game that eventually became the cornerstone of the 2000's age of gaming feels just like another brick in the wall. It's just another one in the bag of thousand positive reviews Max Payne got through the years.\n\nA must have for ANY gamer.","June 22, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your family is murdered by drug addicts, you are deep undercover in the underworld of New York. Then, your cover is blown, and the cops thinks you are one of the bad guys.\n\nThe game itself is a 3rd person shooter, with it´s best feature being the ability to slow down time. This feature added depth to the vicious shootouts, and the destruction caused by the bullets could be apreciated in detail.\nSimply put, there were nothing like that around.\nIt borrowed many elements from The Matrix, including slow motion action sequences and many of its locations.\n\nYou just have to keep moving and keep shooting every single enemy (there is one scort mission, but it´s fairly short and thankfully not frustating at all), It could be repetitive in theory, but the shootings are so fun it never gets old.\nDodging bullets while firing your duals berettas couldn´t be more rewarding.\n\nThe story is surprisingly deep for a game of it´s kind. It involves drugs, infanticide, madness, evend the russian mafia plays it´s part, and high echelon corporate conspiracy. It´s just awesome, and told in a very dark tone.\nUltimately, it´s a tale of revenge of a broken man, alone and desperate, with no higher moral, no savior cause or anything.\n\nIt aged very well. The mechanics are still fun, the graphics might seem a bit bulky and outdated, but there are some really good textures and nice particle effects that still makes it good looking in movement.

Well, when you bullet time dodge, you can't shoot on the ground so you have to wait for Max to get back up before you can fire another shot which by then may be too late.\nAnother con (and this is mostly because of me) is there are no real checkpoints within a level which means unless you remember to quick-save (which I don't half the time) you'll end up back at the beginning of the level.\nThe last and final con is that Maxy seems to have 2 left feet and doesn't like to run in a straight line. Which wouldn't be an issue but there are a few simple platforming obstacles in the game that are more difficult than what they seem because it's pretty hard to calculate Max's jump range and his 2 left feet that seem to jump diagonally at the worst times.\nDefinitely do get this game because there's a lot more good than bad.","March 18, 2014","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting, gameplay, soundtrack, dialogue, artwork - it all comes together in this strange culmination of dark justice.   Max Payne loses in the end, whether he wins or not.  He's doomed from the start, and a lot of games don't torture their heroes this much.  So from the beginning you're in this nothing-to-lose mentality alongside our protagonist.  The mechanics even support this idea, as you can restart from the last point of death if you mash the quicksave button like an underlying arc from a Lost episode.  Events replay like you went back in time a few seconds prior to your blundered encounter and decided to duck left instead of right.  The gaming community criticized this feature when it released all those years ago, and people are still kind of iffy on it because of its linear drive.  This game really is a comic come to life.  The setting is as much a character as Max is, rife with loneliness and torment - slowly picked apart by what can only be described as a 100-year winter.  New York City is the target of the Norse Gods' "♥♥♥♥-this-place-in-particular" ice beam of misery, effectively isolating Max and a thousand goons to do glorious battle in Thunderdome 2.0.  The reason this game is and will always be timeless is because you don't need to inject yourself into 2001 to appreciate this title for all that it is.  It's a story that can be told over and over.","July 16, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game suffers, however, from some clunkiness because of when it was made and its attempts to have occasional platforming sections, that are sometimes frustrating and irritating to play. Some of them are important to the story, but could've been done without having the player make precise jumps with imprecise movement controls. There were also frequent stutters in cutscenes and keyboard lock-ups when I played (Max would be stuck in place or stuck moving or diving in one direction). Despite some of the minor issues, the game holds up because of good encounter design, fun shooting mechanics and great writing, especially in Max's thoughts.

And be warned, MP doesn't pamper you and take you by the hand. It kicks you in the butt and shoves you right into the thick of it. That is to say, the game is H-A-R-D. Very, very hard. Even on the lowest (and default) difficulty setting bad guys ambush you all the times, they shoot very straight, and can mow you down in a couple of well placed hits. The quick save button will be your best friend (and occasionally you'll end up using it more than the 'shoot' button). MP is truly an unforgiving shooter, requiring a tactical approach to every gunfight: where you have to pick your targets carefully, when to roll, when to evade, where you'll land afterwards, who'll be remaining standing... otherwise - GAME OVER.\n\nAnd then, there's the story - a hard-boiled noir crime drama told through comic book style panels, with superb voice acting and an amazingly well-written script. Even if the gameplay weren't so fun, MP would still have you in its grip solely because of the plot.\n\nTo conclude: an all-around amazing game, still incredibly fun even if its age does show. Despite that, it blows the majority of modern shooters out of the water. Needles to say, a must have title. I don't trust a gamer who doesn't like MP.","December 31, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MAX!\nThis game holds so many memories for me. The endless shootouts, the screaming of Max' wife, the babyroom-spaceout-wtf-mind♥♥♥♥, Bullet Time... too much to mention. This game is one of the first really bloody games i came in contact with, and at the age of twerlve, i never had any nightmares. Luskily, because this game is also set in a pretty sinister atmosphere.\n\nStory in short\nWorking at the NYPD, Max is a hard working police detective. Three years ago his wife and kid got murdered by junkies, and he is remembered again when he rolls into a drug investigation. Soon he finds out that this drug and the murder of his family are connected. Desperate to cleanse the city from the drug and redeeming himself from the burden, he goes on a crusade. From an ease-in to a vertical dropdown in a rollercoaster, this game holds you by the balls from start to end.\n\nGameplay\nthis game is a ride, a flow. The game is divided by chapters, and obviously you start at Chapter 1. After loading screen mosly there is a quasi-funny comic, before you delve into the action. And action, well... no shortage of that. From one shootout to the next, blood everywhere, heroin syringes everywhere, painstillers everywhere... - I, for this very reason, do NOT recommend this game if you are sensitive for these things. I mean, if it's not the game, it is the amount of heroin ingame that makes you addicted to Max and his crusade. No, really...  MAN UP, YOU PRICK\nTry to playthrough the game in it's hardest difficulty (Dead on Arrival) and you'll unlock a surprise. It's really worth it.\n\nPros  BULLET TIME;\nthe storyline. Yes, it's one of the game's top features;\nthe amount of blood;\nBULLET TIME;\nthe rollercoaster ride from start to end;\nthe epic dark atmosphere;\nBULLET TIME;\nthe graphics, still beatiful for todays standards;\nthe choice of weapons;\nthe EPIC quiting screen;\ndid i mention Bullet Time yet?\nCons  After a while you start to see a pattern\ni hate those moments when you startle the ♥♥♥♥ out of NPC's coming suddenly into view...\n... and killing you in an instant while you try to unload your whole mag on them. BULLETS, LOTS OF BULLETS\nApart from this, but not to be taken into consideration: The fact that i had difficulties installing and running the game in Windows 7 SP1. Why i don't take this into consideration? You can't expect a game built in the early 00's to be 100% compatible with multicored PC's imho, even when it's revamped. It's engine is just not built for multicore. You want the full experience, try it on a virtual machine, find an older PC or downgrade your PC. Please do not complain about this.\n\nConlusive\nIf you like dense packed action this is the game for you. I think this game is worth every penny, including when it's full price.\n\nGameplay        8.5                Visuals        9.5                Replay value        7.5            VERDICT        8.5/10","October 28, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They do. In fact, they're even better, with me being a more mature gamer and properly appreciating the work of art that is the MP franchise.\n\nMP was the game which introduced bullet time to gaming in a way that worked. Not only as a gimmick, but rather as a core gameplay element. Without it, and without using is smartly on top of that, you'd get nowhere. And be warned, MP doesn't pamper you and take you by the hand. It kicks you in the butt and shoves you right into the thick of it. That is to say, the game is H-A-R-D. Very, very hard. Even on the lowest (and default) difficulty setting bad guys ambush you all the times, they shoot very straight, and can mow you down in a couple of well placed hits. The quick save button will be your best friend (and occasionally you'll end up using it more than the 'shoot' button). MP is truly an unforgiving shooter, requiring a tactical approach to every gunfight: where you have to pick your targets carefully, when to roll, when to evade, where you'll land afterwards, who'll be remaining standing... otherwise - GAME OVER.\n\nAnd then, there's the story - a hard-boiled noir crime drama told through comic book style panels, with superb voice acting and an amazingly well-written script. Even if the gameplay weren't so fun, MP would still have you in its grip solely because of the plot.\n\nTo conclude: an all-around amazing game, still incredibly fun even if its age does show. Despite that, it blows the majority of modern shooters out of the water. Needles to say, a must have title. I don't trust a gamer who doesn't like MP.","December 31, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And FRUSTRANTINGLY difficult towards the end, frankly. My reactions were usually "I STUCK A SHOTGUN IN HIS MOUTH AND PULLED THE TRIGGER, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE A HEAD ANYMORE" kind of thing. The mechanics are solid enough, but the game can be so unfair. The damage is realistic and a example of good difficult: a good headshot and you're down. But when the game has enemies that just.won't.die. Plus enemies that spawn out of thin air(and yes, I've seen it). A lot of situations in this game are hair-tearing. Think press-a-button-spawn-three-enemies-next-door kinda of thing. And then the walls disappear. Towards the end, most weapons you'll be using are the AR, the semi auto shotgun and the dual wielded SMGs... which I personally found a shame. Not that the weapons weren't good, but I just loved using Max's trademark dual Berettas. Neverthless, a great game, marked by some traits of its era. Some are flaws, like that half step lag before Max switches running directions which got me killed countless times, some are design decisions, like the punishing difficult, the unclear directions and the bland visuals(its 2001, to be fair). All part of its charm. Yes, even the unfairness. And while the Bullet time got refined in the next games(it just depletes way too fast for me to have any fun), this is where it started. And the story is...well, it's been copied numerous times by today's standards, but its superb. Max may overblow the drama, but the twists and turns are unexpected, always bringing something new into the table.\nSo, yes, I was frustrated. Yes, many times I wanted to say "♥♥♥♥ THIS". But I kept coming. Because I was being stingy with my items,playing at the edge of my life, and I knew I could get over it. I knew I could aim that next shotgun blast a little bit better and kill that guy faster, giving me time to pump lead on the guy who would walk through that door.

The game follows a cop who finds himself in a questionable position after his family is killed and he seeks revenge.\n\nThere is a lot of emphasis put on performing as well as possible. Absorbing a few rounds from most guns will kill you so you need to take advantage of cover as much as possible and painkillers (the medkits of Max Payne) are sparse in the levels. Luckily , Max can take full advantage of dolphin dives to move from cover to cover. This proves highly advantageous during parts of the game like in boss battles or where there are many enemies.\n\nGiven the game's age , don't expect excellent graphics but looking back on this classic , you will see some features of the game which are well ahead of the time it was made in such as acial expressions and almost ragdoll bodies.\n\nThe game did require a small bug-fix relating to the sound ingame which seems to be due to the way that the MP3 files worked on older systems. There is an official fix for this which I believe I found on the Steam forums.\n\nAside from that , there is very little bad to say about this title. I have only one gripe with the title - there is no way to stay lying down after the dolphin dive. Max will get up as soon as possible from the dolphin dive which resulted in me dying a great number of times. Given the game's quick save and load buttons , however , this very rarely meant repeating whole battles which I am extremely thankful for.\n\nAlso there is a villain based on an in-game comic book heroand the game is self-aware.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JuliusM/recommended/12140/","JuliusM","Hit$u","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JuliusM/","504 products in account","A classic., a big brother to the genre. And FRUSTRANTINGLY difficult towards the end, frankly. My reactions were usually "I STUCK A SHOTGUN IN HIS MOUTH AND PULLED THE TRIGGER, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE A HEAD ANYMORE" kind of thing. The mechanics are solid enough, but the game can be so unfair. The damage is realistic and a example of good difficult: a good headshot and you're down. But when the game has enemies that just.won't.die. Plus enemies that spawn out of thin air(and yes, I've seen it). A lot of situations in this game are hair-tearing. Think press-a-button-spawn-three-enemies-next-door kinda of thing. And then the walls disappear. Towards the end, most weapons you'll be using are the AR, the semi auto shotgun and the dual wielded SMGs... which I personally found a shame. Not that the weapons weren't good, but I just loved using Max's trademark dual Berettas. Neverthless, a great game, marked by some traits of its era. Some are flaws, like that half step lag before Max switches running directions which got me killed countless times, some are design decisions, like the punishing difficult, the unclear directions and the bland visuals(its 2001, to be fair). All part of its charm. Yes, even the unfairness. And while the Bullet time got refined in the next games(it just depletes way too fast for me to have any fun), this is where it started. And the story is...well, it's been copied numerous times by today's standards, but its superb. Max may overblow the drama, but the twists and turns are unexpected, always bringing something new into the table.\nSo, yes, I was frustrated. Yes, many times I wanted to say "♥♥♥♥ THIS". But I kept coming. Because I was being stingy with my items,playing at the edge of my life, and I knew I could get over it. I knew I could aim that next shotgun blast a little bit better and kill that guy faster, giving me time to pump lead on the guy who would walk through that door.

Absolutely awesome game! A must buy definitively. It has very decent voice acting, great sondtrack, an interesting grim and noir story with beatifully drawn comic style cutscenes, and most importantly excellent gameplay. The most important feature of the game is Bullet Time where you slow down time around you and kill everything in your way in a spectacular way all while dodging bullets. You're going to do a lot of quick-saving and quick-loading though, because a minor mistake can be fatal, and you will simply die (shotgun ARE insta-kill even on the easiest difficulty).\nI can't really think of other negative aspects of this game other than constant quickloading and it's somewhat repepetive in that nature (go in a room, die, quickload, try to clear out the room with minimal damage taken, etc), so overall, it's definitively a must-buy to any gamer.\n9.5/10","March 29, 2012","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What a fool I was, 2001 me would have loved this game.\n\nSet in a snowed in New York in 2001 you play as a Burnt out cop Max Payne who's out for revenge after his wife and newborn child are killed by rampaging drug addicts. Pretty grim stuff eh? well it only gets darker from here on out.\n\nThe level design and sound is brilliant, although it has aged I would argue it aged rather well. The atmosphere it gives off is incredibly bleak and noir at its best. The gunplay is great with rounds going off all around you as you fly through the air in slow motion, and yes corpses and bulletcasings (including empty mags and shotgun hulls) stay around. You can really see the carnage you caused. The TV shows playing on random tv sets dotted around the levels are brilliant too, this was continued in Payne II.\n\nUnfortunely for most with modern machines this game will not work from the get go, but there is a series of fixes and widescreen mods floating around on the web. It took me about 5 minutes to get it running on nice resolutions.\n\nIn conclusion if you like 3rd person quality shooters that have strong atmosphere and fun gunplay look know further, this game is a classic.\n","January 10, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2596e/recommended/12140/","2596e","C.C","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2596e/","191 products in account","I was foolish enough to ignore this game when it first came out years ago and only bought the double pack last year. What a fool I was, 2001 me would have loved this game.\n\nSet in a snowed in New York in 2001 you play as a Burnt out cop Max Payne who's out for revenge after his wife and newborn child are killed by rampaging drug addicts. Pretty grim stuff eh? well it only gets darker from here on out.\n\nThe level design and sound is brilliant, although it has aged I would argue it aged rather well. The atmosphere it gives off is incredibly bleak and noir at its best. The gunplay is great with rounds going off all around you as you fly through the air in slow motion, and yes corpses and bulletcasings (including empty mags and shotgun hulls) stay around. You can really see the carnage you caused. The TV shows playing on random tv sets dotted around the levels are brilliant too, this was continued in Payne II.\n\nUnfortunely for most with modern machines this game will not work from the get go, but there is a series of fixes and widescreen mods floating around on the web. It took me about 5 minutes to get it running on nice resolutions.\n\nIn conclusion if you like 3rd person quality shooters that have strong atmosphere and fun gunplay look know further, this game is a classic.\n","January 10, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
