The first 2 levels start out really slow. One of your weapons is a piece of paper... that's right, paper cut your enemies into submission. The 3rd level actually picks up and you kill some monsters, but the game lacks direction on the levels. I ran around for a half hour trying to find the next door I needed to go through and then just gave up. I'm VERY easily scared, but even this game got boring very quickly. Also, if you don't figure out that you manually need to save, you'll die and go back to the very beginning of the game... So that was cool.\n\nHere is my playthrough of Lvl 1-3:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmtlrxKTIFw","April 4","false","1.5"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","26","35","7","0"

Here are some pros and cons\n\nPros:\nVery easy game to run.  Not laggy at all.\nGraphics are nice.\nExciting to play.\nShooting mechanics are good, except the enemies can endure a lot of bullets, which is a bit annoying.\nOverall, good game\n\nCons:\nWhen I try to ALT TAB out of the game it won't let me, which is annoying.\nLike I said, the enemies can endure a lot of damage.\n\nAND that's pretty much it! Like I said, good game so far.  I don't know how long it is, but I'm excited to finish it.\n\n","April 1","true","1.0"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","7","28","0","0"
