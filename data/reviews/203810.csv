In some respects, it is not a game at all. Focusing on environments and atmosphere rather than gameplay and action is a nice way to change the pace, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who prefers Serious Sam and Doom over Amnesia and Proteus, I do not think this game is for you. The sound in the game is, well, not very exciting overall. The intro plops you into the island with explanation of why you are there, if you pay attention. The story is told by a nameless narrator, who talks about the island, his hobbies, and the mysterious Esther. Digging deeper into the story explains more about the characters and the settings, but only if you are willing to look.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe game can be frightening and intense if you let it. Beautiful environments are accompanied by the haunting yet calming voice of the narrator, who tells his life to you. While not the best decision for gameplay, Dear Esther provides with an amazing narrative and an atmosphere that is so thick you could wrap yourself up in it. The first chapter is the make or break point in this game.While not looking very stunning, the first part does do its job to set up the second half of the game. Not giving away too much, but not boring you to the point of no return. The end of the second chapter is where it is its best. The aesthetic changes completely, music greets you immediately, and the haunting feeling kicks in. The third chapter is my personal favourite, with the climax of the game leaving you able to interpret it however you please.\n\nTHE UGLY\nThere is no gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted gameplay, they could've at least given you the choice to turn off and on your flashlight, or maybe do some simple puzzle. Face the facts: You walk extremely slow. Perhaps for pacing, but it can be frustrating whil you spend the whole damn game going 10mph (That's metres, not miles). Also, for a game about discovery, there is very little to discover, not that you'd feel inclined to due the the speed of your walking. It can be quite boring if you're playing it after watching a walkthrough of it on Youtube, TwitchTV, or whatever place you use to watch gameplay videos, so I'd recommend not watching gameplay of Dear Esther before playing it. Also the visuals of Dear Esther deteriorates when it is put into videos, no matter how you set the graphical quality (1080p does NOT do this game justice via video).\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThere are two types of people in the world. Type one is the type who prefer Proteus over Dear Esther, and the other type of people prefer Dear Esther over Proteus. I fall into the latter category, for many reasons. If in doubt, get it on a sale. If you like it, great news! If you don't, you spent $5 and 1.4GB 'playing' a game that you didn't like. Personally, I think that the third chapter is the best chapter in this game. For the first two chapters, you explore the island, and at the end of the second chapter, a forced plot point happens which sends you to the most beautiful part of this game. The final chapter wraps it up nicely, and some people will like the final chapter more, so suffice to say the second half f the game is generally liked more. Also, this is NOT a game for children. It can be difficult to understand and there are so many plot elements that are metaphors or relatively unusual.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Proteus, in many ways, but also differs greatly\n-Amnesia: The Dark Descent, although without being as scary\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","November 27, 2013","true","3.5"," 322 of 403 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","322","403","0","6"

It also has a couple of very big problems...\n\n<Contains minor spoilers>\n\nThe Old Argument\n...but funnily enough, the question of whether or not Dear Esther is a game isn't one that bothers me. Gaming is still a relatively young medium, and writing off a game just because it doesn't meet the traditional definition can only stifle innovation and discourage others from experimenting. Ultimately, I'm more interested in the question: did Dear Esther succeed in what it set out to do? Well, allow me to elaborate on what I think.\n\nHebrides\nDear Esther is a so-called "walking simulator" (i.e. has very little gameplay besides walking and looking) set on a bleak Hebridian island. This island is perhaps the most compelling character in the entire story: it is nothing short of breathtaking. I regularly visit these islands in real life, and Dear Esther succeeds magnificently in capturing their bleak magnificence. Coastal winds whistle through rusted chain-link fences, smoky clouds hug towering cliffs, bothies speckle the terrain and rocky bays with rotten wooden structures dominate the landscape. Both the visual (spinning 2D plants aside) and the sound design are spot-on in establishing the atmosphere, which in turn is helped by the superb soundtrack. There were some moments that left me literally stunned at what I was witnessing on my screen, that's a rare achievement for any video game.\n\nAnywho, you play as a nameless, voiceless, faceless protagonist shipwrecked on a harsh Scottish island, who must make their way towards the radio tower on the horizon. It's not really clear what you intend to do once you get there, but never mind. Interaction is limited to walking around the island and sometimes poking your head into forlorn buildings, only to find them empty and long-abandoned. The lion's share of the game is spent listening to a well-spoken narrator reading a series of letters written to the eponymous Esther. The narrator himself is another highlight of the game; speaking in a deliberately monotone voice to start with, but rising to passionate speeches as you approach the game's climax.\n\nSo I like everything so far, and I don't mind the bare-bones gameplay, so why a No?\n\nCrux\nBecause of the limited interactivity, the narration pretty much forms the crux of the entire experience. Sadly, I found the quality of the writing in Dear Esther to be wanting.\n\nIf ever there was a walking definition of purple prose, this would be it. Although it contains a handful of reasonably well-written lines, the core parts of the narrative are so cluttered with flowery dialogue that it repeatedly draws attention to itself with how ridiculous it sounds. I admit to not being the smartest when it comes to analyzing good writing, but I can usually get invested in a well-told story even if I don't fully understand everything behind it. But Dear Esther is so full of itself and so utterly pretentious that I found myself getting frustrated rather than intrigued by the story. Here are a couple excerpts from the game:\n\n"An imagined answerphone message. The tires are flat, the wheel spins loosely, and the brake fluid has run like ink over this map, staining the landmarks and rendering the coastline mute, compromised. Where you saw galaxies, I only saw bruises, cut into the cliff by my lack of sobriety."\n\n"I had kidney stones, and you visited me in the hospital. After the operation, when I was still half submerged in anesthetic, your outline and your speech both blurred. Now my stones have grown into an island and made their escape and you have been rendered opaque by the car of a drunk."\n\nPerhaps my experience with human beings is limited, but this sounds like it was written by a teenager in English class trying to sound far cleverer than he actually is (this I can speak from experience though, because it sounds like one of my old essays). This is the only story I've experienced that somehow manages to be both frustratingly vague and tiresomely heavy-handed at the same time. Not sure how they did that, but that's the thought that kept crossing my mind as I listened to it.\n\nAmputation\nThen we come to the second problem: the player. The fact that Dear Esther may not be a 'real' game isn't what bothers me. What does bother me is that the player is completely amputated from the story being told. We're not here to partake in a moving tale of human loss, instead we're merely treated as a vehicle for the narrator to force flowery nonsense down our throats without getting to experience or even influence any of it. In fact, we're almost a hindrance to the game for our mere presence. This makes me wonder why Dear Esther is even a game in the first place, especially since it wrestles control from you during the ending (the only time something of note actually happens). The only benefit from it being a game is that I get to hold down W for 90 minutes, so it's essentially like watching a film on a DVD player with a broken pause button. On top of that, the walking speed is painfully slow:\n\n"People need to be more patient and take their time with soaking in the atmosphere"\n\nThis is what admirers of the game often tell me when I bring this up. Fair enough, I like immersing myself in a slow-burner, if anything I prefer a slower-paced story. But more often than not you'll wander down rather lengthy corridors, find nothing of interest, not even a bit of narration, and then have to slowly plod all the way back again. At this point, all the carefully planned pacing in the game comes to a crashing halt. Then there are other times when you have to traverse fairly featureless expanses all the while sliding along at the speed of a Peugeot driver on the Edinburgh bypass. This is not good pacing, this is just time wasting.\n\nFinal...\nSome might say that I've simply missed the point of the game, and that I'm too thick or impatient to fully appreciate Dear Esther's strengths. In all honestly, there's a good chance that you're correct in saying that. However, this game did not engage me on any level. I never felt invested in any of the character shells we're given a vague description of, and its eagerness to be intellectual and thought-provoking just came across as pretentious and condescending. I can give it credit for trying, but not for failing in its primary purpose. For that reason, I cannot recommend Dear Esther as a video game.\n\n(But I do recommend buying the soundtrack. Seriously, go get it, it really is that good)","October 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 217 of 273 people (79%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","79","217","273","14","12"

This game deserves more though.\n\nIn recent years it has become more common to hear gamers, and even some non-gamers giving credit to games as pieces of art. Truly all games are art in some form as they provide a visual and narrative experience no matter what type of game they are. Some games are simply greater classified as art than others, but even inside of that it seems something such as 'Dear Esther' should be given credit on the art scale much higher than any old "video games are art" scale.\n\n'Dear Esther' is claimed by many as "not a game". This is a debate I am no longer interested in, as I simply don't take a hard stance on what a game is anymore now that I have played so many adventure games, and what are more aptly described as "walking simulators". If you want to call it art instead, which it is, I can accept that, but debating on what a game is has become something I do not find interesting anymore. It's a game to me and great art at the same time.\n\nNow that I have grown up a little and become able to appreciate games as great pieces of art, I look for games with beauty in narrative, visuals, music, and even atmosphere much more often than I once did. Giving games described as "walking simulators" a much greater chance than I once would have as a younger gamer. 'Dear Esther' is a game I never would have played maybe as recent as a year ago. I would ignore games such as this and mockingly call them "walking simulators", or games with a lot of FMVs like MGS4, "movies". It's actually quite embarrassing thinking about discussions I've had in the past about such games. >_>\n\nI'm glad I came to my senses because games like this not only give you a sense of extreme beauty, but challenge you to think about things in abstract and interesting ways. Digging into you deeper than a more traditional game focused solely on the gameplay, which I considered the ONLY thing that mattered for the longest time. Games with these weird worlds, stories, and characters just stick with you longer and allow for us to spend more time with them after finishing by discussing them with other gamers. Isn't that something we all enjoy as a major part of gaming? Discussing games and trying to understand them when they give us something to talk about? (feel free to discuss in the comments of this review! Please be mindful of spoilers, however.) It definitely does for me, and 'Dear Esther' made me think, wonder, and read more about it the second I was done playing.\n\n'Dear Esther' on a technical side is a magnificently wonderful game. While you can see in the store screenshots that the game has haunting and lovely visuals, you can't really know how wonderful the atmosphere is without playing it. The music in this game is so well done (I highly recommend buying this soundtrack and I rarely do that) that I found myself saving when I heard a piece start so that I could reload and listen to it again before moving on. The music is atmospheric, haunting, beautiful, and I can't think of a game where I was so enthralled by the music before.\n\nWith the musical score lending to the feel of the game, the island you find yourself on gives a tremendous feeling of isolation, dread, insanity, and fear. You will go into "every nook and cranny, John" to see the strange items and locations from all angles before moving down the correct path to move the narration along. Taking these extra paths may lead you to seeing extra narration, or even ghosts out of the corner of your eye. Making you feel like you might not be alone, and then dissipating into mist to leave you wondering if you had just seen something moving, or it was just your imagination.\n\nThe narration voice-over is spectacular. A voice that helps the atmosphere as much as anything else, but what is said is just as unnerving in many instances. Narration comes at you as you walk around and move through the island on your ascent up to the top. It will be strange and probably not make a ton of sense every time you hear it. You will feel the mind of the narrator, which is you, seem to disjoint, and speak about things that don't seem relevant at times, but interesting none the less. Strangely, although I have played through the first couple chapters more than once, the narration seems to change in different playthroughs, making it almost impossible to know what exact pieces you will hear in a certain area. The theme and dialog seems to be standard enough through the entire game that the story you hear is about the same as it would be any other time, but it is quite interesting to hear other blurbs as you reach a section from game to game. I have no idea how many of these different blurbs you can encounter, but I am planning to play through the game again, maybe several times not just because I love the feel and isolation I feel while playing the game, but to tread deeper into the depths of the story and hear various new commentaries.\n\nIf you read this far, this game is for you. If you are willing to take this much time to read a review, I think you can appreciate this wonderful game as the artistic piece of work that it deserves. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has accepted games as more than just gameplay, but as a form of true beauty, a place to lose yourself in a world without having to shoot at things and jump around, and challenge yourself to see what the creator is trying to say by making it less than easy for you to interpret their strange thoughts to us gamers.\n\nA like-minded gaming friend gifted me this game, and I am truly grateful that someone cared enough to share this experience with me. It was a wonderful journey. Thank you. :)\n\nTL;DR Glorious mix of graphics, music, narration, and atmosphere. Walking simulator that is a true masterwork of art in the gaming universe. Even if you don't respect games such as this, give it a try (Not sure there has been a game in more bundles than this one so there is no way you can't get this for cheap at some point. The forum has 75% off coupons being given away constantly right now as well so there is that too). and see if you can appreciate it for what it is rather than just disregarding this genre entirely without actually making an effort to understand why people DO like them. A challenging, insightful, chilling, isolationist walk through a place that could make you think, feel terror, and maybe, just maybe turn you into a fan of more than just games focused entirely on gameplay.","August 26, 2014","true","9.4"," 179 of 230 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","179","230","4","6"

Very, very bored.  While I was bored there was a pretentious British guy babbling to me in an overwrought poetic manner about something that had happened and for which I had no background information to help me understand what the hell he was talking about.  That changed (thankfully): the backstory filled in, the environment and audio changed, and things improved dramatically.\n\nThis game has very impressive visual and audio aesthetics.  The background sounds and ambient music enhance the experience significantly (you should play with headphones on).  The voice acting is also compelling--you can really feel the narrator's internal turmoil as he struggles with what has happened.  The world the developers built here has a sense of mystery, purpose and beauty, but also sadness, introspection, and the portent of dread.  As I progressed through the "game" I felt more and more anxious about the revelations to come from the narrator. The suspense was palpable, and was reflected in the narrator's increasingly impassioned and upset dialogue.  It's quite well done.  I would say this is a game targeted toward mature gamers, in the sense that it is pretty sophisticated overall.\n\nThere are a few weak points: for a 1-hour experience it's quite a bit pricey at $10 (I got it on sale); the poetic tone was good but I thought it was forced in a few places, and at times obscured the backstory; the guy walks pretty slowly (you can go into console and change that, but that kinda breaks immersion).\n\nIn retrospect, I was impatient at the beginning of the game and am very glad I pressed on.  This is a very worthwhile experience. I do think $10 is a bit steep, so I'd recommend waiting til it's on sale.  If you are really into artistic and experiential games, then this is definitely for you. on sale or not.\n\nI recommend it.","February 3, 2014","true","1.6"," 119 of 160 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","119","160","0","4"

There was a more or less clear distinction between the "higher" arts, and the more "commercial" games, although many of those used elements from several arts (in-game music, often symphonic and with a classical feel to it, being just one example). With the rise of the Indie game-scene around 2010, things started to evolve fast. Since indie-developers are not bound by contracts to large (and indeed often very commercial) publishers, they found themselves in a position where experimenting with the medium of games itself turned into something viable.\n\nOne of the almost immediate consequences of this huge shift in focus, was the rise of what many have called since then "artistic games": games as the newest form of art, following in the footsteps of literature, music, architecture, painting, sculpture, photography, cinematography and the likes. This idea has generated some debate during the last five years, but it's still an underrated aspect of gaming. The one game that really stands out as maybe thé flagship of the artistic games, would surely be Dear Esther. Released in February 2012 by the small indie-company The Chinese Room, it made a huge impact on the gaming scene by the radical way in which it changes the entire concept of what a computer game is all about.\n\nIn this game there are no "goals" the player has to achieve, there is no such thing as "winning or losing", there is not even the possibility of playing well or badly, or of interacting with the environment. Actually, the gameplay is extremely limited: the player can only walk around on an abandoned island in the Scottish Hebrides in first-person view, with no running, jumping, climbing or crouching as in most first-person games. This immediately gives the game a very leisured pace, which may not be to the liking of everyone. Dear Esther has even been called a "walking simulator" - it's the most prominent of its tags on the Steam store at the moment. But it's nothing like that, in my opinion. Thsi game is not about the physical walk around the - extremely impressive and atmospheric - island. Dear Esther tells another kind of story: a story that happens within the main character, and one that is told with such emotional force that I as a player not only identified myself with the character, but also started to actually FEEL like he does. Now that's a rare experience in any game up till now: the feeling that the entire game, with all its components (visuals, story, music in this case) got under my skin in such a way that I got emotionally involved to a very, very large extent. I won't spoil anything from the story, but it's nothing light-weight to be sure and the game has stayed with me since I first played it three weeks ago.\n\nAnd there is not really much more to say about this amazing, almost genre-defining piece of art. Actually, the debate may not be if it's a piece of art (most will agree to that), but to whether it's a game or not. To my opinion, it's certainly both, and as such stands proud as one of the prime examples of artistic games that give as rich and rewarding an experience as reading a novel by Daphne du Maurier, looking at a painting by Turner or listening to a sonata by Mozart. But be advised: this gem calls for your complete attention, so headphones and a dark environment are recommended. Especially so since the soundscape the game provides, be it from the howling of the wind to the eerie, haunting music by Jessica Curry, deserves every inch of attention.\n\nOverall score: 9/10","November 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 102 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","102","141","3","5"

Being a walking simulator, the aim is simple; you walk around an island, taking in it's beautiful surroundings. The protagonist of this 'game' is a man set on a journey across a seemingly abandoned island. As you walk, fragments of a letter sound, and you're left with questions, allowing your imagination to run rampant. Who is Esther, and why does this quiet island resonate such familiarity with our protagonist? Are the surroundings real, or imagined? Abandoned buildings, caves and shipwrecks, this island brings forth an eerie yet calming atmosphere, and the raw emotion is exemplified with the stunning atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nGraphics The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and there is no lack of stunning landscape and imagery throughout the hour and a half (give or take) of game play. However, to call it a game would be entirely misleading; Dear Esther is more of a immersive movie, taking you on a beautifully narrated story around a mysterious island.\n\nVerdict:\nAs the graphics are generally a main focus in a walking simulator (being that there's no real 'game play'), it's super important that they get this right- which they did, perfectly. The only negative thing I could say on the visuals of this artistic masterpiece, is that it ended too soon.\nScore: 8/10\n\nSoundtrack The beautiful instrumental soundtrack, composed by the talented Jessica Curry specifically for this game, has a tranquil, soothing vibe that really adds to the feel of the story. Add to that the calming narration by Nigel Carrington, and you're set to go on a relaxing and encapsulating first person experience.\n\nVerdict:\nThe beautifully orchestrated soundtrack perfectly fits the mysterious and engrossing story line, filling the story with a soothing atmosphere.\nScore: 9/10\n\nOverall VerdictThis visually appealing game is definitely worth experiencing if you like peaceful games with a rich storyline.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10","August 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 79 of 106 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","79","106","0","2"

Nor is it really a 'game'. If you want fast paced action, turn back now, but if you're looking for something different, something a bit avant-garde and arty, Dear Esther is well worth your time.\n\nYou play a nameless character (first-person) who wanders along a basically linear path accross an abandoned Hebridean island for about 2 hours while a narrator intermittently reads fragments of letters to a woman named Esther. Interaction is minimal: you can walk, look around, and zoom in slightly. A flashlight automatically turns on when you enter a dark place. That's it in terms of gameplay, but Dear Esther's focus is not gameplay, it's on story.\n\nAnd what a confusing story it is. Piecing together the narrative will require you to listen carefully to everything the narrator says, read past the symbolism and shifting characters, and to play the game a few times (the fragments are mixed semi-randomly each time you start the game, so you won't hear every fragment until you've played the game at least 4 times). On top of that, you'll have to look around for visual clues on the island: objects littered on the ground, books in houses, diagrams and messages painted on walls. Even then, you'll still have trouble figuring out everything exactly what happened. However, you'll be able to work out the bare bones of the story from one playthrough.\n\nAs mentioned before, the story is primarily told through letters read out by a narrator who is the protagonist of the story. The writing is poetic, symbolic, and digressive, often making it difficult to follow, but this is intentional I believe. The writing is really excellent (although a little over-wrought at times), and is delivered fantastically by the voice actor. Without giving much away, the story concerns a tragic accident in the narrator's past, and explores themes of guilt and redemption. Its stunning conclusion nearly brought me to tears, and loses none of its power on replays.\n\nThe visuals of Dear Esther are stunning, wonderfully complimenting the loneliness and sadness of the story. You get a real visual feast, from the rugged hills above ground to the etheral caves below. The music is also beautiful, and goes well with the visuals and story.\n\nBy now, you know whether this game is for you or not. If you think it is, buy Dear Esther right now and get ready for the experience of a lieftime.","November 25, 2013","true","11.7"," 132 of 191 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","132","191","0","1"

Dear Esther was originally a free-to-play modification for the Source engine, developed and released in 2008 by The Chinese Room. The game is later redeveloped for commercial purposes in 2012, including the Steam version we have here.\n\nOur unknown and unreliable narrator opens his eyes on one shoreline of Hebridean Islands, and starts to walk. For the remainder of our experience, we will walk upon the surface of this forlorn island to discover its many wonders, abandoned mysteries and eerie beauties enhanced with a fantastic ambient music. We walk and bear witness to fragments of a tale concerning a loss, a death, a shepherd, a boat without a bottom, a love story and endless aphorisms of a broken mind, tested through a journey to embrace a final conclusion. We are there to complete an unfinished tale, accompanied only by eerie shadows of past tales that we feel and sometimes see with the corner of our eyes. "Dear Esther" says the narrator in one of his letters; "I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island."\n\nIn its totality, many would categorize Dear Esther as a story exploration or walking simulation game. Yes, it is a walking simulation that will present you the most beautiful of environment designs harbored with genuine melancholy. But in my opinion Dear Esther is neither only a walking simulation, nor a consistent story revelation. It is, with all its grandeur and beauty in display, interactive literature. The script of the game arranged through aphorisms of the narrator is weaved out of allegories, metaphors, fleeting yet crushing narrative descriptions to accomplish a literary experience no lesser than James Joyce in feat. It may possibly take a literary career to completely appreciate the full context of this narrative beauty with tremendous subtext and symbolism.\n\nA full playthrough consists of 4 distinct chapters - monumental areas of the protagonist's journey. One singular chapter takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete, depending on your tendency to explore. It takes 3-4 playthroughs to reveal the whole script, which will accordingly reveal a new part in this symbolic feast every time. There is nothing to do in the traditional sense: only an experience to behold.\n\nIf you are one to appreciate symbolic narrative and have an hour or two to spare, this is a short journey you shouldn't miss. Wear your headphones, kick back and start your exploration. Esther, The Hermit, Donnelly, Paul and Jacobson... they all wait for you in this island, forgotten in Hebrides.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 19","true","2.6"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","53","69","0","7"

On the surface this has a lot going against it. Dear Esther feels like less of a game, more of an experience. You awaken on an island at one end under a lighthouse and you walk your way to a red beacon on a radio tower in the sky. The whole thing takes an hour or less to complete the experience. The controls are simple, walk and zoom. There is no jump or sprint.\n\nYou will experience the morbid and yet gorgeous island in all of its glory. I say experience more than explore. As much as you can walk around and think you're doing your own thing, you're really just on a set path that is highly detailed and winds through coastal beaches, caves and cliff sides. It is a beautiful game and might be one of the most beautiful games ever visually.\n\nThe day turning into night was a nice touch, even if at night you can end up completely blind by the dark. It seemed like the day and night wasn't random as the game claims, but if I died, it did become darker until I was unable to see.\n\nThe whole thing is very immerse with only 3 loading 'screens' once the game begins. The game is short and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome for what is basically a glorified tech demo of the Source engine. Supposedly no play through is the same with different audio for each run, but when I played a second time everything felt the same even if I didn't hear the audio at the exact same spot. I explored a lot more, but everything was the same.\n\nYou can also find it in a few bundles for less than $10 which then the price is worth it, but for 1 hour of an experience, I can't recommend it.","August 16, 2014","false","1.9"," 125 of 193 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","125","193","0","0"

The reason is gameplay for you only do three things: walk, listen and watch. Formula like this can encourage a decent number of people to confer a title of "Walking Simulator - 2012" on this adventure game from the young British developer  The Chinese Room , who previously worked on the atmospheric "Half-Life 2" mod "Korsakovia". But at this point gamers of all ages should ask themselves a question: do they need another rank-and-file FPS on already flooded modern VG market or are they open for innovative ideas and blending of various kinds of art?\n\nDear Esther originated from a Source engine mod of the same name made by  The Chinese Room  in 2008. In this completely reworked standalone only WASD and a mouse are required to play (get your left-hand middle finger ready). Taking this fact into consideration, if Dear Esther was the first video game ever made by man, the industry would have been slightly different...  However, alternate history theories aside, DE is to be considered as an unusual experiment which strays from traditional principles of electronic entertainment. Gameplay is stripped of some widespread features: interactive objects, logs, and puzzles. It may take away the conventional\nfun though it may be all this have been sacrificed for the sake of storytelling and creating more engaging and emotion-focused experience.\n\nThe storyline is one of the strongest points of the title. Presented in a form of an audio messages, it tells about the man who lives (lived?) as a hermit on an island in the Hebrides  - an archipelago just off the coast of Scotland. He wrote a letter to Esther, supposedly his wife, and messages you hear exploring as an unnamed silent protagonist are clippings from this writing. They appear when you reach certain spots of four different locations. This feature adds some replay value to a mature, if rather short journey as one can discover new pieces of the story should he visit places he missed in the next play-through. Writing is top-notch, the narrator is sumptuous - shades of the great Richard Burton, who lent his voice for Jeff Wayne's 1978 epic rock opera "War of the Worlds". The story raises some major existential questions, leaves room for interpretation, and overall feels like it has been inspired by H.P. Lovecraft works.\n\nDear Esther looks and sounds gorgeous. It is not about photo-realistic visuals but about crafty game of light and dark, sounds, colors, and shapes. The island feels alive: grass sways, water flows, caves breathe and glimmer. The result: the most impressive landscapes to compete in one league with "Dishonored" and "Skyrim". Sound design is faithfully backing it all up as everything - from chilly wind to distant ship horns - sounds naturally yet unusual, out of this world. Combined with serene, at times dreadful music by Jessica Curry, it makes a huge impact, immersing one into the atmosphere.\n\nGiving the game credit where credit's due, it is more than just a bold experiment. Dear Esther is an indie title to show that gaming has grown and is not just about mashing buttons and shooting bravado anymore. It offers no challenge but challenges your mind. It doesn't pull of any tricks but occupies it's own niche and broadens the boundaries of PC gaming, thereby bringing rage upon itself. For $10 you get 2 hours of sheer aesthetic joy on your machine. Only if your motto is "No gameplay, no game", there is nothing for you here and there will never be.","November 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 64 of 92 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","64","92","2","0"

You walk on a deserted island, while your mind narrates some letters you wrote to Esther (hence the name). It focuses on the environment, the music, and the very detailed world to amaze and relax you.\n\nThe Pros:Beautiful - The game is beautiful. The world is very detailed, put together with much care and thought. Every scenery is breath-taking. Lots of dense foliage, rocky cliffs, and watery caves. Wonderful lightning as well! This is a walking simulator, of course. It is meant for you to behold, to explore, to enjoy.\n\nGreat Narrative - The narration is very well performed, and the contents are nice as well. Pay close attention and you will get a grasp of what happened in the past. I won't give details about them here. Experience them yourselves.\n\nRelaxing - Besides buying a game, you also get free relax pills. This is excellent for when you are stressed out. Just enter the game, pick a chapter, and slowly walk, breathe in deeply, enjoy the beauty. Works like a charm!Cons:Linear - The game doesn't allow you to stray too far off your obviously paved paths. There are some occasions where you will encounter dead ends, but fear not. Just turn around, look for 5 seconds and the true path will surely be revealed to you.\n\nOne Hour - That is the approximate time you will spend walking around. This is the standard length of this type of games, and I am not disappointed with it's length. But the world is so well made, I just want to see more of it!\nConclusionFor a 2012 game, this was a fresh breath of air. Good looking, interesting, and highly relaxing.

It's 'exploration-focused' and lacks any form of conflict, but I have no real problem with that. You'll find some who spend time debating whether or not this is a game (it is,) but I think this is a useless diversion here. It doesn't really matter one way or the other.\n\nWhat does matter though, is whether it's aesthetically any good. It clearly attempts to deliver in two ways here, through the writing alone and through the connection between it and the world you're exploring. This means that the opening conceit which justifies it being a video game and indeed having any exploration is that the narrator says:" I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island."\n\nThis leads to a game-length extended metaphor tying his emotions regarding the actual events of the story (which take place on the motorway in Britain,) to a hypothetical island. Unfortunately, the range and length of this metaphor means that a lot of it becomes stretched pretty thin, and limits a lot of the writing to only be able to speak in 'terms of an island.' This means that at times you do struggle to see the point of any of the speech about the island itself -- for instance, what are we supposed to gain by knowing how islanders traditionally and historically dealt with plagues? Very interesting - but doesn't help the story along in any way.\n\nThe writing reads somewhat like a parody or imitation of that from a classic novel, but carries little of the same purpose or clarity. There are clever moments, for example the Damascus motif which seems to have been put in because the narrator experienced a 'turning point on the road.' (Though this eventually amounts to little more than a cultural reference.)  But a lot of it is stilted and even somewhat pointless - the 'kidney stone' motif goes nowhere and does nothing. It jumps through such a colossal range of themes that it can't take the time to establish any of them, and this isn't helped by the obscure structure. We're tied into exploring an island, and for the sake of player engagement and interest that means they have to put new scenery and things around most corners. This limits the writing even further, and forces it to find metaphorical links for a huge variety of things - which comes across as constrained when they spell it out, and increasingly obscure when they don't.\n\nIn its defence, the stuffier moments of writing are somewhat masked by a fairly good voice acting job, which does provide a good sense of atmosphere along with the sound direction, (and not just because it's a British voice.)\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think I can in good faith recommend it. The writing lurches uncomfortably from the island back to the motorway, and apart from establishing the conceit of the island (and in doing so providing an excuse for a video game-space,) it does very little else with it.","November 27, 2013","false","1.8"," 245 of 402 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","245","402","0","7"

Initially, I didnt play it because my computer couldnt handle it and it kept freezing. However, I realized that since I had upgraded my GCU, there was no reason not to, and on maxed out settings no less.\n\nThe game is in a word: BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, this might be one of the best looking games if not THE best looking game ever. It's probably a bit messed up, but I kept thinking that this is how Skyrim should have looked (not that Skyrim looked bad). Anyway, I digress. This is actual a mostly linear exploration game, where the story is revealed as you check out locations.\n\nThe story itself is the subject of much speculation and debate. One thing that is not debatable is that this isnt exactly a happy story being told, although possibly it has a hopeful ending depending on how you perceive the entirety of the story. I will give my take on that at the end of this review so it wont spoil the game for anybody who doesnt want to read it. It is told in narrative fashion.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simply you walking around, looking at stuff. You can zoom in, and that is exactly all your actual gameplay options.Keeps it pretty simple that way.\n\nI mentioned the graphics before, but seriously, the attention to detail, even the minutia of a scene, is fairly well flawless. I can find zero fault with it whatsoever. You will be truly amazed with this aspect of the game in my opinion. There are some really jaw dropping images in this game. If you are curious, take a peak at the 140 or so screenshots I took, lol (but be wary of spoilers in them).\n\nSo, that is pretty much it. This game is perfection as far as walking simulator/exploration games go. I've seen nothing better yet. 10/10\n\nAlright, now to the SPOILERS\n\nIt is my opinion that our protagonist is a ghost, revisitng his final days, his final regrets, and finally coming to terms with everything. I am of the opinion that, whether or not s/he was actually dead (the voice is male, but the reality of his gender is ambiguous at best), he was at the very least hallucinating and/or in a hospitalized, drug induced state of disorientation. His mind is clearly fractured and I think the people he references (himself, Jacobson, Esther Donnelly) are all parts of his own consciousness. The cause was obviously an auto wreck, although maybe this was just metaphor as well, and I coulnt help but think that he had lost a daughter, which was the source of his wrecked mind.\n\nI dont know though. This story leaves a lot of your own subjective interpretation, which is actually another appealing aspect of this game\n\nSPOILER/REVIEW END.","January 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","37","53","2","0"

Firewatch was engaging, interesting and immersive. Gone Home was slightly less immersive but still interesting enough to finish with fond thoughts.\n\nDear Esther is far and and way the worst of those three and really is just a terrible game. Even for a walking simulator it was far too light on the game aspect of being a game. The lack of an interact button should have been a giveaway. At least in the above mentioned games you can amuse yourself throwing mugs off towers or turning on every light in the house. In Dear Esther you wander (VERY SLOWLY) around a deserted Island, probably in the Northern Atlantic. While you do so fragments of a fairly obvious story are told to you in a disjointed, fragmented manner. This makes its tough to figure out what's going on but even more confusing is that most of the time the fragments have nothing to do with what you are looking at. The much touted soundtrack cuts in and out with awful editing, at first i thought it was to add to the disquieting atmosphere but in hindsight it was probably just lazy like the story.\n\nWhats worse is that it felt like it was punishing me for exploring, as is basic instinct for gamers i dutifully went down every path and looked in every cave. Without fail there was no reward, no pay off, no collectables and mostly no new information. I think twice in the whole game my curiosity was rewarded with a little two line explosition that revealed nothing new. There are open-ended games but there is a different between open-ended and just adding random things. Twice i found a suitcase of clothes at the bottom of a cliff, why? Who knows. I found three bedrolls which make no sense if this is *SPOILER his mind/puratory*. The game touts its own mystery with things like "What is the significance of the lighthouse?" but honestly i don't think the writers even know.\n\nI finished the whole game in 2hrs which was both too short and too long. Too short in that it felt like a waste of money and too long in that the cripplingly slow walking pace, lack of interaction and confusing story made me wish for the end.\n\nIf you are looking for a good walking simulator or an engaging story, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere.","May 10","false","2.2"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","0"

The more we challenge the status quo through the creation and the experience of such games, the more we do to progress video games as a medium of artistic worth. I'm glad that Dear Esther has been as well-received as it has been; it's a modest landmark for the real success that such experimental titles can find today.\n\nHowever, I am nothing if not a harsh critic, and Dear Esther has its problems, small piece of history that it is. It is possibly unfair to judge an experimental video game by the standards of more established media, but if video games expect to play in the big leagues, they shouldn't be exempt from playing by the same rules.\n\nBut first, there are things which Dear Esther does right. Easiest to praise are the visuals, which depict the island on which you wander as lonely but yearning to be explored. Each point of visual interest has been crafted with great care – from the vistas to the smallest details, like a lone buoy, far offshore and barely visible.\n\nThe size of the island itself is something to appreciate. Regardless of your feelings with regards to the game's very casual walking speed, the island's stretches of nothing have their own desolate beauty.\n\nBut while the setting of Dear Esther can easily hold interest, its story has a much harder time attempting to do the same. From what you are allowed to piece together, the narrator is attempting a sort of redemption by exile. His disembodied voice pops in occasionally at certain checkpoints to provide you with vague details about what basically amounts to "stuff." A small collection of first names, a meandering history of the island, and unclear, melodramatic recollections of ailments and car crashes are some of what you can expect from these telling monologues that are anything but. I very quickly came to realize that the game's visuals were better than its writing deserved. It is frustrating.\n\nFor a game like Dear Esther, the story's the thing. The plot here lacks so much specificity and context as to void its stabs at emotional poignancy. To be vague is one thing, but that artful reluctance to provide specifics is a better trait for a rational character than the opposite. When reasonable people are weighed down by guilt, the poetic musings they conjure surprise you by contrasting with the voice you expect; but the narrator of Dear Esther is too unhinged to make a clear point among all the overthinking. What we get is a voice that constantly oversells things and scurries back and forth much too often between too many incomplete themes. It is unsatisfying to follow and even more unsatisfying still to piece together. There are bits and pieces of good phrasing scattered within all the overwrought prose, but the story would have benefitted from the writers falling out of love with this character.\n\nDear Esther was made in a time when video games needed a reinvention. It tried for some big things and for that it has my respect. Visually, it is a full experience; I just wish that same amount of polish and editing was present in its other, crucial half.","March 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 94 of 155 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","94","155","0","1"

It has no gameplay elements and its experimental approach makes it impossible to categorize. The author calls it a "ghost story, told using first-person gaming technologies" but I'm not sure there is a ghost. I'm not even sure there is a story. If I had to put a label on it I would call it an attempt to evoke emotions with a series of randomised snippets of poetry that roughly ape a narrative structure, presented in the form of software. Not interactive poetry because it doesn't allow interaction. You are confined to the role of an observer, you can listen and watch but that's it. No puzzles, no dialogues, no characters, nothing can be touched, you can't even run or jump.\n\nWith the words "Dear Esther, ..." the unnamed narrator begins his monologue and you, the unnamed protagonist, begin your walk across an unnamed and uninhabited island. And walking (slowly, painfully slowly) is all you will be doing for the next 1-2 hours if you want to "play" through the whole thing... walking and listening to the narrator who will occasionally be throwing in snippets of letters and diary entries. While you're following the strictly linear path (you will encounter invisible barriers all the time) you will notice strange symbols carved into rocks, some mysterious drawings, some chemical formulas, even ultrasound pictures of a baby. Maybe they're intended as clues to help decipher some kind of cryptic story, maybe they mean nothing at all.\n\nThe scenery is very well designed, the music unobtrusive but beautiful.\n\nFor me, the narrative does nothing. I find it pretentious, flowery with no substance or meaning. My predominant feeling when I was "playing" Dear Esther was that of boredom. But that's just me. If you are curious about this storytelling-experiment, by all means, try it out for yourself. If you will enjoy the experience or not is purely a matter of personal taste.","December 11, 2013","false","0.8"," 203 of 349 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","203","349","0","12"

The atmosphere is stunningly strong and solid. There is a feeling of something dark and mysterious always lingering around, makes you paranoid, scared. The poetry is hard to understand and I didn't know what the man was talking about half of the time but it was beautiful and mysterious. The Source engine is perfectly utilized as the environments and all the details are absolutely breathtaking. The music and sounds are significant parts of the atmosphere. The game design is so good it doesn't need any item pickups, puzzles or any sort of advanced controls and that's a very unusual feat. It just works on it's own as an emotional, artistic experience and I think that modern games should be heading that direction to support the gameplay, or as in case of Dear Esther, be completely symbiotical, to create unforgettable games.","February 19, 2012","true","3.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

Everything fits together like a puzzle. You know the feeling, when you want to end the game (to know the ending) but also do not want to end (because the game is really good)? I had this feeling after finishing this game.\n\nStory\nThe story begins on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere. Deserted island has one charm - nature. You have to go on a journey and with exploring the island, you also uncover parts of the story to the end, which is perfect.\n\nGraphics\nI don't know what to say. The waves beating against the rocks, cold wind, in dense fog shrouded lighthouse, amazing night beach, gorgeous moon, caves - such a visual experience offered by Dear Esther. However, I miss there any wild animals on the island (i've seen just one seagull).\n\nAudio\nBeautiful soundtrack by Jessica Curry plays a big role with a voice of a narrator, who is very important in the story games. I must also mention great sounds of nature - like the sea, the wind, falling drops of water in the cave.\n\nGameplay\nWell, all you need to do in this game is just walk around and listen to a narrator, what is a great pity. Story like this just needs some investigations of items or searching for clues, eventually some easier puzzles. But I have to commend the developer console, which is enabled in the settings. Gameplay is really short (1-2 hours).\n\nPrice\nI get this game for free from my friend but I think that 9,99€ is enough because you can finish it in two hours.\n\n9/10","May 28","true","1.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

What bothered me is simply the writing itself and the choice to make narration pieces random. I tried my best to be absorbed by the narration, but the writing overall was lacking to me. You just walk these long distances to just get some little chunk of odd, unimpressive text read to you in a pretty unimpressive voice - why would I be excited about this?\n\nI did not feel much emotion from Dear Esther.

For me, Dear Esther lies in category. Over the 2 and a half years that I've owned and loved this game, I've tried to write a review, but often gave up because I could never find the words to describe my thoughts on it.\n\nIt's one of the first and only games to move me emotionally, to make me truly  feel  something. A chilling sense of wonder about the beauty of life, and yet, the frailty of it all as well. Hope and hopelessness, both at once. Even as I wander down the same paths I have several times before, I find myself awed time and time again by the astounding beauty of something so simple as the view of a moonlit beach or a gentle breeze blowing through the grass. I load it up every so often, just to experience that world again. It's almost turned into a kind of private escape for me.\n\nTo truly enjoy and appreciate this game, you must let yourself become immersed. The sights, along with the sounds, are stunning and realistic. The music and voice acting are top notch, and easily lands itself high on my list of favorite game soundtracks. There is no gameplay to speak of; it's simply a walking, exploration game, as the background of the characters and island are revealed as you move along. That being said, the world as well as the characters are interesting and mysterious, and drive the desire to keep diving further into the island.\n\nIf you enjoy this type of game, do yourself a favor and get it. If you're not sure, get it, and remember to keep your mind open.","October 12, 2015","true","9.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Sadly, the only thing you do in this linear game is hold the W key and point your mouse while the narrator talks. There's nothing to interact with, your actions mean nothing, and exploration is actively punished by an unhelpful terrain and a snail's pace walk.\n\n(See something interesting? Well climb down this little hill and look! Oh... Oh, its nothing. Oh well, I guess you'll have to walk back. No, no, not back to where you climbed down, that's too steep. No, go back. Back some more. No, not far enough, keep going. Just a little... no, no that way is blocked, too. Oh there, you go. Now you're back to the start of the trail. Just a few minutes and you'll back to where you were, but wasn't it so much more enriching to have gone over and looked at that ledge with nothing on it? Good job.)\n\nThe only challenge in this game is holding the W key throughout 2+ hours without your hand becoming a locked claw. I started with my index finger, then to my middle and ring finger and on to my thumb (which didn't work well). I did eventually try holding a spoon down on the key with the heel of my hand, and that did the job nicely.\n\nIn reality, Dear Ester is a movie (a dull one at that) that makes you hold down a button so as to keep you awake throughout it. This is no more a "game" than a movie with audio but no picture is a "movie". But if you want to go through it, it is at least short and the imagery is very pretty with a nice score.

I can't even begin to count the amount of screenshots i took. The areas are designed perfectly, with fascinating scenery and perfect lighting.\nDear Esther is a game about taking your time to explore, Look around and take in the story. As you walk around perfectly sculpted areas, Voice acting: a well recorded, rather soothing voice tells a powerful, hard-hitting story which has been thoughtfully written. I thouroughly enjoyed my time playing through this game.\nIf you like exploration games, Or just want a calm/casual/soothing game. I highly recommend this! However: Although i understand the game is meant to be slow paced, I feel the walking/movement is way too slow. Also i feel the game is quite short.\nTo sum up:  Pros:\nInsanely Beautiful graphics/ Scenery\nIntresting and engaging story\nIt's a very calm and soothing game Cons:\nThe walking is EXTREMELY slow\nIt's a fairly short game\nI highly recommend this game, It's calm, fun, enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drnoooo/recommended/203810/","drnoooo","Elaine!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drnoooo/","191 products in account","Dear Esther is a weird paradox of a game - in spite of its environments being incredibly realistic and beautiful, in spite of it having far and away more detail than its original 2008 mod version, it also doesn't feel real at all. It's like a painting - because you can look at it, but you can't touch it, you're reminded that nothing in it actually exists.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the original Dear Esther mod, but the reasons I enjoyed it were all unintentional, and all of them are lost in the remake. In the original, you could jump and sprint, you could even swim out of bounds and see the unmodeled backs of caves and mountains. You could pick things up, like paper sailboats, hear them knock against walls, throw them into the ocean and stare at them for a while. You couldn't hear anything clearly because of the poor audio mixing, so you made up conclusions completely unintended by the developers, made connections that were never written.\n\nIn Dear Esther, all of this interactivity - no matter how minor, no matter how unintended it was as the result of the original mod copying HL2's basic gameplay systems - is gone. So, as a result, it feels less real than before. As a result, it loses much of it atmosphere. As a result, there's no longer any mystery about what it means. Even the intended mystery of what the island means and what it represents is lost, thanks to distracting new voice clips where the original voice actor somehow manages to sound twenty years older than he did before, new voice clips that spell out all of the meaning.\n\nSo is the Dear Esther remake worth playing? I don't think so. As much as I dislike criticisms of these type of games as "Walking Simulators," and as much as I enjoy games like Gone Home, I think it loses everything that made the original mod of Dear Esther special. I would recommend playing that instead, with the lights low and headphones on, without knowing in advance anything that happens or any theories about what it means - it's a unique experience, something that really can't be done outside of an unpolished mod of a video game, and I think it's much more special.","September 1, 2015","false","4.9"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/203810/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Dear Esther is not a game for everyone, as by most definitions it is hardly a game at all. What began as a Half-Life 2 mod has spiraled out into it's own experience, an interactive story told through the eyes and narration of a man lost to his own grief. You  are taken through a world that is meant to be observed and listened to but not interacted with, essentially casting you as a camera on wheels.\n\nAs you slowly make your way along the paths of the island you are presented with a series of exquisitely written monologues, so meticulously penned in fact that the writer almost seems to lose his way at times detailing seemingly inconsequential facts and events sometimes fail to wrap up in the end. As they say, it's the journey that matters not the destination, but when said journey is so quickly over it's hard not to feel a bit empty inside when all is said and done with so little happening in between beginning and end.\n\nI do have to acknowledge the astonishingly beautiful graphics, with rich detail etched into every crevice and particularly impressive water effects, all of which makes it very hard to believe it is running on the aging Source engine. A haunting and evocative score often takes the place of dialog, sometimes even overpowering it, and sets a relaxed but all the same saddening tone that makes it hard not to feel something is amiss.\n\nIn the end do I recommend Dear Esther? Yes, for those who can appreciate a game that tries something new and stretches the boundaries of what the medium can be. However, as a disappointingly brief experience (I completed it in under an hour), I couldn't advise purchasing it at full price. It's a journey I feel is worth taking, but not one that is worth paying a great deal for. For those wanting something more traditionally along the lines of a "game", you will probably want to skip it altogether. It is far from a must play, but if the style appeals to you, is definitely worth taking a small bit of your day to see for yourself.","January 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","5"

However, there are two things I wish I had known going into this title:\n1). As many have stated in the reviews, it is art not a game.  The only thing you control is movement.  There are no puzzles and there is no challenge whatsoever.  Because of the limited controls, this leads to my second major problem with the game.\n2). It can be agonizingly slow and tedious.  I understand thechineseroom's decision not to include a sprint button, as this game is quite short and it would feel out of place.  However, a simple fastwalk button (or making Esther walk faster than a drunk snail) would have helped tremendously.  At several points in the game, you find yourself at one end of a HUGE plain or cliff that you must traverse to the other.  You will also make many wrong turns and have to turn around and re-tread these massive terrains.  The game requires a lot of patience and, unfortunately, it fails to deliver.\n\nThis game does succeed in its gorgeous visuals (easily the selling-point, oddly enough) and the conventional British narrator.  It also has a very open-ended conclusion if that's your sort of thing.  But ultimately I find it difficult to recommend Dear Esther as a good game, if it's even a game at all.  While I'm not bitter about the dollar I probably spent on this title through a humble bundle, I still want my hour and a half back.","December 29, 2014","false","1.5"," 29 of 53 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","29","53","0","0"

Not to mention the most subtle "horror" game ever made:  There's apparently quite a number of ghosts to be spotted throughout, and you know how many I spotted on my first playthrough?  ZERO!  But there's plenty of YouTube videos to prove otherwise.\n\nMore than any other game I know of, this is definitely about what the player brings to the game.  If you don't like slowly moving through stunning, oddly spooky landscapes in which you MAY spot the occasional bit of activity other than grass blowing moodily in the breeze, this may not be the game for you.  Hell, it's barely even a "game" per se...more like a short (under two hour) journey through some awe-inspiring environments to an inevitably downbeat and haunting conclusion.\n\nNot exactly "scary", and definitely not action-packed (to put it mildly!), this is nonetheless an experience worth indulging if you're the type of person who can get into something which is purely about MOOD and crap-all else.

So slow, you might want to just close it. Press on. The term "game" is used pretty loosely when describing Dear Esther. It's much less a game, and more an immersive experience. You walk the island you're on, listening to the narrator piece together the story as you progress forward. Things get a little more surreal as you go. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's an experience worth having - like watching a good movie. It's about the length of one too. Unfortunately, like watching a movie (think The Sixth Sense), once you know how it plays out, there's little in the form of replay value. Sure, you might take a stroll again, but this isn't a game that you'll soon come back to, or play over and over. My only real complaint is that you walk slow. Relentlessly slow. There is no option to run or jump, and the game sometimes provides two paths - which are equally worth scoping out - but when you take a path that requires you to then turn around and trek back down the same trail to the fork, it feels like a real grind. That being said, $10 feels steep for the experience, but it IS an experience worth having nonetheless.","June 20, 2014","true","1.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I'm glad I bought it, and I'm still discovering new threads to the story.\n\nThat said, I can understand why some people wouldn't like it - it's not a traditional computer game in any sense. You can't jump, or run, or interact with the environment in any way. There's no guns, no goals, and no achievements. All you can do is wander slowly through a bleak but beautiful landscape, while the narrative unfolds.\n\nDear Esther is a tale of love and loss, of grief and anger, of sickness and addiction, of the disintegration of a personality, and a desperate search for meaning amongst the ruins of a shattered life, of the hope for final redemption... oh, and yoghurt.\n\nThere is, though, a trick to Dear Esther. The narrative, and various objects visible to the player, change every time you play. If you want to have any understanding of what's going on, you have to pay close attention not only to the dialogue, but also to the items around you - the photographs on the table, the letter on a pile of rubbish, the detritus on the beach. You have to play through it several times, because each time you gather different clues to the story.\n\nWhether you think the story is ever satisfactorily explained is a matter for you to decide.

I know you can see my listed playtime but I just wanted to indicate that was how long it took from start to finish.","March 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

I'm a new gamer and have an arts background, so I have enjoyed exploring some of the indie games instead of the usual gun-blazing brain-blasters that seem to be so popular. I had just finished playing Gone Home and really enjoyed it. From the reviews I had read, Dear Esther was supposed to be an even better narrative-driven game. It wasn't.\n\nWhen I realized you can't DO anything -- no object engagement, swimming, or overcoming the tiniest of obstacles -- I patiently explored the island, waiting for something to happen. About an hour and a half into the game I decided to give up for the day, feeling like I'd seen a lot of stunningly beautiful landscapes, but that's about it. When I reloaded the game on another day, I discoverd I was forced to start from the beginning, and there was no way I was spending another hour and a half of walking an island with nothing happening just to get through the last of the dull storyline.\n\nI'm sure the story is great, though the metaphorical and lyrical language that guides the game was pushed too far and comes off a bit pompous-sounding. They tried too hard to be brilliant with this one, and it comes off as unnatural and forced. Skip it.","October 25, 2014","false","1.3"," 57 of 109 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","57","109","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phonepyaetun/recommended/203810/","phonepyaetun","Phone Pyae Tun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phonepyaetun/","297 products in account","THE GOOD\nDear Esther is not your ordinary game. In some respects, it is not a game at all. Focusing on environments and atmosphere rather than gameplay and action is a nice way to change the pace, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who prefers Serious Sam and Doom over Amnesia and Proteus, I do not think this game is for you. The sound in the game is, well, not very exciting overall. The intro plops you into the island with explanation of why you are there, if you pay attention. The story is told by a nameless narrator, who talks about the island, his hobbies, and the mysterious Esther. Digging deeper into the story explains more about the characters and the settings, but only if you are willing to look.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe game can be frightening and intense if you let it. Beautiful environments are accompanied by the haunting yet calming voice of the narrator, who tells his life to you. While not the best decision for gameplay, Dear Esther provides with an amazing narrative and an atmosphere that is so thick you could wrap yourself up in it. The first chapter is the make or break point in this game.While not looking very stunning, the first part does do its job to set up the second half of the game. Not giving away too much, but not boring you to the point of no return. The end of the second chapter is where it is its best. My aesthetic changes completely, music greets you immediately, and the haunting feeling kicks in. The third chapter is my personal favourite, with the climax of the game leaving you able to interpret it however you please.\n\nTHE UGLY\nThere is no gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted gameplay, they could've at least given you the choice to turn off and on your flashlight, or maybe do some simple puzzle. Face the facts: You walk extremely slow. Perhaps for pacing, but it can be frustrating whil you spend the whole damn game going 10mph (That's metres, not miles). Also, for a game about discovery, there is very little to discover, not that you'd feel inclined to due the the speed of your walking. It can be quite boring if you're playing it after watching a walkthrough of it on Youtube, TwitchTV, or whatever place you use to watch gameplay videos, so I'd recommend not watching gameplay of Dear Esther before playing it. Also the visuals of Dear Esther deteriorates when it is put into videos, no matter how you set the graphical quality (1080p does NOT do this game justice via video).\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThere are two types of people in the world. Type one is the type who prefer Proteus over Dear Esther, and the other type of people prefer Dear Esther over Proteus. I fall into the latter category, for many reasons. If in doubt, get it on a sale. If you like it, great news! If you don't, you spent $5 and 1.4GB 'playing' a game that you didn't like. Personally, I think that the third chapter is the best chapter in this game. For the first two chapters, you explore the island, and at the end of the second chapter, a forced plot point happens which sends you to the most beautiful part of this game. The final chapter wraps it up nicely, and some people will like the final chapter more, so suffice to say the second half f the game is generally liked more. Also, this is NOT a game for children. It can be difficult to understand and there are so many plot elements that are metaphors or relatively unusual.","February 19, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The voice that narrates this game is perfect for the part, and the text is very relatable, at least to me.\n\nYes, if you did not read the game description or know anything about this game, it is a walking simulator. WALKING. No sprint (which isn't necissary since the scenery is perfect for viewing and exploring by means of a leasurely stroll, not a quick paced jog. walking simulators are meant for walking, not jogging).\n\nEven though it is a walking simulator, it is well made, as the graphics are very well done, meeting up with the graphics of Skyrim in a sense. The landscape, as i mentioned above, is gorgeous! Not only that, but the sound design (to which I recommend using headphones as this game has super well done sound design, which helps add to the game's atmosphere) is perfect, with natural sounds mixing and blending well with the somewhat peaceful, yet ambient, background of the game itself.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game.

We had to compare it to many definitions that humanity scientists have given about games (which fit both video games and board games, for example) and had to write a short essay about why Dear Esther can be considered a game or not, and what this has to say about those definitions or the game. If this hadn't been the case, I would have written Dear Esther off as simply a weird game that was an experience, but nothing more.\n\nNow that I have to continue thinking about it, trying to add to the scientific discussion, I realise that Dear Esther is so much more than just a game. It worms its way into the game scene and causes many of us to doubt what we consider a video game, and others become angry at this so-called atrocity. But it has everything a game needs: a goal, immersive scenery, a story that needs telling.\n\nThe thing is that, in my opinion, the game just doesn't give a damn whether you enjoy it or not; it simply is what it is. You don't get rewarded for rushing through the game in half an hour to see if the end makes sense. You get rewarded for taking your time, going through it multiple times, scanning everything that you see and hear for clues that may or may not give answers.\n\nYou decide your own reward, because you decide what you do: do you forget about this game, or do you try to figure out what the hell is going on? For some, realisation is reward enough. Others need closure and a credit roll. But this game just doesn't care.

The gamer has no more agency than a cameraman, and even then very few events take place live-- it's mostly just an observation of a world previously inhabited, and a story already lived.\n\nAnyway, whether you'll like it or not, Dear Esther is well worth trying.\n\nThe question of player agency is one that comes up a lot. To what extent we actually control the games we play, as opposed to merely go through the motions the designer set forth for us. But in much the same way that a fighting game focuses on one mechanic to the exclusion of others, Esther manages to home in on the player-as-observer, that cutscene-less methodology of the Half-Lifes and Portals of the world, and in that way, provoke both thought and discussion on the topic.\n\nPlus, those ghosts are amazing.","May 18, 2013","true","4.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While the playthrough is short, the game itself offers an interesting way of story telling. And with that in mind, it is an experience that is quite special. The world itself is stunning and looks well done.\n\nThe music is moving and only adds to the story telling experience. But I would not recommend this game should you not be interested in a short playthrough each time, and do not like the artistic side of games. Because this game is what I'd personally call a work of art. It's a story telling experience and it focuses on this heavily. It offers no gameplay other than exploring the available paths which are rather limited, but still pleasent, and listening to the story which varies each time you play.\n\nThis is definitely an interesting experience. So if that is your cup of tea, then I do recommend giving this game a try, as it is very well done despite being so short.","February 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, it is also incredibly short, and while it's not ridiculously priced, if you suspect you'd prefer to spend your money on a longer game... you might well be right.\n\nOne final note: there is a longish section of the game where the camera angle and moving landscape combined to give me a real world headache, complete with nausea, which has never happened with any other game. It was very notsome, and given the length of time overall it took to play the game (broken up into sittings, because headache)... the headache probably lasted longer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/203810/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","Dear Esther is a remarkable event. Not a game, exactly. More like an interactive tale.\n\nI don't think I'm giving anything away in saying that Dear Esther is not a traditional video game. It is a metaphorical journey, exploring sad themes of loss and regret. Your journey across the island is an evocation of a narrator's reflection on a single tragic event, and how it changed his (or possibly her) life.\n\nThe story is not direct. It took about half of Dear Esther before the pieces began to fall in place for me, and there were many odd bits that I struggled to fit into the overall story. For example, it's not clear that the narration is all from a single person, or if it's the work of more than one person who experienced that same event. There are, I have learned, threads in the Steam forum dedicated to stringing the meaning of every bit of narration together, as if it's a puzzle to be solved. I'm not certain that it is meant to be solved, though. It's complicated, and it's subtle. I browsed those threads a bit after playing Dear Esther, and I was pleased to learn that there is no grand consensus on the meaning of this game.\n\nI suspect that a return trip through the island would make some elements more clear to me, but I am reluctant to take that journey again immediately. The experience of Dear Esther is like a beautifully-wrapped gift: much of the pleasure is derived in opening the package and admiring the craftsmanship; the gift within might not be the best part of the experience.\n\nInstead, I will treat dear Esther like a good book. It goes back on the shelf, and in a few years, I may get the desire to experience it again. Will I learn more in a second playthrough? Probably; I do when I read a good book again. But I've let a week go by before writing this review, and I find in reflection that Dear Esther was a powerful experience for me, and I'm pleased to simply reflect on the experience I've had. For now.\n\nOne more comment: Dear Esther is also, perhaps unintentionally, a testament to the durability of the 10-year old Source engine. The island is beautiful. The vegetation is beautiful. The caves are breathtaking. It only takes an hour (or so) to play Dear Esther, but every moment is wallpaper-worthy. Even if this sort of "game" doesn't appeal to you, the stunning scenery is worth the price of admission.\n","December 6, 2013","true","1.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It is not so much a game in the traditionally understood sense of the word. Rather, Dear Esther is an almost entirely cerebral experience. It works on the player in much the same way a good painting will effect an observer who sees in the art not merely a window looking out on our own world, but that same world slightly altered by the surreal, and thus bringing to light things about ourselves we might not otherwise see. That said, Dear Esther, by it's very poetic nature, is one of the most immediately captivating games I have encountered; I do not believe it should be overlooked simply because it does not conform to the usual way in which people have come to view video games.\n\nOverwhelming is the sense of solitude on this gloomy, desolate Hebridean island. Heavier still is the desperately sorrowful soundtrack, by Jessica Curry. In style, it is similar to film composer Christopher Young's most sparsely written music, and plays as a more effective voice in this introspective journey than does the admittedly potent narrator. I often find game music lacking in its ability to plunge beneath the fabric of a game and tug to light its individual and vibrantly beating heart, but this is a rare instance where such a feat is accomplished. Haunting as any chamber music has ever been, the score to Dear Esther will probe the emptiness within each of us, and get us contemplating questions most prefer to ignore.\n\nThis is a relatively short journey, requiring the gamer to simply progress across the island until they have reached a lone radio mast. There are no decisions to be made, no objects to interact with, and the fragmented narration of the main character plays out as you progress. The epistolary narrative renders the intent of the story in a vague light, like a sequence of events seen through shimmering tears. It is debatable what Dear Esther is actually trying to say (and I believe it to have been done that way intentionally), but anyone willing to open themselves to the voices haunting this Scottish island are certain to draw some very strong conclusions.\n\nTo me, the story deals primarily with unspeakable loss, and how we set ourselves up for even greater heartache (potentially leading even to madness) if God is not our anchor in all things. I, for one, see the issue of personal transcendence (as it is articulated at the end of the game by the main character's leap from the radio tower, who then begins a ghostly flight across the moon-dappled sea, followed by a black fade) to be illustrative not of our ability to achieve such a spiritual shift on our own, but exactly the opposite: There exists within fallen humanity a perpetual, aching cry to be delivered, redeemed--to transcend the shattering effects of our sinful natures.... But humanism cannot accomplish this miracle, nor any form of man-centered religion focusing on personal moral performance or upon the sincerity of their emotions as they are connected to a certain belief system. The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only atonement by which we can be saved from all this death. He is the only peace, the only Truth. The end result of all other efforts at redemption lead only to chilly shadows and vacuous spaces brimming with regret.\n\nHopefully sharing my personal interpretation of Dear Esther does not come across as a clumsy effort to proselytize (if that were the case, I would certainly have given the Gospel in its fullness), but rather illustrates the power and versatility the player can expect to experience by such an unconventional game as this.\n\nFor anyone looking to plunge beneath the surface within themselves as they embark upon the solitary journey to the radio tower, Dear Esther offers surprising treasures that periodically flash their brilliance even years after the experience has ended.","October 28, 2014","true","2.2"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","0"

Dear Esther is...well. The visuals are some of the most gorgeous things I have ever, ever seen in a game. There are certain views, different settings, even just the odd angle that absolutely took my breath away. The story is haunting and powerful, with scenes that were really moving. It's the gameplay that is so difficult to describe with any sort of appeal: there's no way to interact with your environment, no pick up/drop/hit/jump, anything. You can move, and you can swim a bit (really, it's just keeping you on the surface of the water), and that's all. You may wonder how any game can get away with that kind of control scheme, but Dear Esther does. It's a very touching story, and I found the ending powerful.

Accepting that there is not really any actual interaction with the environment (the player is an observer and is not able to manipulate the environment in any way), is manditory in order to step into the narrative.  Once this surrender has been made, the story becomes enveloping.  The soundtrack and visuals are the type that cause you to pause, listen and look around.

Where did the times of escapist games go? I don't remember the squawks of birds singing to my ears as a clear signal of their hostility, a pathological pointer of performances past. Every time I remember that night, the emotions rush back to me, the feeling that I should have done something lacerating the bones of my body.\n\nWhat should I have done?

Many Steam members have problems with Dear Esther - first of all it being a Free Mod and now is $10 on Steam and secondly the fact that this does not play out like a game per se at all.  In reality yes you just move forward and hit "w".  Sometimes (if your like me) you just need a break from all the blockbuster in your face action packed complex games that are available and Dear Esther for me fills that void.\n\nThis interactive story shows off some incredible detail using the Source Engine.  I cranked the detal to all High and it looks sweet, really great scenery and environments.  The lush landscape is great - some of the best grass and water effects I have ever seen.  The textures are vivid and appear so realistic, in the caves portion surfaces look all wet - way cool.  The game comes with an interesting soundtrack that is a good balance and mix for the overall tone.\n\nThere is no sense of direction in the game, you simply explore the somewhat linear path as pieces of the puzzle and narrative are revealed to you.  Again in case your not aware - there is no combat or anything it is a simple exploration story game.\n\nIf your looking for a game to add to your casual game library then Dear Esther is  ✓Recommended for you!","January 16, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But it's not a game.\n\nThat's not a criticism, it's fact. Not a game. Games interact with the player, this does not. It's quite literally a walk-through storybook. There is no interactivity of any kind, no puzzles, nothing to figure out. It has exactly the same level of interactivity as a ride through Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland. You can choose where to walk, but that's almost entirely linear, so you're really only choosing where to look while you're walking there.\n\nThat said, it's still fairly interesting. I went fairly slowly, exploring everything I could, though none of that makes any difference because there's nothing to find. At a slow pace and as indirectly as the game allowed, the entire thing took under 90 minutes from start to finish.\n\nIt was interesting, but at full price ($10) that comes out to more than ten cents per minute... so I'd at least recommend waiting for a big sale.","May 10, 2012","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art and level design are gorgeous, with the caves being some of the most stunning backdrops I've seen in the Source engine.

Rich with grammatic imagery that vivifies the whole story. A nice treat to calm a (burning mind).\n\nBUT.... before you think of "getting" the game. You must ask what type of a gamer are you?\nThe game was more focused on the story, the ambiance, the surroundings and how to make things alive. There's an absence of energetic actions and chaotic wars in this game. Instead, it's a fascinating casual indie game of exploration and adventure. Within the game, you only need your legs, your eyes, hands and perhaps an impulsive mind that often gaze in space and through the foreign stars. Nothing else. The game may be short, but the beautiful short story about a demented deserted man on an island makes the whole of it worthful.  I also couldn't say that "Dear Esther" is a game. I think it's much more suitable to classify it as a "virtual story".\n\nThe game may also disappoint some people, but in return the narrator provides you knowledge of how to write a very descriptive essay or a short story : )\n\nI can recommend this to people who enjoys stories, novels and novellas, who are journalists, writers, day-dreamers and of course indie lovers.","January 25, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It begins with you stood outside an old, dillapidated lighthouse, with a narration in the background as the game fades in. The entire game is narrated, and there are no characters at all to meet or speak to. This may seem like a negative, though it allows for a lot of reflection as you wander around the seemingly empty island. The narration effectively takes you through the story, the past, and explains about the island and it's inhabitants, although you may or may not be playing as the character narrating. Realistically, the ending doesn't even strictly answer the question of whether you are or not.\n\nThe game features a fantastic soundtrack, beautiful and incredibly fitting. The game is almost scary, but never attempts to scare the player.\n\nI feel ultimately, the game is philosophical, and this is why I feel the ending may require a bit of thought. For those that have played the game, you may know what I am talking about. For those that haven't, but wish to, allows keep an open mind; not everything is always as meets the eye.\n\nSo, is the game good? Definitely. Is it worth paying for? Yes, but take disgression; the game is only about an hour or two long, and so if you are looking for an expansive experience, this game is NOT for you. Though if you wish to delve deep into another world, one tailored to be merely admired, then give it a go. Just heed my warning; the game is short.","February 24, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere and narrative were wound perfectly together to create a moving emotional experience that I seldom find in games nowadays. The addition of randomized quotes from the narrator and possibility of seeing different scenes ingame to flesh out the story adds some replayability. However, a single playthrough may be enough for some. I had to sit for a while and just absorb what I'd seen after I finished it. The art and level design are gorgeous, with the caves being some of the most stunning backdrops I've seen in the Source engine. It is very short, coming in at around 2 hours long for a single run, depending on how much you decide to explore, but its haunting and contemplative tone stuck with me long after I finished it.","May 16, 2012","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many Steam members have problems with Dear Esther - first of all it being a Free Mod and now is $10 on Steam and secondly the fact that this does not play out like a game per se at all.  In reality yes you just move forward and hit "w".  Sometimes (if your like me) you just need a break from all the blockbuster in your face action packed complex games that are available and Dear Esther for me fills that void.\n\nThis interactive story shows off some incredible detail using the Source Engine.  I cranked the detal to all High and it looks sweet, really great scenery and environments.  The lush landscape is great - some of the best grass and water effects I have ever seen.  The textures are vivid and appear so realistic, in the caves portion surfaces look all wet - way cool.  The game comes with an interesting soundtrack that is a good balance and mix for the overall tone.\n\nThere is no sense of direction in the game, you simply explore the somewhat linear path as pieces of the puzzle and narrative are revealed to you.  Again in case your not aware - there is no combat or anything it is a simple exploration story game.\n\nIf your looking for a game to add to your casual game library then Dear Esther is  ✓Recommended for you!","January 16, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Its pacing gives the player the freedom to reflect on the subtleties of this extremely nuanced approach to storytelling.\n\nA word of caution: this breaks the mold of what one expects of gaming.

However, there are opportunities for exploration and random elements.\n\nWho is Esther? Who is Donnely? Why are you on an island with old and recent ruins, but no signs of life except butterflies and vegetation? When and why did the seagulls leave? Did you just see something moving across the bay?\n"Dear Esther" probably answers these questions, but if, those answers are wrapped inside riddles of their own. What you do get, however, is an enthralling and haunting journey across and below the island, struggling to piece together the protagonist's cryptic notes to an absent beloved.\n\nThe landscape, only a backdrop in ordinary "games", steps up to present itself unharbored by the things that usually clutter it. For an indie product based on an already outdated engine, the serene scenes rival reality itself (unless you look too close at the ground in front of you)\n\nGetting into this "game" may be difficult, as the first chapter opens with two somewhat long dead ends you may literally run into (though they technically belong to the story in an optional way) but afterwards, the path becomes more linear, and you stop more often to admire the splendid view than to reorientate.\nYou will experience the story, reflect, and maybe come back at a later time to experience it again, in a different way and with a different view.","December 23, 2012","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Within the game, you only need your legs, your eyes, hands and perhaps an impulsive mind that often gaze in space and through the foreign stars. Nothing else.

The story really makes you feel like you are in the game itself, you are the character, you live on that island. The map is somewhat open, although it somehow makes you go a certain path which leads you to always new exciting or somehow sad places that always connect to the storyline in some way. "Dear Esther"'s soundtrack is one art for itself though. It always plays the right calming and chilling music and underlines the storyline perfectly. You may have many questions towards the story like "What is this, I'm used to open worlds and dragons!?"

In this game you are going to be walking around and through an island that is apparently deserted and as you go a story will unfold in front of you.\n\nGraphically this game looks amazing, the atmosphere of the island draws you in and all you want to do is take more steps along the beach, up the path, through the caves, and even in to some of the abandoned structures.\n\nThe music coupled with the music is probably the most haunting thing about the game. Well after the game was over I was left feeling the pull that the two together caused on me. The voice acting was also well crafted. There were secrets and bits of story that made you want to discover all there was about the island.\n\nThe controls are VERY straightforward, use the mouse as your camera, and use WASD to walk.\n\nI don't want to give too much away, but I will tell you this there will be disappointment when you find yourself at the end of the game, and it will be sudden. Part of you will know immediately where this story will end, but you will be able to shrug it off until the final moment. You will learn stories of Esther, Paul, a Hermit, a man named Donnelly, and a herder named Jakobson. You will find that you yearn for more, but the sad reality is this is truly a walk through this island, a story is told, and then the end occurs. You do NOTHING other than walk to the designated spots to trigger the next bit of dialogue. So as good as the experience is, unless you are really really interested in taking a walk through something mysterious, you are going to find the 30 minutes it takes from start to finish is going to leave you in an interesting position.\n\nSo would I recommend this to people? Well I'd say if you are interested in being caught up in imagery and a bit of story, then sure. There's nothing here to really consider this a game, per say, even though you do interact with it, I would have to say its more of an interactive art piece. So if I look at that I have to give this an 8.1 out of 10.","March 25, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is more of an experience. You walk around, have a story told to you in the form of letters, and you basically take that in along with the environment. The only gameplay is you walking around. You literally do nothing else beyond that. But it does not need anything else beyond that. The story is actually more interesting than you'd expect, and the environments look and sound beautiful. Something I have actually done is just turn the game on and stand on a cliff, looking out over the ocean and just listening to the sounds around me. The entire journey is actually very soothing, although your character moves unbearably slow. That can get annoying at times.\n\nThe only true negative I can think of is that the world is not as open as you would hope. There are four chapters: two take place outside during the day, one in a cave, and one outside at night. The latter two chapters don't really offer any way to explore simply because of how those areas are laid out. But the first two seem as though you should be able to go off the beaten path, but more than once if I went too far out of the boundaries, the game picked me up and put me back where it wanted me. It is not a huge deal, but allowing a little more freedom beyond "Go from point A to point B" would have been great.","March 17, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While you walk, the narrator keeps informing you about what happened in the past, while you absorb the landscape's natural beauty and unveil a mystery on an island lost in time and space.\n\nThe game is divided in 4 different chapters of short length. Dear Esther's goal is not to glue you in front of the screen for hours of challenge. It is to make you feel like you are taking part in a story that is narrated according to the letters and at the same time depicted on the effects of your surroundings before your very own eyes.

No, this is an interactive novel or more like an audio book with visuals where you control the pace. The writing is clever and the scenery is beautiful, I like Scottish islands.

The only thing that you know is that your name is Esther, and that someone is reading his letters to you. Playing in first person, you wander around a breathtaking environment, discovering the truth behind the island's infection and the fate of its inhabitants. While you walk, the narrator keeps informing you about what happened in the past, while you absorb the landscape's natural beauty and unveil a mystery on an island lost in time and space.\n\nThe game is divided in 4 different chapters of short length. Dear Esther's goal is not to glue you in front of the screen for hours of challenge. It is to make you feel like you are taking part in a story that is narrated according to the letters and at the same time depicted on the effects of your surroundings before your very own eyes.

My main and really only gripe I had with this game is that you are stuck walking at a very slow pace which sort of diminished my desire/curiosity to explore all areas off of the "main path" without feeling like it was a chore to slowly walk out and back equally as slowly because I'm usually the type to walk around and adire all details put into the environment. Apparently this game also has hidden things for replayability. Also, don't expect this game to be super long.

Dear Esther deserves the praise it has received since its modest beginnings as a F2P Source mod.\n\nMore than one friend recommended this to me yet it was never quite high enough on my backlog of indie titles.  If you have waited on this like me, I urge you to bump it to the top of your list and finish a playthrough - it only takes an hour!  The first few minutes take some getting used to (your character walks slowly, & very little actually happens).\n\nThis really is a glorified walking simulator with none of the conventional objectives or gameplay, so it does challenge the "videogame" definition.  It is a game though, one you should play & finish if you're in a thoughtful mood & looking for new, different, outside the box.  It's strictly exploration based & tells a (partial) story.  Evidently more of that story is unveiled on subsequent playthroughs, but one is enough to put the picture together.\n\nThe visuals are phenomenal given what this is.  The audio is also commendable.  Together they create a couple of quietly stunning moments throughout the hour long stroll.  The atmosphere is impressive for something so minimalistic.  I took a dozen screenshots then decided not to post them, because people should just play it and take in the sights & sounds for themselves.\n\nThe writing was also great; again, I love that the developers decided to go with such a poetic treatment.  My brain enjoyed how the narrator's words initially seem like ramblings but slowly piece together into a kind of sense.\n\nI'm eager to see what else this developer comes up with.  Given their methods, the possibilities for interesting stories seem endless.  I recommend.","November 1, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the end you've got more questions than answers.\n\n++ great narrative\n++ beautiful and atmospheric scenery/visual effects\n++ melodramatic, yet still relaxing soundtrack\n++ no real solution, everyone has it's own theorie of what exactly happend\n++ voice actor fits perfectly in the whole setting\n\n-- linear, missing a few more options or different endings\n-- limited interaction with objects\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"It can only be a dead shepherd who has come to drunk drive you home."\n\n"Dear Esther...", jedesmal wenn ich seine Stimme hörte, lief es mir eiskalt den Rücken runter, im positiven und negativem Sinn. Die meiste Spielzeit versuchst du herauszufinden was passiert ist, wo du bist und wer Esther, die Person die der Erzähler permanent erwähnt, überhaupt ist. Starke Ähnlichkeit zu David Lynch Filmen, wie Mulholland Drive. Einer der besten Walking Simulators die ich je gespielt habe. Die Stimmung ist wenig entspannend/ruhig, wenn du, wie ich, jemand bist der leicht zu erschrecken ist. Am Ende bleiben mehr Fragen als Antworten übrig.\n\n++ großartige Erzählweise\n++ wunderschönes und atmosphärisches Szenario/visuelle Effekte\n++ melodramatischer, dennoch entspannter Soundtrack\n++ keine richtige Auflösung, jeder stellt sich seine eigene Theroie zusammen\n++ Synchronsprecher passt sowohl von der Stimme als auch von der Erzählweise perfekt in das gesamte Setting\n\n-- linear, mir fehlten mehr Möglichkeiten oder mehr/unterschiedliche Enden\n-- eingeschränkte Möglichkeiten was Interaktion oder Untersuchung von Objekten angeht","February 24, 2012","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very well designed environment.\n- Easy and intuitive controls.\n- Though the gameplay is unguided, the way forward often presents itself without too much searching.\n- Unique exploration experience. Many different areas to explore, some more out-of-the-way than others and not necessary for completion.\n\nCons:\n- Movement speed is fairly slow. It can feel tedious if you're not really absorbed in the narrative.\n- Given the psychological and "lonely" nature of the game, there's no action whatsoever besides short cutscenes. Those looking for lots of action with their story may want to look elsewhere.\n- Though the graphics are still decent, they are beginning to look dated.\n- The game has very little replay value as it's a simple narrative story. Completionists may still find extra hours of gameplay looking for all of the different areas to discover and learn more about the narrative.\n\nOverall, it's a very interesting story, though a bit of a one-and-done. I do recommend it, especially if it is ever on sale.","January 25","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's a tough question. I think I would to some people, and I wouldn't to some others.\n\nMy main problem is not the lack of clear objective, or combat, or anything like that, but of interaction. I liked "Gone Home" because it let me interact with the environment and uncover the story of the game at my own pace, and I could miss a bit if I didn't check well. So, even when it was another "walking simulator" it had some sort of gameplay that let me uncover the story. If I just speedrun it I'd end up with a different understanding, more limited, of the story. In the case of "Dear Esther" you can't do that, you walk and a narrator tells you the story, so it just gets triggered at certain points and you can't do anything. You can't interact with the environment or objects. You can't even jump, so if you are in front of a fence, or a tall rock, you can't move forward. It's hard for me to tell if I really enjoyed the game or not, because all the narration is quite cryptic, and I'd dare say pretentious. I didn't feel it was telling me something I had to think about to grasp, but a lot of complicated text thrown together to sound deep.\n\nWhat did strike me was the visuals, and would be the only thing I can say I truly enjoyed about the game.  Walking through those landscapes, the caves, and emerging from the cave at night, with the big moon in the sky and some candles scattered throwout the landscape.... it was really breathtaking.\n\nMy recommendation would be that, if you expect any kind of interaction with anything, you should not buy this game as the only thing you're allowed to do is walk.... and very slowly, by the way.\n\nI'd expect it to be on sale for a very cheap price to try it and enjoy walking through the environment, which, for me, was the most engaging part of the experience.","January 20","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The minimalistic pianomusic and the beautiful graphics stir an eerie feel of being lost in a desolate, deserted environment. As a game, Dear Esther is the sort of interactive medium that transcends the genre. Much like a great David Lynch movie should never be approached the same way one would approach a Star Wars, and is better to be perceived as a piece of art one gets to experience first hand. It hits home on a profound level without feeling the need to comprehend nor to put your finger directly on the heart of the matter. While information is seeping through in a disorderly way, it's only after the first play-through you start to analyse and put things into perspective, There's a reason the final cut scene is followed by a black screen you can only 'escape' from with said key. Still you'll be left with many questions and if you don't want to put hours into figuring it out, I srongly recommend the great youtube analysis on the game's story and events.\n\nFor anyone who might get more thrilled by The Stanley Parable than Assassin's Creed, and prefers a good Kubrick or Lynch over an action packed blockbuster.","January 10","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dear Esther deserves the praise it has received since its modest beginnings as a F2P Source mod.\n\nMore than one friend recommended this to me yet it was never quite high enough on my backlog of indie titles.  If you have waited on this like me, I urge you to bump it to the top of your list and finish a playthrough - it only takes an hour!  The first few minutes take some getting used to (your character walks slowly, & very little actually happens).\n\nThis really is a glorified walking simulator with none of the conventional objectives or gameplay, so it does challenge the "videogame" definition.  It is a game though, one you should play & finish if you're in a thoughtful mood & looking for new, different, outside the box.  It's strictly exploration based & tells a (partial) story.  Evidently more of that story is unveiled on subsequent playthroughs, but one is enough to put the picture together.\n\nThe visuals are phenomenal given what this is.  The audio is also commendable.  Together they create a couple of quietly stunning moments throughout the hour long stroll.  The atmosphere is impressive for something so minimalistic.  I took a dozen screenshots then decided not to post them, because people should just play it and take in the sights & sounds for themselves.\n\nThe writing was also great; again, I love that the developers decided to go with such a poetic treatment.  My brain enjoyed how the narrator's words initially seem like ramblings but slowly piece together into a kind of sense.\n\nI'm eager to see what else this developer comes up with.  Given their methods, the possibilities for interesting stories seem endless.  I recommend.","November 1, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I won't go too deeply into it, because I recommend the curious should follow the grim story themselves, perhaps late at night with the lights turned down and a comforting glass of red.  The gameplay doesn't go on for long, which is appropriate, it's a novella, but the price isn't particularly high, either.\n\nThumbs up for hitting the mark, doing something worthwhile, although I should stress this isn't a game in the classic sense, featuring only limited interaction with the environment.","December 30, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game seems boring. You're a guy walking on an island. No enemies, no challenges, no explosions. However, the game makes it work. You're looking for something: Memories? Esther? Salvation? The atmosphere pulls you in, the music coaxes you along. You have this beautifully rendered island ahead of you, composed of somber hues. The red, blinking eye of a radio tower beckons on the horizon. The sun is setting.\n\nI'll admit, my description probably isn't very compelling, but the game is stunningly beautiful, if you give it a chance. The poetic narrative piques your curiosity. The musical score is both ambient and thoughtful and fits the game perfectly. The voice acting is stellar, and even though certain lines do get wordy, it works. Finally, every playthrough is slightly different. Now, that's probably not enough incentive to get you to play through the game again, but I'm glad I did. Something happened in my second playthrough that made it completely worth it. To be honest, it took my breath away.\n\nHere's my bottom line: 90% recommended\nGameplay: 6/10 - There's not much to the gameplay. After all, you are essentially walking through an incredibly well disguised set of hallways. They are really well disguised though.\nStory: 8/10 - The minimalist storytelling could get frustrating if you're someone who hates BS. You have to let yourself get swept up by the aesthetics of the moment to really get the most out of it. The "bits and pieces" storytelling is neat, though. You almost feel like you're walking through the hallways of your mind, slowly discovering old memories. I gave it an 8 for the artistry.\nGraphics: 9/10 - Some of the most impressive Source engine graphics I've seen yet. They just work.\nSound: 10/10 - The music is definitely one of my favorite parts about the game. It just does its job so well. Additionally, the ambient sounds such as the ocean waves and the wind seem very organic. They're very well done.\nActing: 10/10 - Very convincing. A worse actor would not have been able to pull off the artsy dialogue.\nControls: 10/10 - Simple. WADS to move, mouse to look. It allows you to focus on the game instead of on the buttons.\nGUI/Menus: 10/10 - Unobtrusive, elegant.

Boasts glorious graphics. And a fantastic sound design.\n\nSo is the game perfect? No, no game is perfect. The problem with Dear Esther is that it's genre is "first person experiment/art". It's not that experimental. It didn't change the way games are played. It didn't even go as far as trying to emulate Myst, which is what I first thought of when I heard about this game being about a character stranded on a mysterious island. But is he actually stranded?\n\nWell. The game is certainly mysterious, but the island is not. It's the player character who traverses across the island to reach the radio tower's mast. And while doing so, sees candles already lit, beautiful caverns, painted stones and hallucinates an accident on a UK highway. There were a few times when I asked myself, "Is this a dream?"\n\nFrom what you gather from the narrations, which are usually different each playthrough, is that the main narrator was in a car accident and his wife, presumably Esther, died. The context is slim, but you gather this much from the narration and the objects laid out across the island, like car parts, white paint cans, tires, letters, and abandoned boats.\n\nIf I could call the game one word, it would be surreal, because it certainly doesn't abode as right. For the man supposed washed ashore this island following an accident on the mainland. That's surreal and unlikely.\n\nBut it's sure as ♥♥♥♥ interesting and makes you wonder why the devs went with this game design and ploy. I liked it for what it is, mysterious and warranting a second playthrough based on the wonderful narrative.\n\n8.0/10","June 21, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was very glad that I did. Dear Esther is a short, but extremely well done experience perhaps best compared to a vaguely written, but atmospheric short story. The visuals have retained all of their original beauty and the voice acting tells the story quite well. The pacing and pathing through the environment allowed me to ponder each portion of the story and the environment always made sense with what was happening or what had happened. I enjoyed the ending as well which if you are like me, may cause you to check the internet to make sure that your copy of the game isn't broken. Don't worry. It isn't. The ending is intentional and a smart change to the standard formula.

In the vein of walking simulator type experiences, Dear Esther keeps you strictly confined to a set path; without the ability to jump, interact with items, and so forth. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the narration absorbing, and the hauntingly beautiful score spectacular. Dear Esther's story unfolds within the protagonists mind, which after a life altering event is left reeling in limbo. The narrative is the progressive element to the story, with the terrain (visuals), reacting and representing concepts accordingly. Dear Esther is a truly beautiful and emotional experience, and although incredibly short, praise must be given to it's clearly very passionate developers.","August 15, 2012","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although that may be it only lasting all of 40 minutes from start to finish. This isn’t a bad thing as the game does so much in its short time with the colors and amount of detail in each of the four sections throughout the island of Dear Esther giving this sense of wonder and mystery that is well accompanied by the sound design and haunting music all going towards creating this immersive and serene experience.  Its like that moment you have when you're just sitting there looking at or listening to the ocean, a thunder storm or whatever you find relaxing and it just recreates that moment of you have of peace but for an extended period of time, as a “Walking simulator” on this artful island with a story that is, well, forgettable compared to the rest of the game. It doesn’t detract from the experience it supposed to keep it moving forward but for me it was my interest in the island and what was waiting in the next few steps. The presentation of the games graphics and sound design is what made it for me but the story was just an afterthought and I find myself thinking more of the wonderful architecture to Dear Esther rather than the ending or the bits of narration leading up to it.","March 20, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The music and poetic narrative of the trailer immediately caught my attention. The description of the game also spoke about "random" elements which greatly intrigued me. However closer to release I became less and less interested. I can't exactly remember why this was, maybe another game occupied my thoughts or I wasn't ready to pay the £6.99 for a game that took about 60 minutes to finish. Having only just played and completed Dear Esther for the first time it's a shame I lost interest and didn't purchase when it came out in February 2012.\n\nI won't get into the argument about whether Dear Esther is a game or not, I want to leave that to angry people on the internet. I will simply talk about what I thought.\n\nFive minutes in, the poetic narrative brimming with metaphors (and numerous other poetical devices) tells me I shouldn't follow the narrative too closely. For if I were to try and understand every word I would only get confused and muddled. Each paragraph of narration is somewhat like a standalone poem and only with all of them put together can you actually patch a story together. This works nicely as you can still enjoy the narrative as standalone pieces if you don't understand or miss the previous paragraph.\n\nThat said I'm pretty sure the story of Dear Esther is purposely vague and confusing, designed partly for the sake of speculation and discussion. For some this could be frustrating as you aren't really supposed to understand anything clearly in the first few play-throughs. That doesn't mean you don't get anything out of the first play-through, but Dear Esther is definitely better suited to those very fond of analyzing the deeper meaning of literature and poems. After going through Dear Esther twice many aspects of the story still remain confusing but that's why I like it. There is a great element of mystery about the island, some details of which I will never understand. I adore that, but like I said earlier, others will find the lack of detail annoying.\n\nWhile there may be a lack of detail in the story, it would be a crime to say the same for the look of Dear Esther. The texture quality is disappointingly low but like a painting, standing back and looking at everything at once is breathtaking. The environment feels eerily natural, there were times I could swear I wasn't looking at a computer screen. The level design is clever too, it gives the illusion of wide open spaces and many possibilities while in reality being very linear. Not to mention the final area sent shivers down my spine continuously for longer than I've ever experienced.\n\nDefinitely not for everyone, but well worth a try if you're interested.\n\nI give Dear Esther a "Looks pretty damn good and brought a tear to my eye, out of 10".\n\nOriginally written for my blog over at: http://d-facegames.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/my-thunks-dear-esther.html","February 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As the game's protagonist sets foot onto a deserted island, he starts the game's morose, floridly allegorical narrative with the titular words, "Dear Esther". This letter written to Esther contains a rich story whose open-to-interpretation-type narrative makes multiple playthroughs of Dear Esther equally lurid and enlightening, despite the game's somewhat tedious gameplay elements. When paired with Dear Esther's ethereal environment, this narrative creates a deeply mournful and intriguing walking simulator.\n\nThe player's journey up the island begins in the day time, beneath ominously gathered clouds and amid rolling hills of withered plantlife. The atmosphere of Dear Esther is filled with tragic elements that add to the story's themes of suffering and grief. During the first half of the journey, the player will pass by grounded ships and abandoned cottages. As the game continues on, the day will grow darker and soon you're plunged into the fantastical darkness of a cave that is illuminated by the rising moon and studded with chemically inspired, glow-in-the-dark paintings and lines of scripture. The environment of Dear Esther grows stormier and more otherworldly as it approaches the climax of the game.\n\nThe astounding scenery of Dear Esther is paired with frequent pieces of narration from the story's main character. The character's letter to Esther is one filled with metaphors that will depict incredibly abstract images while instilling terrifically tangible emotions in the player. The style of the letter swings between a solemn sadness and a bitter rage, and often the contents of the letter are vague and disjointed—almost as if there are multiple letters and the player is only getting pieces of each one. Each sections of the letter unveils another piece of the story behind your character's climb to the beacon, while leaving enough room for you to speculate about some of the game's more ambiguous plot points.\n\nCompleting more playthroughs of Dear Esther reveals more pieces of the game's shadowy plot; each piece of dialogue the player receives is one of many potential speeches delivered by a supurb voice actor. Untangling the mystery of Dear Esther's story is a slow and thoughtful journey that, with a little bit of patience, could leave you thinking about this game in moments when you least expect it. Dear Esther's literature quality writing and thought-provoking style of gameplay earns it a steady recommendation from me.","September 24, 2014","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bengt1/recommended/203810/","bengt1","Bengt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bengt1/","104 products in account","A full three seconds into watching the trailer, I determined I would perchase the work of art that is Dear Esther.\nThe music of the trailer sets such a mood for the experience that unfolds, it is hard to imagine a game begining this good to be capable of stumbling in execution. And the product does not disapoint. The enviroment is exelent, as it must be to fill the void  left by any form of "gameplay" in this work of artistic sotrytelling.\n\nAnd Dear Esther must be clasified more generally than a game as a "work of art". To call it a game is missleading; a game is filled with game concerns, traps, puzzles, obstacles, and oponnents, and Dear Esther has only the obstecle of your enviroment, an obstecle which you have no ability to overcome, having not even the ability to jump. If you come looking for a game, you will be disapointed.\n\nAnd yet it is this simplicity of presentation that gives Dear Esther its most poignent value; it diverts, if you will let it, your attention from "finding the right soloution" to "finding your own path to follow". It confuses the audience at first, as you atempt to find the correct way to an assumed goal and realize that all the paths lead to the same destination. For example, whenever the game presents the audience with a new enviroment or vista, there is allways a rather obvious main path and several more or less secluded side paths. These will either eventuallly set the audience back on track or abruply dead end, often with a unique dialouge log at the end. But when one turns around in slight fustration that you will have to retrace the same path to get back on track, you realize that there is a second path back, diverging off in a different direction with new a new route to the eventual ending. Level design is Dear Esthers strongest virtue when judged as a "game", containing excelent and intuative, if slightly constaining, paths to the eventual goal.\n\nAnd this constriction is fine in a long and winding journey. Consider the Half Life series. When compared with an open world enviroment, the levels of Half Life are terribly constricting in their layout. They are intricate, but they are constrained to be mostly linear. The games overall, though, do not suffer from this lack of expansivene options becaues of their extensive length. The alternitive form is to have a shorter direct story but a larger and much more open world to tell it in, as games like Skyrim do.\n\nDear Esther, though suffers on it's first playthrough becaues of its length. The game is over far too quickly, leaving the audience with the feeling that it might have done so much more with the world it set up. It is almost fustrating to think about how much bigger the game could have been, how much more could have been explored and experienced, how much longer the game might have been.\n\nTo understand this feeling, consider the construction of the Stanley Parable. Dear Esther shares many charachteristics with that more popular title, Nonlinear sotrytelling, a seemingly short storry on fist playthrough, and an omnicient narrator talking to a powerless player. The differences lie in the execution of each. The Stanley Parable focuses on the concept of choice, of free will, on examining through repeated playthroughs the nature and impacts of choices the player makes. Dear Esther is a game wholy absorbed in it's story, in atempting to pice together the charachter of the narrator, or even if the narrator is only a single person. Over it's short playtime one constantly rediscovers the core of the game, which evolves rapidly as the story progresses. Many complain of the game being too long and borring, but I think it suffers from just the oposite. It is incrediably short if played straight through, leaving you with almost a sense of disapointment that you did not get more out of it, just as when you play the Stanley Parable following all the narrators instructions for the "happy" ending. To truely enjoy Dear Esther, leave no path unexpored, no audio log unheard, and play again\n\nBut while the Stanley Parable is comic, Dear Esther is dramatic, which is a great deal of why many dislike the game for being "slow". It is the same reson many dislike 2001: A Space Odyssey for being "slow"; you must look harder to discover the meaning. In the same way that for some the ending the 2001 is "disapointing" for being anticlimactic after the buildup of the last part of the movie, so is the end of Dear Esther "disapointing", for the most profound part of each is the jouney, not the destination.\n\nIt is incredible to jouney through Dear Esther, and while you may be left wanting something more than the game provides, what it does provide it does exceptionally well. And prehaps this supports one of the many ideas the game hopes to imbune, that there is nothing more to tell of the narrator's storry, for there will always be mysteries that cannot be unraveld.\n\nAfter the game's ending, which is as suprising as everything else in the jouney you have been on, the game fades to black with the sounds of the sea, looping ever onwards, leaving the player to think about the voyage they have been on, and eventually realize that now they must press escape, select exit, and leave the world of the game for their everyday lives.\n\nIn short, If you want a darker, more dramatic Stanley Parable, then this game is for you. If you appriciate ambiguity in your art, this game is for you. If you are interested in level design and game story telling, this game is for you. As long as you do not expect a game with gameplay concerns, and instead are content with an exceptional story of the struggles of the human mind told in a modern visual poem, this game is for you.","January 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game tells a confused and chilling story amidst the Hebridean Isles. The graphics are amazing and beautiful, the soundtrack is really quite good too. The story, however, for the price of £6.99, falls short.\n\nThe game has little to no replayability. I'm told by my friend Zoey that you can replay the game to unlock additional "narratives", but this, at best, is flavour. By the end of the game you "get" the story. I rather enjoyed it. However, I feel that if I had paid full price (and not picked it up in the Summer Sale for £1.75) I would be greatly disappointed.\n\nDon't go into this "game" expecting a game. It's more like an interactive novel. It wont provide you with action and guns and girls, but it will provide you with a unique little story, told in a desolate and beautiful landscape. Worth checking out; if it's on sale.\n\n-Nilesy","July 28, 2012","true","1.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/203810/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","A pretty stroll around an island, intersected at times with semi-random narration vaguely fleshing out your situation (which may change slightly each playthrough).\n\nIt is decisively not funny. When you get down to the story, it's rather angsty if not outright depressive. Art at its finest, eh?\n\nI'm somewhat on the fence with this title. In real life I certainly enjoy solitary walks in an unfamiliar area, especially if it's nature oriented rather than industrialized, surrendering to my thoughts. And in video games I often enjoy dropping main storyline to just mess around and explore, if given game lends itself to it at all. But there's always a choice in the matter and other things to do as well along the way, not just sightseeing and meditating.\n\nWhereas Dear Esther is pretty much only the latter. A virtual piece of art, painting/installation with smidgens of verbal narrative, but with zero interaction other than just walking around, pressing forward to push story a bit, see more, and get mind screwed. Even flashlight turns on automatically. It's painting in the medium of video games, but itself is not really a video game at all.\n\nIn the end I'd still recommend it, just to experience something different, but if you're not feeling particularly artsy you likely aren't going to enjoy it on any level. However, I am certainly looking forward to reliving it once VR becomes a thing, as this title lends itself perfectly to the whole notion.

For reference I enjoy exploration games and am more than familiar with the world of fine art and have a very high threshold for "artsy" things in general. I'm convinced that the only reason why this game got good reviews from so many people is because it's obtuse enough that they figured it must make them seem smart to say they liked it.\n\nThe main character moves painfully slowly which wouldn't be an issue if the environment were more enjoyable. The addition of random statements that do not tie in with the environment actually take away from the game. Most of it seems like someone came up with some interesting looking areas and some cryptic statements and decided that throwing them together at random would be a lovely idea for a game. Every so often the statements will line up with the environment and there's a moment of clarity about what is going on. Unfortunately those moments of clarity were not interesting enough to make me care in the slightest what was going on.\n\nI think I would have enjoyed this slightly more if no one had tried to tell me it was good first. That and if the bits of dialogue were not randomized in an attempt to make it different or if they were written so that it pieced together better regardless of order. There are ways of making your audience work that are effective and enjoyable, this game doesn't use any of them.","December 28, 2013","false","1.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

There are no objective markers, no text prompts, no intrusive and hideous HUD to obscure your view of the world. Exploring the nooks and crannies of the surrounding area occasionally prompts random statements from your character. In these letters are few of the Island's former inhabitants are referenced repeatedly. There are also several themes that emerge from these excerpts and astute players will notice those themes reflected in the environment. A glowing red beacon on top of a radio tower is almost always present and, like a moth to a flame, is compels you to seek it out. Paths split and merge around the island and it's easy to find your way forward.\n\nThis set up wouldn't be engrossing for very long if it wasn't for the visuals. Dear Ester benefits from an excellent graphical presentation and art direction. Textures are rich, dust picks up, leaves blow around, the foliage is dense, and landmarks dot an otherwise open landscape. Warm candle glow contrasts with cool night skies and somehow Dear Esther manages to make caves, often the most drab environments found in games, rather breath taking. Rock walls are scrawled on with luminescent goo, and the rocks form awesome structures with stalactites and stalagmites jutting from the bedrock forming nefarious teeth. Rivers flow through the cave's interior terminating in grand waterfalls. It is perhaps here that the game's setting can be most clearly seen as a metaphor.\n\nTo deride Dear Esther for it's lack of actual gameplay is to remain oblivious to it's excellent adaptation of literary devices to tell a simple interactive story. It's a story that places you not just in the shoes of the protagonist but in his mind and soul. Its an introspective tale which is remarkably rare for a video game. To discuss any more of the plot would undermine the experience and the mystery. Allegory, allusions and metaphors are all present. Dear Esther explores new territory for narrative in an interactive media. With it's lack of a defined structure and a devilish desire not to be too explicit with its plot points Dear Esther's yarn will displease some an accusations of pretension will likely ensue.\n\nThere have been games in the past with exquisite narratives and there have been games that have extraordinary gameplay and mechanics. The biggest challenge is getting these two aspects of a game to work together harmoniously—to have game mechanics that fit into narrative themes. Mechanics and gameplay elements that reflect the subtext of the narrative itself. In many games story and gameplay exist in almost separate bubbles. Actual narrative often bookends levels and takes a backseat while the player controls their character. It's an antiquated formula that only a handful of games seem to have shaken.\n\nThe way The Chinese Room engages the player without traditional mechanics is through simple exploration. By making discoveries in the world you are treated to a bit of exposition. Symbols, diagrams, and writings can be found in the world to reflect elements of the exposition. A book or film could never deliver the level of immersion that Dear Esther offers. The experience only works because the player can choose to see or not to see things in the environment. The ability for the player to set the pace of the story and be given the opportunity to discover the details makes Dear Esther work.\n\nDear Esther has had a remarkable journey from Half Life 2 mod to independent release. It's an exercise in adapting literary conventions to an interactive experience and it's an exercise worth taking part in. The excellent soundtrack and visuals hold your attention while the plot takes shape. The conclusions will stick with you long after the hour and a half it takes to see it through and it's likely that you will want to revisit Dear Esther to soak in it's finer points.","November 25, 2013","true","1.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","A game taking place on a deserted, dismal Hebridean island, housing a peculiar, unobtrusive wandering, promptly sounds like the concept of an experiment. Given the complete absence of interaction between the player and the game, as the nameless player's protagonist without visual identification strolls through the mist, while the release of random sound recordings of letters read out loud to a woman named Esther, it is indeed in fact an experiment. The identity of the woman is unclear, as is the relationship between the two of you; however, as you progress through the windblown beaches, the moors, the deep caves as well as the lighthouse - towards the peak of the island - detached diary notes depict the outlines of a tragic accident, and a ghostly tale appears.\n\nThe story of Dear Esther is utterly obscure and abstract. Cryptic biblical quotation is occasionally displayed on the surroundings, and out of the sound recordings the history of the island surface, along with the hints of a freeway, the disclosure of a fatal car crash, and three personalities; a shepherd with syphilis, an explorer whose infected wounds made him mad, and a broken man with guilt involving the mentioned car accident. However, the dividing line between them becomes blurred, and depending on how you interpret the course of the events, they may ultimately not be three different individuals.\n\nConsidering the game (or not-game) strongly emphasizes the suggestive approach, excluding any specific details and concrete clues, I hardly see it as a puzzle to be pieced together. Through the looking glass, I believe Dear Esther is neither a search for an answer, nor even for a meaning, but an experiment with the senses and emotions. It is a lonely, guilt-stricken journey through morbidly beautiful emptiness; an emotive smorgasbord of sight, sound, implication and metaphor, aimed to generate a feeling of purposeful despair. The world is quiet, uneventful and subdued, the atmosphere isolated and melancholic, and one chapter in particular - namely the cave - might be the most strikingly beautiful achievement ever presented on a monitor.\n\nThe only interaction Dear Esther provides is to look at it, to experience it. To react to what my own mind evokes in response by the emotional implications and occurring subtlety, not to on-screen prompts or physical reflexes. It is a lonely, slow 90-minute walk of purgatory dealing with sorrow, loss, shame, faith and sickness, but also love, hope and atonement. One look at the washed-out hillside, the empty and devastated houses, the constant twinkle of a distant radio mast, and the harrowingly lack of any other life whatsoever (except an eerie silhouette along the horizon and the occasional bird) tells me, however, almost all I need to know; the night slowly falls, and it falls with a sinister reason. The approaching call to that perceptible, mystery mast is inevitable.\n\nIt is a simulator of subconscious introspection that pretty much can be associated with walking along an empty road along the coast at night and where your mind went at that time. But at the end of the day, Dear Esther doesn't need to tell me anything, nor does it really attempt to, despite the minimalistic events that is self-evident enough through implication alone; it only needs to make me feel something, and indeed it does. The meaning I create for myself, both early on and during the resolution, is more than that could ever be - yet it is nothing concrete or even describable. The devoid of clarity is strangely enough satisfying.\n\nRobert Briscoe's uncompromising game design combined with the dark, sensitive tones of composer Jessica Curry's rewritten soundtrack of haunting strings and piano, the island's quiet ambience and underlying emotional depth has the qualifications to profundly affecting the player. Game scientist and lecturer Dan Pinchbeck, who originally created the game back in 2008, has proved that violence and puzzles and logic are not necessarily required. The narrative alone can be just as essential.\n\n8.5 / 10","November 30, 2013","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The second kind (which is the worst) is when the game keeps feeding you hope that it'll be better if you played it just a little bit more but you eventually discover that its crappy like Dear Esther.\nThis game doesn't have a real good graphics like The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter and you only need WASD to move really really slow and you can't sprint which is really stupid knowing that there are plenty of space to walk through for example you reach a crossroad and you decide to take the left road and after 5 minutes of walking and listening to stupid narration you reach a dead end and you have to get back exactly from where you came but without the narration.\nI payed 2.99$ for it which is the minimum amount of money the lazy developers should pay people to play this game in fact this game should be used for torturing terrorists and even if you did that and they managed to stay alive until they finish the game you will feel sorry for them for playing it and give them a hug.\nAt the end I'd like to say that I have never gave a game a bad review before but Dear Esther is way worse than just bad; it's the worst game I've ever played and it is the reason why I wish that one day steam users can permanently delete a game from their account and get rid of the shame of playing it.

The narrator is completely unhelpful when you're trying to figure out where to go next, and this self-guided tour is starting to feel pretty oppressive. I find myself desperately wanting to leave this abandoned beach.\n\nFirst-person exploration games are probably not for me, but if they're your cup of tea, it might be worthwhile to try this. If you're got an eye for detail and enjoy analyzing your environment to help supplement/piece together a storyline, maybe this is for you. As for me, I think I need more direction and structure in my games...","December 22, 2013","false","4.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Dear Esther isn't much of a game, it's more like reliving a painful school trip where your legs hurt like ♥♥♥♥, the guide was a boring ♥♥♥♥, the teacher wouldn't stop asking questions and your crush didn't show.\nMany people will say this game is beautiful. Many people will say the voice acting and the writing is superb. Many people have incurably bad taste.\nWhile some of the visuals in this game are alright, it's nothing special. There are a lot of indie games that do a far better job of establishing an atmosphere. Hell, if you want to look at pretty ♥♥♥♥, you're better off jerking your eyes over a modded TES than this thing.\nOn to the story and the writing -- it's ♥♥♥♥ing drivel. There's nothing enjoyable in the monotone voice acting, nor in the workaday lines being read. Whatever they tried to accomplish, it failed; quite miserably.\nThe two monumental issues that plague this game however, are its linearity and the speed of progression. For the most part, you're stuck trudging down the same track like a ♥♥♥♥♥. That wouldn't be so positively mind-blastingly painful if you weren't forced to walk at the same ♥♥♥♥ing speed throughout the entire game. I mean even using the word 'speed' in this paragraph seems wrong, it's like roleplaying a ♥♥♥♥ing slug caught in some lab experiment while your edgy teenage owner is practicing his reciting for the drama course.\nPlease, kill me.

It is very unorthodox.\n\nIt has no enemies, no other characters, no items, no object interaction at all. All you do is walk and explore as the back story unfolds through often dreamy monologues.\nBut therein lies its strength. It really does try something different, and it pays off.\n\nIt really is beautiful. It's a couple of years old now, but if you crank the settings up to full it really shines. This is due in large part to the actual art direction and creation of the island setting. It looks very natural with no copy and paste going on and it all takes place in dusk or night time so it looks moody and washed out.\nSeriously, take time to look around at the scenery.\n\nThe sound is completely perfect and enhances the experience no-end.\nThe musical score is haunting and perfectly timed to coincide with epic scenery or other happenings. The narrator (the only voice in the 'game') does an excellent job as well.\n\nIt's a strange thing that a game in which you do so little can have such an impact, but that really is the case for me.\nThis game is as beautiful/haunting/mysterious as it is unorthodox.\nIt won't be for everyone, but if you are open to something different, put those headphones on, turn out the lights and go for a walk :-)","November 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

If for some reason you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and plan to play it, I guess I should warn you that there are spoilers ahead.\n\nThis game is such boring, pretentious, fart-sniffing crap that I have difficulty organizing my thoughts about it. Anyone who tells you that this game is creative, revolutionary, ground-breaking, or "worth playing at least once" is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ who you should probably avoid talking to ever again. The visuals are bland and repetitive, as there isn't much on the island, and the graphics are dated (think HL2 on medium). There's no real story, unless you count the ramblings of a depressed british guy. Apparently the VO is semi-random, but never changes enough to lend the game any replay value (an impossible feat anyway, since the game has no value in the first place). As you progress through the game, it may or may not be vaguely hinted at that the depressed british guy is upset about his girlfriend having been killed by a drunk driver. In the end you kill yourself by jumping off of a radio tower. In true fart-sniffing form, just before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character does the world a favor by pancaking at terminal velocity, he turns into a bird and soars away (?!?!?!) as the music gets all dramatic and the credits roll. It's never really clear if you are the depressed british guy or what (does he just walk around this crappy island muttering to himself? Is he a voice in my head? Was he a bird all along? If so, why doesn't he just fly to the radio tower instead of wasting 2 hours walking there?). Honestly, the biggest problem this game is that it isn't really a game. The ONLY story progression occurs in the form of your character TALKING TO HIMSELF, the actions the player performs are boring, and don't contribute to, or in any way seem to relate to the actual story, which might as well just be a radio show since it's all told in voice-over as you hold the "progress" button until the game ends.  This game so completely misses the point (pick any point, it misses them all) that, like Star Wars Episode 1, I don't even know where to start telling anyone how seriously awful it is.","December 6, 2013","false","1.8"," 47 of 93 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","47","93","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/recommended/203810/","ViperMSK","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/","218 products in account","Dear Esther is a first-person ghost story. Rather than traditional game-play the focus here is on exploration, uncovering the mystery of a lonely island, of who you are and why you are here. Fragments of story are randomly uncovered when exploring the various locations of the island, making every each journey a unique experience.\n\nDear Esther is an auditory and visual experience that interweaves a consuming narrative and array of emotions. The game's actual value must not be solely based upon its gameplay length, but rather on the random elements and new secrets discovered through multiple playthroughs. Those that brave the journey into the narrative and world of Dear Esther will discover an experience that few games have been available to accomplish in years. Highly recommended.\n\nDear Esther completely changes the language in which we communicate with a videogame; it is an interactive experience whose notion of interactivity demands much more from the players than they are used to.\n\nDear Esther is a peculiar game. With its beautiful landscapes and script, some people could find it a great experience, others could hate the lack of interaction and the plain gameplay. One of the most haunting and well-executed titles of this or any other generation.\n\nMysterious, poetical and full of atmosphere – Dear Esther is as magical as a short story from Ray Bradbury. The creative way of storytelling fascinated me from the very first moment.","July 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having played and liked Gone Home, I thought it might be a similar kind of atmospheric game. But read some reviews where people called it boring and pointless. I'm into this kind of artsy stuff but to a certain limit only! At the point when art starts to become self-indulgent I get put off, be it films, books or games. So basically, was on the fence about buying it and finally couldn't resist picking it up for very cheap as part of a Humble Bundle.\n\nDear Esther had been sitting in my library for a while now. I had a few hours to kill today so finally decided to check it out. First 10-15 mins, I was like "Uhh...this is going to be a little boring. Where do I have to go? There are so many paths and routes. Is there any marker or any maps to show me the way? Do I just stare at the vast ocean and the foliage throughout the game? This is confusing!" I have to admit that initially I was beginning to see what all those bad reviews by gamers meant about it being just a walking simulator.\n\nEven so, an hour later I found myself still playing and completely in awe of the game's atmosphere especially the gorgeous cave section. And the music...oh god, the music is mindblowing! I think its the music that really sets the mood for this game. In fact, its not really a game in my opinion...its a journey...a piece of interactive art. If you go in expecting to play a game...you will hate it! But if you let yourself be taken in by the environment its trying to create for you...you will have a mesmerising experience.\n\nI simply cant get that hauntingly beautiful soundtrack out of my head. And the part where you fall into the water and see images of a motorway and a couple of cars...that part blew my mind! Everything is just done so well. The detailing, the character building, the lighting, the environments...its pure art!\n\nBottomline, I know many people thought of it as pointless and a waste of time - but I really enjoyed it. I would like to try out some similar stuff and am open to recommendations. The Stanley Parable is next on my list...that demo I played was just fantastic!","June 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Letters stained in brilliant lines by the love poured over them from a man in grief.\nDear Esther is a very slow burning story that many people would easily find to be dreadfully boring. But in the same length of time in which you could watch a feature length film, you can simply wander through overgrown paths on an island and traverse the gorgeous caves beneath. The scenery is stunning but empty except for some cryptic clues; equally as cryptic as the haunting narration that accompanies them.\nRarely have I cared so much to understand an allegorical story. and never have I come out of one with at least three distinct theories as to its meaning, narrative, past, and conclusion. However, the most unfortunate aspect of trying to delve in to the deepest parts of the story is the inevitable realization that, unknowable details aside, the circumstances of the events are not very interesting; they just tug at a few emotional strings.\nOne of the few things that sets Dear Esther apart from Proteus is the fact that there is a story and there are actually some things on the deserted island that garner attention.","November 25, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was hoping that it would more of an emotional type of game, but I just didn't feel anything there.  I personally thought that I'm more of a sensitive type of person, that I can be emotional if I let myself to be.  Perhaps my heart was made of stone the day I played this game(or maybe I should have played the game with lights off,  and with some wine and scented candles, then maybe...just maybe...I might like this game.)\n\nI can tell that the developer focused all the effort in the writing/narration, game environment and the presentation of the game.  I admit that the writing of it is beautiful, combined with as beautiful game environment. However, I felt that the game is trying too hard to be poetic or artistic.  And in my humble opinion, I think it was a bit too pretentious.  In fact, I don't think I have play any other game that actually made me feel this way.\n\nOne of the other things that I didn't like about this game is that there is no instant or manual save option. I understand that this type of game is best to be played in one sitting, but it is still nice to have that option.  The first time I played this game, I played about 20 minutes. I got to a different area in the game, it was after the loading screen; and I had to stop playing the game, thought that it had auto-save. But it didn't auto-save, so I had to play the game from the beginning again.  So the next and last time I played this game, I had this constant unpleasant feeling behind the back of my mind, wondering when this game is going to end, and hoping that it would end sooner; because I sure don't feel like starting the game all over again.\n\nThere are only a few things that I like about this game.  I like the atmosphere of the game; I enjoyed walking around the seaside, cave...etc.  Some people complained about the walking speed being too slow, but I thought that the speed is just fine for me. I also like the soundtrack, suits the game very well.  For a first person POV game, it was a good thing that they  actually added controller support, that's another minor thing that I appreciate.\n\nAll I can say is that this game is still a good enough experience for me.  So, l won't say that I want that couple hours of my life back; but overall, I won't say that I recommend this to everyone.","January 7, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Letters stained in brilliant lines by the love poured over them from a man in grief.\nDear Esther is a very slow burning story that many people would easily find to be dreadfully boring. But in the same length of time in which you could watch a feature length film, you can simply wander through overgrown paths on an island and traverse the gorgeous caves beneath. The scenery is stunning but empty except for some cryptic clues; equally as cryptic as the haunting narration that accompanies them.\nRarely have I cared so much to understand an allegorical story. and never have I come out of one with at least three distinct theories as to its meaning, narrative, past, and conclusion. However, the most unfortunate aspect of trying to delve in to the deepest parts of the story is the inevitable realization that, unknowable details aside, the circumstances of the events are not very interesting; they just tug at a few emotional strings.\nOne of the few things that sets Dear Esther apart from Proteus is the fact that there is a story and there are actually some things on the deserted island that garner attention.","November 25, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When he looked and realized it was only two pages long, he decided to make it seem longer by dispersing two paragraphs at a time while you walk across a hill. The characters are nothing more than names, there is no emotion to speak of, and the mystery is answered by another mystery- why you even played the game at all.

Dear Esther is more like a form of slow and very intentional interactive art, akin to viewing a captivating painting where you're suddenly allowed to step inside the frame and experience the scene in its entirity as you desire rather than be confined to just one perspective. The story is conveyed in fractured pieces of spoken memory of old letters - or possible delusion - and left to the player to construct for themselves as different readings are presented at specific points along your journey, the semi-random nature of these readings meaning multiple playthroughs are required for them to be fully imparted to you. Touching and visually captivating in equal measure, Dear Esther is a brief yet nonetheless poignant example of how the medium of gaming is more than capable of producing beautiful and contemplative works that can provoke great emotion, backed by a strong musical score setting the perfect wistful tones to accompany the bleak isolation and inward reflection of the journey. If you have the interest and willingness to explore such things then this will reward you greatly.","November 26, 2013","true","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The lack of any sort of interaction at all is tiring - at least let me pick up an object and turn it in my hands, even if it is meaningless. There are other games that do this better - try Gone Home instead.","January 1, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I started the game at midnight and finishing it just after 2am, yes I'm aware that that is a lot longer than most people took to finish this, but I walked around and tried to explore as much as I could. The graphics are pretty fantastic and the sound and music and lighting adds so much to the experience. This is a story driven game, and yet it is all up to you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxanQualta/recommended/203810/","LuxanQualta","LuxanQualta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxanQualta/","114 products in account","Dear Esther is more of an experience than a game.  And that experience is one where you will need to peel the onion to see what lurks below the surface.  The experience is rich in layers of perception and one which varies from player to player and even for the same player, if he or she repeats any of the chapters of Dear Esther.\n\nUsually in a game we would expect some combination of:\n\n* A set of rules\n* Interactions with NPC's or other players\n* The ability to interact with the environment; e.g. pick up stuff, move things, shoot things, etc.\n* Quests\n* Achievements\n* In-Game Rewards\n\nYou won't find any of that in Dear Esther, at least not in the way you might expect, if at all.  Rather in Dear Esther you can only move along some fairly well defined paths using directional controls.  With a controller, the left stick is directional for  movement and the right stick is directional for view.  That's it. You can't pick up an item to examine it.  There is no interaction with any other player or any NPC's.  The only quest would be your exploration of the location following a linear path where certain points trigger narrator readings of text  in what is presumably meant to be letters to Esther, who may or not be real and who you never meet and who you suspect is dead, if she lived at all.\n\nSo if this isn't a game, what kind of gamer would want to fire up Dear Esther and wander around to see what there is to offer in the virtual environment?   I suspect that there isn't any one personality type that one would have to be to enjoy this, but it would appeal most to a person given to introspection, who likes to patiently collect clues and peel them away to try to uncover the real story and not be particularly upset, if the answer is that there isn't necessarily an answer or that there are many answers that all may have some degree of validity.  In other words it is a mind game, if it is a game at all.  And one where you are left to try to discern meaning amid chaos and confusion in an imperfect world where your questions are not always answered.\n\nThe experience runs between an hour and half to twelve hours depending on how fast you proceed and whether or not you go back to replay and see what you missed.  And yes, you can miss a great deal the first time through - either because it wasn't there in the first place or because you were tuned in to find it.  For example, there are as many as ten ghostly appearances and you may only see one or two the first time through Dear Esther.   I say this based on what I perceived in my playthrough and what others have reported in their playthrough(s).\n\nThe Celtic music is absolutely haunting and makes the game superb.  If you don't get goosebumps, you're not paying attention.  The visuals are stunning and the narrative readings are full of emotion and maybe more.  All of it works together to cause you to feel a lot of emotion while causing you to start asking more and more questions about what it is that you are experiencing.\n\nSo by now you are probably saying, "What the heck kind of review is this?  You are talking in circles and driving me nuts."  If so, I understand.  The answer is that this really isn't a game in the traditional sense and instead an experience where you are given clues in the environment and narration to piece together after which you are expected to use a healthy dose of imagination, layer peeling, and deductive reasoning to shape your own idea of what the story really is.\n\nIn truth of it is that Dear Esther is one of those things where you may get more out of it by discussing it with friends and other players than by just playing it through.\n\nIf you decide to have a run at Dear Esther, you might be well advised to constantly ask:\n\n*  Is what I'm perceiving real?\n\n*  Is there symbolism here?\n\n*  Is this place real or imaginary; e.g., is this a memory, a dream, some device, a real location, or some combination?\n\n*  Are the names of people given in the narration separate real individuals, creations of a fractured mind, representations of something other than a person, etc.\n\nIn the end you may ask is this a simple sad story of withdrawl from the world and madness following the death of a loved one, or something entirely different?\n\nAt this point I must apologize for a review that has taken longer to write than it took to run through Dear Esther itself.  So now it is probably time to close with a few thoughts.\n\nDear Esther got me to put my thinking cap on and see many possibilities, which is sometimes a good thing.  And perhaps that's the point of Dear Esther to get people to examine perception and meaning.  I suspect that Dear Esther's value is more in the discussion than in the playing.\n\nIf you do play Dear Esther all the way through and come out with more questions, than answers, I recommend a look at the guide at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=124708486#21630.

While the exploration is somewhat limited and definitely pre-determined, the atmosphere and visuals are so well done this hardly matters. During the game, the player finds himself so captivated by the contrasting bleakness and vibrance of the world and it's atmosphere, that he finds his every action and every thought hinged on the next line from the narrator or the next scene, dissolving away the percieved limitations which are so often used to criticize this game. If you are looking to get more out of your game experience, a step above the typical "shoot-kill-earn point" mechanics that are so popular in today's games, I'd recommend Dear Esther. Otherwise your better off with one of the more popular games which stimulate neither the mind nor the imagination.","November 25, 2013","true","3.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

My thoughts are as follows:\n\nIf I sailed in a paper boat without a bottom, then I am further your spinnaker dangling on a toothpick, destined to flap about and try not to lose hold. These twin vapor trails, these white lines which we have together etched into the lonely cliff-face may be our final signatures, our epitaphs as at least I soar into this nothingness. Anywhere away from Donnelly, anywhere away from Jakobson, and from Damascus, and from even more I may one day part. If this paper boat is my galleon, then let fate be our drunken captain and tragedy be our map.\n\nIntimate, poignant, and psychologically intense, Dear Esther is a gem of polished, shining facets.

The ending left my jaw dropped and my hands floundering for tissues. Wonderful way to spend a rainy night.\n\nTip: I entered this game unfamiliar with the controls.

Letters stained in brilliant lines by the love poured over them from a man in grief.\nDear Esther is a very slow burning story that many people would easily find to be dreadfully boring. But in the same length of time in which you could watch a feature length film, you can simply wander through overgrown paths on an island and traverse the gorgeous caves beneath. The scenery is stunning but empty except for some cryptic clues; equally as cryptic as the haunting narration that accompanies them.\nRarely have I cared so much to understand an allegorical story. and never have I come out of one with at least three distinct theories as to its meaning, narrative, past, and conclusion. However, the most unfortunate aspect of trying to delve in to the deepest parts of the story is the inevitable realization that, unknowable details aside, the circumstances of the events are not very interesting; they just tug at a few emotional strings.\nOne of the few things that sets Dear Esther apart from Proteus is the fact that there is a story and there are actually some things on the deserted island that garner attention.","November 25, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Rather than traditional game-play the focus here is on exploration, uncovering the mystery of a lonely island, of who you are and why you are here. Fragments of story are randomly uncovered when exploring the various locations of the island, making every each journey a unique experience.\n\nDear Esther is an auditory and visual experience that interweaves a consuming narrative and array of emotions. The game's actual value must not be solely based upon its gameplay length, but rather on the random elements and new secrets discovered through multiple playthroughs. Those that brave the journey into the narrative and world of Dear Esther will discover an experience that few games have been available to accomplish in years.

Having played and liked Gone Home, I thought it might be a similar kind of atmospheric game. But read some reviews where people called it boring and pointless. I'm into this kind of artsy stuff but to a certain limit only! At the point when art starts to become self-indulgent I get put off, be it films, books or games. So basically, was on the fence about buying it and finally couldn't resist picking it up for very cheap as part of a Humble Bundle.\n\nDear Esther had been sitting in my library for a while now. I had a few hours to kill today so finally decided to check it out. First 10-15 mins, I was like "Uhh...this is going to be a little boring. Where do I have to go? There are so many paths and routes. Is there any marker or any maps to show me the way? Do I just stare at the vast ocean and the foliage throughout the game? This is confusing!" I have to admit that initially I was beginning to see what all those bad reviews by gamers meant about it being just a walking simulator.\n\nEven so, an hour later I found myself still playing and completely in awe of the game's atmosphere especially the gorgeous cave section. And the music...oh god, the music is mindblowing! I think its the music that really sets the mood for this game. In fact, its not really a game in my opinion...its a journey...a piece of interactive art. If you go in expecting to play a game...you will hate it! But if you let yourself be taken in by the environment its trying to create for you...you will have a mesmerising experience.\n\nI simply cant get that hauntingly beautiful soundtrack out of my head. And the part where you fall into the water and see images of a motorway and a couple of cars...that part blew my mind! Everything is just done so well. The detailing, the character building, the lighting, the environments...its pure art!\n\nBottomline, I know many people thought of it as pointless and a waste of time - but I really enjoyed it.

The graphics and physics of the plants and movement of the water is amazing and very well done. The music is relaxing and peaceful to listen to. The story is captivation and makes you want to know more. The game of Dear Esther has a very nice pace to it. It is calming and doesn't take long at all to beat.

As you may have read already from here, this game can be called a "walking simulator" since ALL you have to do is walking through an island while a voice is reading some sort of diary on the journey. It's ok, I do not always play videogames to have a dynamic gameplay. After all, I strongly enjoyed games like Walking Dead or To the Moon, and they're not that far from this main idea.\n\nIt's not the fact that you don't need to do anything in order to beat the game. It's the story itself. I might not be clever, but I haven't understood a single damned thing once I reached the credits. But anyway, I played this game with my girlfriend who enjoys these kind of "conceptual-persona-ultra-indie video games" more than me, and she was very confused too. I like complex stories where you might even need to surf the internet in order to get the whole thing, but... A WHOLE GAME!? I had to check EVERYTHING on the net to ensure myself that this game makes some sense. When you reach this point of "personal game" I'm not sure it should go on the public market.\n\nAnd after all, the story wasn't good at all. I believe that the ending itself was improvised since I've seen that not even the developers could give a proper explanation to that.\n\nThe only nice thing you can rescue from this game is the graphics. Maybe. I wasn't surprised at all 'cause... what developers doesn't use that software?\n\nIn conclusion: this game is 2deep4me. I enjoy difficult storylines but this was totally out of the context. Hopefully some of you will find its beauty because I really wanted to like this game.","September 19, 2014","false","1.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Just make sure you know what your getting into.\n\nThis is one of those "Art" games where the point is more to elisit a reaction rather than deliver a full gameplay experice and if your into that sort of thing Dear Esther delivers.\n\nYou find yourself on a deserted Island with no explination with who you are, whats going on, or what your goal is.  As you wander around a narrator will give you fragments of a strange tale at set loactions.  And thats really it.  Theres just enough story to make inturpertaion as to what happend and who you are but never straight out tells you.  The enviroments is at once lonely, haunting, and relaxing.  The music is pretty and atmospheric.  And you'll likely find yourself getting pulled into the game sort of like Myst minus the puzzles.  The game is short but doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nI'm not sure if this "game" is worth the full release price but its gone down since its release and well worth grabbing during a sale.  Just understand what it is your buying.  If you want somthing different and layed back and enjoy experimental indy games that are more about light exploration and evocking emotion rather than game play, or if you just want to feel alone (and i mean that in a positive way) than give it a look.

Honestly, I find that incredibly insulting. Fallout, Planescape Torment, Chrono Trigger... These are what I consider prime examples of storytelling in video games. Something that takes the player into account, where not only are you the center of the game's world, you also have a say in its fate. Good interactive storytelling is just that; interactive. It should take advantage of the medium the author chose and how much potential it has to make something truly unique and expansive. Dear Esther squanders this in almost every way. It is a brief, bland episode of nothing but walking down a narrow pathway, observing the static environment as the author reads aloud his bad poetry. And yes, the poetry itself is bad, at least I think it is. If you think Dear Esther is good poetry, that's fine. I won't think any less of you for it. Just don't call it a good video game.

It's short at about only an hours length, though you might be able to get a little more out of it by exploring every nook and cranny. Though there is no reason or incentive to do so as there is nothing to collect or achieve other than hearing other small snipets of the story.

While the optics, the narrator and sound are pretty decent, the gameplay itself is rather boring. You wander around very slowly, may take a closer look at things and swim. From time to time the narrator tells you something. The whole thing is very linear and more than once you will stumble upon (invisible) borders where you can't go further, so in fact it is not so much about exploring but more about following a path.\n\nI can see how people may like this game for being so different.

Most people laud it for the simple fact that its different, but being different alone should be justification for praise, you should also be good at what you are attempting to do and Dear Esther isn't.\n\nIt is the videogame equivilent of a pop-up book in the world in literature. You are taking down a linear path with some interactive parts jumping out at your but with very little else going on. The story isn't compelling, the characters uninteresting and the entire focus of the narrative just stale. This is most definately a matter of taste, but there are clear examples where a game that is mostly attempting to be a discussion or exploration is actually good. That example being the Stanely Parable.\n\nOne last note, the nail in the coffin in my opinion is this game's price. The entire experience clocks in at under an hour and for ten dollars that really isn't worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keavon/recommended/203810/","keavon","Keavon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keavon/","1057 products in account","I cannot recommend this game. Do not get it unless it is less than $3. The first and second map (the beach with disgusting grungy human made stuff) are not too good, but I really loved the third map, the caves. They are really nicely made, and are a very spectacular sight to see. I did not appreciate the English writing in the caves, but the symbols were very cool. I really enjoyed that map. The fourth map is somewhat pretty, but not too spectacular. It's a beautiful nighttime view of the sea, but is corrupted by a few grungy human-made things, like a bunker, candles, etc. It also has the radio tower, which I did like, and the game ends in a nice flythrough of that scene (apparently from the shadow, you turn into a bird).\nI'm left with a few questions, like why wax candles are still burning when I walk through, and why paper boats haven't sunk yet.\n\nThe gameplay is awful, if not completely non-existent. The game consists 100% entirely of walking. You can't interact with objects, like picking them up. You just walk. A lot. Really slowly. You can't sprint. You can't crouch. You can't even jump!\n\nNot to be too mean to the graphics, as they are great in the last two maps, but they are not too good otherwise. All the plants are just 2D planes that follow you around, and turn to follow you, which is unrealistic. In addition, texture quality is not too great (at max settings). Textures are often skewed and stretched, and seams are sometimes visible. Much more detail could be done on the models. The water is very pretty, and looks pretty good. I like it.\n\nThe music is also nice in most parts, thought he narration is nowhere near good. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting is VERY good, but the fragmented poem he reads makes little sense, and hurts the gameplay. I am still not sure who Ester is... Me? Another person in the past? Someone in a journal? I am also not sure who the narrator is... Me? Another person in the past? Someone in a journal? Nobody in particular? The island itself? The content of the narration is also very mysterious and mood-breaking. In the middle of beautiful scenery, it speaks of a car crash and a drunk driver. I love the voice acting, but the content is just... bad. I would even like to disable narration, but this is not possible.\n\nFinally, the game is very short. I beat it first time in just over an hour. I thought I was going to play it real quickly to see what it's like, and to my surprise, I had beaten the game just when I was thinking of getting off.\n\nThere is also no way to save the game, so you must play each map from start to finish (which isn't exactly hard, since each map is so short). You can select each separate map from the menu screen.\n\nAll in all, it's a good play at interactive storytelling, but it could be done much better. It is very short, and some of its maps are not great, while others are spectacular. I enjoyed the experience, but am not satisfied with the $5 I spent on it (on sale). Models and textures are not the greatest quality, but the environment design and technology behind the game is very good. There is not story that can be easily followed, and the narration makes little sense, and its content breaks the mood. The voice acting itself is of very high quality, though. The gameplay is really bad, as you cannot run, jump, or pick things up. You are confined only to slow walking, and nothing else. Finally, the game is very short. I would rate it 2 of 5 stars, being an interesting experiment, which may be possible to grow into something better in a future game, but this is not too good by itself. Some spectacular caves, I must say, as well as good music, but I can not recommend anyone gets this game, even for $5.","May 17, 2012","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That kind of thing is right up my alley - it's the story I'm interested in. I had also seen some of the beautiful screen shots, and was eager to explore this little world.\n\nI was disappointed by both the story and the exploration. The world is, indeed, beautiful, and there are details like crushed cigarette packages on the ground and flowers waving in the breeze. The problem is that there isn't much more to it than what you can see in the trailer. After you've had a good look at the shack by the lighthouse and its surroundings, there's nothing new to see until you get to the caves. The caves are gorgeous, but again, once you've seen the first one, they all look more or less the same.\n\nAnd there is no real exploration. You really are just playing a story, and the railroad tracks are firmly installed. Now and then it might appear that you have a choice to make, but you don't. There's always only one way you can go - split paths always quickly meet back up again.\n\nThe narrative is very poetic, often beautiful, sometimes touching. But there just isn't very much of it. The game description claims the audio, visuals, and "events" (not sure what events they refer to) are randomly generated, but I played through twice and they didn't seem to be. There was some slight variation in the order that you hear the various fragments of text, but not enough that I'd call it "random." Once you've played it through once, which takes about an hour, maybe 90 minutes if you really take your time and poke around a lot, there's not much of any reason to play through again. It seems meant to convey a feeling about a singular event more than to tell an actual story, and that only really works the first time through. Once you understand what's happening, it loses most of its emotional effect. I suppose if you have some personal connection to the event in question, it might be more significant, but I think most people will find it a bit too distant to have a lasting effect.\n\nOverall, the game is not *bad*, it's just lacking. If you want to spend an hour or so wandering through an eerie environment, listening to poetic voiceovers, then it's just fine. But don't expect any more than that, because that's all there is, really.\n\nIf you can get the game at a big discount, or as a gift from someone, then it might be worth a play through. The price tag of 7 euros, however, seems awfully high for such a small amount of content.","January 19, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Video games can very well be the epitome of art, and display different ways of expressing art. But I don't think I can call this game art. I cannot call this a game, because it is not. I realize it's a tired joke, but "walking simulator" may very well be the exact definition this game pushes for. It lacks gameplay elements, it lacks a compelling narrative, it lacks any sort of... well, "fun." I believe fun to be a very central philosophy to follow when designing a video game, no matter what sort of game it is. Likewise, games can be both art and fun at the same time, contradicting those who believe fun must be sacrified for the good of art. Deus Ex. Half Life. Portal. Fallout. These are games that offer the player a chance to enjoy its mechanics and immerse themselves in an interesting story and atmosphere whilst treating the player with the most basic function: fun. It is fun to sneak past or gun down your adversaries in an attempt to unveil conspiracies in Deus Ex. But while you do so, you become immersed in a deep plot that questions your motif, your resolve, and it completely conveys the meaning of art. Dear Esther cannot accomplish this, and instead relies on detailing a vivid scenery and split paths to venture forward, while providing snippets of pretentious poetry. It may immerse you, but the sheer boredom that surrounds it is disheartening. You will not have fun. You will not enjoy the game's mechanics. You will walk a standard path, you will enter a cave, and you will finish the game, and finish the story, despite signs telling you to uninstall. To be fair, it is not a bad "whateveritis," but it simply is a bad game, if to even decide on the label of such. I'd be fair enough to name this an Interactive Novel, and I think that best fits it, but even then, "novel" is debatable, and you might decide that "short story" is more descriptive. So finally, we have to decide if ten dollars is a fair amount for a short story, and that, my friend, is up to you.

Most people laud it for the simple fact that its different, but being different alone should be justification for praise, you should also be good at what you are attempting to do and Dear Esther isn't.\n\nIt is the videogame equivilent of a pop-up book in the world in literature. You are taking down a linear path with some interactive parts jumping out at your but with very little else going on. The story isn't compelling, the characters uninteresting and the entire focus of the narrative just stale. This is most definately a matter of taste, but there are clear examples where a game that is mostly attempting to be a discussion or exploration is actually good. That example being the Stanely Parable.\n\nOne last note, the nail in the coffin in my opinion is this game's price.

The narrator has a fine voice, and delivers his lines well, but all too often the lines themselves are pompous and intentionally confusing.\n\nThe game doesn't confine itself to normal rules, but offers you a chance to explore as you like. The trouble is, exploring takes far too long. Not being able to run or jump may serve an ultimate purpose, but I found it to be detrimental to exploring the island. Numerous times I wondered what was around a corner or up a hill, only to realise that invisible walls or faulty polygon detection would get in my way halfway through the journey and I'd give up.\n\nI do not have a problem with the length of the game in comparison to the price. However, I expect the emotional impact to be that much more potent. This did not deliver anything close to an impact.\n\nI would not recommend this game, but would definitely be interested in the developer's second attempt at a game.","March 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Also, try to investigate and understand each single part of the island that you are allowed to roam, cause it will add more sense to the story you'll be creating.\nI wouldn't rate it, because I don't really consider it a game, but If I had to, AND ONLY JUDGING THE ARTISTICS ASPECTS, I would give it an 8/10.\n","December 27, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's beautiful and the music is amazing, but the game feels shallow. The ending is nice, but it comes after slowly walking for 90+ minutes.\n\nThe last chapter feels most enjoyable, I'm not sure who would want to play through the first two though to get to that point honestly.\n\nSuggestions for improvement\n\n- Keep the user engaged more consistently through the narrartion. More talking, even if it's minor thoughts.\n- Interactions. Something to feel like you're actually engaged in the world\n- Make it more linear, if the point is pushing the story forward and the are no 'Easter Eggs' or 'rewards' for exploring make it so someone can't 'Get Lost'\n- Subtitles - Could be more interesting, could be used as typograhic art that scrolls or changes in size and font to fit the mood. They felt drab and did little for immersion, so I turned them off\n- Abilty to walk faster...jog even. Less of an issue if it was more linear, but going 'The wrong Way' then back tracking is tiresome here\n- Camera: Make more dynamic, small bobbing as the character walks","November 23, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There were moments on the journey that I was lost in this other world. When I looked up from my computer I was back in my crummy apartment.\nIt wasn't until the final chapter that I really had a problem. I fell into the water and my game froze, though the sound kept going. Normally you would just be brought back but I never was. I exited to the menu to start from the final chapter and it wouldn't let me. In fact, it would only select the first chapter. Really?

Well a lot actually. when you start the game you think hmmm this seems like it my be some kind of horror game. Better watch my back. As you SLOWLY progress through the game you realize its not. now when I say slowly if you couldn't tell I meant it in the whole sense of the word. Your character walks like like a sloth through tar and you cant run or pick up stuff or solve puzzles because the only controls are WASD and the mouse to look around. Thats it there are no other controls to the game. So If you thought that this might be some kind of mist tribute like some people I know you are sadly mistaken and I am so glad that I could stop them from buying this game just like I'm trying to convince you to do. But I digress. So back to the actuall game. It runs off of the valve source engine so you can expect what kind of graphics to see in the game only they are about 2X worse some how. The game is very slow, very boring, and very pointless. It shouldn't even be considered a game for crying out loud. And are you ready for the real kicker *******************SPOILER ALERT*******************SPOILER ALERT******************SPOILER ALERT************************** IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS POOR EXCUSE TO MAKE MONEY THEN DO NO READ ANY FURTHER THEN THIS POINT BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO SPOILE THE WORST ENDING TO THE WORST PLOT EVER! SO PLEASE IF YOU WISH TO SAVE SOME MONEY DONT EVEN BOTHER USING THE COUPON ON THIS GAME ITS STILL NOT WORTH IT***************** SPOILER ALERT************** SPOILER ALERT*************************SPOILER ALERT******************\n\n\n\nOkay so if you've come this far aperently you want to save some money. So here we go. The plot is your character wakes up on an island. No real indication on who you are why you are there or why you should give a f****. As you slowly walk through the game the narrator starts talking about a woman named Ester. Also he talks some other random crap I was to bored to care about. So as you walk through the game you reach this raido tower where he talks about Ester some more and how he hurt her. Then..... are you ready for this? He jumps off and Kills him self. Then its game over. there is no new game plus there is nothing interesting that happens after the credits... its just over. You killed your self. Thats it.\n\n\nIn short what do I think of this game. Its crap in its purest form. If you took a machine that could convert crap into computer data that data would come out to be this game. Is boring, unintersting and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (and no I will not apologize for using the R word because this is America and I'm intitled to say what ever I want.)\n\nDO NOT! I REPEAT! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS IN NO WAY EVER GOING TO BE WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY\n\nI'm just so glad I got it in a humble bundle so I only spent about $2 on this and like 4 other games because if I had spent the whole $9.99 they are asking for I probably would have driven down to the studio my self and demanded the money back from the person in charge of making this game him/her self.\n\nThis game gets a 0/10 from me.","August 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Most of the time, our games are about blowing up stuff or travelling to other galaxies, in "Dear Esther" we are forced, no - compelled, to follow the path of an unknown protagonist, and it is quite a nice adventure, if you dare to explore your own imagination.\n\nAs we walk slowly towards a flashing beacon in the distance, we find clues here and there about previous encounters with the island we are on, and the narrative (a male voice), is seemingly addressing a woman who he is quite fond of.\n\nMost of the time the wind is our only companion, and the vegetation of the island. Sometimes we feel the presence of "something", but we are not sure what it is, and more often than not, we turn around to see if we are followed, only to realize we have to go on, no matter what...\n\n"Dear Esther" is a short, visual novella, that will keep you enticed for an hour or two, but the real experience comes after you are done with the game, and you are left to wonder about three things:\n\n1. Is there life after death?\n\n2. Can shadows fly?\n\n3. What is dream and what is reality?\n\nOf course you will never get your answers, but you will still ponder about them.","November 25, 2013","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And if you argue that it is a "piece of art" as if it is therefore above criticism as a video game my response is "So? That is no excuse, all video games are a form of art, and there are tons of games that are far more artistic and better presented such as Life Is Strange."\n\nIn the end, unless you have literally never played video games before, don't bother with this one.

To get it out in the open at first opportunity, I don't really care for Esther, but that doesn't mean it's completely inconsequential.\n\nFirst things first; this game is beautiful. The modeling isn't the best ever, and it's rendered in Source so it looks distractingly like Half-Life 2, but there are some moments that frankly left me in awe from spectacle alone. There's also an admirable attention to detail, seeing shadowy figures on mountaintops or in reflections, things that really add to the atmosphere. And for the record, the ending, while being probably very pretentious, was incredibly well-executed and made me feel an emotion I couldn't quite identify upon viewing.\n\nBut in the end, this game is marred by its attempts to become anything more than a walking simulator. I've never really cared for these, because they don't offer anything a video or movie couldn't do better, but Esther tries to step around that by throwing a wrench into the formula; the story, displayed in the form of voiceovers, is randomly switched around and chopped up. While it was probably intended for artistic reasons and to build intrigue, all it ends up doing is making the (fairly good) story completely impenetrable and difficult to understand upon a first playthrough.

But... in the end... it is a poor excuse for a video game and it ends up just a pretentious, shallow, boring walking simulator.\n\nI mean this game is nothing. Most video games in general give you a story, characters, world, and gameplay, but Dear Esther thinks "wouldn't it be a revolutionary idea to remove all the story, characters, interactive world and gameplay from our videogames?". And if you argue that it is a "piece of art" as if it is therefore above criticism as a video game my response is "So? That is no excuse, all video games are a form of art, and there are tons of games that are far more artistic and better presented such as Life Is Strange."\n\nIn the end, unless you have literally never played video games before, don't bother with this one. If you have an urge to play this game, or already have played it and still have that itch you want scrathed (and even if you enjoyed it and think you got that itch scratched), go play Life Is Strange and get your fix of what this game is pretending to be.","December 9, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It's not something that everyone is going to enjoy, as it is less a game and more of an exploratory journey used to deliver a narrative. The term 'walking-simulator' has been dealt out to ths particular genre of games and, while I don't really think that term is useful, it does attempt to give define a tag to apply to these games that offer its players more than just a wandering quest to complete. What Dear Esther offers its players is a contemplative work of art that left me thinking about the game for a few hours after completing it. It's graphics, voice-work, music, and writing all colate into a fine design that is worth taking your time to experience.\n\nI think that if I played too many of these games too often, or consecutively, I would grow tired of the genre as a whole, but they are something that I enjoy partaking in on occasion, and it's the same enjoyment that I find in reading a good book. The player awakes on an island and is left to their own devices to explore though there is a 'correct' path that will reveal more of the narrative. There are some interesting hidden elements in the game that are quite creepy, and the package as a whole is very well done.\n\nI'd recommend this game for those who want to enjoy an interesting and well told story within the interactive medium of a game. You won't find challenges, or riddles, or enemies to overcome, only a story that you can walk around inside at your leisure, discern yourself, and leave you to contemplate afterwards.","March 13","true","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It looked the same on the outside, but while Anna provided tricky puzzles, chilling atmosphere, amazing graphics and intriguing story, Dear Esther doesn't have anything of that. It's literally a walking simulator with some narrated stuff that doesn't seem to have much in relation to the scenery itself. Granted, the scenery is amazing, calling it just breathtaking would be an understatement, especially since it's running on somewhat dated Source Engine. But paying 9,99€ for a "game" with pretty scenery where all (and only thing) you can do is walk around stupendously slowly is simply not worth it. I got it through a cheap deal so it's not that big of a deal, but as it is, it's too expensive. If I'd wanted a non interactive game, I'd watch a movie or read a book...\n\nIf it had interactivity with objects, reading story by picking up notes and books, puzzles, in a way Anna was made, then I'd be playing it with highest interest. But the way it is presented, it's not even nearly engaging enough to pull me into the game. Sorry, I can't recommend it. You need a very specific taste to enjoy this game and I don't think many people have that kind of taste. And this is coming from someone who loves adventure and/or exploration games.","May 7","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It has some interesting aspects and interesting points to think about, but is it a good 'game'? Eh.\n\nTLDR is at the bottome \/\n\nDear Esther is a game where you walk around and explore. . . sorta. As you walk around, little tid bits of who you are (or might be/just a narrator) pop up and give you a vague idea of the story in the form of letters. Well, read aloud letters. It's pretty neat how the story bits can tie in with what you are spectating. However, exploring can get pretty tedious. If you don't walk into a certain area you don't get the dialogue, or if you back track you don't get anything. Since you can't run, there can be long pauses where it's just you walking around trying to figure out where you should go. There are paths that lead you to and fro with a few other paths leading to new bits of dialogue, but attempting to explore much can lead to lots of boring backtracking through large areas. Going as linear as you can is probably more enjoyable.\n\nAs far as environments go, Dear Esther has some gorgeous locations. The whole 'game' takes place on a small uninhabitated island, so you're gonna get a lot of ocean and some pretty cool caves to. . . well, walk through. I was particularly impressed with the caves and are by far my favorite part of the game.\n\nAnd the narrative. If you haven't heard anything about Dear Esther, be warned - It can get confusing. Each run can give you slightly different audio tidbits. Last time I checked, some of them lead to very different assumptions on what the story actually is/means. That means with each playthrough, every person might hear slightly different things. That by no means makes this replayable though. There is NO replayability in this game unless you desperately want to see what differences you can get. The enviroments don't change, trecking through each area is a bore after awhile, and the ending does not change. This game is only WALKING and LISTENING to dialogue. I swear if you replay Dear Esther, you have to either be crazy or a dedicated Wiki editor.\n\nTLDR; Dear Esther is an interesting take on narrative, but the long stretches between that narrative, ruthless lack of nothing if you dare go off the linear path and explore (expect a few meaningless narrative tidbits), and lack of replayability make this a less than par experiance.","December 12, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Absolutely beautiful prose, narration, music, art. If you like literature or are even vaguely artsy, I want you to play this because not enough people understand how beautiful it is. Complex, rich parallel storyline that can be interpreted both figuratively and literally.\n\n~English major intensifies~\nNot really an English major... but seriously. It's a work of art, and of the highest quality too. If this was a book, it'd be my favorite book. But it's not, because it's meant to be that way, and it's beautiful that way. The narration, the vagueness, the art -- the interaction of music, visual art and story is what makes Dear Esther great.

It's incredible visuals had me drawn to seeing what it brought to the table, and sadly, it falls into a style of game that will constantly be picked on and labelled, pretentious, trying too hard or as a simple walking simulator. All of this could not be further from the truth. This is the kind of atmospheric game that has to be experienced and sampled. It is not for everyone, and that is completely fine. If lack of game-play makes something bad for you, steer clear of this.\n\nThe storyline been a bit hazy, is actually done in such a way that makes it powerful and one of it's best qualities. The story conveys itself in a series of audio messages of a person who ended up on this uninhabited Hebridean island, listening to a series of voiced-over letter fragments to a woman named Esther. The narrator's identity is not specified, (Personally his voice reminded me of Richard Burton) though there are many suggestions that he is Esther's husband and that she died in a tragic car accident. He constantly references Esther, Paul, Donnelly and Jakobson and as you continue on it becomes more blurred as the game progresses, the narration moves between topics and relates the characters in different ways. The random selection of voice-over parts causes ambiguity opens up a lot of doors for the player to draw their own conclusions of the how this story ends up playing out.\n\nMy take on the story is that this un-named protagonist lost all of his companions after somehow ending up on this island, some to infections they simply could not heal, some committed suicide, and some failed at escaping. It's unknown as to who or how many people were there previously, as the structures around the place lead me to conclude that this has happened before or that the people that were constantly refered back to made all of them. The last living piece of the puzzle is Esters husband.. Perhaps he had slowly gone mad and gone to the top of the aerial to kill himself and join his fallen friends.\n\nMoving on from that however.. The scenery and the music create such an incredible peaceful feeling. The environment draws you to it with it's beauty, making you stop just to admire it, or at least it did with me. I love the entire feel of this game as a whole, it's something new that we have not seen, forming art into a playable immersive form to lose yourself within your alone time, encompassing you in something you want to go from beginning to end.\n\nWith it being semi-randomly generated, it does offer replay value of 2+ hours, making passes to places you may have missed before and in doing so end up finding more hidden dialogue as well. The opposing bit to that is that this only offers a max 3 hours of play, is sadly very short, but that by no means makes it bad. It is more of a story than an actual game as it offers nothing interact-able, other than just walking, listening and enjoying the land in which you travel across to get to the end.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys simply.. enjoying art, story and a stunning environment in which to do that in.","April 19, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All you do is press forward. Literally.\n\nThat being said, it's only the surface of things. Dear Esther manages to pull off one thing a good game is supposed to have: the atmosphere and it does that so well. The abandoned island reeks with melancholy and it certainly makes you ponder. There were times I could almost feel the wind hitting my face, it's quite an amazing experience in that regard. The tranquility of the island is further amplified by a beautiful sound track by Jessica Curry, I've slept listening to it numerous times. While the occasional dialogue makes little to no sense as a whole, that doesn't by the least bit turn me off from the experience, rather it makes the experience all the more intense, thanks to the terrific voice over work.\n\nConsidering it is lacking a lot of fundamental characterisitcs of a videogame, it still remains to be one of the best experiences I've had. To put it in perspective, I have replayed that 4 times so far just so I could get some alone time, where as I can mention a bunch of actual games in my library which I've left without even playing them for an hour, let alone completing them. Moreover, I certainly see myself getting back to it yet again, Oculus Rift support would make that all the more tempting. I've certainly become a fan of Chinese Room after this so I'm looking forward to checking out Everybody's Gone to Rapture.","July 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Seriously. I was completely amazed by some places i saw. Some of them are currently my desktop wallpaper.\nThe soundtrack is also great and together with the visuals make this "game" a really nice experience.\nThe story makes no sense whatsoever on purpose, and i think is also a strong part of the game. You never know the full meaning of what you are seeing/being told. And that for me is good, in a way that the "game" is always making you wonder and assume things. The meaning for the story and things you see is the one you want to give to them.\n\nNow, the weak parts.\nDespite the good things i mentioned above, let's not forget that the game is extremely linear. You walk to where the game wants you to walk, that's it. You have absolutely no choice. (To press or not to press W it's not really a choice, is it?)\nI enjoyed the game overall, but i should not hide the fact that the game had some boring parts, where you are only asking yourself "will this end anytime soon?". Usually you are then given a new place to go and another piece of excellent narrative, that helps to obfuscate that, but you will probably feel bored some times.\n\nI do not recommend the game for full price, but if you catch it on sale, i would say to give it a shot.","June 18, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Or a walking simulator. The idea is you wake up on an island that may or may not actually exist as you travel to a beacon in the centre of the island because it's flashing red so why not.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game to play turn the hell back because this game doesn't have any, you walk around listening to the monologue of the player character. The only motivation you have though is curiosity to try and figure out what happened, you won’t be saving the world from the combine or any ♥♥♥♥ like that here. I have to give it credit though, I was definitely interested enough to see it through to the end, which took me under one hour to reach so this is more of an interactive art thing than anything else.\n\nNothing in this game is set in stone though, you are left to interpret the events and things you see for yourself, so this game and its plot and meaning are entirely what you make of it. Also, many of the things you see in this game are different each time you play. Some stuff you see or hear may not be in other playthroughs so due to the purposefully fragmented and incoherency it forces you to guess for yourself what're really happening even more.\n\n"It can take up to 6-8 full runs in order to have seen every object and/or event at least once."\n\nThe graphics and environments are very pretty though and the soundtrack is nice and fitting, lots of stuff for you to see and wonder what the significant of this thing you're looking at is alright I found most of the writing on the cliff walls hard to read and often found myself not listening to half of what the character said because I was inspecting things I found and the 'ghosts'.\n\nIt's not a scary game in the slightest, it might be a bit eerie if you're a wuss, especially if you wander into a building, but the ‘ghosts’ people talk about are just vague figures you can see from far away that are obviously humanoid but are gone by the time you get there. They're not spooky or unsettling it's more of a "I want to go to where they were and see what the deal is" feeling of interest and fascination.\n\nIt's interesting, for sure. I'd say it's worth checking out, but would I buy it at regular price? Nah, probably not, especially since it's under an hour in length. Still though, pretty nifty little thing.\n","June 2, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It has some interesting aspects and interesting points to think about, but is it a good 'game'? Eh.\n\nTLDR is at the bottome \/\n\nDear Esther is a game where you walk around and explore. . . sorta. As you walk around, little tid bits of who you are (or might be/just a narrator) pop up and give you a vague idea of the story in the form of letters. Well, read aloud letters. It's pretty neat how the story bits can tie in with what you are spectating. However, exploring can get pretty tedious. If you don't walk into a certain area you don't get the dialogue, or if you back track you don't get anything. Since you can't run, there can be long pauses where it's just you walking around trying to figure out where you should go. There are paths that lead you to and fro with a few other paths leading to new bits of dialogue, but attempting to explore much can lead to lots of boring backtracking through large areas. Going as linear as you can is probably more enjoyable.\n\nAs far as environments go, Dear Esther has some gorgeous locations. The whole 'game' takes place on a small uninhabitated island, so you're gonna get a lot of ocean and some pretty cool caves to. . . well, walk through. I was particularly impressed with the caves and are by far my favorite part of the game.\n\nAnd the narrative. If you haven't heard anything about Dear Esther, be warned - It can get confusing. Each run can give you slightly different audio tidbits. Last time I checked, some of them lead to very different assumptions on what the story actually is/means. That means with each playthrough, every person might hear slightly different things. That by no means makes this replayable though. There is NO replayability in this game unless you desperately want to see what differences you can get. The enviroments don't change, trecking through each area is a bore after awhile, and the ending does not change. This game is only WALKING and LISTENING to dialogue. I swear if you replay Dear Esther, you have to either be crazy or a dedicated Wiki editor.\n\nTLDR; Dear Esther is an interesting take on narrative, but the long stretches between that narrative, ruthless lack of nothing if you dare go off the linear path and explore (expect a few meaningless narrative tidbits), and lack of replayability make this a less than par experiance.","December 12, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Dear Esther brings up the whole discussion whether video games can be a form of art or not, I honestly believe I can but this case feels somewhat different for me. In Dear Esther the character you play as narrates an interesting and compeling story which comes with very great music, despite lacking most of the times. Not only that but you are able to witness some really beautifull landscapes and underground sections which probably were the most enjoying part for me. This leads to the a great question, is Dear Esther really a game? As far as I see it doesn't really offer any gameplay at all, you just walk around, it's basicly like watching a movie where you are the camera man per say.

This is something more akin to an interactive poem as you explore a solitary island and come to terms with the grave tragedy that befell you and your loved one.\n\nA beautiful landscape and background musics sets the atmosphere for your journey as passages from a diary or book of sorts are narrated with heartfelt sentiment. In a nutshell, an emotional portrayal of the impact of loss and the search for peace.\n\nI definitely recommend giving this a try if you're into philosophical, self-reflection, poetic and emotional thinking and do not mind spending 1 or 2 hours wandering around, listening to the narration, piecing together what happened and reflecting about the particularities of life. I certainly found it relaxing.","December 22, 2013","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though I did feel like my character moved to slow at first and it felt really linear, I came to appriciate this at the ending. If your looking for a game this really isnt one. You have to play this from start to finish. its very short. the ending is what makes it so great. This is really a new form of interactive art. Totally worth the price for the expereince. I would recommend everyone play this but make sure you set aside a couple dedicated hours and beat it without a break otherewise it ruins the experience.\n\nTo sum it up...... if your looking for an interesting experimental art form GET THIS. but if you want a game no.","December 28, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I wasn't exactly sure what I needed to do or where I needed to go, but the longer you emmerse yourself into the world, the easier it becomes. As a writer, I absolutely ADORE the narrative parts of this, the metaphors and imagery are so incredibly strong, which add more beauty to the experience that Dear Esther gives. Overall, this gives the player an incredibly beautiful and poetic experience, definitely one of my all time favorites.","December 3, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm glad I didn't.\n\n"Dear Esther" is something that must be experienced this way. Stand alone. On its own. With some of the most staggeringly beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game, big names should stand aside: this game is pure visual emotion and poetry.\n\nGameplay within "Dear Esther" is almost completely nonexistent. While some may say this declassifies it as a game, or makes it unenjoyable, I beg to differ. There is gameplay, alright; however, the gameplay is completely existential. To 'beat' the game is to uncover the story of Paul and Esther. To unwind the metaphoric and symbolic clues, to decode what we see and to piece together what we hear from the beautifully-written narration.\n\nI knew exactly what this game would be like when I saw it, and I loved every second of it.

Seriously. I was completely amazed by some places i saw. Some of them are currently my desktop wallpaper.\nThe soundtrack is also great and together with the visuals make this "game" a really nice experience.\nThe story makes no sense whatsoever on purpose, and i think is also a strong part of the game. You never know the full meaning of what you are seeing/being told. And that for me is good, in a way that the "game" is always making you wonder and assume things. The meaning for the story and things you see is the one you want to give to them.\n\nNow, the weak parts.\nDespite the good things i mentioned above, let's not forget that the game is extremely linear. You walk to where the game wants you to walk, that's it. You have absolutely no choice. (To press or not to press W it's not really a choice, is it?)\nI enjoyed the game overall, but i should not hide the fact that the game had some boring parts, where you are only asking yourself "will this end anytime soon?". Usually you are then given a new place to go and another piece of excellent narrative, that helps to obfuscate that, but you will probably feel bored some times.\n\nI do not recommend the game for full price, but if you catch it on sale, i would say to give it a shot.","June 18, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Or a walking simulator. The idea is you wake up on an island that may or may not actually exist as you travel to a beacon in the centre of the island because it's flashing red so why not.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game to play turn the hell back because this game doesn't have any, you walk around listening to the monologue of the player character. The only motivation you have though is curiosity to try and figure out what happened, you won’t be saving the world from the combine or any ♥♥♥♥ like that here. I have to give it credit though, I was definitely interested enough to see it through to the end, which took me under one hour to reach so this is more of an interactive art thing than anything else.\n\nNothing in this game is set in stone though, you are left to interpret the events and things you see for yourself, so this game and its plot and meaning are entirely what you make of it. Also, many of the things you see in this game are different each time you play. Some stuff you see or hear may not be in other playthroughs so due to the purposefully fragmented and incoherency it forces you to guess for yourself what're really happening even more.\n\n"It can take up to 6-8 full runs in order to have seen every object and/or event at least once."\n\nThe graphics and environments are very pretty though and the soundtrack is nice and fitting, lots of stuff for you to see and wonder what the significant of this thing you're looking at is alright I found most of the writing on the cliff walls hard to read and often found myself not listening to half of what the character said because I was inspecting things I found and the 'ghosts'.\n\nIt's not a scary game in the slightest, it might be a bit eerie if you're a wuss, especially if you wander into a building, but the ‘ghosts’ people talk about are just vague figures you can see from far away that are obviously humanoid but are gone by the time you get there. They're not spooky or unsettling it's more of a "I want to go to where they were and see what the deal is" feeling of interest and fascination.\n\nIt's interesting, for sure. I'd say it's worth checking out, but would I buy it at regular price? Nah, probably not, especially since it's under an hour in length. Still though, pretty nifty little thing.\n","June 2, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
