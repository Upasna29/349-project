There's also a storyline but I stopped following it pretty quick. Something to do with avenging your father's death (really).\n\nThe difficulty curve in this game is INSANE when you start off. I think it took me at least 90 mins to get past the first quest of raising 4000 coins (or w/e the currency is), I was really close to giving up because it will seem like you're not getting anywhere. Some of the random events can be very unforgiving as well (e.g. 'high winds' meant your ship lost about 90% of its cargo)\n\nBut if you get past that it gets a LOT easier to do cool stuff. And it is cool, for a while. But once you get to being a millionaire and reach the highest social rank, it's not 100% clear what you're supposed to do, apart from just get richer. There are quests but they usually amount to 'go to place, go to next place', and the payoff for each quest stays quite low - so you're making millions trading, but then spending 10 mins on a quest to be paid 3000. (Unless I'm missing something here).\n\nIt's also kind of buggy; a couple of places (mines/monasteries) weren't accessible to me because they made my game crash, which meant I couldn't get a couple of the achievements. So a big recommendation: SAVE OFTEN because there is no autosave. Also there are places you can get trapped when the seasons change - you can't sail in winter so if you get trapped on an island you are pretty done because there's no 'sleep' option where you can just spend a day in the same place.\n\nBut overall a nice way of wasting a few hours if you can get it on the cheap (from the looks of the forum the devs are pretty sharp at fixing bugs so some of this may be out of date soon anyway). Also - if anyone figures out how to play the knife game in the tavern, let me know!!","December 25, 2014","true","6.6"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","67","70","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/294020/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Merchants of Kaidan is a trading simulation game (which you may be familiar with if you’ve played Sid Meier’s Pirates, or the Patrician series), where the fundamental game mechanic is buy low and sell high. Kaidan tries, and only sometimes succeeds, in spicing up the genre by adding a couple of different elements to the game. You can finish quests to boost your income, explore ruins and abandoned buildings, make investments by founding massage parlors, monasteries and other establishments, and hire different crew-members for your caravan of trade-wagons. And then there are the random events.\n\nOh random events: drunken crew-members, weird old women, snakes...You have a “luck” score which presumably determines how bad your random events are going to be. Most of them tend to rob your hard-earned money or goods. Especially in the early parts of the game, I was incredibly frustrated by micro-catastrophes Kaidan kept throwing at me: cart breakdowns, thieving highwaymen, over-zealous tax-collectors, and bizarrely, gnomes trapped in treasure chests. Yes, all these events add flavor and randomness keeps things from getting stale, but for a strategy game, it seemed a little over-salted with random events that threw off the player.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s “strategy” where Kaidan is found lacking. Like I said, the core mechanic is about buying goods for low prices, and selling them for higher ones. To make good strategic choices, you have to be able to discern patterns and trends, and Kaidani makes that pretty difficult. Yeah, there’re some seasonal changes, and a couple of goods follow the rule-of-thumb of “buy in villages, sell in cities”, but even those weren’t guaranteed, and price fluctuations felt essentially arbitrary. Sometimes, your log may say things like “Feast in Town X! Price of olive oil is high!” but by the time your lowly horse-drawn cart finds its way there, the deal’s over and you’re left with an excess of expensive cargo.\n\nOn top of that, you spend most of the first part of the game trading only furs and food, which are bulky and have slim profit margins, meaning you have a ton of grinding to do before you have enough money to rank up, and be deemed socially acceptable enough to buy lightweight luxuries such as spices and jewelry. You kinda forget the whole “I will avenge my father!” storyline as you wearily travel back and forth between towns, desperately trying to find a good buyer for that 600 kg of food you thought was a steal. After a couple of hours of play, I was getting thoroughly annoyed by the whole thing.\n\nMerchants of Kaidan gets some points for nice artwork, a decent musical score and with a couple of interesting gameplay features. Unfortunately, the core of the game feels unbalanced and underdeveloped. For a strategy title, unlike an adventure game, for example, where a good story can carry the game forward, that amounts to a cardinal sin. I wanted to feel like a powerful, capitalist, magnate, trading luxuries between the far corners of the world, raking in profits, and not like a petty pawnbroker, scraping the bottom of the barrel with scavenged goods.","September 11, 2015","true","16.9"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","68","77","0","1"

So far, the quest bugs, as well as button bugs seem to be fixed, and progression is once again possible. As such, we'll redo this review to the current state.\n\n\nThe game gives you a decent pool of items to trade from, starting with a very basic 4 items and expanding as you level up. While larger cities may carry all goods, smaller outposts have a more limited variety. There are definite patterns from city to city which allows you to form strategy and design trade routes around the different items you are trying to trade. While it can sometimes be frustrating when prices aren't trending your way (especially considering the costs of travelling around the map while not making profit) it is quite possible to limit this by picking a smarter route and figuring out which cities might have cheaper prices in one item, with a nearby neighbor that buys consistently higher. You might still get burned sometimes, but that's part of the fun.\n\nIf you're looking into this one purely as a trading game, there is definite promise.\n\nAs alluded to by this edit, the Devs had a pretty fantastic response time to a pretty gamebreaking bug, which leaves hope for quick development and maybe some new features, locations, or an expanded list of tradeable goods.\n\nI did still note one minor graphical bug with one city background, which seemed to clear up upon leaving the city. The game likely won't be bug free, but it seems that major problems will be met with a fast response, and for that I'll give it a thumbs up.","July 28, 2014","true","3.8"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadimus/recommended/294020/","gadimus","g.adim.us","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadimus/","324 products in account","(tl;dr at the bottom of the post)\n\nThink of this game as a turn based trading board game you play by yourself.  It includes lots of random elements that are effectively dice rolls except that one of the dice has a broken wheel every turn and it takes an extra day to roll it.  If you play the storymode you start as a youth trying to avenge your father's death/betrayal brought on by his business partner who is never really mentioned after first hearing about him.  Now prepare yourself for what feels like a lifetime of gameplay not accomplishing much at all...\n\nConsidering the developers are Polish I'm surprised how little "polish" this game has... I bought it on a recent sale where it went down well under $5.  I think it's is well worth <$5 but definitely not worth the non-sale price (~$15 right now).  Overall this game stinks of a development schedule that was cut short.  It's full of half-baked features, poor optimization and a general lack of refinement.  It seems more like a greenlit game than a full game... Oh wait!  That's because it was a greenlit game that was probably just rushed to market with the wonderful double game launch functionality Steam has invented.\n\nUnlike the main description exclaiming that the game has "lots RPG elements" there are in fact very few (no traditional exp / levels / etc...).  There is one stat point that determines whether or not you'll have a good time or if gameplay will be hellish.  This stat is "Luck" and can have a value of -3.0 or +3.0.  Ultimately it determines whether or not you have negative encounters while travelling (although carts seem to break down regardless of luck).  Once you figure out that you only have to boost this one stat (maybe by using some kind of diety based gambling mechanic?) then you have very few negative encounters and a ton of positive ones - effectively rigging the dice, feels more like cheating than anything.\n\nThe UI is not very intuitive and has quite a few menus that only appear under specific conditions.  Playing through the storyline you'll also be bombarded with tons and tons of unnecessarily wordy text for quests (go to this place), or world events (excess amount or famine on certain goods).  All it would take is bolding on the keywords to eliminate the need for the text description but nope! - read this long block of pointless narrative when all we really want is for you to go from one location to another and then do that one or two more times and maybe buy something....\n\nThere are many items in the game but they don't seem to do anything - they likely to do stuff but very few of them have clear indicator of what they do.  Some of them lower the price of certain goods but the lowered price is displayed in red so the immediate assumption is that it's set higher or you're being punished for doing a quest for the "bad guys".  Again - these suffer from the same UI problems (excessive text) I mentioned before and tend to have pretty vague interactions.\n\nThere are also bugs but whatever.  They're less annoying than all the other issues...\n\nEventually you start ignoring the bulk of the text and then scan for keywords, even further down the road you start just mindlessly clicking through the dialogs - you have +3.0 luck remember?  Surely with the broken mechanic in hand you can beat this awful game and put it to rest along all the others in your steam library.  Oh what;s that?  You accidentally gambled away 600 units of Arms for 600 units of Food?  Oh well, you managed to trade those back a bit later or maybe the $160,000 wasn't really important in the grand scheme of things.  Now you have your main character, a guy in a boat and a guy in an airship and a couple mines.  Every turn requires to to make three moves - for three distinct characters.  It's as if the developers said to themselves "Hey - I know what would be more fun than playing this long arduous game with tons of dialogs and wordy text and slow progress!  Playing it three times at the same time so it takes three times as long to accomplish anything!".  It's like the kid who plays the board game by himself only to find that it was made for other players so he brings out the other player pieces and starts playing with them too.  It's just dark and sad and pretty time consuming.\n\n\nTl;dr\nThis is a fun game with interesting gameplay but it has a lot of half-baked features that might make you regret any time/money you've invested in it.  I recommend consuming a moderate amount of alcohol to offset the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aspects of this game.","August 14, 2015","false","19.3"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","38","43","6","0"

I was probably influenced by the Anime "Spice and Wolf" which is about a merchant travelling through the country selling goods and buying them. With the usual stuff like bandits, church war auctions, failures and sucess.\nSo i looked at the game description and it seems fine so i bought it since 15€ aint alot for a game that could be the one iam looking for. But i didnt quite get what i was looking for.\n\nThe tutorial was quite short and simple and i was able to proceed into the main game. The first thing that i really started to dislike are the weird buttons in the city. Why not just make it a Menu where you can choose where to go instead of making it a minigame of finding the button and remember where to go?\n\nAfter travelling through the Map i was confronted with random events and quest but no matter if i accepted some or not i still had them in my questlog, well whatever probably just a small bug. I also feared something bad would happen instantly if i decline. Because noblemen have power but nothing happend. Now the game description said you could buy furs in summer and sell them in winter. So i have not figured out which day of the year it is and when theres an actual summer or winter, or if its spring etc.\nStill traveling i noticed that even after visiting 20 cities most of the items i looked at had a average buy price of 0. So our merchant is to dumb to keep a log with prices? There should be a option or make it automaticly to memorize these prices without buying something in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place.\n\nOkay so iam kinda lost with the prices, lets go and buy some drinks for the people in the Tavern maybe i can get something useful. Well i got some Maps but no useful gossip. Noone knew anything useful thou. I would like if they could give you a hint for a good deal in the near locations like just 1 village away, you can also make it luck based either its true or not.\n\nAlso no information at all where some of the stuff gets produced more. So i was buying and selling ore and was like "Hey lets buy iron at this place near the mountains, its probably cheaper there then in the inland, where they have no mountains at all. How wrong i was. The cities near the mountains actually had the highest prices to buy and sell ore. And the cities in the inland had the best prices to buy and sell. Color me confused.\nAnyway my point is, theres villages and cities that produces specific goods that are usally known all over the country. Maybe northwest is specialized in weapons and arms, cities near forests usally have cheap pelts. And cities near a wide open space are great to get food. Stuff like that. Also adding a quality of wares. Like you could ask someone about a cities speciality and they answer "this city has the finest and most expensive lumber, its made from these special trees that grow no where else blablablabla". This wood is ofcourse much more expensive will probably attract more bandits and can only be sold in some special locations but it will make a hell of a profit.\n\nAlso this game is missing War and Church. I know this is a fantasy setting but really what is a merchant trading game without these 2? A war makes the best trades for Weapon and Armor. The prices for Food could grow and you could get penalties for trading to much food since its used for the army. Armies could also overtake cities and you get better or worse prices depending on who you supported during the war. Or which region you belong to.\nThe church on the other hand could be a good trading partner that could be way more powerful then a merchant guild. They can ban wares being traded or support the trading of specific wares. You could maybe even get blessings from the church.\nIam not quite sure how you could implent it, but maybe you can add joining a religion too.\n\nEven more is coming yes!  So you said you will add even more regions? GREAT! But what i was always missing is the fact that there was only one currency. Different areas could use different currencies, that are worth more or less, like some cities produce silver coins that are worth much more and gold coins that are only worth pennies in moster other countries. You could also add "counterfeit?" money, uhm money that is actually worth way less because it has alot more lead in it to make it heavier or whatever. Iam no expert on this haha.\n\nAll in all i would say, give the people more information and rework the interface and make it more intuitive. Thats the first thing you should work on. And find a way to note the prices of wares you find.","August 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","0"

It fills a niche for a type of game I've been looking for, a non-linear Merchant game. After reading several negative reviews I started to get scared off but I was so curious I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. The game has unlimited potential that it hasn't reached to this point but it is a good game as is. I'm hoping they really get to work and make it a great game. Some of the writing is strange but you get the point. Perhaps there are translation issues, dunno. The trading isn't completely random like others have stated. I used excel and have tracked every towns prices and the changes that take place as the seasons change. The prices aren't set in stone and that is a good thing as if they were you could just make the same runs over and over and that would be broken. The difficulty is pretty hard at the beginning as you struggle to find ways to make money due to the limited resources you are allowed to trade. But with a little patience and thought you figure it out. My guess is those that come into the game unwilling to map things out and make notes will not like this game without sticking with it. I for one hope the development team gets busy and adds more content to a wonderful base.","November 13, 2014","true","11.3"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","0"

This said the game starts wonderfully, you only have around 1500 gold and one transport cart, whats more you are limited on what goods you can trade, all these factors make the game very fun and challenging (In the beginning!). You are pretty much always under pressure as you daily spend money to your crew, you pay prices when crossing bridges and so on. My point is you have to find some nice trade routes and make profit really fast... But! as the game advances and if you reach the midgame successfully it becomes very, very easy and it really breaks the experience. In mid and late stages of game, when you can trade all the goods, its so easy to find profit and you have so much money already, that you don't have to really  try  to do something, you just go on with the game like hot knife through butter. In fact the late game gets very repetitive - you have to just wonder through towns (Without caring or paying attention to anything) and whenever you see for example Jewerly uner 70 gold just buy it. The events also get very repetitive and boring.\nOverall  I can not give "Not recommended" to this one as you can have some fresh and new experience with it for some time, but I would give this one only 3 out of 5 stars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/recommended/294020/","katosepe","Katosepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/","603 products in account","*Update*\n\nAfter an update to the game and a couple messages from the developer, I decided to give Merchants of Kaidan another try. The game now has an ironically titled "Realistic Prices Model" option also known as Easy Mode. I find it an odd choice of words as it implies that the normal game setting uses an unrealistic price model but that's semantics, I suppose.\n\nThis is highly recommended for anyone starting out in Merchants of Kaidan. This mode basically makes all the statements regarding city specialties and location-based pricing much more pronounced (read: actually noticeable). Now, when I went to the ore town, I more-or-less knew I would get a good price on ore. This mode also features a series of tabs showing you the prices from the cities you've visited for the last 10 turns, essentially managing the basic bookkeeping for you. It makes sense that the game would provide this since it does say that the person managing your cart is supposed to help with bookkeeping. You may still want to keep your own series of notes throughout the game, however, as this is far from giving you a global view of Kaidan's economics, plus it won't help with tracking seasonal changes.\n\nUltimately, it's a mode that holds much more promise than the basic mode although it's mildly demeaning that requesting a realistic pricing model is listed as easy mode. The odd pricing scheme is still in effect where you can't sell products for the same amount as the guy next to you in any given town with any given product. Some odd quibbles still exist as well, after updating, including typos found in a couple of the written entries ("thron of airship" instead of "thrown off airship" in the Thieves tip.) and the inability to scroll comfortably to the edge of the map, meaning edge towns remain more difficult to select than they need to be.\n\nI still can't recommend the game to the average player for these issues but it's certainly on the right track. If you are looking for a difficult economics game and don't mind putting serious effort into understanding the complex system, Merchants of Kaidan is worth a try. If that sounds daunting or even just tedious, this isn't the game for you.\n\n*Original Review*\n\nMerchants of Kaidan is a game with a fantastic premise that could have been so much more. Forsaking the common fantasy tropes of becoming a knight or a king, Merchants of Kaidan puts you in the role of just that, a merchant. There is no combat or magic or anything like that and while that may be offputting for many gamers, the fresh concept was very exciting for me.\n\nThere are several modes you can play in MoK including a story mode, where you play as a young adult from a powerful merchant family who, following betrayal, has to start anew and avenge his father's death, and several free-play modes with goals like "get to 1000000 gold" or "play for five (in-game) years". All of them put you in the shoes of a fresh-faced merchant who has to travel around, increasing his renown and building up income. You do this by buying goods from one place and selling them in another, ideally for a profit. It's a simple concept but one that is immensely satisfying when mastered.\n\nThe problem of the game lies in the mechanics and that's where MoK truly falters. Despite the game design claiming that they use a complex algorithm to create a realistic yet immensely complicated economic structure for the world, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for almost anything that happens. It starts with the base mechanic of buying versus selling. Namely, no matter where you are or what you're selling, you always sell a product for less than what you can buy it for in the same location. This means that you play as literally the worst merchant in the history of economics. You can't sell something for the same price the guy next to you is selling it for? Why? These aren't cars, they aren't losing their value. This mechanic would make sense if you were buying a product at a place it's produced (ore at a mine, for example) but this is the case for anything and everything no matter where you are.\n\nThe game also tells you that cities specialize in certain products and that buying there will be cheaper than other places. While this seems to be the case some of the time, it's not the rule. Going to the central ore city is usually cheaper than buying ore other places but going to the town known for it's wines doesn't seem to make alcohol any cheaper than anywhere else. In fact, in my game, it was commonly the most expensive place to buy wine. Maybe that means it's higher quality but then why can't I sell this higher quality wine for a higher price elsewhere?\n\nRandom events also cause a deep problem as they are based around a statistic known as your luck. Many of these events will decrease your luck stat while a select few will increase it. Since your luck determines how often you are to receive each type of event, this means you will almost always fall into a bad luck pit that you can never get out of. Expect constant cart breaks, delays and taxes since this is what you will have for the rest of the game.\n\nThat's not to say the game is all bad though. While the quests are mostly take person A from point A to point B (then to point C and point D...), the fact that it has a quest system is an interesting boon and a strong motivator for pressing on through hardship. Your ability to search ruins for items and eventually wipe out the monsters and build up passive income buildings is also a lot of fun and can be satisfying. Ultimately, if you're willing to move past the randomness of the prices and the fact that all the mechanics are designed to make your life harder, there is a tough game here that some could enjoy. For most, however, Merchants of Kaidan is one investment you shouldn't make.","November 17, 2014","false","5.6"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","5"

I think I paid $1.50 and given that I played it for more than 10 hours, I definitely got my money's worth.\n\nThe atmosphere and sound are very relaxing while still adding a sense of tension surrounding turning a profit. You need to come out ahead on every transaction, as losing even 1-2GP per cargo can be punishing after factoring in time lost, traveling fees, etc. Sometimes you'll be relieved just to break even.\n\nThe strongest portion of the game, in my opinion, is when you are only operating a single cart. Later in the game you'll unlock a boat that can travel between ports and an airship that can travel pretty much anywhere, but managing this is tedious as you'll be constantly having to meet up to trade goods and coin between them to reach the next merchant tier. The mid-end game doesn't provide much of a challenge as you should, at this point, have enough of a buffer to easily cover any losses stemming from a bad transaction or two, versus the early game where every coin spent is carefully weighed against its risk/reward potential. The late game also suffers from a variety of systems that feel kind of tacked on - having a variety of carts is novel but the tools to manage them feel weak, storage of goods seems like an afterthought, you never need to actually purchase insurance, profits from installing monks/miners/brewers are pitifully low for how much effort you spend setting them up, cavecrawling feels extremely unrewarding (not to mention the QTE combat window is incredibly small, it must be less than 1/8th of a second at most). I could keep listing minor complaints about this section of the game, but in a nutshell it seems like the developers spent most of their brainpower making sure the core early game works well, which to their credit, it does.\n\nIn spite of these flaws, you have a fairly engrossing simulator which takes enough time to figure out that it's well worth the modest sale price.\n\n7/10 would supply arms to both sides again","December 6, 2015","true","20.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I didn't found any hint on how the Prices on different Items are affected. Ok, I understand, that some Items costs more in Winter and less in the Summer, but how is it Possible, that the Price of Food and/or Hide goes up/goes down about ~20% in ONE run from one Town to another and back? I didn't get this algorithm.\nOne Feature that also would be cool is the following: I often get the "Event" where I can help a Merchant, which than told me, where I could sell something to a good price...the Second Time I didn't even found the namend Village...Something like a Highlighted Village or a "Tooltip" showing, while going over the Town with the Mouse.\n\nTooltip: While going over a Town with your Mouse, let you show some Informations of your last Visit (the Price of Items the last Time you visited for Example).\n\nAll together: The Game is a Funny Timesink atm, but needs a lot of work to be done.

Intructions for quests follow the same pattern : too long and often incomprehensible. Sometimes place names or stuff names are wrong, good luck finishing the quests.\nThe economic simulation doesn't work. They state the game uses a "complex trading algorithm", which means prices are completely random. You will never understand how and why they change, seasons mean nothing, supply and demand even less.

Most good trading games have a trading engine at their core, with  "RPG" extras. While this game attempts that, it's core trading mechanics are so unrewarding that it just makes it annoying, and the "RPG" extras in the game are virtually nonexistent. For the most part you are wandering the map, getting frustrated at the incremental progress you're making or lack of, which after awhile it gets repetitive and boring. The economy in the game makes no sense, it seems to be extremely flawed at it's core since it's most important feature is the trading and yet its so poorly done.

It is definitely a little rough around the edges, and the criticisms raised in the negative reviews are all valid.  However the parts that were finished -- the core of the game -- are good enough for me to give a solid recommendation, provided you understand what you are getting into.\n\nFirst of all, the trading mechanics in this game are very simple (I would even say casual). There is no realism or predictibility to the economic system whatsoever, and it is not possible to develop a long term strategy by identifying and exploiting favorable trade routes, for example. The excitement in Merchants of Kaidan is of the gambling variety -- the occasional thrill of hitting the jackpot when you randomly find a great deal on that cargo you've been lugging around for the past two weeks. In fact, playing this game reminds me very much of what it feels like to play video poker: getting by on marginal trades (pairs, jacks or better) while bidding your time waiting for the big score (straight flush) that will propel you to the next level.\n\nWhat really makes Merchants of Kaidan worth playing are its artistic qualities. The world building, artwork, and music are all beautifully done and very evocative. The world of Kaidan is what I can only describe as "medieval steampunk" -- the villages, horse drawn carts, and peasant workers all seem like something out of the late middle ages. But look more closely and you'll spot aliens underneath some of those hooded cloaks, and airships plying the trade routes alongside (or above) the wooden carts.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in Kaidan. If you are not expecting a deep strategy experience, and if you can excuse the fact that the late game feels somewhat unfinished, it is definitely worth a try. At the very least, download the demo and do a little tavern hopping to get a feel for what the world of Kaidan is like.","May 23","true","40.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After seeing many cool things and new features that were added almost every week (and updates still seem to keep coming weekly) I decided to finally pull the trigger. And I'm glad I did. After playing for a couple of days now I found out you can play this game in, at least, 3 different ways. You can seek best offers chasing disasters and events in different places while trying to make as much profit as possible, complete quests and get rewarded, utilize mine, ruins and (perhaps) other estates to increase your income or play a bit of everything and do whatever you like or whatever falls into your lap. I gotta admit I'm a bit hooked. I can't wait to uncover new things next time I level up. I already catch myself playing way too late into the night... but hey... after all  it's holiday season;).\n\nI also really like the fact that sometimes I have to choose between finishing my quest or getting a great deal I had lined up done and it's either one or the other. In most games you don't have to choose or worry about it because your quest will always wait for you to finish it or you can restart it anytime you want. I like that here it's more like things are in real life: you don't always have enough time to do everything you like. Well... at least not until you restart or load game (if you thought of saving in time, that is);).\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games that involve trading, RPG or both and looks for a game they could spend long winter evenings with.","December 14, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's some place I could see an offbeat game of Dungeons and Dragons being set in. The trading mechanics are solid, though consistant spelling errors may distract some and the story wasn't exactly to my taste; I would say it feels forced but I think it's my bias toward a less defined background (not every game can give you advanced RPG customization, it's just unrealistic). Also, it's essentially a series of menues and little else, but they're easy to navigate and visually stimulating. Consistantly experienced problems selecting options in the game, having to click three or four times 75% of the time.\nAs for the trading mechanics, which were mentioned previously, they aren't overly simplistic but they certainly aren't complicated... Well, as others have mentioned, they start out pretty limited with only two resources being profitable with any consistancy. The idea of investments are pretty cool but you better have some serious resources if you're going to do the monster hunting neccessary. Honestly, the point where Merchants fails worst is the barriers to entry keeping players from the well developed portions of the game. Also, luck is a huge factor, to the point where you can do everything right and still lose significant sums of money. As someone else said, the economy feels somewhat arbitrary at times, and yet others it fits nicely into what you would expect from a "real world" (as much as I would expect given my experience with the game so far).\nSo far it has been fun, and I can see myself logging hours consistantly when I have a little time to kill here and there (some, but not enough for a more involved game). I'd recommend it on sale, bottom line. It's a game for the casual gamer, those who take their trading very seriously will probably be disappointed.\nIf I make a fool out of myself here, forgive me.

Most of the reviewers have hit on the positive and negative aspects.  There are a few things that would immensely add to the game:\n\n1) I played through the whole avenging my father line, and even by the end (which was a loooong time, I only had one fully and one partially staffed ruins (which require 5 different specialists + artifacts + mercenaries).  I also only had 2 fully staffed and one partially staffed massage parlor, and no mines at all.  It takes forever to a) find the specialists you need and then level them up.  On top of that, you only have so many spaces for specialists (which I found no way to open all of those slots), so you end up having to sacrifice someone who'd be beneficial to your travelling team and level each specialist up 1 at a time (2 additional levels at 100 days a pop--and no, you can't just buy a storage facility and pop them in to finish leveling.  They just go into stasis in there).\n\n2) Some quests give you unlimited time, some quests limited time.  Some quests are main quests and some trivial, side quests.  Unfortunately, there's no distinguising between the two until you click on the flashing quest icon.  Then you end up having to say no to some, and they disappear.\n\n3) Broken transportation and constant robberies.  I know it says you can raise your luck, but no clue how to do so.  There are a few, little items, and periodically, you come across a woman who will enhance your luck if you pay her, but there's no indicator as to how much luck you have, and apparently, I had none.\n\n4) Disproportionate.  Because my airship guy could travel so much faster, but the end of the game, he had nearly 10,000,000.  My ship guy was the worst off because during the winter, he's just stuck sitting, and I ended up just using him to feed supplies to my airship guy.  Even the carts did significantly worse than airship guy, ending with a little over a third of the money as airship guy.  In some ways, it almost became pointless.\n\nYet, still I clicked.  I know I mentioned a lot of little things, but I really did enjoy the game and story overall.  In fact, it was probably the story and quests that kept me going.  Would love to see more of that--an expansion of the storyline or new one.","June 1, 2015","true","43.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The main interface involves clicking around on various towns/cities to navigate your trade caravan and interact with the world. Your primary goal is to trade goods and make money via buying low and selling high.  Basic fetch/deliver quests also make up a significant part of the gameplay. You can also trade items, which bolster your caravan or character in various ways. During gameplay, random events can occur that will hurt or harm your business.\n\nHere's my short list of pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Fun, albeit basic trading simulator. If you enjoy trading simulators similar to the 'Patrician' series, you'll probably like it.\n-The artwork and design is unique (in a good way).\n-Random events that occur while moving around the map keep the game fresh for a while.\n-Creating stationary businesses (massage parlors/mines/wineries) add a few other fun elements to the game.\n-Quest text can be interesting.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the character dialogue can be really confusing due to what appear to be translation errors.\n-There are some bugs that require the game to be restarted or that crash the game completely (to be fair, I didn't find many gameplay bugs).\n-Some features are not explained very well, even with the various tooltips available in the game.\n-Some features don't appear to be fleshed out fully (partnerships could be so much better).\n-It can get VERY tedious trying to find special characters to join your caravan. Sometimes you will visit 100 pubs before you find the person you're looking for.\n-The UI for inventory/quests/map/etc. is really bad. I still have trouble finding and navigating the quests screen. The developer should have labeled the various symbols with words. UI windows also close if you click anywhere outside of them...I found this highly annoying as I had to constantly reopen UI windows.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game for the price. It has a certain charm to it that makes it very entertaining and it certainly has that 'just one more turn' feel to it.","May 16, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Hey, I said, "intensely FUN", not "intensely REALISTIC", and to me, that's actually a good thing.\n\nCONS:\n-Music is ridiculously calming.... ALL the time....

I want some music to help me feel sorry for myself for those 5 seconds.....\n-Kind of grindy, especially if you're not intending on doing any of the quests.\n-If you don't catch on quick to the small-scale scheme at the beginning, you're in for a rough ride.  >>  Buy food cheap in the small villages that hunt, and sell in the big cities.  Upgrade your capacity and repeat.\n\n9/10\nIt's rare that I find a game I can rate above 7/10 and not feel like I'm being merciful, much less find a game deserving of 9/10 at all.

In fact, there are no animations, only still images. But its ok for a trading game. I didn't mind\n- Sound is ok but repetitive. Might want to mute the music after awhile.\n\n\nThe bad parts:\n\n- It's not a good trading game. It seems everything you do depends far more on luck than how competent you are at trading stuff. Just getting the 4000 gold to get into the merchant guild as your first quest took hours where i traveled around, made only money to stay even (at 1000 gold) when suddenly i got lucky and found a village selling low priced food right next to the capital who bought it at high price. There i made 3000 gold in 5 minutes. That's after 4 hours of play!\n- To make things even worse, price flucuates wildly for no reason most of the time. The only logical reason is because of the season change, One day food is priced at 6 gold and a few days later its 20 golds. And the season didn't change. And it can happen at any city or farming village. WTFuuuuuu..c...k? So trying  to establish a valuable trading route is impossible. It all depends on the luck you have to be at the right place at the right time. So most of the time, you move around with no cargo because its not worth it. But you still have to pay your guys each day.\n- To make things a lot worse, you got the concept of how lucky you are! It goes from -3 to +3. Positive is good and negative is very very bad. When in the positive, most of the time nothing happens when you travel, so thats pretty good. But if you misbegotten son of a wh....ore get into the negative, you are in deep troubles. At -1.4, i got dragons attacking me EVERY TRIP. They eat my wares so i lose cash over the maintenance i pay for each trip. And when you are unlucky, it is very difficult to get back to lucky or neutral again, because you get more and more unlucky events that drop your luck.\nYou might say, just pay a sheet.load of money to get your luck back, but until you are very rich, you don't have the money to buy your way outta bad luck.\n\nWOW, what a concept! A game so based on luck that it doesn't matter what you do it all depends on chance!\n\nI don't like game of chance so this game is not for me. I prefer to play poker instead, i get better luck and its far more fun.\n","June 19, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You go from town to town, buying low and selling high. You can get more carts and upgrade them as well as new steeds. The music and visuals are very pleasing and the game runs smoothly, the character portraits are a welcome touch as they give every character a sense of individuality.\n\nThere are some issues I have with this game, though. Firstly, there's no way to check the buying and selling price of resources in towns that you are not in. The closest you get is a recording of the buy and sell history of resources you can look at while in the market. This method isn't very good because it only tells you the prices of resources AT THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE THERE LAST. This means that it does not tell you the current prices, which is useless. The "2 days ago" and "8 days ago" tabs are also unclickable. Whenever I tried to click on them, it would just close the market window.\n\nIn addition to this the game also gets very samey after a few hours since the "random events" cease to be random after you encouter them a few dozen times.\n\nWith all that said I still had a few good hours of fun with this game and would reccomend it to anyone else who likes games that allow you to become a successful merchant. After about 5-6 hours of gameplay I managed to go from $0 to $20'000, so there's plenty of profit to be made. I hope the Dev team makes updates to this game as I would love to come back to it to find fixes and new additions.","October 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No rhyme or reason to the prices of things.  That's not just me saying it, it's also the giantbomb gameguide writer saying "ya, totally random pricing, good luck".  You got cities sometimes selling food for less than the rural villages.  Mountain towns selling ore for more than the villages on the plains.  And if they just came out and say "ya, it's totally random" at least you'd know what you are dealing with. But no, they insist on telling you over and over that certain cities are producers and others are consumers.  Well if that is true, sir, you are the worst buggiest programmer to every write an economy AI.\n\nAnd in a buck against the trend, this game starts brutally hard then (according to game guides) becomes extremely easy.  This must be to make some kind of point that starting easy and increasing the challenge as the player learns the game is all wrong.\n\nI don't know why they made a trading game where the new player can only trade in 4 of all the products.  And then make 2 of those 4 useless (you'll never find someone buying it for higher than you got it) so you have to GRIND your way to making the first 4,000 gold 50-100 gold at a time.  I spent 2hrs and only got 2,000 gold.  I give up.  I see no reason to grind in an unfun game just to hope it becomes fun later.","December 24, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Even the cities that supposedly specialize in producing a good usually don't seem to offer a better deal than any random village you could wander into. also there's the whole hill herb thing, usually 120t to buy and can only seem to offload it anywhere for 30t at best, What the hell is that? I went to the barbarian cities to try and find hill herb cheaply and even there it would be ridiculous trying to run a route off of it.\n\nThe only break they give you is that the starting city sells food cheaply for like a week and then it dries out and you're stuck wandering through all these cities looking for a single thing that can be traded for a profit.\n\nIMO your money would be better spent on Port Royale 2 or Patrician if you've never played those, really regret buying this because now it just sits unplayed.","April 21, 2015","false","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

One of the games for those "bionic beaver" Unisys ICON computers was a game called Cargo Sailor where you (as Prestige Worldwide put it) "sail around the world and go port to port" (by furiously rolling the trackball that was built into the keyboard - the game didn't let you chart a course for your ship) buying and selling goods. There was no combat, no pirates to defend against, and that was really lame. But I understood that the school wouldn't let me play cool violent games, so at least Cargo Sailor was better than doing word searches or other busywork after I finished my work.\n\nBut I graduated a long time ago, so I'm not stuck playing boring education games. MoK has some random events, but it's still just boring buying and selling. If I'm too much of a wussy merchant to kick butt, fine, but at least let me bribe some demons to attack a mine after I get a monopoly on all the ore or something.

I was told to go make a profit on a trade between the barbarians and the empire, of at least fifty units of a single good.  When I did so, a notification popped up saying I'd accomplished one of four tasks!  ...  What?  So I went back to the capital to see if there was another stage to this quest, and there wasn't.  Then I went back to the barbarians, and did another trade, getting the popup for 2/4 tasks done.  So then I went back and forth between the barbarians and nearby imperial outposts, figuring I needed to trade four times -- no dice.  It only counts it when I do a valid trade a fraction of the time.  What the hell?  It also really doesn't help that there's a timer in days on this quest, making me have to start over every time I try to get it done.\n\nThis game is poorly written and programmed, but I do like the idea?\n\nThird impression:  I am ridiculously back and forth on this game.  Once I got past the quest mentioned above (apparently I needed to do profitable trades, each direction, between THREE factions) I immediately went back to having fun.  There's typos everywhere, quests are a lot harder than I think they were designed to be, but in the end it's got the basics down.

I was hoping for more interactivity besides buying, selling, and a choice or two in random quests/events. Perhaps there's more to the game, but I get the feeling you only get to that after experiencing going from city to city to raise your capital. Not my type of game, maybe it's yours.\n\nSo you start the game with some amount of gold, a cart, and a valuable item you need to sell for money to buy goods with. You start off with selling your valuable, buying a mercenary (initial charge and upkeep cost as well), and then you get the choice of buying your cargo. If you were dumb like me you won't think that you can actually scroll through the list of choices you can buy, so keep that in mind. Buy your cargo, go to different cities, sell when it's good. Random events with choices, may or may not help you. That's about all I experienced for a while until the game said "Hey, we noticed you haven't actually gotten to the point we want you at so here's a reminder that you're not doing things wisely." Of course prices fluctuate, are influenced based on where you're most likely to get certain cargo from and so on, but I hope this little review helps someone out with their choice of finding out if this game is for them or not.","December 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I had expected more of an RPG that was a visual game with actions rather than background screens with text pop-ups and picture menus.   Also, I don't see many RPG elements yet. This game appears to be a text/picture based version of The Guild without many of the things that made The Guild such a fun game.\n\nThere were icons that were not very easy to identify. Icons for completing tasks are not obvious and traveling doesn't work well. The game locked up on me twice while attempting to travel.  This is one of the reasons I decided to just turn it off rather than continue.   The other reason is that it everything is very slow paced. This is frustrating for a person like me who likes things to move right along.\n\nI'll give this more time later and update my review to reflect the additional time.  Right now, I don't recommend the game while reminding everyone (including myself) that it is early access.  Perhaps the developers need more time and input for improvements to be made.","August 2, 2014","false","0.1"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

Time is of the essence, but you HAVE to stop at every single town along the way, which causes you to loose the quest that you actually did pick up.  The trading part?  To start you'll be given a map of what you think will be nice, decent trading posts.  Don't be fooled!  They carry the same stuff as the 10 cities/towns that you had to stop at and they carry nothing new.  This game was a complete waste of my money.  If it was a little better I'd be playing more, but frankly I'd rather choke to death.","August 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

Runs great even on PC's with integrated graphics and has a surprising amount of depth if you devote some time to it. If you are looking for a game where you will be rolling in gold after an hour, look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\nUnique world populated with characters and merchants not typically seen in ANY other fantasy setting (there are no elves, dwarves, or orcs in this world)\nSeveral fun quest lines including a pretty well thought out main storyline about avenging your father.\nLots of items and trinkets to collect, some of which effect gameplay.\nThe artwork in this game...just wow. For an indy game someone spent a LOT of time designing and then drawing these awesome characters and towns. No two locations share the same piece of artwork, and there is a diverse enough cast of NPC's and other quest givers that you don't often see the same species pop up more than once per town/questline.\nThe music is fun, and the game even includes an option to just play the music without having to load the entire game.\nRewards effort. It took me a couple days to get the hang of price fluctuations and to amass any significant amount of gold. Once you start expanding your merchant empire, the game REALLY opens up and adds several new types of travel and the ability to control multiple merchants at once, as well as own businesses. Clearing caves and mines out of treasure and monsters was a nice touch and helps to mix up the gameplay.Cons:\nThe map is pretty small, especially if you come into this game expecting Civilization-size maps.\nWhoever proofread this game needs to be fired. I'm no grammar nazi, but there are enough spelling and grammar mistakes that it becomes very noticeable, especially after playing for a while.\nSlow start puts a LOT of people off, which is obvious from the number of negative reviews with only a few minutes or handful of hours playing, as well as the fact that most achievements on this game can be considered "rare", with the most acquired achievement sitting at 10% globally.\nOnce your empire is huge and you've played for 10-20 hours, you've pretty much seen it all, although the other story/quest options allow for some replayability.\n\nOverall I got way more mileage out of this game than I thought I would. I had a coupon for it for 90% off and got it for $1.50 as a joke gift for my wife. She wound up playing it A LOT, so much so that I just HAD to play it too.

It's far from perfect, but in the end I finished it and had fun with it, so I'd recommend.\n\nPros:\n+ The travelling merchant experience is there. If you are browsing this game, I'm guessing you are looking for a game that let's you travel from town to town buying low and selling high. Well, this game will deliver on that. I'd say the trading mechanics are pretty solid.\n+ The game has a story. It's not super creative or deep, but it does keep the game moving to some extent. This is a simple thing, but it's absent in too many of these economic/merchant type games.\n\nCons:\n- Although I'm fine with the travelling merchant experience, it's just not enough. The game does get quite repetitive after a while. I have to confess that I considered quitting before the end. Once you get rich enough and experienced enough, there is nothing new under the sun. You are just kind of going through the motions. The game does make an effort in this regard, by allowing you to do things like clear dungeons and open massage parlors, but these things are kind of half-hearted and don't add much.\n-  The story has a tendency to stagnate, and there were times when I was just wandering around trying to figure out what I had to do to advance the story. As it turns out, many of the story events only trigger when you go to certain places. I eventually realized that you have to be careful to explore the whole world (not just your favorite trading routes) or you might never trigger the story's advancement.","June 6","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
