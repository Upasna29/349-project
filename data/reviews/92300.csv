Extinction Agenda EX” which is essentially an upgraded version of the game. I'm only recommending this game based on my experience before the new version released.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/315340/\n\nTL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda is a 2.5D side scrolling action platform game that attempts to fill-in for the Mega Man (Rock Man) drought.\n\nLike the aforementioned Mega Man series, this game places you in the shoes of an advance combat android named Ares. After a mysterious asteroid collided with a Deep Space Reprocessing station, a group of scientists were sent to investigate an energy emission radiating from it. Shortly after arriving, the team discovers that all the machines inside the station are now hostile to human life after being exposed to a new vapor gas called Zytron which came from the Asteroid. The Scientists, before being trapped, was able to send samples of the Gas back to earth who then develops Ares, an android immune to Zytron. Ares is now sent on a search and rescue mission on the Minos Space Station and along the way, discover the true nature of Zytron.\n\nPROS:+ High resolution graphics with a nice and colorful artstyle\n+ Crafting System for weapons and item upgrades\n+ Good weapon variety\n+ Good character designs\n+ Outstanding soundtrack\n+ Responsive controls (specially on a gamepad)\n\nCONS:- Very short\n- The game relies on grinding to extend gameplay (what I call “game time through attrition”)\n- Story is under developed\n- Cinematics are dull with no voice acting and, more importantly, no sound effects except the soundtrack in the background.\n- Underwhelming bosses\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME which is reminiscent of the Mega Man franchise. It has good high resolution graphics with a nice and colorful artstyle; it features a crafting system based on materials you collect from the world and enemies; the game shines with its amazing soundtrack and responsive controls specially with a game pad. For its cons, the game is very short and the cinematics are a bit boring and unrewarding but for the price however, this game would make as a good casual experience for younger audiences.\n\nAlthough I'm placing my recommendation, please don't buy this version and take a look at the “A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX”  instead. It's essentially an upgraded version of the game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azroix/recommended/92300/","azroix","Azroix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azroix/","289 products in account","A.R.E.S. is one of those games you can only recommend to a certain few. There isn't anything particularly special about A.R.E.S. and although it attempts to be a solid platformer, it falls short through a frustrating "crafting/shop" system. The majority of items in the game require nearly all three of the specific currencies to construct and unfortunately, one of those currencies is in very short supply throughout the game. After three full playthroughs, the needed currency is always scarce. So farm if you must, though like any hardcore platformer fan, you'll persevere without the upgrades -- even if it kills you.\n\nThe game itself is rather short and each successive playthrough becomes shorter because you can keep your unlocked items. My final run through of the game was a little over 40 mins. The cutscenes are decently created in a typical "fanime" style. The story tries to be more than it is and is mostly ignored except in between chapters. There are only 5 chapters with none of the stage environments or enemies revealing anything about the world A.R.E.S. is set in.\n\nI had hoped A.R.E.S. would've been more than what I played and because there is really nothing memorable about the game,  I can only recommend this to those that play for the learning experience of game development.","November 25, 2013","false","5.5"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","33","44","0","2"

You see, I grew up on Mega Man and his countless adventures on the NES - with some of those games still to this day being able to rekindle a gaming joy within me when I feel the current slew of gaming titles are doing nothing but putting a damp squib on my desire to play and complete them. There is just something inherently appealing to me about 2D platform side-scrollers that I will always love (again this is probably due to my younger years harboring an almost fanatical fascination with games like Contra and Mega Man) so I didn't hesitate for a second to add A.R.E.S to my collection. At the time it was touted as Episode 1 in an ongoing series of episodes and the price-tag of $9.99 back in 2010 I felt was a little steep for what was essentially a downloadable first chapter.\n\nIt appears something went awry as we are already half-way through 2014 and A.R.E.S has yet to see an Episode 2. Searching the game developers bare-bones website, http://www.x10interactive.com , it appears not much has been going on for quite some time which leads me to believe they are most probably now defunct which is sad in any event but after playing through A.R.E.S (once back in 2010) and now recently in 2014 (for the Steam Trading Card business) I can’t help feel that they had much of a future to begin with. A.R.E.S for all intents and purpose tries so desperately to mimic the successes of the past games yet doesn't even come close. The entire game feels like a cheap imitation of a mid-nineties Mega Man game and the kicker is that is poses very little to no challenge at all. Even ramping up the difficulty levels does very little to put it on par with some of the more challenging Contra and Mega Man fare released almost 20 years ago.\n\nWhilst the 2D artwork may look nice and the techno buzzing soundtrack amiable providing the listener with tunes to hum to while playing, the platform jumping and shooting mechanics are somewhat borked and will have you flinging more than a few unkind words around the room. Boss fights are an absolute joke and require very little tactical thought on the player’s part where it is simply a case of find a corner and blast away until the enemy is no longer.\n\nI had high hopes for A.R.E.S but in the end I can only lightly recommend this title. Since it appears we will see no continuation of the story, if you must pick up the game (particularly if you want the card drops) rather wait until this the game is being offered at a discount price since currently there are a dearth of more endearing indies games you could be spending a tenner on.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 15, 2014","true","5.9"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","33","45","0","0"

It doesn't know whether it wants to be Mega Man or Metroid, and suffers for it. The level design includes both large multi-scrolling rooms and more platforming-oriented sections, and it's never entirely clear which drops are bottomless pits and which lead to other parts of the stage. I'm also not happy with the upgrade mechanic, which encourages literal grinding as you kill enemies for the three types of items that are needed to upgrade your weapons. The controls also feel a little slow, with the dash move in particular always feeling like it's just a little too long to execute and traverses just a little too short a distance to avoid enemy attacks.\n\nAt least the boss fights are pretty fun, and it's entertaining when you get into the groove of blasting enemies and jumping from platform to platform. But all of its other problems make it hard to recommend. You could do worse, but you could also do a whole lot better. Try Cave Story+, Noitu Love 2, or They Bleed Pixels if you want to play a really good action-platformer.","June 16, 2013","false","4.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

Several platforming puzzles lead to frustration just because of how short the Character's jump was.\nYou're also told early on that you can change suits, but the game does not give any explanation as to why you'd want to do this, and how each suit affects you. From what i experienced, there isn't any discernable difference between the suits anyway, aside from the berserker suit.\nThe enemies are more of an annoyance than anything else, and it's very difficult to dodge their projectiles as your character is rather large. And even if you do get hit a lot, you can easily craft a cheap healthkit that heals most of your bar. Speaking of the crafting system, you can also make grenades. But i rarely found myself using them, aside from when they were required to bypass obstacles, they can also be used to perform an air dash move, but this needs to be charged up and so is only useful in specific situations.\n\nAll in all, I think this game isn't really that good.

Shooting things.\n\n\nMain Review\nYou're a woman in a spacesuit on a lone mission to find out what happened in deep space, on an abandoned junk station. Something about this game feels strangely  familiar. Ah well, at least she's called Valkyl and not Samus, right?\nAnyway, after speeding straight into the game, I'm placed as a space suit warrior lady in a a seedy, futuristic station, where all the machinery has gone mental and is now trying to kill everything. The learning curve is harsh, you more or less need to learn yourself  the mechanics, deal with weird little robot things fast or die miserably. A lot. I like that you have to figure out everything by yourself. At the same time I dislike it. It's part of the charm of retro games. And that includes the sounds!\n\nAt least  with all this you can upgrade your stuff so it looks more awesome AND kills things a lot faster.\nI think the design is pretty cool, futuristic shiny green and blue space, with rusting machinery as backdrop. The enemies, and there are a lot, from security system robots to weird little vacuum cleaner things that don't like you. I'm not usually a fan of futuristic style games, but this one has something about it I like.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to, and they're part of what make this platformer challenging. That, and the oops I didn't expect that to happen moments when you slide under a wall and get blasted by sentry turrets on the other side. I think the controls could be better crafted or more responsive.\nWhat I find annoying is how far back a level/save point resets if you die, which can mean you have to refight tough monsters you already killed, and repeat a lot of content, which could make it stressful fast. Though there is a sense of achievement getting past those ANNOYING OBSTACLES.\n\nPros\n\nCool space graphics\nOld school sounds\nPuzzles progress well.\nGetting weapons is awesome!\nThrows you straight in(makes it more old style)\n\nCons\n\nKind of stressful (because of the controls)\nNot very long\nThrows you straight in (No help)\nControls are clunky\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall VerdictI want to like this game, but the controls I feel drag down the quality of this platformer. The story is small but you know what's going on. Everything about the game I think can be amazing, but the responsiveness of the controls, and the situations you find yourself in with them let it down. I like everything in the game, except for the gameplay.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","November 15, 2015","false","9.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","1"

I played with a gamepad, so movement is with 1 stick, and shooting is with the other. The story was not the most gripping, standard save the world type stuff. Your suit makes you immune to some chemical that is being released, which is why you are mostly going alone.\n\nI found the enemy types to be pretty repetitive at the beginning. It seems in the first level I fought about 100 copies of the same 3 enemies. The boss design was a little lacking. The best strategy seemed to be to hide out in a corner or tank the fight. The controls were somewhat sloppy. It was difficult to get the tight movement necessary to dodge some attacks.\n\nThe graphics are bright and colorful, but I found the animation to be choppy. The environments didn't really do enough to draw me in to the game. Seemed like I was just fighting in giant labs of warehouses. The soundtrack does a little to pump you up, however. It may have been the high point.\n\nI feel that there are enough entries in the Megaman/Metroidvania platformer genre that are more worthy of your time than ARES.

A lone robot goes on a mission to a space station where a mysterious virus has taken over all the machines while an NPC dumps information on them at key points - if it all feels familiar to old console players, it's because it absolutely is.\n\nThe main issue is that a lot of the charm that made Mega Man X what it was is gone - the game is linear, weapons are few and stingily upgrade, and A.R.E.S is nowhere near as responsive as X was. Controls are slightly clunky, rewarding pattern recognition over reflexes, and areas often have a constrained, restricted feel (oewing to the decent amount of space your character takes up on-screen) that may be appropriate for the space station theme, but aren't much fun to play around in. Enemies often include flying foes that are hard to target with the default gun. Add in 3D environments that can occasionally be confusing as to what qualifies as a ledge and you have the recipe for some issues. Add in a rather pointless crafting system - you need particular elements to craft each upgrade, but... there's no way to predict or seek out the exact elements you need. It also makes you choose between buying disposable items and upgrades, leaving the former as a trap and the latter as the only great choice to make. And the story is pretty forgettable, and ends on a cliffhanger that seems unlikely to ever be picked up again. It's also quite short if that's a issue - lasting only a few hours, it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThat isn't to say it's all bad - the boss fights are clever, if heavy on pattern recognition, and it's light fun if you're willing to put up with its foibles, and rewards replays with extra unlockables and upgrades.  Mega Man X fans may enjoy it well enough if you pick it up on sale, as it's not truly bad, just exceedingly average - it doesn't really fall over, but it doesn't do much to distinugish itself.","December 28, 2014","false","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, it's kind of good\nAlright, I know starting a review with that type of header isn't likely to inspire a lot of confidence. But trust me on this one:\n\nThis game actually isn't that bad. In fact, it's kind of good?\n\nA.R.E.S. feels straight out of the 90s in both design, story, fidelity, and - let's face it - name. It's an action side-scroller and you control a robot dude. You have access to several types of weapons (that you're never not spamming the entire level), and you use them to mow down hordes of enemies and the occasional boss. There are some RPG-lite elements, like weapon upgrading and new suits, but it's all pretty shallow.\n\nIt's short, and not all that hard. Its understanding of level design is...uh...questionable. It's colorful and full of neon. Did I mention you're constantly firing guns? Like, all the time?\n\nThat's it. That's all there is. But there doesn't need to be anymore, right? This isn't a "fake" retro game, there are no surprise plot twists or usage of ironic "bad design"\n\nIn fact, maybe that's why the experience felt so good: it was genuine. It felt like a dumb action game that was perfectly content providing that exact experience - a callback without all the "heh, remember THIS?!" that plagues so many others.\n\nIt's a fun game, and I think you'll have fun with it as well.","February 15, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

'But Chris, I already have all the card drops from this game by just sitting idle in the main menu..!', well shame on you! There's actually a decent attempt at a classic genre on offer here.\n\nIt's a 2.5d side scrolling game, which reminds me of Metriod, Mega Man and all the other games from the NES/SNES generation I grew up playing. The level designs are simple, but have scope for secret areas and discovery, while the music again is a fantastic tribute to the genre and era it's attempt to reflect.\n\nBoss battles reflect on the genre well too, with each boss having set pattern attacks you can learn and counter. Weapon upgrades and suit upgrades are there too. All in all this is a fun little game, and fans of the genre should check it out.\n\nGameplay wise I'd recommend investing in a 360 pad, or something with Dual Analog sticks, as the game supports 100% (even the force feedback), and plays a lot smoother for having one too.\n\nOverall advice would be - give this a game a chance. If you see it in the sale pick it up, if only for the brief chance it'll remind you of the fun you had as a kid.","June 24, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it would seem from the offset that the folks from Extend Studio know what they're doing, sadly A.R.E.S.  never quite manages to capture the precise beats of the controls and core mechanics that made both of the mentioned games as exciting as they were in the early nineties. My biggest gripe with A.R.E.S. is that the controls never do what you want them to, even with an Xbox pad. It really hurts the rest of the experience when the game pegs a wealth of secrets accessible only through exploration and careful platforming. This wouldn't be a problem if all the actions in the game didn't feel a chore to commence as the lumbering animations making double jumps especially hard to predict and all-round not fun to do. Despite this fatal shortcoming,  I will give A.R.E.S. credit for it's soundtrack which, like the Mega Drive games I mentioned, feature memorable tracks for each level.

It's a side scrolling action game, very similar to Mega Man. The game's story is not it's strong point; essentially you're a robot sent on a mission to a space station to stop the evil AI from blowing up a planet. Typical stuff.\n\nThe gameplay is standard run 'n' gun for the most part, and features an upgrade system where all of your weapons can be upgraded to make them stronger. Although usually this doesn't seem to be worth it as the differences in damage are minimal. Besides what you should do is to take those components for upgrading and use them to make medkits for healing; with enough of them the game becomes a breeze since all enemies drop components.\n\nOf course there is a higher difficulty setting, and rankings for each stage if you're a completionist.

A.R.E.S. is a decent 2D platformer/shooter which reminds me a bit of Contra and other similar games. Some reviews have made it sound like a Metroid style game, but it's not really an open-ended world. Rather, it consists of 4 or 5 linear stages that are played chronologically. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this, just that some other impressions of the game are a bit misleading. It's actually a fairly decent game, assuming you like this genre. There is a story, but I honestly didn't follow it all that cloely, as it was largely unnecessary. The main draw is jumping and shooting stuff. The game is also fairly challenging, especially if trying to achieve high ranks for each level. It can also be completely in just a few hours. All in all it's a decent game that lacks the sort of polish one might see in AAA titles.

Weapon purchases and upgrades transfer over with every new game that is started, and there are multiple endings depending on the difficulty one chooses, throwing in a little bit of bullet hell style progression into the mix as well.

Minimal story (note, there IS a decent enough story, but it doesn't get in the way whatsoever) upgrades are a nice amazing touch and they don't completely break the game. As a bonus grinding the necessary materials took me only about half an hour to max all upgrades. Exploration is VERY rewarding as you can find various upgrades that either lower crafting costs or enhance your abilities. The bosses are FUN to fight and tough as nails until you get the patterns right. While the game certainly isn't a breeze, the difficulty plus the satisfaction of nailing down a difficult pattern is on par with the satisfaction of doing so in old NES classics such as ninja gaiden and megaman (from which ares draws a lot of inspiration) On the downside jumping is the worst kind of clunky. It works perfectly under normal conditions but the jumping is just a FEW pixels off. Not much normally, but on stages of heavy hurried platforming deaths galore if you don't perform a FLAWLESS jump.\nI got the game from indiegala on special for $2.60 but i'm having more fun with it than other AAA titles, as such with all it has to offer, i would rate this a 8/10 the game is VERY addictive and satisfying even if the jumping is off other than that what keeps this from being a truly stellar (read: future classic) is how little risk they took, as well as how little tools they drew from the games they paid homage to. not just weapons, but collectible armor pieces (megaman x) would have been AMAZING coupled with bigger open world environments a-la- metroidvania would have been even more amazing. Icing on the cake would have been a ledge climbing mechanic such as metroid fusion-onwards and this game would have stood its ground with the greats, probably knocked out a few.\nas it stands now however it's still an amazing game. i you HAVE the money, i suggest you buy it even if just for the sweet sweet nostalgia value","June 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is short, easy and with few variations. But the soundtrack is not too bad. The problem is that if you're in the target audience for this game, you probably know of better games and expect something you won't get out of this.\n\nAnd that is the biggest argument against this game. It's not that it's not that great, but it's that even at a price tag of only $9.99 compared to bigger budget titles, there are much better options everywhere at a lower or very similar price, like buying Mega Man X on Virtual Console or other retro-styled games like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV or you could always just save that money for a higher costing but way better alternative.\n\nIt's a very weak recommend at best.","November 25, 2013","false","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The stages are set up so that you're not always just rushing in one direction to the end. You find weapons and abilities that you can upgrade, as well as craft certain useable items throughout the game.\n\nBeing able to craft repair kits in stage makes the game a bit more forgiving, but you waste materials that you would rather use on upgrades. Crafting can also be a bit annoying sometimes because it feels needlessly split amongst 3 different kinds of materials, when all of them are used when crafting any item, and only the yellow ones seem to be a bit more scarce than the others.\n\nThe slides are a little hard to execute with a controller. If you use a PS3/4 Controller using DS#Tool, it will force-bind movement to the analog stick, which might make certain movements a little more complicated than I wanted, but this could be fixed by using something like Joy2Key instead.\n\nDespite a few nuances in the game, It was pretty fun to play. It only takes a couple hours to beat for the seasoned veteran in platformers, but there are also many things that are easily missed or passed on the first playthrough. The stage system allows you to easily revisit these areas, so it's not like you have to play through the whole game.","March 23, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have heard comparisons of this game to Megaman X, but it feels like a more action packed and shorter version of Metroid. I did not play this enough to unlock all the achievements, or find all the collectibles. I just did multiple playthroughs with different difficulties. The boss fights were enjoyable, but the rest of the game was a bit easy in comparison; easily disposable trash enemies and no thought-provoking/skillful platforming.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I did enjoy it, otherwise I would not replay it thrice, but if you are the kind of buyer who wants bang for their buck, I do warn that the story felt awfully short, and to get full enjoyment, you should plan to do multiple playthroughs and aim for some of the more challenging achievements.","November 16, 2013","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you enjoy Megaman, you'll feel at home with this. It has a fixed theme that escalates it art style, and provides gameplay that is fluid, even offering a crutch for player less adapted to it. For the most part, it's a fun, short experience. My only con is the game feels EXTREMELY slow, in terms of character and enemy animation. I had to check several times what my FPS was. It feels like it hinders the great animation cycles but once you get used to it, it's dandy.","September 18, 2013","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is kinda short clocking in at only five stages, but there is some replay value in not only trying to max out the weapons and grenades, but also in stage rankings.  The achievements seem fairly difficult, as some require great stage ranks, which will take some time and memorization.  For a first game in the series, this isn't really too bad of a game.

It provided some decent challenge (at least if you play on Hard difficulty) and the storyline was a pass. You unlock 4 weapons throughout the game which you can upgrade into stronger versions, 5 levels each with its own boss, so the whole game was fairly short and could be finished within 3-4 hours. Although, there is a lot of replayability value if you want to upgrade all your weapons, find all the secrets and get perfect SS score on each level, and other things that are listed in the achievements.\n\nFor $5, I'd say the game wasn't bad and definitely worth trying. However, I do want to point out that there is a similar game called A.R.E.S: Extinction Agenda EX which is available for $5 extra (if you already own this game) and is apparently an improved version of this game with more content. I haven't got to play the EX version yet, but I'd say that this game has at least earned my recommendation.","May 14","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some people compare this game to Megaman X games, others compare it to 2D Metroid games. And unfortunately, in my opinion, it is neither as grand as Megaman in weapons nor as Metroid in the coined "metroidvania" style. It may be, however, the exact opposite: linear levels with arguably-not-really secrets with some extra collectibles and the depth of Metroid's weapons (as in, a few and extremely situational).\n\nAnd if you want a bottom-line here on top, here it is: the game isn't good enough to stand on its legs, plus there's already an "enhanced version" that is the exact same game but slightly "better" in some ways that aren't relevant for this review. If you really want this game, I suggest you buy "A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda EX" instead, the exact same game with two more letters.\n\nAnd if reading the above didn't demotivate you enough, let me guide you in how much I consider this game to have failed over the next few paragraphs...\n\nThe game features 5 stages, which are fairly large, and a boss at the end of each stage. You don't pick stage order, but you can revisit stages you've cleared at a later date, and you're sent on a predetermined path on each stage until you reach its end; there's secret rooms, if you can even call them secret, and some collectibles scattered in some places, plus very little and insignificant alternate paths (as in, choose left or right in a section but the challege is exactly the same until the point where the paths meet)... but exploration is null otherwise. The bosses are fortunately challenging if you're going for the "no damage" achievements, which heavily rely on a mechanic that grants the player "invulnerability" as he dashes, but to use said dash correctly is awkward and in many situations feels forced or too much timing sensitive (as in, do it just a quarter second too soon and maybe a little too far away and you're definitely going to get hit anyway). It reminds me too much of some relatively recent Mega Man titles, but without the cool weapons.\n\nAnd since I brought guns onto the table, why not tell you about them... You get a few different guns, because let's face it: if Mega Man only had the Mega Buster with no upgrades, would you play Mega Man? In ARES it's actually worse, because while each weapon has its own pros and cons, which innevitably translate into the ability to combo hits for a higher score at the end of a stage or being slightly better against a very specific kind of enemy, each weapon doesn't actually feel like a power up: it feels like your main attack suffered deviations and transformed into something... arguably useful or useless depending on the situation. ARES also has litteral bombs, which over the course of the game will eventually become limitless, and bring into quesiton whether you really need the guns if you don't need to move while firing.\n\nSpeaking of firing, how much do you like aiming directly where you want to shoot? "Oh my gosh, I can shoot 360 degrees!", you may say. Yes, true. But personally, I feel like it's the main reason why I don't really care so much about this game. Why? Because not anyone can be a God at aiming with the mouse, especially if while you move the character the angle at which you're firing is altered as you keep the mouse in place in rooms where the camera is fixed to a point. Is it ideal to target specific parts of some bosses? No doubt. But I guess not anyone can be a God at platforming and shooting horizontally with great timing too, which is the Megaman basic formula, so let's not factor this into how good the game is.\n\nOne other thing that bothered me greatly was how obvious ARES was about having been a XBox Live title, and how many of more recent games HAVE to integrate social media into themselves. Yes, I'm looking at you, Facebook, and what revenue extras both you and the developers may get as consequence. Sometimes it does feel that, while obviously the game has the bare minimum qualities to make it shine under a light, the game was made purposefully short for the intent of a quick cash grab. Price of 9,99 for what was barely 2 and a half hours to clear the game with all of the "secrets"? I'm not even going to bother with the achievements, some of which being too annoying to fail at the very last second (my fault, but still too annoying).\n\nAlso if you're considering ARES, remember to look at the trailer and screenshots. You're getting pixel-y models with real models on a fully (low poly) modelled and textured environment. The art style occasionally feels slightly offputting as a consequence, in my personal opinion, but in most locations this may be a blessing of a callback (it reminds me of Megaman Legends a little). If you think you can stomach it without taking some pill, then move on to the demo before making a final decision: that's the smart way to go.\n\nIf you notice, the current Metascore of the game is 68 of 100. Not saying that it's not accurate, but it really depends on how it will impress you in general whether you will love it or hate it. I'm pretty sure that right now you're better off skipping this game and buying the "enhanced version" since you DON'T want to pay for that game after playing this one. Also on the subject of money: the Berzerker suit DLC may be worth it, if you like high-risk with high-reward playstyle, but it mostly shows how useful it is on bosses and some of the more cramped-with-mobs rooms.\n\nIf by this point you're considering buying this game but you're not sure whether to get the complete edition over the regular game, consider if you're likely to like the soundtrack of the game by browsing Youtube for a bit, or judge biasedly from the trailer (which features the boss music, if memory recalls at this point in time). If it's the same music as the remake I say "skip it", but then again, I'll also say the same about the berzerker suit: likely, you'll be buying this game for the exclusive reward on the remake, which sounds to me like a publicity stunt to make some extra bucks out of suckers.\n\nFinal remarks? I'd avoid this game, as you can probably tell. Every day I have more and more trouble giving games that have once been XBox Live or tablet/phone/you-name-it titles because of the disapointed feeling games like ARES give me. But if you like the idea of a Mega Man nostalgia feeling with mouse aim without resorting to things like the AVGN game or some likewise poorer quality titles, ARES delivers a solid yet short experience that will make some sort of impact on you.","February 10, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a great look and music that tickles all the right spots if you're nostalgic for the glory days of Megaman X. But while A.R.E.S. has some good moves and gadgets and the makings of a solid and exciting action game, it stumbles at every step of the way. The developers made every mistake in the book. It starts with the unfortunate controls that will have you endlessly fumbling your controller, despite the fact that none of the movements you're performing are original in any way and have been done better in every other game that features them. But it extends into the enemy, level, and boss designs (the end-boss is terrible), which will leave you cringing again and again. It's too many little details to list, but you'll be dying a lot and it will be for stupid reasons every time. That is, unless you play on easy (well, "Normal") and spam med packs. Which in retrospect I might recommend because at least it's less frustrating. But a game like this shouldn't have to rely on a big health meter to be playable.\n\nI make it sound like garbage, but if it weren't for the heap of frustrating niggles too big to sweep under any rug, I'd probably love this game. It's not long, and it's not very original, but the elements it brings together are definitely fun ones. If the controls were reworked properly, that alone would make this a lot more fun. The rest could be fixed with a day's worth of focus-testing and tweaking. Unfortunate that it wasn't.\n\nI didn't hate my time playing through this, and if you enjoy games of this nature you may not either, but there is a lot of potential here that got buried under the myriad of small but significant mis-judgements in design.","November 16, 2014","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a nice style and an interesting weapon system. There's definitely an emphasis on replaying levels, whether it's to collect pieces to upgrade weapons or to get a better score for that level. Honestly I never felt compelled to do either. I upgraded my favorite weapon to max (level 3) and did so for another.

Upgrade weapons and bombs, craft supplies using materials and collect a full bestiary along with upgrades for almost every entry. Replay value comes from the fact that you are scored at the end of each of five chapters. On the normal difficulty setting, you can only reach A rank, however on Hard, you can strive for SS. Raise your overall rank to unlock a bad ♥♥♥ new suit. The game's achievements provide it with some more replay value. There are only a handful but they're fun rather than tedious and boring.

Terrible slideshow cutscenes, a terrible script, some hit-detection issues, and worst- lots of spots for blind-jump-death.  The game teaches you to "explore" for hidden secrets by jumping in places that look like fatally bottomless pits by hiding goodies there every so often.

It's a shame it's the only good part about the game.\n\nThe game isn't bad, but it's rather mediocre. The main levels are filled with enemies that oppose almost no resistance, contrasted with bosses who have attacks that are literally impossible to dodge with your slow character. To compensate, you have a lot of health, and the ability to buy health packs from the pause menu, which breaks the already low difficulty. Quite a long ways from the  twitchy experiences of Mega Man and Metal Slug.\n\nThe game also has that unpolished feel that screams "indie" in a bad way. Weird animations, unbalanced weapons (Why use grenades at all when I can do the same damage in 3 shots), cliche story (humens r EVIL!1)... It's also pretty short (~2 hours), though 100% completion probably needs a lot more due to the upgrade system needing to redo levels to gather materials.\n\nAll in all I'm prettry disapointed, but at least I'll have some good songs to add to my library.

They're totally different games; ARES is a 2D action-platformer and STALKER is an open-world FPS, but they share one critical thing: nobody expects their acronym to actually stand for anything. It's the name of the main character; any further explanation is left to the imagination. However, with only four letters, it's not terribly difficult to guess what they might be.\n\nAlways Riddling Enemies with Shots\nARES: Extinction Agenda plays something like the Megaman series if it was invented twenty years later. Controls boil down to variations on jumping and shooting, the former feeling fantastic and the latter feeling less so. The combat is fast and frantic; if you manage to get a bead on them, enemies die in seconds. You aim & fire either via mouse cursor or analog stick, making attacking & dodging independent. This is for the best, as ARES moves a tad too ridigly for its own good especially when it comes to the air.  The designers seem to have been at least somewhat aware of this, and tend to stray away from insta-kill death pits, which can swing the difficulty from challenging to frustrating. Overall, the gameplay remains solid and plays to its best points, though there are speed bumps along the way.\nThe game also includes a ranking system for each level, influenced by a number of simple factors. Did you find the secret area? Did you get hit? Did you go through quickly? It also takes into consideration a combo system, which counts the number of consecutive shots you've landed without taking damage. It's a simple system that rewards skill and practice well. The issue, however, is that it trivializes slower weapons when you can get six hits on enemies that would normally only take one or two. It's a small problem, but a definite oversight.\n\nAnimations Rarely Exceed Substandard\nARES' aesthetic appeal is a mixed bag. In screenshots and stills, the game look marvelous, and rightfully so; the environments are carefully detailed, maintaining a consistent art style that's a pleasure to look at. Sadly, this means little when half of the animations look like something off of an old Flash game. Most of the time, you're too preoccupied by the fast-paced gameplay to notice a laughably strange wiggle-to-death animation, but it becomes hard to forgive when some of the main bosses disassemble in the same spectacularly shoddy fashion. Overall, the graphics are well done but inconsistent.\n\nA Really Excellent Soundtrack\nOne of the best aspects of the game is its soundtrack (which is free to listen to here: http://hyperduck.bandcamp.com/album/a-r-e-s-extinction-agenda ) Electric guitar combines with industrial synth to amplify the already intense environment. It's a really standout part of the game, definitely worth picking up separately.\n\nActually Rather Enjoyable; Short\nAt its best, ARES is explosive. Satisfying shooting, detailed graphics, and a supercharged soundtrack all combine to make ARES' high points memorable. However, the game fizzles out far too soon, lasting only a couple hours. Enjoy it while it lasts; its replay value is limited.","July 7, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any similarities with other famous titles end there, as the flagship high attention to level design that is so present in most installments of Megaman games is completely ignored with this game.\n\nI completed my first playthrough of A.R.E.S. on the "Hard" difficulty so I cant speak for the normal one. As said in my intro the biggest point of disappointment in the game was the level design. There is a total of 5 levels in the game, all but the last one very straightfoward in the sense that you just have to move to the right while killing enemies... But that's it. The enemies are seemingly placed at random in the levels (Which also have almost no variation. We could describe all the scenarios as "orange factory", "red factory", etc) neither enemy placement or overall level details and progression had any though put into it.\n\nAnother point that juts out when playing the game is it's controls. You move with the left control stick and shoot 360º with the other stick, using the "A" button on the xbox 360 gamepad to jump/double jump. You start right off the bat with the ability to double jump and because of that all platforming segments of the game have to be based around it. This is really bad because the jump itself is very awkward, and when most of the game depends on it that can be a very frustrating experience. You will more often than not simply do the "double jump" animation instead of doing the first one, which will make you fall to your death a lot.\n\nAlthough failing a mission is simply considered a "slap on the wrist", because the game instantly lets you continue from the last checkpoint with no "Continues" system implemented.\n\nAnother detail that shows how uninspired the levels are is the fact that all of them have an obligatory "Enemy gauntlet" room, where you have to stay in a single screen fighting some waves of enemies until the game is satisfied.\n\nThe bosses, aside from the last one, are actually ok when compared to the rest of the game. Although they dont have many attack patterns and are mostly just giant damage sponges they are far from the worst problem the game had.\n\nThe game tries to give you various shallow mechanics, like having 2 types of granades that clear different obstacles and having you craft your items (Like grenades, health pickups and upgrades) from fallen enemy parts and even giving you the ability to call from air support to deal damage to all enemies in the screen, but due to the short lenght of the game (About 1,5h from start to finish) they are as previously mentioned shallow and are only there as failed experiments. The game also gives you multiple weapons but I was never complied to use them, prefering to stick to my default blaster that was already upgraded to the final level (3).\n\nOverall A.R.E.S. was a very unpleasant experience, showing that it takes more than a couple of capable people to make a satisfying game. The game is short, uninspired and terribly bland and that's what makes it get an overall 3/10 from me.","June 22, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you defeat enemies and blow up crates, you can find three types of resources which can be used to upgrade your abilities and weapons. You acquire more weapons as you progress through the game.\nThe storyline is nothing amazing, but engaging enough. The game itself looks beautiful and plays like the old Megaman X games on the SNES. The levels have varied enemy types and can be challenging. There are also several difficulty modes and a ranking system based on how well you perform in each level.\nMy only complaint is that it is far too short...with only 5-6 levels, you can finish the storyline very quickly with full upgrades. The DLC for the game simply includes alternate skins for ARES and music, nothing that really adds to the gameplay.\nThe game itself is great, but you don't get very much for what you pay. I also doubt any further DLCs with expanded levels or extras will be added. I hope if they ever release a sequel, it will be much longer.","December 29, 2012","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's short and lacks a certain polish as there are some things that maybe would be better tweaked. All the same, it's rather enjoyable though. Some of the game's flaws in my mind include a rather confusing yet generic story, art that can be hit or miss (the hand drawn elements clash with the CG elements) and a somewhat difficult leveling system due to limited "currency" with which to upgrade weapons and the like. While the negatives seem to be many, they really aren't enough to make the game not worth your while. It has been compared to the likes of Mega Man and there is some truth to that despite the ability to shoot in all directions and level designs and enemy patterns adjusted to that difference. I did purchase this game while it was on sale and I don't regret my purchase. Due to its shortness and a few of its flaws, I hesitate to recommend purchasing it but if you can find it for a good deal, you may not want to just pass it by.

While the shooting is decent along with the weapon variety and the ocasional need to craft grenades to access other side areas you spend alot of the time jumping and for me the jumping in this game felt kinda clunky when sometimes the controls wouldn't respond at all and I was playing with mouse and keyboard because aiming with the right stick on the 360 controller was a pain I couldn't bare. The game relies on the loot that enemies drop, which is three different resources, to craft items such as medkits and grenades and also to upgrade your weapons and grenades. Basicly you're forced to go through the level shooting enemies and if you need going back and killing those enemies again (because enemies respawn as soon as you leave their "area) and sometimes doing some platforming. While the graphicstyle is nothing to brag about it gets the job done and it kinda "fits" the setting of the game. The game gets alot repetitive even though it's extremely short (I've beated it in less than 2 hours) with some ocasional variety everytime you meet a boss. The plot of the game was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it but unfortunately I don't think that alone is enough to recommend this game to any other people.","December 24, 2013","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is. Is it amazing? No, but if you're a fan of Mega Man, it's pretty much as good as you'll get until Mighty Number 9 or something. The artwork is heartbreakingly beautiful and it controls very well. Basically, this game is the child of Cave Story and Mega Man, which is a very natural combo. There aren't too many levels, but they're long. The bosses are gigantic and the fights are very satisfying, but, the plot is...well the plot is kinda iffy at best. The ending is pretty bad too. If you're someone who values a rewarding ending above all, might wanna skip this one. Overall, I recommend it on gameplay alone. The overall pros and cons in my eyes are the following:\n\nPros:\nStunning artwork\nSome Metroid style backtracking with rewards\nGood level design\nDecent platforming\nSoundtrack fits the mood well\n\nCons:\nEnding's a disapointment\nNot much in the way of characters\nSome of the jumps are iffy, not many but some.

While the shooting is decent along with the weapon variety and the ocasional need to craft grenades to access other side areas you spend alot of the time jumping and for me the jumping in this game felt kinda clunky when sometimes the controls wouldn't respond at all and I was playing with mouse and keyboard because aiming with the right stick on the 360 controller was a pain I couldn't bare. The game relies on the loot that enemies drop, which is three different resources, to craft items such as medkits and grenades and also to upgrade your weapons and grenades. Basicly you're forced to go through the level shooting enemies and if you need going back and killing those enemies again (because enemies respawn as soon as you leave their "area) and sometimes doing some platforming. While the graphicstyle is nothing to brag about it gets the job done and it kinda "fits" the setting of the game. The game gets alot repetitive even though it's extremely short (I've beated it in less than 2 hours) with some ocasional variety everytime you meet a boss. The plot of the game was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it but unfortunately I don't think that alone is enough to recommend this game to any other people.","December 24, 2013","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take the role of a powerful robot trying to free hostages from a space station overrun with an army of robts run amok.  The stages scroll both vertically and horizontally, and you earn new weapons each time you defeat one of the boss characters.  You also acquire spare parts that can be "recycled" into repair kits, bombs, and upgrades to your existing weapons.  Using a controller, you have full directional control of your weapon, and you'll eventually earn a Mega Man-style slide to get into small places and attack your enemies.  The game is pretty short but has 2 difficulty levels and Steam achievements to add replay value.  If you're a fan of old-school action-platformers, give this one a try, especially if you find it on sale.  Be careful of scrolling into a new area with a chasm nearby, though; you can accidentally walk off before you're fully aware of what happened.","December 29, 2011","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people compare this game to Megaman X games, others compare it to 2D Metroid games. And unfortunately, in my opinion, it is neither as grand as Megaman in weapons nor as Metroid in the coined "metroidvania" style. It may be, however, the exact opposite: linear levels with arguably-not-really secrets with some extra collectibles and the depth of Metroid's weapons (as in, a few and extremely situational).\n\nAnd if you want a bottom-line here on top, here it is: the game isn't good enough to stand on its legs, plus there's already an "enhanced version" that is the exact same game but slightly "better" in some ways that aren't relevant for this review. If you really want this game, I suggest you buy "A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda EX" instead, the exact same game with two more letters.\n\nAnd if reading the above didn't demotivate you enough, let me guide you in how much I consider this game to have failed over the next few paragraphs...\n\nThe game features 5 stages, which are fairly large, and a boss at the end of each stage. You don't pick stage order, but you can revisit stages you've cleared at a later date, and you're sent on a predetermined path on each stage until you reach its end; there's secret rooms, if you can even call them secret, and some collectibles scattered in some places, plus very little and insignificant alternate paths (as in, choose left or right in a section but the challege is exactly the same until the point where the paths meet)... but exploration is null otherwise. The bosses are fortunately challenging if you're going for the "no damage" achievements, which heavily rely on a mechanic that grants the player "invulnerability" as he dashes, but to use said dash correctly is awkward and in many situations feels forced or too much timing sensitive (as in, do it just a quarter second too soon and maybe a little too far away and you're definitely going to get hit anyway). It reminds me too much of some relatively recent Mega Man titles, but without the cool weapons.\n\nAnd since I brought guns onto the table, why not tell you about them... You get a few different guns, because let's face it: if Mega Man only had the Mega Buster with no upgrades, would you play Mega Man? In ARES it's actually worse, because while each weapon has its own pros and cons, which innevitably translate into the ability to combo hits for a higher score at the end of a stage or being slightly better against a very specific kind of enemy, each weapon doesn't actually feel like a power up: it feels like your main attack suffered deviations and transformed into something... arguably useful or useless depending on the situation. ARES also has litteral bombs, which over the course of the game will eventually become limitless, and bring into quesiton whether you really need the guns if you don't need to move while firing.\n\nSpeaking of firing, how much do you like aiming directly where you want to shoot? "Oh my gosh, I can shoot 360 degrees!", you may say. Yes, true. But personally, I feel like it's the main reason why I don't really care so much about this game. Why? Because not anyone can be a God at aiming with the mouse, especially if while you move the character the angle at which you're firing is altered as you keep the mouse in place in rooms where the camera is fixed to a point. Is it ideal to target specific parts of some bosses? No doubt. But I guess not anyone can be a God at platforming and shooting horizontally with great timing too, which is the Megaman basic formula, so let's not factor this into how good the game is.\n\nOne other thing that bothered me greatly was how obvious ARES was about having been a XBox Live title, and how many of more recent games HAVE to integrate social media into themselves. Yes, I'm looking at you, Facebook, and what revenue extras both you and the developers may get as consequence. Sometimes it does feel that, while obviously the game has the bare minimum qualities to make it shine under a light, the game was made purposefully short for the intent of a quick cash grab. Price of 9,99 for what was barely 2 and a half hours to clear the game with all of the "secrets"? I'm not even going to bother with the achievements, some of which being too annoying to fail at the very last second (my fault, but still too annoying).\n\nAlso if you're considering ARES, remember to look at the trailer and screenshots. You're getting pixel-y models with real models on a fully (low poly) modelled and textured environment. The art style occasionally feels slightly offputting as a consequence, in my personal opinion, but in most locations this may be a blessing of a callback (it reminds me of Megaman Legends a little). If you think you can stomach it without taking some pill, then move on to the demo before making a final decision: that's the smart way to go.\n\nIf you notice, the current Metascore of the game is 68 of 100. Not saying that it's not accurate, but it really depends on how it will impress you in general whether you will love it or hate it. I'm pretty sure that right now you're better off skipping this game and buying the "enhanced version" since you DON'T want to pay for that game after playing this one. Also on the subject of money: the Berzerker suit DLC may be worth it, if you like high-risk with high-reward playstyle, but it mostly shows how useful it is on bosses and some of the more cramped-with-mobs rooms.\n\nIf by this point you're considering buying this game but you're not sure whether to get the complete edition over the regular game, consider if you're likely to like the soundtrack of the game by browsing Youtube for a bit, or judge biasedly from the trailer (which features the boss music, if memory recalls at this point in time). If it's the same music as the remake I say "skip it", but then again, I'll also say the same about the berzerker suit: likely, you'll be buying this game for the exclusive reward on the remake, which sounds to me like a publicity stunt to make some extra bucks out of suckers.\n\nFinal remarks? I'd avoid this game, as you can probably tell. Every day I have more and more trouble giving games that have once been XBox Live or tablet/phone/you-name-it titles because of the disapointed feeling games like ARES give me. But if you like the idea of a Mega Man nostalgia feeling with mouse aim without resorting to things like the AVGN game or some likewise poorer quality titles, ARES delivers a solid yet short experience that will make some sort of impact on you.","February 10, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In ARES it's actually worse, because while each weapon has its own pros and cons, which innevitably translate into the ability to combo hits for a higher score at the end of a stage or being slightly better against a very specific kind of enemy, each weapon doesn't actually feel like a power up: it feels like your main attack suffered deviations and transformed into something... arguably useful or useless depending on the situation. ARES also has litteral bombs, which over the course of the game will eventually become limitless, and bring into quesiton whether you really need the guns if you don't need to move while firing.\n\nSpeaking of firing, how much do you like aiming directly where you want to shoot? "Oh my gosh, I can shoot 360 degrees!", you may say. Yes, true. But personally, I feel like it's the main reason why I don't really care so much about this game. Why? Because not anyone can be a God at aiming with the mouse, especially if while you move the character the angle at which you're firing is altered as you keep the mouse in place in rooms where the camera is fixed to a point. Is it ideal to target specific parts of some bosses? No doubt. But I guess not anyone can be a God at platforming and shooting horizontally with great timing too, which is the Megaman basic formula, so let's not factor this into how good the game is.\n\nOne other thing that bothered me greatly was how obvious ARES was about having been a XBox Live title, and how many of more recent games HAVE to integrate social media into themselves. Yes, I'm looking at you, Facebook, and what revenue extras both you and the developers may get as consequence. Sometimes it does feel that, while obviously the game has the bare minimum qualities to make it shine under a light, the game was made purposefully short for the intent of a quick cash grab. Price of 9,99 for what was barely 2 and a half hours to clear the game with all of the "secrets"? I'm not even going to bother with the achievements, some of which being too annoying to fail at the very last second (my fault, but still too annoying).\n\nAlso if you're considering ARES, remember to look at the trailer and screenshots. You're getting pixel-y models with real models on a fully (low poly) modelled and textured environment. The art style occasionally feels slightly offputting as a consequence, in my personal opinion, but in most locations this may be a blessing of a callback (it reminds me of Megaman Legends a little). If you think you can stomach it without taking some pill, then move on to the demo before making a final decision: that's the smart way to go.\n\nIf you notice, the current Metascore of the game is 68 of 100. Not saying that it's not accurate, but it really depends on how it will impress you in general whether you will love it or hate it. I'm pretty sure that right now you're better off skipping this game and buying the "enhanced version" since you DON'T want to pay for that game after playing this one. Also on the subject of money: the Berzerker suit DLC may be worth it, if you like high-risk with high-reward playstyle, but it mostly shows how useful it is on bosses and some of the more cramped-with-mobs rooms.\n\nIf by this point you're considering buying this game but you're not sure whether to get the complete edition over the regular game, consider if you're likely to like the soundtrack of the game by browsing Youtube for a bit, or judge biasedly from the trailer (which features the boss music, if memory recalls at this point in time). If it's the same music as the remake I say "skip it", but then again, I'll also say the same about the berzerker suit: likely, you'll be buying this game for the exclusive reward on the remake, which sounds to me like a publicity stunt to make some extra bucks out of suckers.\n\nFinal remarks? I'd avoid this game, as you can probably tell. Every day I have more and more trouble giving games that have once been XBox Live or tablet/phone/you-name-it titles because of the disapointed feeling games like ARES give me. But if you like the idea of a Mega Man nostalgia feeling with mouse aim without resorting to things like the AVGN game or some likewise poorer quality titles, ARES delivers a solid yet short experience that will make some sort of impact on you.","February 10, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a game to scratch an itch that only mega man X can scratch, then A.R.E.S. will likely at least partially scratch it for you. It is in many ways similar. The side scrolling, the different types of suits with different weapons for different situations, the hidden power-ups and upgrades are all there.\n\nI would say that my one gripe with this game is that the controls don't feel as tight as a mega man X game...they are responsive and you can play the game and get through levels just fine...but they just don't feel quite as accurately measured, and so as a result I found defeating bosses slightly less satisfying compared to mega man X. I am not sure how to describe it...the sensation you get from those short dashes from the mega man x games...they feel very well measured, and you can get a sort of rhythm going. I didn't get that same feeling from A.R.E.S., which is a shame. It felt a little more like old regular mega man games in this way.

You have a dash, or a roll, which you use by pressing down + jump, and you don't dash+jump like in megaman X to cross gaps. some portions of the game require you to make your own grenades with the synthesis system, since they aren't found in the game.

If you are a completionist this game could take you a good long while to get 100% on. Overall I'd recommend it for 5 bucks.","November 6, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Compairing this to MMX is like compairing an old mutt with cancer to the Alpha wolfs of a large pack: Very wrong. If I had to score it, 3/10. The engine's nice, and it has potentional, but as it is, you need better enime and boos designe.","September 27, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Generic anime art for characters, monsters are generically robotic and have stilted movements, music is repetitive (Get Item fanfare in particular is obnoxious, long, and inappropriately trying to be cool), and any sort of actiony cutscene tries to be cool and fails because its all styleless chilche..\n\nNone of the enemies are fun to fight in any way including bosses.  W+M1 is the way to go for every weapon.  Platformers are one of my fav game types and the platforming in this game is TERRIBLE!  As far as I can tell the game is short too, and there's no real reason to replay any stage except to slightly upgrade stats or grind for items (the game even suggests this!).  Haven't beaten it yet, but my peek at the level select screen also suggests the game is quite short.\n\nI'm glad I didn't pay more than the $1.25 split from Inide Royale, because this game really sucks.","November 25, 2011","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The gameplay is okay, a little awkward for controller to use both sticks to shoot (yes you can use buttons, but trying to aim and not move easier with the sticks).  But my major issue is in the third stage where platforms won't load, picking up an upgrade will port you off the screen and kill you, a check-point will kill you, getting the armor upgrade will kill you. This game has a lot bugs. Otherwise it's all right.","March 14","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has alot of nifty info about the world that is used as collectables for you to find that also give slight powerups. It only has 5 levels so don't expect to play it for long. Even 99% the achievements doesn't take too long if you know what you are doing probably under half a hour, hour tops. IMO the Berzerker suit is op, granted it is dlc but levels 1-4 can easily be played though with it with very little trouble completely removing the need to upgrade other weapons and stuff. The last level makes the suit a little harder to use making you probably need to upgrade 1 weapon (Tho I didn't).\nPersonally I think keyboard and mouse are btter for it than controller, you get alot less control over your blaster with controller, mainly because its controlled with the right stick where as with the mouse it has a target reticle that you can use put on what you want dead and then fire.\nAll in All I'd give it a 8/10","January 4","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
