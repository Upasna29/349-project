So it doesn't take long before it annoys you. The controls for pulling a car over is also quite hard and the combination driving and operating the functions to check and pull over a car is just annoyingly hard.\nThe traffic stops and accidents are a little bit to repetitive, but I really like the procedural part of it.\nThe English dialogue is just weird and doesn’t always feel natural.\nThe radio traffic is just distracting and never actually says anything.\nYou have a partner, which rides with you in the car, but he or she just sits there and never does anything to help or says anything, why even bother, when you aren’t going to do anything with it?\n\nCome on, you got a lot of potential here to make a great game, but it falls short by quite a margin. Please patch and update.\n\nWould I buy it again? A big maybe, it is fun for a while, but it probably will grow old quit fast if it doesn’t get any kind of updates/upgrades.","August 28, 2015","false","6.5"," 75 of 89 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","75","89","6","0"

I ended up watching video reviews online to help me make up my mind.\n\nI'm glad I bought this game. I prefer sims over any other genre, and I always thought a highway police sim would be cool.\n\nPersonally, I really can't understand why there's so many negative reviews. I guess a lot of them were written prior to the updates/patches, which appear to have corrected most of the bugs and glitches. It's really not a bad game at all if you're into simulators. And i think this is where most people make the mistake of reviewing it like a regular game instead of a sim.\n\nIt can become very tedious and involved, and you can easily lose track of time and your surroundings while playing it. But for me, that is essentially what simulators are all about. They do, after all, have to replicate their real life counterparts. So be prepared to spend looooong periods of time driving, inspecting vehicles and talking to drivers.\n\nThat's not ALL there is to do in this game though. You can stop ANY vehicle whenever and wherever you want on the autobahn. You can issue speeding tickets, warnings, fines for offences and defects, and of course arrest the serious law breakers for being under the influence of drink or drugs, or for trying to evade you when you go to pull them over. There's a variety of offences to be found, such as erratic driving, using a mobile phone while driving, not wearing a seat belt, and driving an overladen vehicle.\n\nYou can choose from either a marked or unmarked patrol car each time you leave the police station, and attend accidents, investigate reports of suspicious vehicles, and even pursue and recover stolen vehicles. In the boot/trunk of the car you'll find traffic cones, axle scales, and road warning lamps for securing accident scenes. You'll even be working a mix of day and night shifts.\n\nSooo, let's wrap this up.\n\nPros:\n- Half decent graphics\n- Variety of events and incidents to keep you entertained\n- Extensive procedures for each task\n- Ability to decide what action to take when dealing with drivers\n- 40km of Autobahn to patrol\n- Promotions awarded as XP increases\n\nCons:\n- Blue light is distracting during in-car view\n- Documentation in the game is displayed in German (licenses, waybills etc)\n- Vehicle controls aren't great when using keyboard, so a wheel is recommended\n- An understanding of German traffic law is almost essential with a few of the tasks, as the manual does not explain it\n\nThese are just a few thoughts off the top of my head following a few hours of gameplay.\n\nIn summary, I love this game. It does what any decent simulator SHOULD do. It puts you in someone else's shoes and gives you an insight into a different world. I can see myself playing this for a long time to come, and I personally believe the replay value will be quite high.\n\nI only hope the developers might introduce some more scenarios and vehicles over time.\n\nIf you've been pondering this one. Get it. You won't regret it!","October 11, 2015","true","10.7"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","48","55","5","0"

I have a decent computer - it can play Skyrim, Just Cause 2 and Euro Truck Simulator 2 at either Ultra or nearly Ultra settings... except this game - it can manage only on Medium setting otherwise the frame rate drops to 11/s. "And? Your point being...?" is probably along the lines of what you're thinking so I shall explain. The graphics are terrible and most certainly nowhere near standard for the price and release year.\n\nThe next problem is the impossible controls. *Stand next to car door* "Press F to open" *Spend 3.5 days aiming at the interior before you get the option to drive car*.\n*Long loading screen at 45 f/s*.\n*Turn left gently - back away from the wall you sharply veered into*.\n*Get onto the Autobahn and head to the scene of an incident after wiping out due to the vague controls and having to restart 5 times* *After having done a 3 day long ceremony for the God "Wallaubantraun" you are finally able to step out of the car*\n*6 hours of flipping between controls and the game, you finally manage to talk to someone and find out what happened*\n*Spend ages flipping between controls and gameplay until you flip out, throw your computer out the window.*\n\nAnother problem is the handling. Hold down right mouse button to look when on foot and then have completely impossible vehicle handling where left may be right and no controls means you'll be turning like a spinning top.\n\nI didn't find out too much more after that beyond the game is utterly boring.\n\nGames like this have so much potential, but sadly never deliver.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamernoobjay/recommended/348510/","gamernoobjay","Gamer Noob Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamernoobjay/","106 products in account","If I could sum this game up in just one word it would be 'LAZY'.\n\nNow you may say it's impossible to review a game after just one hour, but I did play this when it first came out in order to do a youtube review however, after playing it back then I decided it simply wasn't worth my time.\n\nI saw from the 3 updates the devs posted on steam that they had 'made improvements', so I figured, as a police enthusiast, I would check them out. Sadly, nothing felt improved and the word LAZY kept popping into my head at every hair raising turn.\n\nSo where to start?\n\nFirstly, I'll get the good out of the way because that shouldn't take more than a few sentences.\n\nAs a cop enthusiast, I have to say the game has some elements that are neat and if the devs hadn't been so LAZY, those elements might have led to some interesting events. The ability to stop vehicles, check lights tires, trunk contents etc are all things I'd enjoy doing in a well developed police simulator, but sadly after the first couple of times, they became repetitive and annoying, mainly due to the character interactions which I'll cover in a bit.  I did like that you could follow a vehicle, trigger an observation and things like no seat belt worn would flag up.\n\nOk, now the now on to the bad.\n\nFirstly, the optimization is terrible.  My rig which happily plays the latest big budget titles on high settings, managed barely a slide show when I ramped the graphics up to high on this one which is crazy given how pathetic and dated the graphics are. Ultra high is an option, but I could only laugh at the thought.\n\nI'll mention the 20 mins I spent on google trying to figure out why I couldn't move my character only to discover you have to disconnect ANY other controller that's attached to your PC.\n\nWe move on to the game play itself.  The first thing you encounter is the facepalm, and I mean FACEPALM driving mechanics. They are truly terrible.  After treacherously weaving my way on to the autobahn, I suddenly released why the devs focused much of the driving on a repetitive straight stretch of road., though even on this straight road, trying to keep your vehicle in lane isn't without its challenges. For a simulator, I wanted to lead by example, demonstrating good careful driving which sadly I never achieved, quite often using the center barriers like bumper lanes at the local kids bowling plex.\n\nWhich leads me on the my next issue. The simulation. Of which by the way there is none. In fact, the word 'simulator' should be forcibly removed from the title. Let's start with the basics, and I really to mean 'basics'.\n\nThere are absolutely zero character animations in this game bar walking and running and even those look terrible.  The simplest and basic animations like getting in and out of your vehicle don't exist. Press F and you teleport from your driving seat to the exterior of your car, and the same in reverse when you get back in.   There are so many simple animations that could have made things a little more immersive such as holding up a radio to your face when speaking dispatch, administering a breathaliser / drug test, taking the drivers papers, checking tires, but nope, that was too far of a stretch for these guys. LAZY!\n\nThen there's the actual interactions with the drivers.  The questions you ask and the answers you get are the same word for word rehashed sentences every single time. After only my first 5 or 6 traffic stops, I could literally predict what was going to be said.  There is obviously only one or two responses for each question in the database, so why the devs didn't bother to actually voice them is a complete mystery. Oh wait. LAZY!  If the driver is standing outside his car, which he will be if you're responding to a car accident, he just stands there with his hands pointing out by his sides, penguin fashion. Apparently having them turn to face you when you speak to them was too much of a stretch for the devs. instead they just stare across the autobahn as though you don't exist. LAZY!\n\nNow lets not forget interaction with dispatch. Again it's the same rehashed replies, but what annoys me even more is that they are instant. Ask to check ID on someone, they reply the second you click your question. They could hace had you wait a few seconds, perhaps giving the response 'stand by whilst I check for you officer', but no. LAZY!\n\nIf you arrest someone, there's no cuffs, no animation, no escort to police vehicle,  they just instaport straight into the back seat, and the entire scene including their vehicle and cones you placed just vanishes into thin air.   Even traffic stops were you issue a simple ticket, sees the car just  'poof' and vanish. I mean seriously? Is it too complicated to script it so it drives off, back on to that long cornerless straight road? LAZY!\n\nAt the start of your shift, you get a female partner who also just appears in your car. She sits there the entire time and NEVER gets out to assist no matter how serious the incident.  LAZY!.  There's no interaction with her, no conversation, nothing. LAZY!\n\nEvery single one of the so called 'dynamically created' incidents that were given by dispatch on my first patrol took place at a petrol station, the suspect vehicle parked in the same parking spot each time.  To frustrate me more, each time the station was on the other side of the autobahn forcing me to drive past it for a few minutes until I reached an off ramp, only to go back the other way for another few minutes till I arrived at the damn thing. I did this so many freaking times it didn't take me long to realise every single off ramp / overpass / on ramp is exactly the same cut and paste job. Same rocks same Y shaped tree, same stretch of road. LAZY!\n\nThere's no script that simulates other road users knowing you even exist. Pull out on to the road or switch lanes in front of one and he'll just carry on ignoring your existence until he smacks in to you. LAZY!\n\nAfter inspecting the contents of a vehicles trunk / boot just a handful of times, you come across the same grouped items over and over again. You'll be amazed just how many Germans carry a teddy bear back there. LAZY!\n\nThe driving controls are dangerous! I'm not talking about the steering here, I'm talking about things like switching your emergency lights on, siren, high beam etc. All done through a point and click menu / sub menu system which you're supposed to do whilst driving your highly volatile death trap on wheels. LAZY.\n\nAnd finally ( could go on by the way). There's the German text you encounter. The game is in english (albeit a German cop sim) but you have to deal with ID's papers and tickets in German and unless you speak the laungage, you'll have no idea what they mean. LAZY!\n\nSo there we have it. Unless you're a complete and utter law enforcement fanatic, you should avoid this lazy train wreck of a game, in fact, avoid it even if you are!\n\nI have precisely 55 mins of game play left for my youtube review before I turn this excuse for a simulator in for a refund.\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!","January 3","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To recommend or to not. I would say that if you want to get enjoyment out of this game you will have to put many hours into it because I'm sure I didn't see all of the scenarios and they could get better the more you rank up in the game. Did I have fun playing the game yes, but that's only because I was recording for my subs. Do I think that I will ever play this game again? Due to the flaws in the game, no the driving pure laggy hell which is weird because you'll be driving a lot in it. The worst part of the game is the physics they're really bad, but that's expected in a simulator game, right? No, it shouldn't why can't any simulator game do proper physics. The gameplay is fine but not amazing. I would only recommend this to a YouTuber to play on their channel, but in general gaming don't bother. Don't just take my word for it give it a watch.

You're entitled to your opinion as I am to mine.  But let me share a bit more of my thoughts on this game:\n\nSeeing as there's no tutorial, the game is only semi-openworld, had terrible handling, didn't have proper controller support, and most of the functions either don't work or are completely non-user friendly, so I'd say I gave it a decent run through.  If a game doesn't grab the player's interest in the first 20 minutes of gameplay, then it's not a good game.  That's the approach I have to games and it's what I use to judge them.  This game just falls into the same category as "Woodcutting Simulator 20XX" where they don't have a polished and user-friendly product and are putting it out anyway.  Other games like Farm Sim, ETS2, and even Construction Simulator 2015 have a decent engine with a fair amount of gameplay but most importantly, they made it user-friendly to make it enjoyable.  This game felt like work.  I'd rather not have to work to enjoy a game.  Which is disappointing, because I would like to find a good police sim...\n\nAnd if you think that those other sims just got it right the first time:  ETS2 evolved to where it is today, from some really bad truck sims.  Farm sim was a mediocre sim in the early years, but was boosted by community addons.  The problem with the "Autobahn Police Simulator" is it's the same company/producers that keep putting one cookie cutter sim after another, and they don't evolve and improve their engine.  They also put very little effort into their userability.\n\nHopefully that clarifies my findings a bit more.  I won't say I'm not biased, because it was fairly apparent what this game was likely going to be like, but I did give it a fair shot to draw me in and it failed to do so.","August 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 64 of 136 people (47%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","47","64","136","18","7"

Totaly unplayable on pc. The vehicle handling is the worst i've seen in a game so far. Super bad framerates, even on low-medium settings on a pc that should be more than capable. This game needs a MAJOR patch before I'd even consider to play it again.","August 31, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The game features a very friendly tutorial that helps ease you into the gameplay and get you ready to take on the campaign. Or you can just jump into 'free roam' and do whatever you like, right from the start!\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are friendly and easy to master.
