You can also use the environment on your\nfavor, like doors , corridors ans such.\n\nSound assests are good. When you mix aliens with explosions, grenade launchers and mayhem,\nit gets really really rewarding.\n\nUsually this game along with others (from Sigma Team) appear on bundles,\nor heavily discounted not only on steam but also in other sites (i.e. Indie Gala).\n\nWhen you are bored, and want a quick and mindless session you can fire a chapter\n, or even play a survival session.\n\nPlay it with v-sync off, to avoid some problems.\n\nIt runs on a toaster, so it's perfect for those (like me) that have ancient hardware around.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302142791","August 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

You also have access to two separate last stand horde modes where you fend off a truly never ending mass of aliens as either a person or a static gun turret until you are overcome for the sake of high scores.\n\nThis time around, you get to pick from a number of different characters each with slightly different stats and in between missions you get access to the shop menu from Alien Shooter 2. The graphics have also been improved to match the later games.\n\nThis is all however, not nearly enough. Alien Shooter wasn't a great game and neither was it's sequel. Simply adding a few features on top of the same old missions does make this worthy of a replay or even a new purchase for newcomers to the series.\n\nThere is nothing really worthy of note in this repackaged version and the updates made are easily forgettable. If you honestly want to play one of the Alien/Zombie Shooter games then you should pick one of the sequels as they are slightly less lacking than the old versions, even "revisited" ones.","May 15, 2013","false","15.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The guns are fun to use but in the later levels, only the minigun types and explosives are worth using, or else you will find yourself seeing the main menu countless of times. I understand the approach this game takes, but making a level difficult isnt about spawning endless hordes of enemies which outgun you, the right way is making the AI more competent ( learn from Nuclear Throne please!!). I got this in a bundle and I am very glad I did as this is one of the worst top down shooter I have ever played. Absolutely cheap difficulty scaling and death!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/33110/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Alien Shooter: Revisted is an updated version of Alien Shooter. It has been ported to an engine that looks very similar to Alien Shooter 2, and comes with all the improvements you might expect from that process. Some of the flaws that haunt the original game still appear in this one, however.\n\nLike you would expect, Alien Shooter: Revisted involves shooting lots of aliens, and that may be an understatement. On some levels your kill count will be up in the thousands. You control with WASD and shoot with the mouse, holding down the left button to shoot and using the cursor to aim.\n\nThe style of this game is an isometric top down shooter. I found that the isometric view could actually be a hindrance at times, with many enemies being hidden along the wall. You will find yourself being injured by aliens that you could not possibly see, and I have a slight problem with that.\n\nThe graphics have been drastically improved from the last version, and some light RPG elements have been added. You can purchase upgrades to your skills or weaponry, however a lot of weaponry can be found in the open throughout the levels. The enemies and characters have some additional detail over the original, and the environments have been give a new coat of paint. This looks more like a commercial title and less like a free flash game that the original did.\n\nThe game still lacks voice acting or much of a story. You just kind of dive in to the scenario, committing genocide without much thought. With Alien Shooter 2 having much more story going on, it makes its absence well missed in this game.\n\nWhile Alien Shooter: Revisted has welcome improvements over the original, it is still missing too much to warrant much of your time. Without much of a story going on, and the upgrade elements still feeling a little too light, I would skip this in favor of Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded or another shooter.\n\nGrade: D+","June 29, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
