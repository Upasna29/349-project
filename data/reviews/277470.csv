It is a standard old-school, turn based battle JPRG along the lines of the Dragon Quest or and original Final Fantasy series with a lot of emphasis on exploration. The dungeons are big, open and detailed. They have a lot of interactive objects with loot hidden in more than just chests and dressers. You will find plenty of characters to join your party hidden throughout the game. These include cows, chickens, men hiding in baskets. Again, you are rewarded for exploration in big ways.\n\nThe game feels free and open after the first area where you can go virtually anywhere you can walk to if not fast travel for gold. Each town feels big, and there are small settlements littered throughout the world map that add a lot to the game. You'll find merchants, shops, shrines and quests in each town, settlement and castle. My only problem is the world map itself for the most part are literally lines of land instead of big expansive plots of land like the towns and dungeons are big and ripe for exploration. The one problem with such big towns is that there is no run button.\n\nOnce you've gone through a tunnel, you have an option when going back into it whether or not to simply travel through it or go into it. Its a nice time saving feature that feels like its not padding the game with wasted time, but you can still go through for those that want to.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll find a choice of casual mode or normal mode. Normal mode feels easy enough, but casual mode has random enemy battles less frequently and you regain health after each battle. Its good to have a choice for people just looking to plow through the game. The random battles are not painfully frequent like in old school Dragon Quest games. Its more like every 40 paces or so. You will find enemies in walls or thieves attack on over world bridges. There are tutorial books littered sparingly throughout maps and having a tutorial book seems odd instead of just having NPCs explain things to you if not have an extensive help feature in the menu.\n\nThere is little enemy variety in the game and you'll see the same enemies from area to area, which is a disappointment. A few enemies are reskins, which I'm fine with, I just wish they did different things. The combat feels pretty shallow and you can use a 'rush' (autobattle) for 99% of battles. The battles are turn based, where you select everything that your party will do on their turn of the battle ala old school JPRGs, then when everyone knows what they'll do a turn happens based on their speed. Quicker characters will take their turn first. It is as old school as possible straight down to map movement moving you an entire body length with each press of the left, right, up or down.\n\nThe skills in battle seem underwhelming if not almost useless except for certain circumstances. At least every character has their own skills so everyone feels unique. You'll gain more skills as you level up. You can even change characters on the fly with the party system. So if you have 3 dead party members, swap them out with living members. There are skills and items to revive people of course.  With the excess amount of accessories, you'll be able to craft the character's stats and resistances to your preference. You'll have to chose different weapons based on stats, do you want this sword to make your character speedy at the cost of damage or have a heavy damager that is slower than enemies? It is a nice sense of freedom from typical armor and weapon upgrades.  It adds something to replayability since you can customize your party so much.\n\nOne downfall if not exploit I have found that I can have 3 party members block and my main hero can destroy every boss. Some bosses throw waves of enemies at you before you get to battle them, which I suppose is a unique take on boss fights, but it could also be seen as useless fluff.\n\nThere is an Asian style to the game that makes it feel fresh, even if I suspect the graphics are from the Samurai DLC pack instead of custom. Even with an Asian style, the characters speak with modern words like 'dude' and 'cool.' I think the game is in on the joke and embellishes on it.\n\nBook of Legends feels very dialog heavy, and offers some fun banter between characters when you search or find treasures, but the actual story is just far too dialog heavy for me and I found myself skipping through everything said. Even the NPCs have a good amount to say instead of just one line throwaway statements. It adds to the immersion even if I can't be bothered by the story when its just paragraphs of dialog.\n\nYou can save in most every settlement, but there is an autosave feature and your main hero can save and fully recharge his energy. Its nice to have just before a boss.\n\nWith all of that being said, are there better RPGs out there? Yes, but this stands out as being better than 99% of the RPG Maker games out there for its sense of exploration, freedom to do as you please and make your own party, customizations and all. I am a big fan of customization and freedom. Is it worth $15? Probably not. Maybe $5 hits the mark.","October 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 111 of 121 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","111","121","0","0"

I hate to dump on indie game developers, but I really can't recommend this game.\n\nGranted, I only played a few hours, so maybe it gets better, but in the time I played the fighting was pretty uninspired. I mostly found myself just fight-buttoning though the same troops of enemies again and again, and I didn't really have to deploy much strategy apart from "One of my moves can only be used with 4 or more enemies, so use that if there are 4 or more enemies."\n\nI really don't care for the writing either. The dialogue between characters seems like a nonstop train of snarkiness that is trying to be playful and funny but I can't say I laughed at any of it. I am 27 and sort of jaded. I may have found it funnier when I was a teenager I suppose. I spent most of the game with two party members, and then when another was potentially going to join me, I had to choose between her and the one I already had. These characters were very cliched "young cute love interest" and "mature sexy woman love interest" tropes straight out of any cheesy harem anime.\n\nWhen I first saw signs of the inevitable relationship building between the two charactres  I had in my party, it felt extremely forced and stereotypical. All of a sudden the hardened ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ warrior reveals a deeper side through referencing his tough childhood. Of course.\n\nThe art is good, and the plot was at least interesting enough to keep me paying attention to it for the short time I played. The dialogue, characters, and combat are what ultimately made me give up on this game after just a few hours. Best of luck to the developer on future games, and I hope my rather harsh review has at least a little bit of helpful criticism.","March 24, 2014","false","5.4"," 193 of 259 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","193","259","3","10"

The fact that every time one of the characters makes a 'joke' the author had to add 'ahaha' at the end of the line really gets to you after a while. The dialog is lengthy and not well written. It's also quite repetitive and after some time you really have to force yourself to still pay attention to it.\n\nIt's a typical RPGMaker game in presentation, but I have to admit that the graphics and music are well chosen, The locations are again lengthy and exploring them grants you a lot of usable items, but sadly not enough equipment. Which brings me to my main complain about this RPG.\n\nThe game is unbalanced. Heavily unbalanced on multiple levels. The first 'dungeon' is far too easy and your character way overpowered. You continue and gather other characters and the game is still way too easy and that's not because I gained too many level early on. A level up in this RPG basically has no effect on your combat performance except when you get a new skill. The increase in HP and attack power are so minimal that it's hardly worth to grind at all. In terms that means that you have to rely on equipment to give you the needed boost to get better in combat. For a good amount of the game that doesn't matter much as the 'mob' fights are ridiculously underpowered and you won't have a problem at all, but in boss fights it shows that something isn't exactly working out. You can still push through those with a bit of tactic and luck, but it's starting to get really frustrating.\n\nAt some point the game forces you to play as a group of characters that are completely underpowered. Only one of them has magical abilities and they aren't very powerful. This is when the game grinds to a halt. You can't make them stronger by leveling up nor can you get better equipment. So every tougher fight is a pure gamble if you'll get through.\n\nSo far that's not too bad, but add to that one enemy that always attacks first, has a quite strong AOE spell that costs you about 50% of your HP and is nearly not hittable because it dodges every attack. I'm not kidding. In random encounters those enemies flee after a couple of rounds, but then you run into a forced encounter with three of them and they don't flee. I tried it five times, each time grinding a level for each character more and there's no way to get past them except for getting extremely lucky and hitting them with every attack.\n\nI don't like not finishing a RPG, but this one is just so annoying to play that I won't try to push through. Don't waste 14 hours on this one like I did and get a better RPGMaker game instead.","August 11, 2015","false","14.3"," 78 of 91 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","78","91","0","0"

The game features some really nicely detailed artwork, character portraits and profiles are especially well-done.\n\nBattles play out in the expected manner typical of the genre, with combatants taking turns to attack each other, use skills, defend, etc. There are plenty of skills on offer for each of the characters, ensuring that combat doesn't become tiresome. Many skills take both your character's statistics and enemy numbers into account, allowing for a decent amount of strategising during combat. New skills are unlocked as your characters gain levels, providing new ways to overcome enemies. Encounters sometimes start with an ambush, or with you ambushing your foes, which mixes things up somewhat when you're fighting. You always have the option to run from battle as well if you don't fancy your chances against your adversaries. The enemy sprites are all quite detailed, with some quite elaborate designs in there too. Status elements, both positive and negative, element-based skills and weaknesses are all present and accounted for and as always, monsters drop both exp and gold when defeated. Equipment can be attached to five different slots per character, comprising of weapon, shield, helmet, armour and accessory respectively. I've yet to complete the game (and by all accounts it's a sizeable adventure) but what I played was well-balanced in terms of challenge and I never felt the need to level grind. The bosses represented a reasonable challenge but nothing insurmountable. The encounter rate is nicely balanced (with different rates for the game's two difficulty modes) and doesn't feel too frequent or intrusive as you explore various locations in the game.\n\nThere's good attention to detail in the environments, treasures are scattered throughout each area, encouraging players to venture off the beaten track. The tilesets that make up the game's locations are well-utilised to minimise repetition, with little touches such as animals being scattered throughout the many locales adding life to the world. Another thing that impressed me with the environments was the amount of scenery that be interacted with to elicit some type of comment or remark from your character, a little detail that is far too often overlooked, especially in modern titles. It really harks back to the glory days of the 16-bit rpgs and some of the habits players picked up during that generation are recognised and rewarded here. It's a very self-aware game and it uses that to subvert the player's expectations at several moments during the game - there's plenty of flavourful dialogue and choices, primarily from the main character, Jordan and it only gets better as additional characters join the party, there's some entertaining exchanges between party members, even early on in the game. Indeed, the entertaining ensemble is definitely one of the highlights here and In some ways it's quite reminiscent of the self-satire seen in the Disgaea series, though the script could use some editing here and there to give it a little extra polish before it approaches that level of finesse.\n\nIf you were a fan of 16-bit era rpgs and lament their absence in recent years, I'd expect that, like me, you'll find something to love here. It's good to see more titles like this finding a home on Steam.","March 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 124 of 162 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","124","162","0","4"

The price is currently at 80% of Baldur's Gate, and the price is higher than several far better JRPGs.\n\nEssentially, this game seems like a very high quality work of a high schooler, who put a lot of work into it. There is a story, many areas to discover, a variety of companions to join the party, and lots of optional sidequests.\n\nThe weakest point of the game is the intro. For the first hour, combat is trivial, boring, and unavoidable. Gamebalance also often relies on the player doing some things which the player can't know about - Didn't find some hidden party members? Combat will be easy until the next boss fight, then you're screwed. Didn't grind to buy that awesome sword before moving to the next continent? You'll now have to grind at least 30 minutes more to become strong enough to continue.\nThis will get better over time. Once there are ~6 party members all at level 20-30, combat becomes less trivial and the game doesn't try as hard to screw you for not findiong a hidden party member or item.\n\nThe second weakest point is the writing. The dialogues are okay, but not great. This is where the impression that the game was written by a high schooler comes from. Humor is attempted. The entire setting is not fleshed out and the story is simple. There is dialogue tough, which does at least make the party members somewhat likable.\n\nThe third weakest point is the combat system. Some stats make a huge difference, but the entire combat system is not documented, not even on the developer's forum. You have spells to create or cure status effects which are not explained. You have abilities that cannot be used in some fights. You have new weapons that increase the damage dealt by a factor of 10 or 20.\n\nSUMMARY: The story is weak, the game takes a while before combat becomes non-trivial, and in the early game the game balance often depends on doing things "right" without having any clue what "right" is.","May 16, 2014","false","43.5"," 95 of 122 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","95","122","0","0"

The skills and combat seem good, and the dialog isn't bad. Although as other have said, it seems every other line from the main character is sarcastic.\n\nThe main breaking point for me is the leveling. I was somehow able to beat the first boss, mainly due to the fact the main character has a skill which makes the first chapter a cake walk. But the next area, I got one shotted time and time again.\n\nMy main character is able to withstand any foe, but every supporting character I have just gets 1-2 shotted. I even tried grinding a bit, but after several hours? (it felt like that), I feel my characters still aren't there. The weapons and armor didn't seem to help much, and many items seem very expensive for the area.\n\nI would recommend this game to someone who has a kid that can burn many hours on it, but as far as JRPGs go, I think your time is better spent elsewhere.","May 28, 2015","false","10.1"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","58","68","0","5"

Casual mode slightly lowers the encounter rate, allows partial healing after battles, and auto-saves after every fight as opposed to after every ten fights.The Book of Legends plays out similarly to a Star Ocean game in that the overall plot, including major boss battles, is scripted while player decisions influence the trajectory from Point A to Point B.The game has 31 potential party members, including a slew of talking animals, so players have a lot of characters to keep track of.The game requires some grinding here and there, but unused characters gain partial EXP from battles. Babysitting is unavoidable, especially when new recruits join at low levels, but partial EXP gain is better than none at all.The best part of The Book of Legends is the music.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/277470/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","Book of Legends is one of the best RPG Maker JRPGs I've played so far.  The battle mechanics are very basic - you have your Fight, Skill/Spell, and Item options, as well as Rush (everybody attacks random enemy) and Escape, but it's the quality and quantity of content that make this game.\n\nThere are tons of playable characters, and most of them are well written and often have something interesting and/or funny to say when you speak to NPCs.  Jordan, the main character, is, well, an ♥♥♥, who doesn't shy away from telling people what he really thinks of them, or from poking fun of standard JRPG tropes such as NPCs who just stand around saying the same line all day.\n\nI was surprised when the game offered me the choice to kill the first potential companion who offered to join, a cute anime girl at that.  There was very reasonable (paraphrased from memory) explanation of "You just tried to kill me, and when that didn't work you know offer to work for me?  How can I trust you not to try to kill me again when my back is turned?"  I chose that option, and the story went along with it.\n\nBy the end of the game you'll have many characters accompanying you - some optional, some required.  You can only have 4 members in the active party, but you can juggle your party around any time outside of battle/cutscene.  Inactive party members still gain experience when the party wins battles, but at a greatly reduced rate.  Still this keeps them useful when it's time for boss battles which often require you to field two to three non-overlapping parties for concurrent fights.\n\nThere are tons of side quests, secrets, items, spells/skills, etc to keep a JRPGer occupied, and I found the story and dialog well written and engaging.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the main character is ridiculously overpowered for the starting area, and can still easily solo most enemies for some time afterwards - but he is supposed to be a badass after all.  Don't worry, battles come soon where you actually have to rely on your companions.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that while the game has "random" encounters, the time period between the encounters is not random.  In Casual difficulty you'll have an encounter every 50 steps, and in RPG difficulty every 40 steps.  I found this a very welcome change of pace from JRPGs who seem to throw you into combat every couple steps.\n\nMy only issue with this game was from the UI perspective.  It's generally pretty good, but a couple pieces of missing functionality stood out:\n\n1.  The game has plenty of status effects which your characters can deal out or be dealt in combat, but no explanation of just what those effects do.  "Poisoned" and "Paralyzed" are self-explanatory, but "Diseased", "Dazed" and "Distracted"?  And after beating the game, I still don't know what the difference between "Paralyzed", "Lost" and "Numb" is (though based on observation I think Lost enemies took more damage or were more susceptible to critical hits).\n\n2.  When shopping for equipment, you only see which of the 4 characters in your active party can use any given piece - to know if any of your dozen+ reserve members can use it before buying, you gotta swap them in.  And lack of item descriptions for equipment in the inventory means that not only do you know know which character can wear that "Full Moon" you just found, but until you find one that does you don't even know which equipment slot it's for!\n\nTL;DR I recommend this game to any fan of the JRPG genre.","July 20, 2014","true","44.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

I almost NEVER replay games more than once because I have only limited time.  However, the Book of Legends was enjoyable enough that it makes me want to replay to see a different ending and try out different characters.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy unique characters, meaningful player decisions, important party decisions and an oldschool style of difficulty that features some tough boss fights and requires a bit of leveling up.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from others is the fact that you make actual meaningful decisions that can affect the plot, your party's competition, and the ending.  There are 31 characters in the game (some are well hidden) and you get to pick who to allow to join you, who to use, who to level up etc.  It's pretty interesting and it isn't simply about leveling up the "4 best" characters.  Some boss battles require you to have 2 or even 3 parties of 4 characters so your choices about who to pair together adds an element of strategy.  In the first few hours of the game, decisions you make will actually affect you throughout the game, which is pretty rare to see these days.\n\nEach of the characters have interesting personalities and are pretty unique.    They have fun personalities and the dialogue between them is often funny and usually interesting and well written.   The main character is a bit of a jerk and very sarcastic with often hilariously rude replies.   The plot itself is quite good and there's lots of sidequests. I finished the game in about 39 hours, completing 8 of the 27 quests.  I also did some optional stuff in the arena.  The speedrun for beating the game is 20 hours or less, but I recommend taking your time and it would be pretty difficult without building up a few extra levels as well.  There's lots of NPCs to talk to in each town and lots of side paths to explore in both the dungeons and world map.\n\nThe Book of Legends reminds me of an oldschool RPG in that it can be quite difficult.  Combat can be pretty challenging, especially bosses.  Even when I thought I'd powerleveled quite a bit for a boss fight, I'd end up getting a challenging fight so that was enjoyable.  When you reach a new area on the map, the regular enemies are pretty tough but as you level, they get easier.  Combat itself is pretty good.  There's a nice "rush" feature that lets you stomp easy enemies quickly,\nthe characters have quite a few skills and it is cool to try different combinations of parties.  You also have the choice of trying to keep all of your characters high level, or just focusing on certain characters.\n\nThe world itself is quite huge, dungeons are big and sometimes require multiple visits to get all the way through.  There are many hidden areas in the game.  Finding hidden secrets in dungeons and even on the world map is fun and rewarding.  It is also worth noting that there is a strategy guide available for sale on Adorlea's website.  I finished the game without it, but I did read up on the forums a few times.  I played the game in "RPG" mode which is the more difficult version of the two.\n\nAs far as negatives, I would say that the first hour of the game is actually the worst.  For a long time, I was lost in the forest with a stupid dead rooster, wandering aimlessly.   Luckily, the game gets a LOT better.  Also, you can get a free sample of the strategy guide which has a map of the forest, which I found was the most confusing map in the game.   The economy in this game is VERY tight.  The best weapons and armor are EXPENSIVE and even getting enough healing and magic potions\ncan be pretty expensive.   Also, due to the difficulty of bosses, you'll need to grind levels for both money and xp.  This can be a bit dull, but it was pretty much the norm for old school RPGs so I didn't mind it too much.  I probably spent about 3 to 4 hours building levels and getting money (while raising up weaker characters as well) out of the 39 hours played.\n\nThere are a few optional bosses that are really really tough and the game doesn't necessarily warn you about it, which I didn't like.  (The cave early in the game is the worst offender) Just remember to save before a boss and that you cannot beat everything right when you fight it. Some stuff you have to come back for later.\n\nOverall, the Book of Legends is a real gem of an RPG.  The unique characters, humor, strategic party composition, important player decisions, solid plot, and massive replayability make this game stand out.   There's a bit too much grinding but the end result is well worth it.  The only game I could compare this to might be Suikoden V, due to the amount of playable characters in both games.  However, the characters in BoL have more personality and you get to choose which ones to use in a more impactful way.

With my ever growing library of hundreds of titles gained with bundles or purchases on the Steam market, I now have time to tell the world what I think.\n\nWhen you start BoL, you will get bored, the game DOES in fact pickup after about an hour or so. The start of the game is just anticlimactic and that's not so bad, many RPG or JRPG can start off this way. Once you really put in the time you will notice that BoL has loads to offer you. You will acquire and have many companions to chose from in your party's organization, with different equipables and abilities. This can be quite nice over some other RPG Maker titles that only give you an initial party and about 3 hours of game play. You also have a nice variety of side quests and the main story to keep you entertained for a number of hours and I have seen players reach over 50+ hours when going to fully complete the game.\n\nThe main thing that BoL has going against it is the large price of $15. This price isn't that intimidating when picking up the game from a bundle, trade or Steam sale. So I recommend buying the game when it's on some sort of sale.\n\nI'll be giving this game a 8.5/10 and strongly recommend you give it a try and remind you again to at least play through the boring intro to hit the games real stride of content.","May 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

Kinda what I was expecting from an RPGmaker game experience. Except, the main character's personality is really rude. I wonder if he will change over the course of the game?\n\nI am about 12 hours into it and am ready to take on the second demon in the storyline.\n\nFor me, the pacing of the game seems slow. Stopping every so often for a fight feels like a destraction.\n\nI enjoy clicking on the animals in the game. You get some funny things. I think the best so far is when I 'speak' to cats in the game and the game makes a 'meow' sound. It is this sound that freaks out my cat in real life thinking that there is another cat in the house and she is confused about it.\n\nMore details later as I progress through this game.","September 7, 2014","true","64.9"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","25","33","0","2"

I played the original version for the first time two years ago and I loved it. Since the game is now on Steam, I'd like to share my impressions here:\n\nIt starts quite "traditionally" - a simple task for a "saviour of the world" hero. Things become more complicated very quickly, though. I won't spoil the story, but let's just say it's both adventurous and thrilling, with plenty of twists. Plus, the main protagonist isn't the "classical" hero. He's more selfish and self-centered, which adds spice to the story.\nChoices have impact on the story, too. You can't have all characters in the same playthrough, because you have to choose between some of them. This alters dialogues, accessible areas and battle strategies.\nSpeaking of characters, there are plenty of them, both human and animal. Some of them like each other, some of them don't, so party banters are really entertaining sometimes. Some of the characters are even more powerful when fighting side to side.\n\nFights are classical turn-based, but with lots of added depth - countering spells and attacks, equipment for regenerating health or mana, multiple-hits weapons etc. Difficulty tuning is great, normal fights are easy (especially with top equipment), but boss battles are really tough, often with adds and multiple rounds, requiring different parties and strategies. For extra challenge there are also arena (Colliseum) and "challenge tower".\n\nThe gaming world is fairly big, with many town, dungeons and hidden places. Dungeons have many sideways and optional areas, usually with stuff that is worth the extra effort. "Exploration pays off" is certainly true when it comes to TBOL. Once you go through a dungeon for a first time, you can automatically "go through" next time. This makes exploring more enjoyable, too.\nProgression through the game is quite nonlinear, especially when playing on RPG difficulty. There are many optional places you can visit, but you aren't strong enough for them yet. This makes you to backtrack from time to time and test your newly acquired "toys" (= spells and equipment) against tough enemies.\nThe replayability is also pretty good, considering all the choices and secrets that are often easy to miss.\n\nOk, to sum it up. We have good story, dialogues and gameplay. It's a "solid foundation", but what really makes TBOL so special in my eyes is the the sense of achievement, the way how the game rewards you for knowledge of its mechanisms and thorough searching. You can rush it on lower difficulty and call it "fun". But try again in RPG mode, with all sidequests and bonus stuff, and it's a completely different experience. And then, when you unleash all of your hard earned powers against an enemy you previously considered to be challenging, you feel as true heroes. Few games can make this that well.\n\nFor me, TBOL is definitively "more than sum of its parts". I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I strongly recommend to test the demo and give it a chance. Even now, after two years, when playing it again, the game still amazes me.","March 15, 2014","true","11.3"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","51","80","0","0"

I've always been hesitant because RPG Maker games, a genre that I like very much (if well made), are often not being treated with much love here. Seeing the release of The Book of Legends made me change my mind.\n\nThis game is not just "well made", it's fantastic. It's undoubtedly one of the best games I've ever played.\nAt first I felt a bit repelled by the main protagonist. He's really not what you'd expect a hero to be like. He's grumpy and rude and not friendly at all, but the dialogs with him turned out to be a lot of fun to read, much like dialogs in general contain a lot of humor in this game. What makes them even more interesting is that they depend a lot on who you have with you. For instance, a conversation with an NPC guard in the town Zenna is hilarious - but only when playing with Princess Melusine.\n\nWhich leads me to the greatest feature of the game: You can choose who to play with. Several times you'll have to decide whether to keep or get rid of characters and who else you want to add to your party. There's a variety of different combinations, which makes replaying the game a whole new experience. All the characters have different skills and abilities and different strengths, so you'll have to come up with new tactics in every playthrough. In addition there are loads of hidden characters to discover, like animals that will support you with their special skills. One animal for instance can decrease the chance of being ambushed, which helps tremendously in a certain area. There are also some very valuable, yet optional human characters that will join you (if you find them).\nWhat I appreciate a lot is that not only the actively fighting members level up. Also the rest will gain experience points, so you don't have to spend hours on grinding.\n\nMaps are made with much love and many details. Exploring thoroughly pays off as there are loads of secrets to be found, including some unexpected things like a chest that will refill several times during the game. Also there are many sidequests to solve, and some are pretty tricky!\nYou can even unlock new places to visit, for instance as a reward for finishing a quest.\nAlso, the artwork is stunning. The characters look just amazing.\n\nThe battle difficulty depends on whether you choose "Casual Mode" or "RPG Mode" at the beginning of the game. Casual is easier, plus you gain back some HP after each battle, which is a great help and you won't need too many restorative items. You can get through the game without doing a lot of levelling up - although the boss battles can be quite tricky and tough, forcing you to choose your parties wisely and use the right tactic. Very thrilling and a lot of fun!\nFor me Casual Mode is exactly the difficulty that I like; it's very well balanced.\nThus I personally haven't tried RPG, but it's certainly a much bigger challenge.\nThe game features random encounters, which at first I wasn't too happy about. But the encounter rate is perfect, so fighting doesn't get boring. Also, there's such a big variety of enemies, so battles are quite diversified.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is the way the Colyseum is set up. Much too hard at the beginning, so you gotta keep it for later. The humans enter in pairs, but you can only put in every character once, which will be reset every time after killing a demon. You can't return there after every demon though, so if you keep it until late in the game, you can't have all the characters participate.\nIt's not really disturbing though since the Colyseum is 100% optional and not important at all for the game.\n\nAll in all the game is awesome. No matter how many times I play it, it never gets boring. I highly recommend everyone to give it a try - maybe even those people who don't hold RPG Maker games in high esteem. Give it a chance, you might be positively surprised!\nI would love to see more games like this on Steam in the near future!","March 23, 2014","true","49.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"

The dialogue was ok but probably contained a bit too many jokes and lacked seriousness, Though I did enjoy the jokes. The difficulty curve was probably the worst part. It was harder early on and a small part of the middle. But later on it became too easy and the bosses were way too easy.\n\nI loved that you could get lots of animals to join your party.\n\nTo sum it up:\nA fun game but the difficulty curve needs improvements.","March 26, 2014","true","26.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Also, the game has no "world map" which can be really tricky sometimes... even for the ones who like dungeon exploration.","October 18, 2015","false","2.2"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","0"

The game itself is pretty basic, you fight similar enemies with similar skills the whole way though. Once you get a few more party options the game gets a little more interesting. I am satisfied with the amount of grind to it (so far very little), but the combat is uninspired to say the least. I have to say that the story and characters are well worth pushing through the game. They interact enough that they're memorable, but not so much that the game is centered on interactions. It's good for a few hours of fun at the very least.","August 22, 2014","true","4.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyrilee/recommended/277470/","lyrilee","LyriLee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyrilee/","154 products in account","On one hand, this game has a lot going for it. The main character is a little annoying, but in a likable way for the most part. The flavor text for checking random things in the environment and responses to NPCs are very enjoyable and I think what really makes this game worth the play through. It's also rather expansive. I can normally keep track of the map of a dungeon in my mind as I play through an RPG, but most areas in this game are so large that I can't do that in TBoL. I like to explore everything, so it lead to me being really overleveled at the end of the game.\n\nThere is nothing special about the combat. There are a couple of fights that you have to figure out the tricks to win them, but all and all, very run of the mill. You occassionally have to split your party to take care of multiple fights at once, I found that more annoying than innovative, but that's just my own 2 cents.\n\nI will say some of the character interaction is just downright silly. You beat a boss, and then you're given the option to kiss one of your team mates. No, that's a terrible way to do that. This does not happen in normal interaction with people. You don't just kiss people because YOU want to. They should have added some text that suggests the character would like to kiss you as well, and then give you the choice. It's a two person action, and I find it almost borderline offensive that it's handled the way it is. But that really is its only flaw. And I'm sure many people played it without taking issue with that portion.","March 8, 2015","true","46.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"
