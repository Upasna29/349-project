Not as involved as later titles in the series, and if you're on a post-Vista and/or 64-bit system, you'll need a custom patch to play it. I still recommend it if that sort of casual time-killer is your thing.","November 25, 2013","true","4.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/recommended/15900/","serieus1","Serieus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/","2327 products in account","7 Wonders II offers a match 3 game where you have to drop building blocks to the bottom of the field so that workers can collect them and build the 7 wonders of the world.  The gameplay is simple and casual as it should be.  There are extra bonuses during each game where if you can match 3 within a specific colored area then you can access bonus games.  These bonus games are timed and also limit the number of moves you have.  You have to figure out how to drop a star in the field to the bottom within those number of moves.  All in all, the game is a normal match 3 game, but it doesn't stand out like Bejeweled or other well developed match 3 games.  I wouldn't recommend this game because it gets lots in the large amounts of match 3 games that you can find out there with better delivery for better entertainment.","January 3, 2015","false","9.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It great for casual gamers and great for kids to play around with. You find 3 or more matches to progress through each level. Its great fun and really easy to understand. This is highly recommended for casual gamers.","March 30, 2015","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Really enjoyed them both. Took about 4.5 hours to complete this whole game, but being a puzzle game, it has high replay value. I liked this one more than the original game. It still has the same overall game mechanics but without the rotating of the board. The original was more challenging for sure.\n\nThere's not really much to say. It's a standard match 3 game like Bejeweled. There's the 7 Wonders theme, but no story. I still find this to game to be the most fun in this genre besides Bejeweled. After playing both the original and the sequel, I will continue to play other games in the series.","May 18, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gummywormz/recommended/15900/","gummywormz","Gummywormz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gummywormz/","592 products in account","It's a generic match 3 puzzle game with some extra goals tossed in. You have to break all the background pieces by matching blocks on them. This gets really tedious for the bottom row and corners, so much so that you pretty much HAVE to have a block destroying spell with you at all times. You also have to get a large, immovable block all the way down to the bottom of the screen. This is also annoying but not nearly as bad as getting all the background destroyed. You can unlock a secret world by matching a certain color in a certain spot, but you can only do this once per world. Therefore, it takes at least 3 playthroughs to maybe come close to getting it. It's pretty generic. Nothing special in graphics or music, and is in my opinion not worth $5. If you like match 3 puzzle games then for half off maybe. Otherwise this is an easy skip.","January 3, 2014","false","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/15900/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","This is your typical Match 3 like Bejeweled. In each level, you match up 3 or more stones of the same color to reach your goal. There are also extra objectives on each level, like making a match with a certain color in a designated spot. There are different powers to get that you can charge up and use which make the game a little easier. Lots of secrets to unlock. As you progress, you get stones to help build a wonder.\n\nThe graphics are quite colorful. The music is non-offensive. No complaints about the controls.\n\nNot a bad little match 3. These don't keep my interest for long, but this had enough going on for it that if I wanted to play something like that, I might as well pick it.  Recommended if you like Match 3 puzzle games and are looking for more.\n\nGrade: B-","June 12, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are better ones, maybe even cheaper, but you also need to know that this isn't so bad. Almost 10 hours that i have spent playing this game is enough to say "yup, it wasn't waste of money". If you enjoy 3-match puzzle games then think about getting 7 Wonders II. Maybe not for full price, but on sale - why not.\n\nKeep in mind that it may not work on modern operation systems - i'm still on Windows XP so i haven't got any problems, but if you are using Windows Vista/7/8 then you can have extra trouble getting to run this. Remember to always check system requirements to avoid any problems.","February 1, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The aim is to collect building blocks to aid your workers in completing "Wonders" of the World. There is next to no challenge involved in this game, as you have an silly amount of time on each stage to complete your task. Coupled together with the power-ups you collect as you progress further into the game, you find yourself creating the wonders quicker than ever.\n\nI play this game on a regular basis as it is a casual, easy to pick-up and play game that you can spend hours on, trying to get an even higher score. This is also one of the handful of games which carry a demo on Steam, so you can pick that up and see if its your cup of tea.","December 20, 2014","true","14.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"
