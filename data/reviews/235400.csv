This started as Facebook game (which is where I tried it initially, long enough to see all the features) with microtransactions and a wait-or-pay-to-play system. Facebook login is not required to play unless you want any of the sharing features or cross-platform play with browser and mobile. Typical for this kind of game, you can expect constant "share this with your friends!" prompts and an unskippable mission to send gifts to friends, and so on.\n\nThe combat system isn't as interesting as the true King's Bounty games: gone are the three hero classes and the skill trees. No mana management, you have to purchase scrolls for each spellcasting. You don't lose troops, you just pay gold to resurrect them. Units can always move their full movement and attack or fire. Units are missing some interesting abilities they have in the "real" games. Side-note: animations are also inferior-looking and don't have the wacky character of the originals.\n\nThe overworld map shows its flash game origins and is a far cry from the gorgeous 3D maps of the original games. The quests are given in the usual dry facebook game style, and I haven't detected the trademark humor of KB:TL either.\n\nOnly redeeming factor would be maybe the presence of a PvP option, or the simple progression system which allows you to upgrade the stats of your units, as well as a simple crafting system.\n\nOverall unless you're really interested in the social aspects or you're desperate to play this on your phone, I don't see a good reason why you'd play this instead of buying King's Bounty: The Legend. If you don't have it yet wait for the next bundle where you'll be able to get it for under 4$. (Google the "Wars of Ages" bundle for instance, should be up until mid-january 2013.)","December 10, 2013","false","2.4"," 1,275 of 1,404 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","275","1","5","13"

All of the elements that made the previous games interesting were removed or tweaked to provide the most bland and generic experience possible to the player.\n\nIn this game, there is no specialisation, you can spend your gold on marginal upgrades for units and spells, but cost scaling and level requirements for these upgrades is made in such a way that you can't just decide to dump all your gold into spells and rely on them. Especially since you can't learn spells, you have no mana, you have to buy scrolls, every time you use a spell you need to use a scroll.\n\nWhen it comes to army building, there isn't much to it unless you are willing to pay, you have access to some basic units from shops, and a few advanced units as quest rewards, but only enough to show you what these units can do and encourage you to purchase more at the real money shop. You just don't get the satisfaction of doing your best with limited resources like you did in the previous games, especially since morale mechanics and most of the units special effects were removed.\n\nFinally,  you don't have to select your battles like in the previous games, here you simply progress from one area to another with the ability to grind when you feel you aren't strong enough to take on the next challenge.\n\nThe only thing that's left from the previous games is the turn-based gameplay, which just isn't enough to hold the game together without the strategic elements that the previous games had.","December 10, 2013","false","2.8"," 107 of 123 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","107","123","0","0"

I own all the games on that other, DRM-free site, and two games over here. I have hundreds of hours put into them, collectively. When I read a positive, recent review of this game, I thought I'd give it a try. I lasted only 12 minutes. During that time, I was nagged to log in and share things over Facebook NINE TIMES. In TWELVE MINUTES. Kill something? Share it on FB! Find a component? Share it on FB! Your wizard cast a spell? Why not share it on FB? Your warrior had an itch on his groin during combat and used the elven healer's pointy left ear to scratch it? Hey, I have an idea - you could share it on FB!\n\nAt one point, I was actually informed of a feature that could ONLY be unlocked if I logged into FB.  That was enough for me.\n\nSeriously. Nine times. In twelve minutes. It's like the first time I discovered my father's box of Playboy magazines, only not nearly as pleasant.

The main problem with King's Bounty: Legions is there's a lack of elements which makes grid combat interesting such as distance on ranged attacks, obstructions, and positioning! The game will also persistently bug you about sharing things to Facebook, I feel it sort of belongs there amidst all the other games that require you to fall into zombie state to play.\n\n“Amazing job.”\nKotaku\n\nI hope that's sarcasm Kotaku, or an unfinished paragraph.","December 11, 2013","false","0.7"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","1"

It was made by the same Katauri studio, which resurrected King's Bounty title in the first place. If you familiar with some of those King's Bounty games, you'll feel yourself like at home at the start.\n\nBut, but, but... the farther you go, the more you need dozens and hundreds of gaming friends on the Facebook, along you, to continue playing. Why? Firstly, friends are to send you some little, yet useful gifts, which you are need to strengthen up your army. And even with that help, you'll be grinding helplessly for missing ingredients. Secondly, some quests supposing that you're going to beat some tough enemies, which can be done only with help of friends.\n\nWhy I'm talking about Facebook friends so much? For it's not the game FROM Facebook. It still runs ON Facebook, and Steam there acting just as middleman. If you don't have Facebook account or if your account is made not for gaming (like you don't want to invite hundreds of unknown people just to play along them) - you can start the game, but certainly you will not succeed in King's Bounty Legions.\n\nSo don't start. It is just another grindfest, where you can't play like you want it, but need to wait until some hero's "energy" replenishes, which takes hours of real time. You can't get very far in it without supplement of at least 10-20 constantly playing facebook "friends". And you'll need hundreds of hours to achieve same things as normal game will give you in 10 hours...\n\nMark 5/10. Time-wasting facebook grindfest game. There are so many more "free-to-play" games on the market, that are much better in terms of gameplay, even if they might not look so gorgeous as "Legions". And there are original single-player King's Bounty games, which are good. Just not mess with "Legions", it's a bad idea, that will turn you down after some time.","January 8","false","13.1"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","54","63","2","0"

Abusive F2P model that utterly ruins the Legacy of the King's bounty series, with a broken system of getting party members & getting the members you want is extremely expensive, & easy to abuse with Real money currency.\n\nSadly the very introduction of the Real money system is what breaks the entire system, as it massively inflates the cost of the buyable party members, to the point, of it being unreasonable to even attempt to keep a full party worth of each type of minion you have.  It also makes the 'free' premium characters you get worthelss after a few levels gained because you can't keep pu their numbers, and they become weaker then a full slot of farmers.\n\nThat is also to state, there is No Steam support, steam friends mean nothing for htis game, the only multi-player where friends count or matter, is Facebook or you having to  spend the limited free premium currency on the temporary 'AI friends' slot filling item, if you want to keep playing on your Steam profile.\n\n2/10  Functional, but nothing more then a massive insult towards the fans of the Kings bounty series.

You can get King's Bounty: Platinum Edition for 7.50$ on a sale and 1 dlc of this game costs more than that.

However, this game constantly tries to get you to use Facebook to get / share extra rewards with friends.  And it makes it feel like a facebook game.  That little fact, above all else, absolutely ruined this game for me.\n\nHowever, the game is free, and like I said, it can be pretty fun.

I don't think you lose anything by not connecting with facebook, but you will be annoyed by the constant requests to do so (at the end of every quest / battle).\n\nHonestly, the devs made a decent game.  I'd love to give it more of a chance, but the whole facebook thing just throws me off.  If you don't think that something like that would bother you, you should totally check this game out.\n\n5/10.

The first thing that put my hopes down, was a facebook login. I got very frightend at the idea. most facebook games are bad, and this game follows that trait.\n\nBad musics and sounds. i wish i had the sounds off, it was awful, it wasn't enjoyable at all, and worst didnt fit anything i was doing.\n\nArt design. i still don't know who the ♥♥♥♥ was what and why they did what they did, after only 2 battles. i could barely tell if there were assigned colours or not. this got even more confusing when the 'turn based' element was implemented poorly.\n\nGameplay. how do you mess up turn based, first it's someones turn, then its the next. in this game it thinks every character is a different player, and it's quite confusing at times to understand what the hell is going on. this isnt like final fantasy X, where it had a neat little side bar to say,  this person is next because they're fast. there is no warning, or understanding. (unless i had to read that, which i didnt)\n\nTutorial. god knows if i even finnished that tutorial, but it was awful. a bunch of text with no highlights stopping me from playing how i wanted to. it forced me to use elements that at the time i thought were a terrible idea. it even stated for me to kill the big guy first, and not giving me much option, or reasoning. i should be lead to do what i want, not be forced to.\n\nThe end of two levels. After the two levels i played it led me to some sort of buy screen. i don't know what i was doing when i was in that screen, whether i was buying more units, or buying backup units. but the idea was i had to use in game currency to do so, and with that, i left. I do not wish to spend days playing a game, to get some currency to get higher level items. theres no fun. no race differenciantions, nothing.\n\nAgain, comparitavely to games we've seen 10 years in the past, this game is still rubbish in comparison. an epic battlefield, consisting of 5 blokes with rope for pants and 5 meters appart fighting over something probably as trivial as a stick.","December 14, 2013","false","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The music wasn't bad, though not as catchy as the original, IMO. The gameplay is where the largest difference was. There is hardly a connection to the original, other than unit type and battle similarities.\n\nThe methods by which troops are recruited are totally different. The basic units could be hired at the home castle, but exotic units would have to be hired from their lairs in the unexplored wilderness. Part of the challenge and fun was finding some of the more rare units during your travels. In fact, there is no exploring at all in the new game. You must defeat a predetermined number of groups of enemies before being able to advance to the next town. The new game is repetitive and slow in its progression. The battles lack the save level of dynamics and difficulty of the original. Although there are some character upgrades (equipment, etc.), you are limited to one character. The original offered 3 different characters with different strengths (income and rank, leadership, and magic).\n\nOverall, there was more freedom in the original, and everything, from the music to the exploration and battles, was more interesting. The new game lacks challenge and is very tedious. The game name "King's Bounty" shouldn't be associated with this game.","December 23, 2013","false","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"Press X to win" sounds like a doctorate thesis compared to the instructions of this game.\n\nIf you happen to reach level 10 prepare to have your an*s boarded by the hundreds who were willing to dish out but a few coins for this game. Yes, it's P2W, and, no, you won't be having fun without investing in it.\n\nThe game is lackluster, dull, boring, trivial, and monotonous. It forces you to do numerous superfluous tasks without any merit or proper reward. The few rewards you do get all rely on a luck factor. If you genuinely want to feel like you're playing a game you will be thoroughly disappointed.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that utilises the few good elements of this atrocious monstrosity I advise you to look not within the compounds of this series, for the goods have been all drawn from HoMM and Disciples, and I earnestly suggest that you pick up any of the games from those series.\n\nKing's Bounty: Legions is a free to play game, and much to my disappointment it is a bad game that should not be plaguing Steam nor any computer on the face of this mislead Earth.","January 20, 2014","false","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After the wonderful Armored Princess, Crossworlds, and North King's Bounty games, Legions comes in with not much changed graphically. What they have changed, though, is that it is now Free to Play. While I am fine with this in general, this is one of those F2P changes that feels wrong given what the game is about. In the past games, you could in theory stack your army with very powerful units (although a low number since your character level and thus "Leadership" is low) if you won early battles and knew where to recruit. Replacing this deep and interesting mechanic are paid "Starter Packs", which are not nearly as diverse or interesting as a custom crafted army, or you can buy Booster Packs or units with real money.\n\nEven this state of affairs could have been remedied if I had some early access to a wide variety of units, some of which would be the higher tier units. This is simply not the case almost 10 hours into the game. I am stuck either rolling the 2-3 strongish units (even though my Leadership could support 6-7), or having to constantly spend gold on a very sparse selection of troops to replace heavy losses from crappy troops. I mean, I shouldn't have to buy Archers as my only replenishable ranged choice. At least open it up so I can recruit any low level archer.\n\nI really hope the devs go back, do a proper update of the engine, and release a game for $20 and remove the game killing mechanics that support the F2P model. It just doesn't work for King's Bounty.\n\nYou're better off buying the earlier games.","January 21, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately this game doesn't even live up to the prequels of King's Bounty.\n\nIt's one of those browser type of games where you pour down tons of money in order to beat your oponents, aka pay-to-win. As far as the browser ptw genre is concerned this is better than average in graphics, sound and theme, but lacks a more in-depth economy, common in the genre.\n\nIn short, King's Bounty Legends aims at many different audiences instead of focusing on pleasing what the core fanbase might have been interested in paying for.\n\n","January 28, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though of course it would be nice if I also had a baby dragon or valkyries to supplement combat in addition to my armies (plus, are there only scrolls?  No permanent spells?  Dumb).  Plus, some of the changes made to the basic formula of the game actually create excitement in ways the regular series does not really do--the first time I found my army in the middle of the field and enemies on both sides, I think I said "OH ♥♥♥♥ (not ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥!  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)" out loud because it was so amazingly unexpected.\n\nBut yes, I definitely recommend anyone who loves the King's Bounty reboot series check this out--I mean, free is free after all.

Everything in the game is craftable and upgradeable for free given enough time. If you have patience to grind through, you should be fine. My PvP record is quite good 31 wins and 5 losses. For those who find PvP difficult, they usually level up too fast and did not upgrade everything. Be patient, this is a social game. You will need a lot of friends to help you unlock the wanted missions. Those missions will give you free units. Daily quests will also give you free units.

I tried it again now that it came out on Steam, though, and it's gotten a lot better.\n\nBasically it's the new King's Bounty games as a social game / MMO-lite, with fairly predictable upsides and downsides. While I think I still prefer the offline ones, it's honestly one of the best social games I've ever played, being both fun as a game in general and clearly using the social mechanics usefully rather than just being "Diablo, but you can play it in your browser" - a thing some of the other 'good' social games I've played suffered from.\n\nIt's free to play, and while it whines at you to log into it via Facebook, you don't have to in order to try it out. So, yeah. Trying it out comes in highly recommended by Imban!","December 12, 2013","true","3.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

I've spent quite a few hours playing it and have bought some gems (I believe if you enjoy a free to play game its only right to buy some stuff).\n\nPros\n-The game is fun and has a decent level of depth to the strategy and diverse content.\n-You can let the ai play for you, which is great when you want to watch a movie and play the game at the same time.\n-A multitude of deiffering monsters and soldiers to pick from.\n-UI is easy to navigate and understand, except for the chat system.\n-Units are very indepth with different abilities and counter classes.\n\nCons\n-Adding friends is a pain and a chore, I made the mistake of signing up through my facebook, after trying for a few hours to find out how to add steam friends I couldn't figure it out.\n(To fix this I would just do what normal games do and add friends through the game, then add a facebook friend option as a secondary method).\n-the chat sytem is a pain, it constantly put me back into the sytem chatbox, only shows two boxes at a time which forces me to scroll to the clan chat. You can't talk in chat or clan chat while in a fight.\n- Again I understand the p2w model and am not against it for the most part. But to keep your legendary and even "blue" units topped off at full strength you don't have many other options which will cause you to stall out at around level 20+.\n(A solution I can see would be to allow players to save up items and use them along with a long cooldown to upgrade unit I.E a knight with several pieces of armor can be trained into a paladin, A swordsmen can be trained into a knight. this would give a deeper crafting system and not make players feel overly pressured into buying units with gems).\n- the gems don't feel scaled stuff is a little expensive like a paladin costing 28 gems, thats fine if I was only buying one every couple levels but not when I need a new paladin every level.\n\nThis is just a brief review I'm sure I am missing a few points but over all I would recommend this game. If you have any questions please ask.\n\n12/20/2013*\nI did leave out the reason I recommended the game. It is a pretty simple reason its free, even though it is a very face bookish game (seeing as how it started tha way) the quality and level of work is pretty damn high. I doubt we will see any significant change to the game; almost never do. The bottom line is it's worth picking up for free and messing around with it as far as a tactics game goes.","December 17, 2013","true","62.4"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kksedric/recommended/235400/","kksedric","GermSausage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kksedric/","215 products in account","Originally featured on Kongregate.com, King's Bounty Legions borrows the popular working formula from the original King's Bounty series.\n\nTo accomodate casual player and to become a MMO, NivalPublishing watered down the brutality of the original series. Instead of loosing troops and lose the ability to hire them again, the hire pool refreshes every daily. Immortal and Legendary units are rehirable at a price as they are unavaliable to replanish on the map.\n\nUnlike other MMOs on the market which requires a lot of attention to maintain a well equipted account, Legions tries to accomodate gamers who are able to commit less than an hour a day by introducing dailies which can be completed in minutes and a patrol mode.\n\nIn patrol mode, the player leaves the avatar at a location and the AI does battles over time. The player can sustain losses in this mode. However, in a reasonable location, a positive income together with additional rewards makes Legions a game for busy people.\n\nLegions demostrates great promise with a good compromise between free and paid gamers. However, increasingly powerful and pricey units found on the Royal Shop (the Cash Shop on King's Bounty: Legions) greatly tilts the favor towards paid gamers in the PVP arena. (*I am trying to remember whether PVP yields any unique rewards. If it does, the game would greatly favor paying customers with a fat wallet).\n\nFortunately, the the game redeems itself by introducing a Raid feature which pits players against various other player's teams and everything boils down to defeating the AI which controls them.\n\nWhat further irks me is the inability to transfer progression between different platforms. In my case, my progress from Kongregate to Steam.\n\nStill, this game is a good introduction for players who are undecided on purchasing the original King's Bounty series, a new to turn based role playing game or an online world to test their skills against other like minded gamers.","December 30, 2013","true","0.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","2"

I can't for the life of me understand why you are reading this and not trying to play the game!\n\nSure it crashes as soon as you tell it to 'update' and therefore the game is unplayable BUT YOU NEED TO SEE THE UNSEEABLE, TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE1!1 See how this game makes you think, beyond the borders, of the screen!\n\nBuy a 4-pack, share the fun.\n\nKing's bounty: Crash Edition GOTY Version is the most fun you'll EVER have on the fantastic journey, back to your desktop.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN!\n\nSo seriously, what am I doing? Why do I have 1000+ hours?\nKing's Bounty: Legions comes from a long line of King Bounty games, which in turn come from an even longer line of King Bounty games, yeah crazy right?\nKing's bounty started life on the Amiga and was ported to several other home computers before morphing into the Heroes of Might and Magic series which still runs today. King's bounty was shelved, Heroes of Might & Magic lived on and Nival bought the rights to King's Bounty making their own series of games, similar to the original but with a modern take in terms of graphics and gameplay style.\n\nLegions is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of those newer games, being more PvP centered which is great. What's not so great is those 1000+ hrs? Yeah, the grind. Oh don't worry Rich American/Russian/Chinese player, you can buy the best PVP gear in the game, but it will cost you. How much? About $1000 during an ingame sale and double that outside of it. Rather unsurprisingly I opted to grind out my gear instead and 1000+ hrs later, I still don't have all of it, infact I have non of the pieces, it's that bad!\n\nIf you like HoMM or KB and always wanted some multiplayer style PvP then HoMM has that, but KB never did, so this game is the only chance you will get for that. Bring a fat wallet, or prepare to give up your social life though because as you can guess, this is pay to win and if you don't have top tier gear, then someone richer or with more time invested than you is going to kill you very quickly.\n\nAlso link up to your facebook account or else the game is nigh unplayable, many features are cut from the steam release.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","December 18, 2013","true","087.4"," 16 of 42 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","16","42","0","0"

Not a waste of time.\n\nBasically, this is a Facebook game. At least I think it's an import from FB, since you can share to your wall and it has that terrible hand-holding tutorial for the first 10 mins of gameplay. Try to power through the big dumb CLICK HERE YOU IDIOT buttons and when the game opens up a bit more it's very fun.\n\nIt has Might and Magic/King's Bounty style combat, but none of the overworld parts (Which I never really cared for a ton anyway). Units are stacked and your attacks chew through each individual guy's HP until you kill the whole stack. The focus on Combat and army building over the larger scale city building and adventuring is welcome for me, others may not like that. It reminds me of playing a somewhat obscure Playstation 2 game, Gladius, since it's fight after fight with a bit of crafting and a quest between each one.\n\nI'd say give it a try, but be careful of microtransactions. Not sure how good the PvP is yet, or if there's pay-to-win, but I wouldn't be surprised. It's a fun, cut down King's Bounty experience though.","December 10, 2013","true","6.0"," 22 of 60 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","22","60","0","0"

Is it fun, that is debateable. I would not persoanlly play a lot of this game but I do recommend all to at least try this game. It may suprisingly be fun to you though it is not fun me to. It has a unique type of gameplay that can be attractive to a certain audiance and worth at least a try.\n\nStory: 3/10\n+It has one\n-What is it about?

It takes that social nattery about sharing every single thing like taking a ♥♥♥♥ with your friends.  So if you don't like that kind of trash don't even bother playing the game.  It is also heavily Pay to Win typical facebook malarky.  So if you are not a fan of this then you should also stay clear.  It also has other frustrating elements of gameplay and while the tutorial explains some things it is very bla and a pain in the ♥♥♥.  Also having to pay gold (which is in way too short supply in the game) to revive fallen units can be annoying.  Also 30 minute cooldowns to re-do a mission is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ so if some lame little character says "collect 2 of these quest items and turn it back into me!" my advice is to not turn it in so that you can actually have some fight to do over and over instead of having to wait for all the other cooldowns.\n\nAnother con is it also has some of the worst starting content in a game.  You should never punish players and make it as boring as this game does in the beginning by having to basically criple your army to unlock enough areas to actually be able to progress your character.  So dumb.  As I played I kept thinking things like "man this game sucks" and "I hate this soooooo much" but I stuck it out since someone told me it will be a good game to pass the time.\n\nSo why am I writing that I recommend the game?  I ended up getting a creature called the "emrald dragon" from some lucky box thing which generally gives you extremely pitiful amounts of gold (takes 2000 gold to get 1 unit that doesn't suck and you generally get 50-150 from opening the chests.)\n\nOnce I gained this creature that had the ability to heal and resurect creatures around me and could do it 3 times a battle the game actually changed into something more like Kings Bounty.  I found myself playing the game around the concept of running a perfect game w/o losing any creatures each whatever I did.  And it took on an interesting form of gameplay that was actually fun.  I was suddenly playing towards the strategy of the game instead of some, no fun, facebook social nattering, invasive, pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fest.\n\nI found myself shocked that I was actually having fun.  A lot of fun.  In the end though with all the other BS the game has going for it I don't write a strong recommendation for this game but a very mild "it will help pass the time and it's free and you might have fun if you stick it out."\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, and in the beginning it wasn't for me and it won't be for most if you don't want to deal with that facebook social sharing nonsense (since let's face it we play games on steam so we don't have to deal with that trash.)  If you want a really fun game and are willing to drop some money I would say get the real Kings Bounty over this, but as for free to play games it's not so bad if you can actually get into it.\n\nHowever in the end the way the PvP is completely broken and the way it trys to force players who want to do anything to have to shell out obscene amounts of money I can't recommend it in good faith to any other player.","December 12, 2013","false","21.7"," 0 of 13 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","13","0","0"

Most of that was only being online to monitor my alliance chat, but you can guess I played a lot. Do I recommend the game? In it's current state, hell no!  Why? Here are some reasons:\n\nNival never showed even a tenth of an ounce of respect for their customers. People tried so hard to communicate with them, working on new ideas and sugestions about how to implement them in a way that the game would thrive instead of dying like it has been over the last 12-18 months.\n\nI played this game so much and wanted it to get better. Instead, they implemented a stamina mechanic that totally makes the game unplayable for newcomers. This totally killed the community as old players were quitting faster than new "regular" players coming in.\n\nAbout 24 months ago, when I started playing, it was a decent F2P. The P2W was there but you could still (slowly) progress without paying. Then, maybe 18 months or so ago, they implemented the stamina, which was not too much of a hassle for me as I had so many creatures I could use. But then, people started quitting. Others tried to open dialogue with Nival to improve the game. Nival gently told us to f**k off by deleting our forum posts. The message was clear : we don't give a s**t about what's going on and what you think. We are in charge and we will shamelessly ask you for money so you can replenish your troops stamina, troops which for some are only obtainable by spending in game currency or PVPing (but PVP matchmaking is broken anyway!). So basically, pay for troops, then pay to play with them if you are unlucky enough to have more than only a few minute for your play session.\n\nBut most of all, pay for gems that we will take forever to send you. I once bought gems that they took over 2 weeks to deliver to my account. After the 10th of 12th day, I asked them for a refund, and their answer was that I was too late, according to their policy, to be eligible for a refund. I am being told that I am late when I waited over 10 days for something that should have been delivered instantly?\n\nHonestly, I don't know if it's the game itself that sucks, or the team behind it that can't seem to get their s**it together, but there's definately something fishy going on.","December 6, 2015","false","764.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The next day you log on only to find your gold dwindled to a small fraction of what it was. You have been raided by other players. So you build up your garrison with more troops. The same thing happens the next night. What you need to know is that someone paid good money to buy elite troops and is going around stomping on players with average troops and taking thier gold as booty. There is no fun for the off line person in that. Why don't they just skip the battle part and just hand out gold to every one for the amount of time they are online, and take gold from everyone who is off line.\n\nSecond, virtually every other screen is about facebook and/or purchasing stuff using gems which you need to buy with real money. In your face pay to win is just plain stupid. AND I DON"T DO FACEBOOK!\n\nThird... There is no third, I didn't waste my time with this game to find out.","December 16, 2013","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you buy any of the legion packs or DLC to get a jump start it doesnt matter.  The secret is the units all need to be upgraded 15xunit x 10 unit slots per garrison/main army.  This can be upwards of probably 3-4 months of mind numbing grinding and friend whoring to facebook.  Your other option is to pay like 100$ for in game "gems" to upgrade your stuff instantly and to actually buy new units.  Thats the other hidden trick, as you level your army is allowed to have more units in it which everything but the ♥♥♥♥♥iest units have to be bought thru gems or daily quests and theres no way to max that out and the best units "aka Dragons" are like 40 gems a pop.

Which normally I would say "SWEET!" but there are some critical issues.\n\n1- All of the graphics and spell animations have been purged from the King's bounty series in exchange for little "ball" effects that fire slowly (instead of the Archmages shooting an instant lightning bolt across the screen, now you wait for a little ball to fly by. The same ball as the priest and virtually every other caster I've seen in the game), and the game is tediously slow. Probably 20-30% the speed of the real king's bounty games.\n\n2- dispite this being on Steam, it is a pure Facebook port. It'll ask you to join the facebook game and disable all but the most rudimentary features if you don't join on facebook. Once you do join, it transfers your game to a "facebook" account and deletes your game, so the game is forevermore "just" facebook. There is nothing else here.\n\nThe game ends up unimaginably tedius and slow, even to get through very simply fights with few turns required.","January 14, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's 100% facebook centric and 0% stream centric. It quite literally requires Facebook with friends to play. Don't waste your time unless you do Facebook gaming, and if you do I don't see why you wouldn't just play it on FB in the first place. The concept is cool, the single player game itself is interesting and this is a good concept off of it.\n\nThe short of it is this game is worth trying if you're a facebook gamer, otherwise it's not even playable when it boils down to it. I remember playing this on FB in the past for quite some time when I was doing facebook gaming and it was pretty fun, for steam it's a definite no-no though. I'm actually quite surprised that Steam even supports a game that requires facebook and can be played off Facebook.\n\nFun game, REQUIRES Facebook.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brna666/recommended/235400/","brna666","Basso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brna666/","272 products in account","Back in 1991 I played a game named “Kings Bounty”. Little did I know at the time, that this simple game would grow and gain such a following in the modern computer world. Well, now we have a new version of the game, and it is all grown up. “Kings Bounty Legions”.\n\nKings Bounty was not much to look at, but the game play was awesome. I spent hours playing it and could not get enough. What is so unbelievable is that after 22 years, the game is still growing and going strong.\n\nThe new Kings Bounty Legions is visually stunning, and the game play, better. In this game, you can grow an army, do quests, get rewards, and once again grow your army. What makes this game so different is the 3D quality of the battle scenes, and the ease of play.  There is no base building or taking over cities in this game, so it plays more like Kings Bounty series of games than Heroes of Might and Magic for those who are familiar with the two after they split into separate series of games.  So the game does consist of a lot of one battle after another, and the duel match up is flawed in that it will often throw you against opponents who are way too high of a level with little to no chance of you beating them, so there could be some better algorithm about dueling and the game not forcing you to battle opponents higher than 3 or 4 levels than you where you have no chance of winning, but other than that it is a pretty fun game and if you liked playing Kings Bounty Armored Princess or Kings Bounty The Legend you will likely find the game enjoyable.\n\nYou can fight against random foes, or engage in PVP battles. Now, on Facebook, this is not something new, but this game does something many of the other’s do not. It gives you more choices, more control, and it does it like you would expect a paid, installed, game to do.\n\nFor an internet-based game, the action and play is better than anything I have ever played online. Kings Bounty legions uses the Unity 3D Technology, which gives it the edge that makes this game so much better than the competition.","December 28, 2013","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously. It's a facebook game, you cannot even access some of the most important features w/o facebook account AND it's not possible to connect steam and facebook - without erasing steam part of the account, no less. Until guys from Nival change their attitude I strongly recommend AGAINST paying them a dime - because chances are, the very next day you may not be able to log in again to use the in-game things you just bought. Check forums for more info...\n\nUPDATE: I've been playing this thing casually for a few months and now I could say for sure - yes, it is definitely p2w :) What's worse, though, is that the developer's greed killed all the fun. There is not much to do in the game after you beat the campaign but to PvP. Now, without upgrading your units to at least 8-10 level you're a cannon fodder. The problem is: the random generator is bugged and to reach the levels stated you will either be subjected to the long and extremely boring grind or... upgrade for real money. You want to experiment with different builds? I am sorry, but there are no way for steam players to get new creatures in-game. Recent update further decreased the chances to steal a unit in PvP (which was the only viable way for us so far) so chances to collect a stack of units without paying real money is now effectively 0. Now I woudln't mind throwing in a few bucks time after time but with one full stack costing about $30... And you need 5 of them... And don't forget, you'll have to upgrade them to make playable... Add it all up and think about it: why would someone pay a full price of a decent AAA game for a *chance* to have some fun in a typical facebook game with all of its shortcomings?..","January 7, 2014","false","808.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some would even say a storied history. Well, not many of us would say that. But I might. It is a fairly well known strategy RPG with a pedigree reaching back to the dawn of PC gaming. In recent years, developer Nival Interactive has released a few new games in the series to largely rave reviews. They have always stuck to their guns and kept the games difficult and deep, rather than caving to the recent revolution in simplifying modern gaming. Now they have released their newest title, King’s Bounty: Legions. A free-to-play game tied inextricably to the all-consuming monster that is Facebook. Does this mean Nival has finally sold out and simplified the series? Or is there a legitimate game hidden in here that they have simply chosen to release under a new kind of business plan? In all honesty, the end result is a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nTo its credit, King’s Bounty: Legions does not have “energy” or whatever the equivalent resource is that most Facebook games use to limit playtime unless you purchase more. You can play as long as you like each sitting without having to worry about some arbitrary limitation holding you back for a few hours while it recharges. The main barrier to entry is simply time consumption. You are of course able to purchase all kinds of gameplay benefits with cash which do give you distinct advantages, such as “auras” that grant you increased experience and gold gain, or more units to use in combat. There are many other options as well. These are all the typical trappings of a free-to-play game. Multiple currencies include gold, gained in game, and gems, purchased with real money. Gold can be used to resurrect units lost in battle and purchase additional units to fill your army as well as buy spells and items. Gems are used for upgrading your troops, spells, and all manner of additional things.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it is a moderately simplified version of a typical King’s Bounty game. There is no more over-world exploration component, you now have a very simplified ‘world map’ that you simply choose a destination on to move your static player character icon. You move from icon to icon, collecting and completing simple quests to kill a number of each creature or defeat a specific army. All depth and strategy has, disappointingly, been thrown out of the world map aspect of the game.\n\nSo how about combat? Well, it is once again a mixed bag. Spells have been all but removed, and turned into single use items you have to purchase with gold and are not affected in any way by character development. Which itself is also entirely missing from the game. Gone are the days of choosing skills and the specialization of your character to fit with your own play style. Combat is dumbed down to the larger stack wins, with many units having had skills simply thrown out and replaced with nothing. It is largely a disappointment and pales in comparison to previous games in the illustrious King’s Bounty history.\n\nHaving said these things it is only fair to say that, as a Facebook game, King’s Bounty: Legions does succeed at what it aims to be. A relatively simple time sink to rake in some capital. It does have obnoxious pop-ups that constantly tell you to “Share X with your friend!”, and insipid purchases to boost you ahead in the game, yes. But it also doesn’t force the purchases down your throat or force you to spend time waiting in order to play again. For fans of free-to-play Facebook games, King’s Bounty: Legions may very well be appealing. Nival Interactive has done a fairly respectable job of transforming the game into a social title, and will likely make large sums of cash as a result. For those of us who don’t give a flying rat’s caboose about Facebook, though, it is a definitive pass. Play an older title in the series instead, and be much happier for it.

This started as Facebook game (which is where I tried it initially, long enough to see all the features) with microtransactions and a wait-or-pay-to-play system. Facebook login is not required to play unless you want any of the sharing features or cross-platform play with browser and mobile. Typical for this kind of game, you can expect constant "share this with your friends!" prompts and an unskippable mission to send gifts to friends, and so on.\n\n\n\nIt pesters you to share your Missionrewards with friends on your Facebookpage after every damn mission.\nYou get equippment by gathering small pieces after every kill, and the Tutorial is one of those "klick exactly what i tell you to for 10 minutes" things.\n","January 30, 2014","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you buy any of the legion packs or DLC to get a jump start it doesnt matter.  The secret is the units all need to be upgraded 15xunit x 10 unit slots per garrison/main army.  This can be upwards of probably 3-4 months of mind numbing grinding and friend whoring to facebook.  Your other option is to pay like 100$ for in game "gems" to upgrade your stuff instantly and to actually buy new units.  Thats the other hidden trick, as you level your army is allowed to have more units in it which everything but the ♥♥♥♥♥iest units have to be bought thru gems or daily quests and theres no way to max that out and the best units "aka Dragons" are like 40 gems a pop.  So yea this game is a big bend you over and ♥♥♥♥ your wallet game.  Not really worth while.","December 20, 2013","false","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
