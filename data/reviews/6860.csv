You're given targets that you must kill, and in some instances, objectives to complete. That's it, the rest is up to you. You decide your weapon of choice to pull off the perfect hit; will it be the pistol? Shotgun? Assault Rifle? Submachine Gun? Sniper Rifle? You can spend the money that you earn from hits on different upgrades. Will you opt for a silencer on your pistol, or will you spend it on improved lockpicking skills? There are multiple different playstyles, and the choice is entirely up to you. Will you run in, guns blazing, killing anything that stands between you and your target? Or will you sneak in, using a disguise you stole from a guard that is now unconcious in the dumpster? How will you kill your targets? Will you poison their food? Strangle them? Snipe them? Rig a chandelier to fall on them? You choose how you play the game. You choose your definition of a perfect hit. First time players beware, however, you will find yourself spending lots of time doing trial-and-error to find the best ways to kill your target. If you enjoy games with linear gameplay where there's only one way to win, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, if you want a sandbox stealth experience, where you get to decide how the game will play out, at $8.99, this game is perfect for you.","August 20, 2013","true","95.8"," 178 of 182 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","178","182","0","1"

There are only 11 missions (not counting the training mission and the ending) but each of those have so many different ways to complete them and the level design itself is some of the best in any game i have played. The graphics still look good considering it is ten years old. The only con to this game is that it is short, but if you get into it you can challenge yourself to beat the game on the highest difficulty and with silent assassin rating on each mission, which is next to impossible if you haven't studied the levels and the guards movements! It is fun to go on a rampage every now and then but the core gameplay revolves around stealth and subtefuge with the biggest challenge being to kill only your marks and leave no witnesses rather than charge in like rambo.\n\nYou might be thinking why play such a old game when there is a new Hitman game? The problem with Absolution is they tried to build a game around a story rather than the other way around so it ended up with linear level design, horrible quicktime events and a general feeling of being prodded along a set routine.\n\nand m80s let me tell you... the story in Absolution was so bad, I mean REALLY bad almost like it was writen by a 12 year old Catholic schoolboy who just saw his first Tarantino movie. The fact that they ditched pretty much everything that makes a Hitman game a Hitman game to accomodate this drivel... there are no words.\n\nI hope that if IO ever make another Hitman game they listen to the fans of the series and pick up where they left off with Blood Money ands lets pretend Absolution never happened, OK? k...","February 16, 2015","true","11.0"," 149 of 158 people (94%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","94","149","158","27","9"

In fact, as much as I believed I had killed every target in every way possible, even today I found a new way to eliminate Vinnie. I purchased this game in 2006 originally, and I can’t even imagine how many hours I’ve spent playing it since. It was great picking it up again on steam and going through it all once more and remembering each and every style, technique, path to become the perfect Silent Assassin.\n\nBlood Money brings the series back to familiar territory, after the dark path of Contracts (Hitman 3). This is why I rate Blood Money and Silent Assassin as my two favourite in the series, purely due to the vast possibilities of completing missions. For instance today – setting a mine off outside Vinnie’s house and attracting all FBI members outside the building, I ran towards the front door where Vinnie stared right at me, and began chasing me. I led him to the road just outside his front door, knowing full-well that in approximately 5 seconds the FBI *backup* Limo would speed its way to the entrance. So yeah, with Vinnie looking confused and wanting to know who I was – and standing directly in the centre of the road – BANG. Goodnight Vin! So much for that FBI Witness Protection program!\n\nIt’s hilariously entertaining & ruthless at the same time. What other game can you sedate food dressed as a Clown? Rig a barbeque dressed as the local neighbourhood Pool Cleaner? I am only talking about one mission here (A New Life) there is an outrageous amount of different possibilities to this game and that’s why 9 years on I’m still having fun & enjoying new ways to go through Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nAn incredible combination of stealth & brutality lets this game shine for many more years to come.","April 6, 2015","true","61.7"," 115 of 122 people (94%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","94","115","122","27","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/6860/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I've owned and played all of the Hitman franchise, both on consoles and on the PC (non-steam), and I've thoroughly enjoyed each one. I think my favorite games in the franchise are Silent Assassin and Contracts, however, each game is a wonderful experience and should be given at least one playthrough if you have the chance.\n\nIf you like stealth-oriented (or guns-blazing) gameplay, being a dangerous assassin, and open-ended, challenging missions, then you will really, really enjoy this game. The Hitman franchise has consistently been able to provide the experience of being a world-renown and package it into a fun, fresh, and user-friendly game for all types of gamers to enjoy.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the environments and character models are very well-done. The music and sounds in the franchise have always been solid, and the score used in Blood Money adds a sense of grandiosity and elegance to the gameplay. The story has always been interesting, and this installation chronicles the FBI's hunt for Agent 47. The "ending" is quite satisfying, and offers a great segue into the next game.\n\nThe controls are not too difficult to familiarize yourself with, and the tutorial mission is both fun and very helpful - it feels less like a hold-your-hand mission compared to other games that may restrict your actions initially. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, further influenced by the difficulty you select (no notoriety on Rookie) and playstyle you use (stealth vs. bloodshed).\n\nBefore you begin your missions, you will be able to select which weapons to take with you, as well as upgrade each primary weapon you own - more options are unlocked as you progress. The money you accumulate is based on your rating upon completing your missions (generally, more stealtheir approaches lead to higher rewards).\n\nYour performance rating is provided in the form of a newspaper article, with the headline "Silent Assassin" if you achieve a perfect playthrough. I really liked this feature, as it will comment on your most used weapon, firearm accuracy (ex: the 4 headshots and unwasted bullets suggest a deadly professional), number of witnesses and casualties, and how the targets were killed. Each mission has a mechanic available to make each target die in what appears to be an accident (ex: a pallet of crates falling on top of someone), allowing you to achieve full stealth.\n\nNotoriety is affected by your performance, and the more attention you draw to yourself, the higher your notoriety gain. As it climbs, NPCs will react faster to your presence and may even call for help from guards. You can pay a fee to reduce your notoriety, and obtaining the CCTV tapes (if you are spotted on camera) will eliminate that hit to your notoriety.\n\nMy favorite mission involved  assassinating a target in his mansion, while being under the witness protection program. You can deal with the protection detail aggressively - open the doors and unleash a bulletstorm (silenced or not); or, you can even place a posion/sedative into a box of donuts, change into a donutman disguise, and pass the donuts to the security team (eventually causing them to all be knocked out).\n\nYou can challenge yourself in many ways - try doing a mission without switching into a disguise, being seen (causing an alert), killing, using weapons, etc. I beat Blood Money on the hardest difficulty on my 3rd playthrough (full stealth), and I encourage everyone to NOT try the game on Rookie (the notoriety feature adds a lot of intensity and fun). For my first playthrough, I did full stealth and normal. For my second, I tried a Rambo-style method - both provided me with a satisfying, badass assassin feel. Watching NPCs running away in fear while helpless guards fall to your expertly-placed shots can be just as fulfilling as entering a restricted area without anyone knowing.\n\nOverall, the game is very enjoyable if you are the least bit interested in assassinations (stealth or non-stealth), and everyone should definitely give this game a try.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 27, 2014","true","0.8"," 110 of 117 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","110","117","6","12"

Hitman is a series that boasted a novel concept which has somehow managed to remain pretty unique to this day (seriously - how many disguise-based stealth games are there?) and that gameplay evolved from game to game with Blood Money being the pinnacle (since Absolution went in a somewhat different direction closer to other stealth franchises like Splinter Cell).\n\nAbove all Blood Money is an action adventure game. Each mission provides quite a huge and open area with one ore more targets which need to be assassinated as well as the occasional non-assassination goal. Each map features many characters following basic routines and items or statics objects which can somehow be put to use. The beauty of Hitman lies in exploring the big and diverse environments, discovering usable objects, observing the targets and bystanders and then putting a brilliant plan together - and somewhat ironically the best and toughest plan is always the one where nobody dies, except for the targets of course. It gets even more complicated when you wish to make the deaths look like accidents and leave nothing behind (especially not that precious suit!). But even once you've developed that brilliant plan, there's still the matter of execution which requires perfect timing, with wits, patience and a good memory being the key to success - one mistake and everything goes to hell and there's not much left to do except mowing down everyone in your path.\n\nAs an action game Hitman is definitely sub-par but if you're up for it and are willing to spend ages on the same mission until you find and execute that perfect plan (or at least one perfect plan as often there's several ways to get that awesome Silent Assassin rating) there's nothing quite like it and a truly rewarding experience awaits you.\n\nThere's not much going on in terms of story, which is told through non-interactive cutscenes, but that doesn't keep the game from providing many very original locations and missions depicting the criminal underworld from a wide variety of angles, mostly ones you don't know from other games. To top it all off the action is accompanied by one of the greatest soundtracks to be ever heard in a video game, composed by legendary Jesper Kyd, providing a truly surreal atmosphere at times. What kind of graphics to expect everyone can clearly see on the screenshots.\n\nBottom line: if you are looking for an original stealth game or just want to know what all this Hitman talk is about - this is the game to go with.","November 25, 2013","true","2.9"," 86 of 89 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","86","89","0","0"

You can do this by changing into clothes and impersonating other people. It's really fun to observe your surroundings and plan the perfect assassination and getaway.\n\nIf you turn down the difficulty settings, it is also really fun to just ignore stealth and kill everyone (including civilians).","June 3, 2015","true","19.3"," 118 of 134 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","118","134","16","3"

This game requires skill and patience with almost endless possibilities to every mission. Not only are you allowed almost infinite options on how you come to face your target, but also how you chose to eliminate them.\n\nBlood Money also offers an enjoyable experience to Stealth fans, but with a different approach. A majority of stealth games pride themselves on wall-to-wall, shadow-to-shadow gameplay; and while this can be very enjoyable and exciting; there are different ways to enjoy a stealth style experience; Blood Money is one of them! You are keeping your true identity hidden, not letting the enemy guards notice that their perimeter is breached; not allowing anyone to know you are even there. And when it all goes belly-up it still offers just as an enjoyable time trying to dig your-self out of that mess!\n\nObviously Blood Money has a few dated features like glitchy ragdolls; dated textures and filtering. But when you look past this, you see a game that far surpasses most modern day games in areas specifically such as the plot and level design. But if you are a gamer who when searching for new games mainly looks at the visual side of things, this may not be for you.\n\nBlood Money also offers the ability for players to customize certain weapons with features such as silencers, scopes; different ammo types etc. Sadly, not all weapons found throughout the game allow you to do so, but this feature is still only found in very few games; including those of the current high budget new-releases.\n\nIf I were playing this game at the time it was first released, it would have been a game with no noticeable flaws, but certain dated features cannot be ignored by today’s standards. Although the game’s base design is still without a doubt, impeccable, as are its plots and levels.","February 26, 2014","true","5.3"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","0"

Instead you're out in the open, blending into society the best way a man can with a barcode on the back of his big beautiful bald head. Get use to it, because you're gonna be staring at it for awhile, not just because you can play the game in third person, but because it's beautiful. I mean, look at it, it's so shiny.\n\nEach mission you are given the task of murdering someone who probably has it coming, you do this by planning out an attack, playing dress up like I used to with Polly Pocket because my mom refused to buy me any G.I. Joes because they would encourage  meto be a strong male role model for children. Thanks mom.\n\nNow, with the right equipment and the perfect shade of underwear, you go on the attack, soloing out people at their most vulernable and promptly drowning them in a toilet. Way to go!\n\nYou'd think that this whole murder shtick would get boring after awhile considering it's all you do, but surprise! It doesn't. THe new locations, difficulty of your target, and unique ways you end up drowning others in toilets keeps the game fresh. It's by no means an easy game, unless you're me. Then it's super easy because you're super good and I have a history of drowning others in toilets.\n\nKeep that last bit to yourself.\n\nBut when drowning others in toilets isn't an option or you're just a complete chump, the game gives you a plethora of weapons to go on a murderous rampage with. These include Agent 47's iconic handguns, the silver ballers. They are baller. See what I did there?  While the shooting is nothing special, the guns have just enough OOMF to be entertaining to fire, especially when you send people out doing back flips with hand gun bullets.\n\nBut surely there's a punishment for going crazy, right? There is, and it digs deep. Not only will the game detract money you can use on new weapons and upgrades, it will also call you a total loser. After each hit, you get a newspaper describing the incident where you're called anything from a Silent Assassins, to a ghost, to a skulking man who drowns people in toilets. The more damage you do and the less inconspicuous you are, the less money you have to spend on yourself. So no new Xbox for poor Agent 47, you horrible person.\n\nBut should you play Hitman: Blood Money?\n\nI will admit, this is probably the last Hitman game you'll play that feels like an honest Hitman game. While it does seem odd for an angry looking man in a bird suit to not look suspicious, the disguise mechanics is what gave the game that flavor it needed to stand out from its competitors like Thief or Splinter Cell. It's fun, it makes you feel like a badass when you succesfully pull off the perfect hit, and it's easy to look over it's problems just by how fun the game is on it's own.\n\nPunchman: Booboo Tokens gets 16 corpses in bathrooms out of a possible 4.\n\nWhen hippos are upset, they sweat red.\n\nThe Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\n","July 24, 2015","true","24.5"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","91","48","53","56","0"

If you play like a pro you'll play Silent Assassin difficulty and never be satisfied until you have a Silent Assassin ranking on all missions, which rewards you with the most cash and the highest rating.\n\nYou can blend in with crowds, disguise yourself as NPC's and watch NPC behavior, using a wide variety of methods to assassinate your targets. You can even make deaths look like accidents on most levels.\n\nAlternately you can murder anyone you want, or everyone if you really want a massacre in the newspaper.\n\nYes, at the end of each mission you get a newspaper report that mentions the number of people found dead, the number of witnesses, whether or not there were signs of a professional assassination, and whether or not deaths are believed to be natural or accidents rather than assasinations.\n\nIn addition to being a professional assassin you can collect weapons from missions, adding an element of replayability, additionally you can upgrade your own weapons and gear with cash you collect from missions.\n\nThe game has gamepad support and works great with mouse and keyboard, it's well worth purchasing.\n\nIt's a damn shame that there has never been another game like Hitman Blood Money.\n\nCons & Drawbacks:\nThe controls are rather clunky at times, in a way that adds to the stealth focus but it also just feels and looks clunky sometimes.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated. Still passible but dated.\n\nThe voice acting is sometimes hilariously bad, that may be intentional though as there is a lot of dark humor.","December 27, 2014","true","0.5"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","39","45","5","0"

Couple that with state of art level design, and you have the perfect Hitman game: more accessible than hitman 2 and not plagued by silly checkpoints like Absolution. You can set your own pace and figure out all that happens around you; concoct your plan and proceed to the assassination. Then savor that sweet, sweet kill-cam before walking away unnoticed like a real boss.\nThe story is very loose, but a truly epic ending ties it all together nicely.\nIf you are new to the series or want to give old 47 another shot, just pick this game and let it do its thing.

The amount of varied missions here and the numerous ways to complete them result in endless replayability. I must have played 50,000+ hours on my retail copy, and I still find myself coming back to this game and finding new things I didn't notice before. Honestly there's not one mission I hate in this game, and each one is a nice sandbox-type map where you are thrown in and told to kill somebody; how you do that is up to you.\n\nIf you're new to the series I would suggest buying this game first and avoiding the mess that was "Absolution" altogether; or wait until it's extremely cheap. Blood Money was a near perfect game and should have been the standard that all future Hitman games followed. Instead of Blood Money 2.0 we got a ridiculous wall-hugging game--which might be alright in other games but for Hitman it's awful. Blood Money is not without it's flaws, though. The guards are way too gullible to manipulation; but man is it fun to trick them. They will follow blood trails, pick up dropped weapons, and respond to noises. At the time I had never seen AI this advanced before.\n\nBottomline: the amount of detail and things you can do in this game is amazing. If you've always wanted to play a game that provided hours of replayability as a hitman in a sandbox environment then get this game! The other games in the Hitman series are also fantastic, except for Absolution.","January 30, 2014","true","36.7"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

It's relatively easy to beat the game, but the fun comes from experimenting and figuring out just the many, many ways of finishing each mission, and working towards perfection in your final rating. It's not just a question of stealth versus frontal assault, it's poison versus bomb, sniper rifle versus falling chandelier, rigged fireworks versus chloroformed panties.\n\nIt's got a dark, noiry style without the grindhouse cheese of Absolution, taking itself seriously even while it lets you do ridiculous things. Even now, having played through more than once, I find myself wanting to go back to try to screw around and finish the missions in new ways or perfect my old plans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/6860/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Hitman: Blood Money is generally regarded as the best game in the series and definitely lives up to its reputation. Previous games had been plagued by bugs, poor design decisions, and overall unfair situations. This time around, the developers seem to have taken note of what went wrong with previous installations of the series and as a result they have produced a highly polished and well executed hitman game.\n\nAs per the Hitman formula, most missions require a few trial runs to learn all the necessary elements such as guard positions, entry points, and target vulnerabilities required to perform the necessary executions with maximum efficiency and stealth. In order to get the best rating, it is almost mandatory to study each level in depth to see where your targets will be at their weakest.\n\nOne thing I noticed with this installment of the series is the introduction of well-handled crowd elements. This feature really shines in the “Murder of Crows” mission where you have to wade through crowds of revelers during Mardi Gras in order to track and eliminate several targets. Other new entries to the series include notoriety which can increase upon being spotted (yellow) or from CCTV sightings, which can be rectified through securing security tapes. There is also the addition of a new execution technique (strangulation) that can be done via elevator hatch above a target.\n\nThe only downside to this game, and this seems to be a trend for what it’s worth, is the final mission. All of a sudden, despite having done a majority of the game almost entirely in stealth, you are required to gun down an entire area full of trigger happy NPCs. I found it to be entirely inappropriate to the overall storyline not to mention my preferred style of play (silent assassin). Nevertheless, I managed to find a way to take a human shield and plow through the finale. If it were not for that final mission, I would consider Blood Money to be a perfect game. Regardless, it still lives up to its reputation and will likely live on to be the best that Hitman has to offer.\n\nGood Luck, 47\n","September 20, 2015","true","22.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

Yeah, the nature of having fun playing as an assassin is morally questionable, but if it makes you feel any better most of 47's targets are terrible people. The story that ties your missions together is really interesting, too.\n\nIn the level Curtains Down you must take out a politician and an opera singer, both tied to an underage prostitution ring, in an opera house during the recital. There's a prop gun used during one of the acts, and another agent has hidden a real version of that gun in a coat that, if you choose, you can claim at the front door. Here are just a few of the many ways you can go about this task:\n\nThe singer:\n\n-Replace the prop gun with the real gun during one of the scheduled breaks between rehearsals. The gun is used in an execution sequence in the opera, so it's an instant fatality.\n\n-Take a pistol along with you and skip the prop gun. Make your way to the back of the stage OR to the lighting rigging on top and fire the pistol at the exact moment the prop gun is fired in the execution scene.\n\n-Don't bother with the execution sequence entirely and run to the opera singer's dressing room, turn off his light, and hide in his closet until he comes in to go over some of his lines in private. If you want to take him out with a melee attack you have to shoot the dressing room mirror before he arrives, or else he will see you coming when you sneak up on him.\n\n-Bring some explosives along with you and sneak your way up to the top of the opera house and plant a bomb on the lighting rigging above the actor. When the actor gets up on stage trigger your bomb and make sure you're far away from anyone that might notice you when you do.\n\n-Just be an idiot and shoot everything in the opera house if you want to roleplay as a crazy person.\n\nThe politician:\n\n-If the opera singer does not get up after the execution sequence the politician will run over to the bottom of aisles to gasp. He'll stand there for just enough time for a bomb planted on the chandelier above him to cause the chandelier to mysteriously fall on him.\n\n-You can replace the prop gun with a real gun and then bring another pistol along with you. Set yourself up in the lighting rafters and, during the execution sequence, shoot the politician at the exact moment the real version of the prop gun is fired.\n\n-You can take out the politician with a silenced sniper rifle at any time\n\n-You can take out one of his guards and then disguise yourself as one. Once the opera singer goes down and he begins his run towards the aisles you can take him out in one of the staircases without any people on them.\n\nI just described how you can take out your targets, I didn't describe any of the many paths you can take to get to those points, or the disguises that you might use. This is just ONE level in the game, and there are many more like it.","November 29, 2015","true","47.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Polishing the gameplay set by previous entries, this masterpiece delivers some of the most unique stealth gameplay available. Hitman is the series that pioneered social stealth, the ability to “hide in plain sight”. The disguise system in Blood Money works great and it’s fun to try different disguises to figure out what works best for certain situations. There are so many memorable levels in Blood Money, and I still manage to find new ways to perform assassinations. Levels like A New Life, Curtains Down, and The House of Cards are works of art. In this game, there are many creative ways to dispatch your targets, more so than any other Hitman game. You can rig a piano to fall on someone’s head, you can blow up a photoshoot with some well placed mines while dressed as Santa Claus, you can silently garrote your target while disguised as a birthday clown. Those who played Absolution and are looking for a taste of what the old games were like should look no further than Blood Money. For its current price, this game is a steal. Without a doubt, this is the best stealth game I have ever played.","July 11, 2015","true","47.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","2"

With the money you can edit you weapons and buy stuff like: armours, faster pick-locks, health boosts, etc you can disguise in other clothes and collect new weapons but theres only 1 thing really annoying about this game and thats the bugs thats pretty much it haha\n\nWatch this video if you are considering buying hitman:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty4Uv22QjJo\n\ncheck this to maybe: http://hitman.wikia.com/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_Money\n\n8/10","January 25, 2015","true","176.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","0"

And yes, this is as clichéd as it sounds. But you don't come here for the story itself, but for its settings, which are fantastic: you go to Las Vegas, a wedding on the , the White House, an Opera House, a boat on the Mississipi, a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans... All the 13 levels have fantastic locations that are very memorable, even though the story is incredibly forgettable.\n\nGRAPHICSSurprisingly, the game still looks gorgeous after 10 years. And sure, while a couple of textures aren't in HD, the character animations and the post-processing effects show how much care was put into creating this game. I also love how every single level looks and feels different.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is very simple: kill the designated targets as stealthly as possible and leave the area unnoticed. You are free to choose which playstyle to use: equip an assault rifle and go on a loud killing-spree, find a vantage point and snipe from afar, go upclose and personal to garrote them, or, even better, make it look like an accident.\nThe best example of this is the Curtains Down mission: you are at the theatre during the rehersal of Puccini's classic opera "Tosca", and one of the two targets is playing the lead role, who gets executed with a pistol. In order to make it all look like an accident, you can switch the prop gun with a real WWI handgun. You can guess what happens next.\nThis is just one of many things that makes Blood Money a fantastic game to just play around with and to experiment to get different outcomes. There are also other details, like being able to carry only one heavy weapon (shotgun, assault and sniper rifle) that can't be stored in your suit since it's too big. There are also upgrades to buy before each level to reduce recoil, improve damage or get silencers.\nAnd, in case you didn't know, by pressing F1 you can enter First-Person mode to improve your shooting. I didn't know this when I first played the game, but it sure helps if you get into some tough gunfights.\n\nCHALLENGEThe AI makes the game very challenging: they hear gunshots, they recognise you based on the outfit you are wearing, they follow blood trails and they change how they react based on who dies. And, in case you get seen, you can try to shoot your way out of it, even though going full-on stealth is the best way to play this. Also, there is a save system that can be used in each level to correct some mistakes and to try without fear certain playstyles.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are top notch, as well as the voice acting, and the soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is beautiful, from the Main Theme to Apocalypse, as well as Ave Maria by Schubert.\n\nREPLAYABILITYMultiple ways to kill your enemies, easter eggs and secrets will keep you coming back to this game for years to come.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best stealth games of all time thanks to the variety of levels, weapons and excellent AI. A must play for every gamer and stealth fan.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 9.5\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 10\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 11","true","44.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","4"

Gorgeous visuals, well designed levels, intuitive gameplay and a compelling storyline make this title Agent 47’s defining moment.\n\nCampaign: Released by Eidos / IO Interactive in 2007, ‘Blood Money’ puts gamers back in the familiar shoes of Agent 47 – a professional assassin who is both ruthlessly efficient and disarmingly charming at the same time. The campaign details 47’s first foray across the Atlantic, and its 13 missions take you around the world to varying locales and vastly differing settings - from mountain retreats in the Rockies to Opera Houses in Paris, from Casino’s in Las Vegas to Jungle Hideaway’s in Chile. The missions are seamlessly woven into a broader narrative of the FBI’s efforts to connect the dots in a series of high profile assassinations and the surprising twist ending ensures your attention is kept throughout.\n\nGraphics | Sound | Gameplay: Graphically, the game is beautiful, with detailed, lush environments, atmospheric sound and some of the best level design seen in modern gaming. Each mission has several objectives that need to be completed – but be aware – there is no handholding here. True to its ‘Hitman’ roots, ‘Blood Money’ drops you into a large open world level with the freedom to accomplish your objectives in any order you see fit, and you are largely left to figure out the best way to get at your targets and escape unnoticed. Every mission, even every target, can be approached in multiple ways limited seemingly only by your imagination – Sniper kills from afar, close up strangulation with Piano Wire, a poisoned beverage to a distracted gory death are but some of the options at your disposal.  Tight and intuitive K&M controls, a broad selection of weapons, tools and distraction items, and upgradable items available for purchase in-between missions round out your toolkit.\n\nFlaws: The game also addresses many of the core gameplay issues and complaints of previous installments while at the same time moving the series forward – the inclusion of plentiful in-game save options, much improved AI, ability to play in both 3rd person and first-person views and high replayability make finding fault difficult. If pressed, a few gripes would be some clunky character animations and a close adherence to the Hitman formula making things seem quite familiar to veterans of the series.\n\nOverall, ‘Hitman: Blood Money’ is 47’s finest hour – a visually stunning, atmospheric, Stealth / Strategy RPG that puts you in the shoes of the iconic assassin and where you are ultimately limited only by your imagination in finding new ways to eliminate your target.

You plan your hit as you go, take note of points of interest, then attempt to execute the plan in as tight a timing as you can manage with as literal collateral and evidence possible. Get in, subdue the guards, strangle the target to death, then plant the barbell over his neck so it seems like he died when working out. Why did the guards get KO'd? They won't know, or care.\n\nBut on your way out of the room containing the dead target and his unconscious guards, you're spotted by an obese, elderly southern woman who starts screaming bloody murder, waving her arms and stomping her feet like it's the running of the bald, and suddenly you're in a hardcore chase simulator where you -have- to catch up to the tubbo and snap her neck before tossing her over a railing lest she lose you the coveted Silent Assassin rating.\n\nAs you manage to pull a kitchen knife -- wait, a kitchen knife? Right. You picked up a kitchen knife for the melee unlock at the end of the level.. only you remember that's only in Contracts. Either way, you pull out a kitchen knife by mistake instead of the fibre wire, and you end up slitting the poor woman's throat and watching her slowly tumble to her knees and cover the walls in her ragu as you contemplate what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are.\n\nAs this happens, you realize the clown and the caterer have seen the entire chase and murderer, and are now making their way to the Secret Service van positioned outside to keep an eye on the witness you were dispatched to.. dispatch. Pulling your pistol out of your coat, you put a round into the backs of their heads with expert precision and wipe sweat from your shiny bald plate as you manage to sprint to the exit before the guards can find the brutal murder-trail you've left behind.\n\nAt the ending stats screen you realize that you left your suit and a customized gun behind alongside killing three innocents, so you don't get a Silent Assassin rating and have to spend a whole chunk of your assassination fee to clean up after the ♥♥♥♥ing carnage you've caused.\n\nAnd that's Hitman: Blood Money.

Stealth games simply don't get better than Hitman: Blood Money and,granted, this game is most certainly underrated. The missions are special, each in their own way. There are, literally, dozens of possible ways of completing a mission, and if you replay missions, you will find more and more hilarious possibilities of killing. You can be slyish sneaky, or a psychopath, whichever suits your mood. However, the game never tells you to do things in a certain way and there are multiple paths and choices for every mission. The story is surprisingly good, and quite subtle as well. You don't get bombing production values, but with every mission you feel like things are getting more complicated and interesting.

Hitman: Blood Money is the staple of the series, from the wonderfully orchestrated music from the dark undertones of USA. Ambient lighting fixating on the movement of Agent 47, lurking into the position of his kill. Each theme orchestrates how your performance, an example would be ''Apocalypse'' that plays if you have successfully elimated your target without being caught. Agent 47 is sent on missions all across the United States for each distinct contract, in these games - stealth and disguise are your main friends into elimating a target. Agent 47 is a true netural, an anti-hero who has no moral or emotional conscience for these targets, he is simply doing what he paid to do - which is be a keen hitman. This game has a high replay value as you may tackle on your targets distinctively than your last. One of the best features of this game is the sniper rifle, and how agent 47 constructs it from his sturdy suitcase.\n\nHitman: Blood Money is an exciting and tense experience. Each sandbox level offers variety and there is plenty to explore, as the levels are essentially puzzles and sequences that can shift to your own planning.\n\n9/10.","November 28, 2013","true","24.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game is so, SO good. In my opinion, This IS hitman. Like yeah. Hitman 2 was really good. And absolution was pretty decent / good. But this here is the best in the franchise. The game is simple. You're a hitman, you have to kill people, you have to figure out how you wana do it. Which brings me to the games two biggest strengths: Choice, and Variety. There are many ways to complete each level, and you get to choose which you like the most. I know a lot of stealth games have this, like the amazingly suberp " Dishonored "( Another amazing stealth game I HIGHLY recommend if you're a fan), But this takes that, and cranks the dial up to like 14\n( For the time, at least ). And the game is incredibly fun because of it. Not to mention how high the replayability factor is. Each mission being worth 3-5 playthroughs, as, you have several unique ways of killing each target. From walking up and shooting him the face, to rigging a chandelier to fall and crush him as he sits in his favorite chair, making it look like an accident. You'll really feel the urge to replay and see how many different ways you can kill someone. This game has a good story, good soundtrack, tight controls for the pc version, fun combat, each level is a fun large sandbox dying to be explored, and you'll be dying to see how many different paths you can take through the levels, and how many different ways you can kill your target. This game is a must own for any stealth fan, and the quintessential Hitman game. Easily recommendable on sale or at full price. 9/10.","February 19","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game allows a lot of creativity and variety in how you carry out missions, as well. There's probably at least 10 different ways to take out each target. The Hitman games have always featured lots of trial and error, and this one is no different, but all of the missions in this game are cool and interesting (unlike Hitman 2, which put a third of the game in the Middle East, where you had to dodge the military). In the final level, you have to sneak into the White House and take out the corrupt Vice President; pretty epic.

In Blood Money you play as a very scary looking and highly dangerous man in large open ended environments hunting down assassination targets and killing them, preferably as quietly and skillfully as possible. And that's pretty much the game in a nutshell, there's no real story and the gameplay isn't too complex.\n\nHowever what Hitman does do, It does extremely well. The levels are HUGE and there are multiple routes to take and a very wide range of ways to murder your targets, and because of the open endedness it can lead to a lot of cool ''yeah I meant to do that'' type moments, a plan can completely fall apart or things may play out differently than you intended, but you can take one of the other god knows how many routes there may be and still take down your target and get away without leaving a trace, so as you can tell the gameplay is very organic and nonlinear compared to something like Absolution, which makes it extremely replayable because you're going to want to try new things and see how else you can pull off an awesome assassination.\n\nI also love how despite how grim the game itself is with all the murder and ominous music and stuff, you can kill people while dressed as santa claus, or a f*cking giant bird, sniping another darker bird through a window (NOT RACIST) It strikes a nice balance between being grim and comedic, so the game never get's dull for me.\n\nThe gunplay could've been a bit more refined though, many times If things happen to go badly for you, chances are you won't survive a gunfight because of how flimsy and at times, unresponsive the aiming is, (However first person mode does help a little bit) and there's no kind of quick dodge type manouever, all you can do is awkwardly strafe and hope that the enemy has very sh*t aim, on the normal difficulty you can take a fair amount of bullets, but the enemies call their mates pretty quickly and you're gonna end up filled with holes faster than you can say ''f*ck''. Though some people might say this is a good thing because It incentivises you to be more sneaky, I'd say that it prevents an organic and fluid means of escaping the situation, It's actually pretty jarring since you suddenly become as stiff as Robocop. But for the most part I'm good at planning out my kills so things don't go awry very often, so the shooting doesn't bother me very much.\n\nPersonally, I can look past the lack of a story and complexity simply because of how fun and organic the gameplay is, there are many routes to take, many ways to plan out your murder and a crapton of ways to actually pull them off.\n\nGreat game, get it all full price.","July 17, 2015","true","34.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Hitman Blood Money is a game about finding and eliminating targets in a multitude of scenarios ranging from a party in a vineyard, to suburbia, to a casino, and a mardi-gras street fest.  This game is non-linear and each level presents many options for eliminating your target.  Do you go quiet and kill your target by switching the prop gun with a real replica?  Do you equip your machine gun and go in guns blazing?  Do you slit his throat in the dressing room?  The level of options for each level make this the best hitman game to date.\n\nSmall detractments from this game include some wacky AI choices and some difficult movement elements (going through windows can sometimes be a pain and AI can sometimes spaz out and find you etc.)  But don't be discouraged, the positives in this game far outweigh the negatives.\n\nI recently rebought this game on steam because I lost my CD.  I'm enjoying this playthrough just like I enjoyed the dozens of hours I experienced through my retail copy.\n\nTake it from a TF2 spy main.

It has a great concept where you play as an assassin and are sent to kill people and then decide how best to do it. In practice... it's a puzzle game where the trick is to find the "correct" route that will lead you to your target and let you whack em. Not as fun as the original idea implies.\n\nWell, that's what i'd say about the -other- Hitman games i've played. Blood Money on the other hand comes the closest to what it was trying to be all along. In this game you have a number of assassination missions, and there truly are plenty of ways of carrying it out. And it can get really really fun. Example... ah no. I'm not going to spoil that. You have to find out on your own! Guns, poisons, sedatives, fiber wire, and bombs are included among your toys, and that doesn't include any of the options that you can use once you on site. Some of which allow you to get other unwitting people to do your killing for you.\n\nAnyway, it's a great fun game where you are sent to kill some people, and then choose how you shall go about it. If that sounds interesting... grab this during a sale. It's worth it. :D","March 7, 2014","true","41.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's essentially a puzzle game set inside real-world sandboxes - you walk around in plain sight trying to figure out how to best distract or impersonate the guards to get to your target and then get back out again. It is very refreshing to play a game that has a true-to-life amount of civilians walking around in it instead of being stuck in abandoned city blocks or enemy bases. Of course, if you start attacking those civilians indiscriminately, you will be dead in no seconds flat. Really cool concept.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that the game is designed around trial and error. You have to die over and over to figure out what places you are allowed to go, and to figure out the movements of your targets. You also get limited saves, so eventually it just gets frustrating. It's a testament to the game that even after i started using walkthroughs to figure out where to go without having to repeat sections over and over it was pretty fun. If you are into pure stealth spy games (there are no dialog options/conversation challenges), it's certainly worth the pittance it goes for these days.","January 3","true","16.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It took IO Interactive quite a long time to develop the latest episode for the game industry's (probably) most famous assassin. As to what caused this postponement I do not know - perhaps the reception of Blood Money had been negative or somewhat mixed. My feelings about the game are only positive and I salute IO for making such an amazing, stealth-based action-adventure software that offers high replayability due to the various difficulty settings available.\n\nBlood Money gives us a different setting in each mission. Hitman eliminates a gang on a riverboat in Mississippi, approaches a drug lord in Chile, takes down members of a rivaling organisation during a street festival, eliminates a sheikh in a casino in Vegas and more! Every level is very different from its predecessor - it requires different tactics and it is very important to pay attention to your surroundings, i.e. where the enemies are, what their patrolling route is, what disguises you need for them not to be able to recognise you etc. Attention to detail is top notch. The game looks good, runs well and has very decent voice acting. Music was composed by Jesper Kyd who later on presented us with the excellent score of Assassins Creed.\n\nMore than one solution exists to solve a mission. The game, therefore, is varied and offers replayability as some solutions require more finesse and while they offer you the easy way out (i.e. no violent encounters) the execution can hold you for hours. In fact, a higher difficulty setting allows you only to save fewer times so you really need to plan every move carefully. Higher difficulty levels yield you with extra money after the mission as the game offers no achievements. More money means better weapons and gadgets at your disposal. But if you prefer the stealth approach you will not purchase new weapons or upgrade your existing ones with the extra sum - you, instead, will use this to bribe key people to decrease your notoriety. Also, when you play the game for the first time, it is advisable to purchase information; information that helps you with the solution in each mission in the form of tips, personal messages.\n\nIn Hitman you need to obtain a disguise all the time to get past certain points in the level. While stealth-based games are many I do not recall any of these out there offering this option. In many cases you need to use more than one disguise and just to make the game more challenging you get extra money for reaching the extraction point in your tuxedo, how you originally started your mission. Even the story is interesting and has some surprises - just to mention the name of some locations towards the end of it would be a spoiler so you can find it out for yourselves.\n\nBlood Money is an exceptionally good game. Absolution is the "next-gen" version of Hitman - but if you don't mind playing a challenging and exciting game that is 6 years old Blood Money is for you.\n","March 19, 2014","true","31.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Agent 47 is a highly trained, professional assassin for hire and this game really displays that nicely.  You can customize his primary agency weapons to make them more silent, precise, or damaging.  You can knockout bystandards and take their clothes to disguise yourself and get into restricted areas and reach your target.  This game allows you to really take any approach that you want to a situation.  You can go in a just kill every person in sight and you could go through the whole game like that.  However, this game rewards players who take their time and think about their moves to get their target and not be seen.  You get a more rewarding experience when you think out your moves and it makes you feel pretty great when you finally take out the target and leave without a soul knowing what has even happened.

It takes the tired and true hitman game mechanics and updates them into 2006. Tracking and killing a contract in big levels with great AI and atmosphere never gets old. The rush of garroting a target from the darkness is awesome. The graphics are quite good for the time period, and the sound design is superb. It's very well voice acted, and Jasper Kyd's soundtrack is superb. What really shines in the game is the level design. Blood Money contains some of the most creative, varied and impressive levels I've ever seen, which lend themselves to countless possibilities in pulling off kills. That and the surprisingly good AI which reacts to and changes strategy on the fly make for a great gameplay experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grellisbest/recommended/6860/","Grellisbest","Djpegisister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grellisbest/","51 products in account","This game is by far the best Hitman in the series, even till this day. The playability, even on this platform, is exceptional. No lagging, rendering and most of all no crashing (windows 8). Despite having a lot of options and weapons and ways to use them etc... everything is easy to use after the tutorial mission, nothing too complex. The graphics are awesome, especially taking into account that this game was released over 8 years ago!\n\nHours of fun is to be had with this game, it's entertaining to go and play the game back to do things a little different and see which route to take is the most rewarding one. The introduction of new systems in the series such as a cash system, notoriety system and conventionally a rating system. Each one tying everything in the game together, demontrating why your approach has earned you your reputation/money whether good or bad. Axiomatically the stealth route is the most fruitful, but to blast your way through the game and become notorious can be extremely fun too.\n\nThere are 13 immersive and addicting levels in the game, each taking around 30-60 minutes to complete, so you will certainly have hours of fun. Each level is beautifully designed and shrewdly thought out, making Agent 47's world one which you will want to go back to again and again. Despite the linear narrative in the game and the ineviable ending, how you get there is what makes this game unique. You notice new things as you go back and play again, noticing different geographical approaches or the fact you completely missed a secure room which takes you on a different route to achieve your assassination(s).\n\nThe AI need a mention in my review for the vast improvement the developers have made, contrasting previous titles. They are much more intelligent in every sense you can think of when approaching a conventional stealth assassin game. They no longer blow your brains out for wanting to go through a door that is restricted, they just become aware and suspicious of you for wanting to do so. They will ask you to leave, if you do not comply, that's when they logically gun you down. Also, you can no longer hide in the most ridiculous place as the AI will look if they're suspicious of you being in there... for instance, if you shoot from a building and your notoriety shoots up, if you're in a building with a closet and you get in, they will get you out of there... the game prepares you to be more of a stealth killer, or just more prepared for the mini army about to come and get you.  A final mention on the AI is the fact they can see right through your disguise if you do not use them wisely. If you put on a disguise, but have irregular patterns or do suspicious things, their awareness will raise and they'll eventually warn all other staff and before you know it everybody is coming after you. This again engages you to be much more shrewd about your assassination if you take the stealth approach to the game.\n\nAll in all a beautiful looking and atmospheric game which captivates throughout. The rebuild of the engine has made for great animation with amazing lighting effects and shadows and immaculate detail for a 2006 title. The only negative I can possibly fathom is that the camera can sometimes be a little awkward in tight spaces, such as an elevator, however this takes nothing from the overall playability of the game. It's definitely worth picking up at normal price, but at it's current discounted rate it would be crazy not to!\n\nPros:\n\n- Enthralling and story-line that gives many hours to feast upon.\n- Beautiful scenery in each level and a great atmosphere.\n- Extremely easy to pick up and play due to it's incredible playability.\n\nCons:\n\n- Camera can be awkward at times.\n\nRating: A stolid 9.8 out of 10.\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each level was well crafted, provided a reasonable challenge, and offered a multitude of ways to beat the level. This is a stealth action game with emphasis on non combat and discovering a sequence of events that will lead to the completion of each level.\n\nPros: The overall presentation of the game was much better than the previous two games with cut scenes between each level and a good story arc. The biggest improvement has to be the multiple ways of approaching each level.  You could beat the level one way then talk to a buddy who did the same level a completely different way. The music was used well to heighten the mood when need be. As expected the graphics and game mechanics have been improved.\n\nCons: Although many paths exist for completing a level, Blood Money still suffers from the fact that once a sequence has been found for beating the level it is pretty easy.  However, this is still way better than the previous two games.  The game is only just good.  There are not many epic memorable moments and you never feel that involved with the level.\n\nIf you like the stealth action genre then this is a must play.\nScore: 8.5/10","August 4, 2013","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grellisbest/recommended/6860/","Grellisbest","Djpegisister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grellisbest/","51 products in account","This game is by far the best Hitman in the series, even till this day. The playability, even on this platform, is exceptional. No lagging, rendering and most of all no crashing (windows 8). Despite having a lot of options and weapons and ways to use them etc... everything is easy to use after the tutorial mission, nothing too complex. The graphics are awesome, especially taking into account that this game was released over 8 years ago!\n\nHours of fun is to be had with this game, it's entertaining to go and play the game back to do things a little different and see which route to take is the most rewarding one. The introduction of new systems in the series such as a cash system, notoriety system and conventionally a rating system. Each one tying everything in the game together, demontrating why your approach has earned you your reputation/money whether good or bad. Axiomatically the stealth route is the most fruitful, but to blast your way through the game and become notorious can be extremely fun too.\n\nThere are 13 immersive and addicting levels in the game, each taking around 30-60 minutes to complete, so you will certainly have hours of fun. Each level is beautifully designed and shrewdly thought out, making Agent 47's world one which you will want to go back to again and again. Despite the linear narrative in the game and the ineviable ending, how you get there is what makes this game unique. You notice new things as you go back and play again, noticing different geographical approaches or the fact you completely missed a secure room which takes you on a different route to achieve your assassination(s).\n\nThe AI need a mention in my review for the vast improvement the developers have made, contrasting previous titles. They are much more intelligent in every sense you can think of when approaching a conventional stealth assassin game. They no longer blow your brains out for wanting to go through a door that is restricted, they just become aware and suspicious of you for wanting to do so. They will ask you to leave, if you do not comply, that's when they logically gun you down. Also, you can no longer hide in the most ridiculous place as the AI will look if they're suspicious of you being in there... for instance, if you shoot from a building and your notoriety shoots up, if you're in a building with a closet and you get in, they will get you out of there... the game prepares you to be more of a stealth killer, or just more prepared for the mini army about to come and get you.  A final mention on the AI is the fact they can see right through your disguise if you do not use them wisely. If you put on a disguise, but have irregular patterns or do suspicious things, their awareness will raise and they'll eventually warn all other staff and before you know it everybody is coming after you. This again engages you to be much more shrewd about your assassination if you take the stealth approach to the game.\n\nAll in all a beautiful looking and atmospheric game which captivates throughout. The rebuild of the engine has made for great animation with amazing lighting effects and shadows and immaculate detail for a 2006 title. The only negative I can possibly fathom is that the camera can sometimes be a little awkward in tight spaces, such as an elevator, however this takes nothing from the overall playability of the game. It's definitely worth picking up at normal price, but at it's current discounted rate it would be crazy not to!\n\nPros:\n\n- Enthralling and story-line that gives many hours to feast upon.\n- Beautiful scenery in each level and a great atmosphere.\n- Extremely easy to pick up and play due to it's incredible playability.\n\nCons:\n\n- Camera can be awkward at times.\n\nRating: A stolid 9.8 out of 10.\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a stealth-action game, but really how you complete each assassination is all up to you. You can be stealthy if you want, but you can also try to mindlessly gun down everyone too if you want. This game adds some new features to the series such as being able to hide bodies in containers, and I still think this is the best game in the series. I'd say it's a good starting point for people who haven't played Hitman before. Don't worry too much about the story by the way if this is your first Hitman game.

Throughout the game you wiill encounter the usual kill the target hide the body collect the evidence etc. But its the way you do it that makes the game so fun you choose how your going to carry out your mission and killings,. If you want to go for silent assassin ratings then you need to learn the level and the way the AI moves about the level and how they react to diffrent events, If you prefer to go in all guns blazing then you can do that also both ways are fun but if you want to learn this game and experience the fun of it i suggest doing it as sneeky as you can.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Retuobak/recommended/6860/","Retuobak","Bernd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Retuobak/","534 products in account","One of the very best games of the past generation. Hitman: Blood Money again has you perform several assassinations as the 'bald killer clone' Agent 47. You are dropped in about a dozen large maps, and have to figure out how to accomplish a set of tasks, which of course always include assassinations, as silently as possible. As a result, the game is essentially a puzzle game, and a very good one at that. No level has just one solution for attaining the optimal 'silent assassin' rating, which makes replaying levels worthwhile, as should be obvious from my time spent on the game.\n\nPerhaps one of the game's strongest qualities is the variety in level themes, it takes you to snowy mountain villas, quiet suburbs, underground nightclubs, redneck weddings and many other locales. All this is scored by one of the generation's finest soundtracks by composer Jesper Kyd.\n\nBlood Money is significantly more refined than its predecessors, which while good, are a bit too rough around the edges for the average gamer. This is also essentially Hitman's last hurrah. While Hitman: Absolution is not an irredeemably terrible game, it does move away from what is the core of the franchise. Where in Blood Money, the focus is clearly on planning and figuring out the solution, Absolution switches it more towards execution. I think the appeal of the two games as a result is rather different, this aside from several design issues Absolution has with one of its core mechanics.","July 3, 2011","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you swap a fake gun for a real one, and watch as your target gets killed onstage, or do you snipe him unseen from a balcony? Or do you just rush in with a shotgun and eliminate everybody and anybody? It's your choice!\n+Graphics are fairly decent for an early 7th gen game, and most systems should run it easily.\n+Great soundtrack by the legendary Jesper Kyd.\n+Good voice acting.\n+Solid game mechanics. Everything, from the disguise system to weapon customizing adds to the game, and doesn't feel like shallow filler.\nCons\n-In game, resolution options are limited, and you may need to edit the .ini files to get one that matches your monitor.\n-Limited amount of weapons to customize, and all upgrades can be bought fairly quickly.\n-Not a whole lot of missions (13 total, and 1 is a linear tutorial, and the last one isn't really an assassination, so it's more like 11), but the replay value makes up for it.\n-Story isn't that interesting, but you can skip the cutscenes at any time, and I don't think people play these games for the story anyway.\n\nOverall\nBeing my first Hitman game, I really enjoyed it. The numerous ways to eliminate your targets and open ended levels add lots of replay value, the game looks nice, and although the story is lacking, it's not awful.

Hitman: Blood Money is by some considered to be 'the better' Hitman game. Although it obviously has an edge over its predecessors as far as graphics and sound effects are concerned, it did a lot of things right.\n\nThe graphics are decent for its time. While there are definitely some graphics glitches (most ragdoll related), it does not fail to immerse the player. The effects of lighting has been taken advantage of and at this point in the game development industry there's a healthy emphasis on textures except for skyboxes.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and has only minor glitches that you will likely not even trigger unless you start experimenting. Regardless, none of the glitches you will run into should break the game or your perception of the atmosphere and storyline. And don't get me wrong, it had the potential to go terribly wrong here: the gameplay hooks in on the story and immersion, it could not exist without the storyline, and the storyline would not be convincing without the mechanics this game has to offer. Luckily there's nothing to be afraid of in this regard.\n\nThe music is fitting and blends the environment and story together. A proper use of sounds and quality voice acting make it the story much more enjoyable.\n\nBuy it if you haven't played it yet! Hitman: Blood Money is one of those classics that you should try at least once. It is a good quality game that today's videogame industry should consider looking into as reference material.","January 4, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the game you encounter unique moments that are iconic to a young man's life - ranging from killing your first victim to hiding your first cold, lifeless body. Hitmane: Blood Monet is a great game, but it does have it's cons:\n-Controls are sort of funky\n-Optimization for PC is just not there\n-Very violent for an E+ rated game (this really surprised me)\n-Levels feel very boxed in, and it often feels like there is nowhere to go, and going about most situations is very one-sided.\nOther than that, the game is sure to provide some quality entertainment. Now for some pros.\n+Physics engine is pretty good. It can be a bit too realitic sometimes, but that's ok\n+Graphics are fantastic, especially for when the game was released. They may not be up to par today, but the game is still just as enjoyable.\n+The story is very rich with drama, romance, comedy, and especially blood - which is just essential for any Hotman game.\n+Has an E+ rating, so many different types of age groups can enjoy it.\nOverall, Hit and Run: Brood Mother is a pretty great game!

This gem is just a classic and it brings nostalgia to the top. But, unfortunately the PC version is disappoiting. Mainly because there's no controller support and the game stutters like crazy. I spent hours on the internet trying to find a fix for that and, even though it's not the best thing, it works.\n\nFirst you either have to run the config (when you start the game from Steam) then check both SLI options or/and you have to run the game in window mode (window mode did it for me).\n\nAnd if you're like me and you hate playing with that annoying tool bar and borders on the side of the screen, you can download a cool little software called "Windowed Borderless Gaming". You might still have white bars on the side, but you can go into the options and enlarge the screen a little bit so they dissapear completely.\n\nI still have to recommend this game because it is truly awesome.

Do you swap a fake gun for a real one, and watch as your target gets killed onstage, or do you snipe him unseen from a balcony? Or do you just rush in with a shotgun and eliminate everybody and anybody? It's your choice!\n+Graphics are fairly decent for an early 7th gen game, and most systems should run it easily.\n+Great soundtrack by the legendary Jesper Kyd.\n+Good voice acting.\n+Solid game mechanics. Everything, from the disguise system to weapon customizing adds to the game, and doesn't feel like shallow filler.\nCons\n-In game, resolution options are limited, and you may need to edit the .ini files to get one that matches your monitor.\n-Limited amount of weapons to customize, and all upgrades can be bought fairly quickly.\n-Not a whole lot of missions (13 total, and 1 is a linear tutorial, and the last one isn't really an assassination, so it's more like 11), but the replay value makes up for it.\n-Story isn't that interesting, but you can skip the cutscenes at any time, and I don't think people play these games for the story anyway.\n\nOverall\nBeing my first Hitman game, I really enjoyed it. The numerous ways to eliminate your targets and open ended levels add lots of replay value, the game looks nice, and although the story is lacking, it's not awful.

Hitman: Blood Money is by some considered to be 'the better' Hitman game. Although it obviously has an edge over its predecessors as far as graphics and sound effects are concerned, it did a lot of things right.\n\nThe graphics are decent for its time. While there are definitely some graphics glitches (most ragdoll related), it does not fail to immerse the player. The effects of lighting has been taken advantage of and at this point in the game development industry there's a healthy emphasis on textures except for skyboxes.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and has only minor glitches that you will likely not even trigger unless you start experimenting. Regardless, none of the glitches you will run into should break the game or your perception of the atmosphere and storyline. And don't get me wrong, it had the potential to go terribly wrong here: the gameplay hooks in on the story and immersion, it could not exist without the storyline, and the storyline would not be convincing without the mechanics this game has to offer. Luckily there's nothing to be afraid of in this regard.\n\nThe music is fitting and blends the environment and story together. A proper use of sounds and quality voice acting make it the story much more enjoyable.\n\nBuy it if you haven't played it yet! Hitman: Blood Money is one of those classics that you should try at least once. It is a good quality game that today's videogame industry should consider looking into as reference material.","January 4, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes the game unique is that you can play in a stealth approach: observing enemy patrols, finding out how to infiltrate certain places, and planning a way to get close enough to take out your target or even how to take them down from afar.\n\nOne of the main features of the game that is still intact is that 47 is still a master of disguises and has the ability to change his clothing in seconds (it may sound a little weird, but it explains how someone can do the stuff he pulls off), which in most cases is the only way to access certain locations in the game. For instance, only workers can enter a part of the opera house that is still being build, I mean, you can enter without disguise, but that will attract attention AND the guards of the place.\n\nAn addition made in this game, is that now 47 can move faster while sneaking, in previous games, it was hard and painful to sneak around because it was too slow. He can now throw coins around to lure people to someplace where them and 47 can have a more "personal conversation" or simply use them to lure guards out of posts and such.\n\nAlthough it is a stealth game, it is different from what the conventional stealth games are and play. In here, you don't use the darkness to hide, you use the people and your disguises, you can crouch behind something, but don't expect that to go unnoticed: people react to your actions, and someone sees you sneaking around or behind people, they will react properly.\n\nIt is weird that people only bother listening to YOUR footsteps. For instance, there's this guard walking with another close to him, he'll do his job normally, then later you take out one of the guards and take his place, the other guard WILL start looking back and perplexed stare at you. These things are a little annoying because it happens only with the player. Since you can't sneak all the time without calling unwanted attention, you have to adapt to survive, and having access to a plethora of ways to approach a place/person is what increases its replay value and makes it unique.\n\nAlso a new feature is the introduction of Accidents. 47 can now push people off rails, roofs, etc, or he can just knock them out and THEN throw them off such places. This adds even more different ways to complete the assignments. Since the money you earn is determined by your performance in the missions, things as killing innocent people or be seeing doing something suspect all count towards your final rating. If someone saw you, you CAN kill this people as a way to have no witnesses, but the game will not penalize you if you can make it look like an accident, this is a nice addition.\n\nYou can now also customize your weapons, like putting a silencer in your Baller pistols or SMG, or putting a more precise scope at your rifles. Upgrading equipment is also possible now, such as decreasing the time it takes to lockpick a door or increase the distance of where you must be to detonate your remote bombs.\n\nA new possibility now in case things get hairy is the ability to take people as human shields. But besides the obvious purpose it also serves as a way to take someone faster to a certain place. For instance, instead of having to wait till the person is knocked down with the effect of some of your tranquilizer syringes and then drag them somewhere more discreet, you can grab then and "quickly" get them elsewhere and THEN knock then out without worrying with the possibility of someone seeing you.\n\nIn the graphics department, the game handles very well, its attention to detail is remarkable and every place in the game looks convincing, from a suburban house to a rehabilitation clinic or a Mardi Gras parade.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing, it server to set the mood for the missions but also to tell the player of the current situation, if something goes wrong and you're about to get shot by the guards, you'll know before hand because of the song that will start playing. The voice acting is really good, David Bateson delivers a believable cold Agent 47 as always, and Vivienne McKee does a great job bringing the faceless Diana to life in her "cold but sometimes caring" voice. The NPC's voices sometimes are goofy and funny but noticeable intended as a way to ease the tension in the game.\n\nThe big arsenal of weapons, equipments, and disguises give the player a lot of freedom to approach the missions. Being stealthy and infiltrating a place from the back or even the front, or simply go guns blazing, be certain that you can always surprise yourself when things DO work even when you try to be more creative.","January 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkeletonWarriors/recommended/6860/","SkeletonWarriors","Vunjak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkeletonWarriors/","262 products in account","I can without hesitation reccomend this game. As of now I have 147 hours of playtime which is probably more than the average person would get out of it. It is not without it's flaws but in my opinion the flaws are not game breaking in the least.\n\nDo not be put off by the first mission. The very first mission is a mandatory, linear, and all around just not very fun. It serves to teach you the mechanics without distracting you from the goal. There are other missions just like it which I feel are too linear, but nowhere near as bad as the first. I think this tutorial mission put off too many people who never got to the next one to find how "open" it could be and what the possibilites were like. It's not unbearable but it's so un-indicative of how most of the game goes and what makes it so good.\n\nThe menu system is pretty clunky. It seems to be really geared toward console gamepad controls. It's a small nitpick and you get used to it quite quickly but it can get annoying if you need to switch items a lot in rapid succession.\n\nThere is one fault with the rating system I will go into detail about next. There is a way to cause "accidents". You push someone off a cliff/down the stairs/whatever, or maybe you rig something to fall apart or explode suddenly to cause something large to crush them. Now while I love the concept and usually it is brilliant, there are problems. For example, I remember one instance where I wanted to get all accidents for the Silent Ghost rating (the highest paid rating possible). Well, pushing the guy down the stairs was the best way. So I push him and then he falls kind of slowly in what looks like a crawl down the steps. Then what happens? Apparently he didn't "crawl fall" enough and gets up and starts to shoot me along with everyone else. I had to reload and do this many, many times for it to finally work correctly. So I have a little problem with that but it happens relatively few times in the course of a playthrough.\n\nSo with the things that bother me out of the way, let me lose myself in the seemingly endless things that I love about his game. Starting with the Rating System. Now with this system you are awarded cash and a title depending on many factors including whether you did the optional objectives, how many innocents you knocked out/killed, how many times you alerted guards, how many bodies were found, how many "accidents" occured, what gun was used the most, how many shots hit their target, how accurate you were, noise level, violence level, and a whole bunch of other factors. Most of these come as a straight spreadsheet of info, but some are in the brilliant newspaper front page that you get afterwards. It gives a summary as an article of what you did, whether you silently exectuted the target/s quietly, or went and killed hundreds of people. Seeing the different ratings you can get for accomplishing certain levels of violence, silence, and ways to kill people, really increases replayability and makes certain "runs" pretty fun. Sometimes I just try to see how many people I can kill with a kitchen knife and still finish the mission. Or maybe i'll see how many accidents I can cause.\n\nThe custom loadout is really well done, but it has one flaw. You are limited in that you can only bring one weapon that you acquired from a mission. Like if you leave a mission with a Mosin Nagant sniper rifle then it becomes available with limited ammo for taking you with you on a mission. But what I don't like is that you can't have 2 rifles, 2 pistols, or 2 sub machine guns. You have 1 pistol, 1 rifle, and 1 submachinegun with no exceptions. I would rather have traded some of the other gadgets i didn't need for more flexibility but it simply wasn't an option. Still, the loadout system is fine despite that limitation. If you're really good then all you need are the syringes and the fiber wire most of the time anyway.\n\nThe writing is so hilarious. It is mostly self aware of how crappy it is at times and does it for comedic effect. Other times the writing is really witty and feels very real. Mostly everyone fits some sort of stereotype, almost insultingly so, but it has such a charm when a sailor with sideburns on the Mississippi says "Get lost Chum Lee." in a Cajun accent. This game has so much character in the characters if that makes sense. It feels very real, but at the same time it's so very surreal too.\n\nThe soundtrack is to die for. No really, it's like really well done mostly because of Jesper Kyd when he was, in my opinion, at his peak. It's a very teasy mix of classical and electronic rythums depedning on the mood and what is happening. Easily one of my favorite soundtracks.\n\nAnother thing I love about this game is the attention to detail. I'm always finding something new. I found out last time I played Curtains Down (a mission in which you are at a french opera house during a practice night). There is a guard constantly "patroling" with a group of people as a tour guide. This guard takes a break and goes into this small closet-like room. When he does you can quickly knock him out/kill him and take his clothes. So when you come back out the group starts following you as if you are the new guide. After a mintue or so of not talking to them they of course disperse sounding agitated in french. It's this kind of nuance and possiblity of discovery that helps me come back to play and see what else I can uncover. I hate to spoil a later mission but for example you walk into a high class party and the singer is absolutely, positively awful. First time I played I didn't even really notice I thought that maybe the game did it for a laugh, but then later you find out that she is the secret assassin there to kill you. That sort of blew my mind when I found out and yet another testament to the small things. You'll notice too that when you kill a contract they will appear in the main menu's chapel sitting in various spots as if attending. I could go on forever about all this little stuff but I think you get it.\n\nI can honestly say it's one of my favorite games of all time.  Try it.","January 28, 2014","true","148.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ignore the rest (as Hitman Contracts isn't sold  anywhere), this is the only one you need. One of the great ones in freeform stealth games. The game gets completed in one evening's playthrough but you can solve the missions in so many different ways it can be played through multiple times without getting stale. Crank difficulty to the max and ignore the in-mission saves, getting in trouble is half the fun.","July 16, 2012","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you swap a fake gun for a real one, and watch as your target gets killed onstage, or do you snipe him unseen from a balcony? Or do you just rush in with a shotgun and eliminate everybody and anybody? It's your choice!\n+Graphics are fairly decent for an early 7th gen game, and most systems should run it easily.\n+Great soundtrack by the legendary Jesper Kyd.\n+Good voice acting.\n+Solid game mechanics. Everything, from the disguise system to weapon customizing adds to the game, and doesn't feel like shallow filler.\nCons\n-In game, resolution options are limited, and you may need to edit the .ini files to get one that matches your monitor.\n-Limited amount of weapons to customize, and all upgrades can be bought fairly quickly.\n-Not a whole lot of missions (13 total, and 1 is a linear tutorial, and the last one isn't really an assassination, so it's more like 11), but the replay value makes up for it.\n-Story isn't that interesting, but you can skip the cutscenes at any time, and I don't think people play these games for the story anyway.\n\nOverall\nBeing my first Hitman game, I really enjoyed it. The numerous ways to eliminate your targets and open ended levels add lots of replay value, the game looks nice, and although the story is lacking, it's not awful. Buy it when you have the chance.","March 23, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hitman: Blood Money is by some considered to be 'the better' Hitman game. Although it obviously has an edge over its predecessors as far as graphics and sound effects are concerned, it did a lot of things right.\n\nThe graphics are decent for its time. While there are definitely some graphics glitches (most ragdoll related), it does not fail to immerse the player. The effects of lighting has been taken advantage of and at this point in the game development industry there's a healthy emphasis on textures except for skyboxes.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and has only minor glitches that you will likely not even trigger unless you start experimenting. Regardless, none of the glitches you will run into should break the game or your perception of the atmosphere and storyline. And don't get me wrong, it had the potential to go terribly wrong here: the gameplay hooks in on the story and immersion, it could not exist without the storyline, and the storyline would not be convincing without the mechanics this game has to offer. Luckily there's nothing to be afraid of in this regard.\n\nThe music is fitting and blends the environment and story together. A proper use of sounds and quality voice acting make it the story much more enjoyable.\n\nBuy it if you haven't played it yet! Hitman: Blood Money is one of those classics that you should try at least once. It is a good quality game that today's videogame industry should consider looking into as reference material.","January 4, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The great thing about the levels is that there are so many different ways to complete a hit.  There are so many missions i played over and over just trying to find new ways. The settings are beautiful and innovative. Like for example you are in an opera or on the streets of New Orleans while the Mardi Gras parade. But even on a mission, where you're just in a quiet neighbourhood, are so much things to see and explore. The story plot and the characters are well staged.

The main focus being on stealth provides a lot of opportunities  in unique environments. You can go full Rambo by gunning your way through every level but will result in more deaths. You can also go stealth which will result in less deaths and a satisfying payoff but you will have to be more patient. This makes you choose whether to go for risk or reward. The story is nothing special in fact it merely serves a purpose to move the game along ,but they do throw in some plot twists here and there to maintain the players interest but that's all I will say. On the console versions the fps will drop in more pact situations, the key example being The Murder Of The Crows mission as your wading your way through literally hundreds of people. This game also takes no PC performance so it can run on most PC's. Even though this game takes no huge leaps in technology for 2006 standards the graphics are still very good. On the Xbox 360  especially shows off unique environments with great level design. I would rate this game a 9.5/10 highly recommended above all other Hitman games.","May 30, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes multiple play-throughs to truly experience all that the developers have put into the game.\n\nI would highly recommend this game!","September 19, 2011","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stealth is different from other stealth games, since it's all about hiding in plain sight. The player must acquire and use disguises to avoid suspicion. While you can go through the game guns blazing, it's more more fun and rewarding going through the game stealthily.\n\nI highly recommend this for stealth action fans.","November 9, 2012","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hitman: Blood Money is great fun, even after you've beaten every level.  It's one of the most replayable games I've ever played simply because of the amount of ways you can complete your objectives.","November 3, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
