Like something you can beat on your lunch break.\n\nYou're wanting a game that's very forgiving in mistakes. If one of your units gets wiped out. They're good as done. What you see is what you get.  Mastery of skill and making use of what you have is key.\n\nYou hate realism.\n\nYou're very picky with the occasional wonky A.I.\n\nAn obessive frame rate freak.\n\nDo buy this game if:\n\nYou want a wargame that tries to bring another level of realism to the table. Such realism like giving orders to units via a courier. Proper troop deployment, ammo supply, fatigue, morale, and how to manage the characteristics of different units. Not one is ever truly the same as the other. Some units will fight to the death, some will scatter after a few casualities.\n\nYou want massively scaled battles with literally thousands of soldiers on the field.\n\nLove historical based games.\n\nLove the ability to command an entire army or just simply a brigade.\n\n\n","November 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 297 of 339 people (88%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","88","297","339","21","26"

Now this is a problem, it's party becasue the engine is old and glued, taped and rubberbanded togeater from older incarnations, The game only uses 1.5 cores yet the game is 90%! based on CPU power, with RAM far behind and GPU almost playing no effect.\n\nAperantly the reason for 1.5 core use is with more cores the multiplayer becomes unstable... So it was dield back 1.5,\nSo if you got a 3.5 x 8 CPU you will get worse FPS then a 3.8 x4  CPU.\n\nNow this is bad, but worse is the devlopers complantancy with it, When this topic is brought up, you will be swarmed with "this isn't a first person shooter, you don't need 60 fps, or 30 fps" or similar excuses. They honestly think 12 fps is good enough. Now the same thing is happening on the steam forum, any complaint that 12fps isn't good enough and you'll be swarmed by people attacking you for pointing out this very obvious fact.\n\nI personaly get slighly nauseous and can get bad headaches if playing on 7-12 fps, yet this complaint is ignored, like my experiences with the game isn't valid. I think all this stems from some of the developers and alot of the fanboys(I count my self as a fanboy of this game and all the games made by Norbsoft, also before it was nordsoft)  Are totaly separate from the rest of the gaming comunity. I honestly think they think 12 fps is fine. And do not realise that about 99% of the rest of the gaming world do not agree.\n\n\nOk Now to the good stuff, and there is alot of good stuff.\n\nAs mentioned I have played the pevious Scourge of war games, and the Two "Take command" games. Take command first bull run when it first came out was AMAZING!\n\nThe game from the name obvously deals with Waterloo, You get 20 "campaign missions"  10 for each side. With each battle getting bigger. The first battles are brigade sized game, where you control a few thousand soldiers. The last two battles are The full waterloo battle, one as Napoleon one as the Anglo-Allies/Prussians. This is an epic game, At 1:4 scale you will controll some 18 000 sprites representing about 70 000 men, And the enemy got about the same sized  army.\nAs the battle goes on, another 5000-10000 sprites will enter the battle.\n\nI personaly feel the game looks great, sure it's not a total war looking game, but seeing tens of thousands of troops marcning is a beautifull sight.\n\nAs an Army general you will give orders to your corps and divisions, or even brigades,\n\nBut as a brigade general you are just a small clog in the big ben, You will have to do your best with your 1500-3000 men while the battle rages around you.\n\nThe ai while not perfect, is better then almost all other strategy games. each commander is based on the real one.\nSo Ai Picton will generaly perfrom better then AI Prince of orange. ect.\n\nI do have one other complaint, the arty, and this has been a thing since first bull run. Arty is useless with anything less then canister. You can have 80 cannon fireing at 30 000 enemies and after an hour they will have killed 10 guys. It does remove the fact that arty did in general much more damage then muskets and sabers.(with some exceptions)\n\nI can not comment on MP as I do not play it online, but aperantly it's fantastic.\n\n\nYou also have the ny Mini Campaign, map of belgium where you move, detach retach units, with sevral options for victory, from taking spesific town, to hunting down and destroying most of the enemy forces. Quite fun, and can lead to enormous battles. I personaly had one battle that totaled over 300 000 troops(so over 70 000 sprites)\n\nThere are other minor compaint that some people feel are more imporant then I do. like unrealistic movement of units, or "spagetification" as it's called, It might be I'm simply used it that rather odd sight based on it's been in the engine since First bull run some 10 years ago.\n\nThe game is far above any other Napoleonic game.\n\nI also recomend the Scourge of war gettysburg if you are more a ACW gamer, Not sure if it will come on Steam, but matrix games have it in it's store.","November 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 89 of 115 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","89","115","6","10"

Sure, the game is not as pretty as Napoleon: Total War and is even mildly less appealing graphically than Histwar, but it makes up for this in spades by presenting as accurate a combat simulation that can be made of the Napoleonic Wars given today's technological constraints.\n\nThere is a lot more going on under the hood than what you can gather from the screenshots - you have the opportunity to play the full battle of Waterloo in real time, simulating the nearly 200,000 soldiers that participated, generally in 1:4 scale. The Sandbox Campaign also lets you simulate the campaign in Belgium during the Hundred Days, so you might be able to radically change history that way as well.\n\nI am a huge fan of the era and so this game was a must have. Even though I am not as partial to Waterloo as other battles of the period (I would prefer Austerlitz, Wagram, Leipzig, or Jena-Auerstedt) the modding community has already provided a substantial amount of content and has created some of the OOBs for those battles already.\n\nIf you think this game would be a good match for you, go to the developer's website and check out their demo for Scourge of War Gettysburg since they are similar enough. Overall, I would say the game is worth it for any fan of the Napoleonic Wars.","November 20, 2015","true","8.9"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","43","52","0","1"

I've already logged a bunch of hours while my internet was down...\n\nRegardless this game is a great strategy game. But be warned watch a video, this isnt a visually advanced game, its all sprites and what not. It is also not fast paced. But it is in-depth and in my opinion exciting, and despite the slower pace, the... intense moments of watching your line trying to hold, or ordering a division commander to fulfill orders or being that division commanding officer. You can chose from a variety of command levels on the Order of Battle. You can play the battle of waterloo or make your own. The sandbox campaign is fun but I feel like it is just lacking a in few places, but only in the sense that it leaves me wanting MORE. Over all though I totally would recommend the game to someone who enjoys thoughtful gaming.\n\nIt's too bad though the game doesn't have some sort of grand campaign. That would be pretty awesome. Thats about my only negative I got.\n\nEDIT---\n\nAs I now play larger and larger battles I have found more... frustrating things. Such as a simple notice like... when a major player is killed on the battle. Playing a massive battle on the campaign (my much smaller dutch army w/ fewer infantry, fewer cannons and no calvary trying to hold off a larger french army that including cavalry) where a win was critial as if the french were to break through the town, that army could have caused havoc until I could have mustered a large enough army in the area to counter them (if that was even going to be possible). The pressure was intense, the battle a fantastic reperesentation of what this game has to offer and a billion things going on. Trying to hold a thin line, meanwhile the cavalry rushing in scaring my men into squares where they became easy pickings for my infantry, on the flanks a back and forth of me trying to flank the french and ease pressure on my center before not once but TWICE did the french counter attack with near fresh divisions. The battle itself was absolutely enjoyable. Would I love for some portions of the battle to not become so... laggy. Of course who doesn't want a fluid game? Why when there are i7s and i5s out is the engine rocking some 1.5 crap? Is it too much to ask that the same awesome smooth marching and fighting in smaller battles be capable on the larger scale? Regardless thats absolutely minor and doesn't take away from the fun what so ever, just being picky.\n\nBack to my original point in all this mayham, the bloody Prince of Orange, the commander of the entire dutch army died. No courier to my next in command saying your in charge now. On top of that I find the end stats loaded with info that I dont get a chance to look over cause the game keeps promting end of battle but while your trying to read the stats and find out just who is left in command of your regiments, divisions and corps, the battle is raging on for some reason behind the screen... And maybe I havent found it yet on that screen cause it keeps bumping me out when the end battle newpaper pops up, but the stats you can find midbattle of wounded, missing, and killed for each battalion is great, but why isn't on the end stats. Finding out which of your commanders was killed can be tedious. Or before that just having a courier saying that this commander is dead and so-and-so is taking over. I'd like to look over his stats and see what kind of person he is, seeing as it could someone important or crutial. I think finding out a reliable or favorite division commander was killed would help immersion of being connected or invested in your forces. Finding out after words is like... Oh well that blows. And keeping in touch with historical aspects... I think the chain of command would notice that the PRINCE OF ORANGE was killed and orders were coming from someone else... Haha it's really too bad, now I've got to fight the rest of the campaign without such a leader (who was replaced by a MAJOR/sure hope that was just heat of the moment in battle and someone else is appointed commander, have yet to see).\n\nAnd the screens for spliting and merging portions of your forces can be a pain, and I dont understand why it isn't possible to merge different units to form difference corps or divisions. I have yet to find a way to use Uxbridge's force effectively as it is very cavalry heavy while other portions of the army are without such a vital tool. Just snagging a division and attaching it elsewhere would be nice or atleast have them travel together...\n\nAnyways at the end of the day I would still recomend it. I also recomend watching youtube videos if your on the fence. Be fair warned, the battles are fun as hell and you'll lose track of time having a blast...

It takes a while to get use to and there are a couple of bugs but overall it’s the experience that I was looking for. I’d recommend this to anyone that likes games along the lines of Hearts of Iron 3 or …. Well there’s not a lot to compare this to.  This isn’t a Total War game. You’ll be disappointed going into it thinking that you’ll get that kind of experience. It a thinking man’s game focused on realism. The graphics are beautiful if you recognize what the game is. In my opinion, this is a simulation.  It’s like what x-plane is to war thunder. X-plane take’s hours to learn and is accurate down to the smallest little detail. To make such a game, you cannot have AAA graphics due to the processing power needed to calculate every little detail. Anyways, if you want a historically accurate tactical simulation of Waterloo buy this game.","November 21, 2015","true","84.6"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","4"

And then you see a division of his mates walking over the hill raising their muskets.\n\nNapoleon Total War is like meeting a good looking American Hollywood actor dressed unconvincingly as a Frenchman, on a strange alien world, you pull out a laser pistol and shoot him dead, and his body disappears before he hits the ground.\n\nThe choice as they say is yours.\n\nHowever this game really needs processor speed I have found it very slow in large battles because it doesnt make use of multiple processors. I like the game, its not a fast game its very in depth. Yesterday I rather stupidly got stuck in a pincer between two German units. I held out for an hour but lost in the end, very enjoyable it was too its not often you get beaten by the AI in games. I do love the long massed battles and the courier system is superb.

In a way you probably wouldn't expect.\n\nI am taking command of General Girards 7th Infantry Division, under Marshal Reille's II Corps, with two infantry brigades and Capitan Barbeux's artillery battalion. A Courier from Reille arrives and tells me to mobilize to a small town on the far western end of the map, far away from the rest of the army.\n\nWe arrive at the objective ahead of the Prussians, and I organize General Piats brigade in the treeline, whilst Brigadier General Villier stays on the hill to act as a reserve. We await the enemy from the south but they unexpectedly approach from the west. Without cavalry to scout the area, I did not know where the enemy would come from. Luckily, the AI is fairly capable on its own and general Piat mobilizes his brigade to turn and face the enemy.  My artillery begins to fire and a brigade of Prussian Landwhere approach me. In the distance, I can see a large force of cavalry and infantry with artillery support mobilizing. I estimate that the enemy is in Corps strength, so I dispatch a courier to the Marshal, requesting support and prepare to hold my defensive position. If I can delay the enemy here, a full Corps of enemy troops will be away from the main battlefield. I do not know where the rest of my Corps is, or how far away the rest of the army is but they are out of my sight so this is a dangerous situation for me. However the terrain gives me an advantage, and if the rest of my Corps arrives in time, the tide could turn easily enough. The enemy advance slowly, and we manage to maintain the upper hand for the first part of the battle, we both send out skirmishers splitting them from our regiments and a slow grueling infantry duel begins. After about 30 minutes of fighting though, my men are exhausted. General Piats brigade has barely held, and then General Villiers begins an ill fated attack against the Prussian right flank. His men are mowed down and massacred, until only a single regiment remains. His troops pull back to Piats position and my artillery also repositions itself. Finally, a messenger from Marshal Reille arrives, I am to hold my position at all costs, support is on its way. Angry at General Villiers for beginning his attack without me telling him too (The AI officers under you will do things like this, my favourite part of the game actually), I take direct command of his few remaining troops and continue to skirmish with the enemy, buying time as their cavalry closes in, routing half of Piats remaining men and I am now utterly screwed.\n\nThen most of the Prussian force breaks away, turning to face a new threat in the distance. The rest of the II Corps is marching towards me, from the rear of the enemy force. I withdraw my men back to the crest of the hill, using the distraction to rally them and rest. As the battle begins in earnest again I march my troops into the now rear of the enemy, wiping out the small landwhere brigade under general Von Frunk (Maybe wrong name, I don't remember) and eventually breaking into the enemies center. Another long battle ensues, and one hour later it is over.\n\nMy men had held our position, and reinforcements had arrived. We had beaten back the enemy in the west, and I recieved new orders from the Marshal. We would march south and hit the allied Army in the east. Despite the poor condition of my men, barely a thousand left out of four thousand strong, I followed the rest of the Kollum acting as a rear guard. We arrived at the central battlefield, a river standing between us and the flank of the enemy, Then I saved my game and took a break. This game is amazing, but ♥♥♥♥ is it exhausting. This was not a proper campaign mission either, simply a "Sandbox" battle.\n\nHopefully this small thing will give you guys an idea on the scale of the game, the ingenuity of its AI, and sheer grand tactical options (I say grand because most of the time you are operating at the grand tactics level).

Although this game doesn't have the richness in graphics i believe this game feels more realistic on the battlefield. This game allows you to have tens of thousands of men on the battlefield.  It is a game you could easily spend a few hours just deploying your troops. The maps are a lot bigger than total war maps.  The great part of this game is that you can be in control of anything from a brigade to  a divison upto a full scale army. This game allows you to ask for aid through mounted messangers .\n\nThe only downsides to this game in my eyes are the graphics and the navigation. Although you can alter the settings to change speed and controls.\n\nIf you are after a game with large scale and is realistic to battles fought in that era, then this game is definately for you. I really enjoy it and haven't fought a different battle yet. I have this game instaleld on my old steam account as well.","April 15","true","4.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Recommended only to hardcore fans of the era.\n\nAdded comments: The really good thing about this game is that you can play a napoleonic battle at a huge scale,which in itself is a great quality. The total war game is great but you loose the huge scale. They do need to change some of the mechanics though,especially with artillery and cavalry.Artillery is weak,which is unrealistic and cavalry is too scared to attack.While playing the scenario with the huge cavalry attack on British squares (played as British),I saw that instead of huge fights the French cuirassiers were just standing at a distance without attacking,being hammered by my ridicously weak artillery at short range.In real life the artillery would have wiped clean these huge masses of large targets.\n\nAdded comments No.2: If you have 5000 cavalry and the enemy 200 men in square formation, the cavalry won't attack.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoomboy27/recommended/369390/","zoomboy27","zoomboy27","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoomboy27/","112 products in account","Picked this game up after hearing the Scourge of War had a Napoleonic option after Scourge of War: Gettysburg and always like to take a chance on an evolving engine.\nI like both levels of the Napoleonics - both battles and the politics.\nThis hits the spot that I like for battles allowing you to dig into the OOB (Order of Battle) structures and various tactics and formations (column, line square, double-speed, etc.)\n\nGraphics: I usually play this on my laptop and even with lower specs it plays quite well.\nThe ground is solidly displayed and the units are colourfully done.\nGood graphics and has plenty of graphical options - things like draw distance, trees transparency, and objects control.\nSound is good and classical and keeps up with the battle.\n\nControls and Gameplay: Camera Control has a lot of options with options to spped up camera movement(at first I found the default too slow)  And with the OOB button, you can find units in your command structure.\nA lot of the direct unit control has been done through a Context Toolbar menu(moddable).  After you select the unit, you right-click the ground where you want to that unit to go and a menu comes up giving the formation options(that you can chain together.)  And off they go.\nThere are lots of scenarios that are not easily winnable(replayable) and for both sides as well(France/Allies).  There is a sandbox that I found impressive with many options, different levels of complexity, and starting terrains.  On top of that there is a sandbox campaign that allows you to string together scenarios.\nAnd at the higher levels of difficulty, you have limited views and have to send couriers to get your commands done(HITS HQ In The Saddle). I ain't good enough for that.\nThere are some OOB mods and many in the community use the Grog Mod that expands the Context Toolbar(often shown in the YouTube videos)\nhttp://www.norbsoftdev.net/forum/waterloo-modifications/68686-expanded-toolbar-grog\n\nLearning Curve: You need to go through the tutorials and to keep the fairly thorough manual nearby.\nYou can select any of the seven difficulty levels(Untrained, Militia, Normal, Seasoned, Veteran, Historical, and Grognard) and can tweak AI effectiveness.  You can select brigade, corps, and division levels for your scenarios.\nThere are more than a few tutorials on Youtube for different subjects.\nFor any questions, there are both the Matrix and NorbSoft Developer forums\nMatrix - http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tt.asp?forumid=1385\nNorbSoft - http://www.norbsoftdev.net/forum\nCheck out both for answers, mods, and After Action Reports\n\nOverall:  For Napoleonics, it is worth it to get into the nitty gritty of the tactical.\nThe AI offers a challenge.  The game is stronger than most tactical games for content - many scenarios are available with both sandbox and sandbox campaigns.\nMmmm ... this HITS the spot.","May 17","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It also adds in the ability to play a subordinate commander - something that I find immensely enjoyable. There's nothing like being able to handle just one part of a combat action while the entire battlefield rages on without requiring your micromanagement skills. However, for those so inclined, you can absolutely command the whole ordeal - either micromanaging everything, or once again role-playing your spot and sending orders to AI subordinates who will carry those orders out however they deem appropriate. In my opinion, it gets you as close to the experience of commanding armies in a game as what it would feel like to a real general doing the same.","May 28","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(sorry but English is not my main langage).\nFirst of all, this game has A VERY steep learning curve. I went through the short tutorial as well as the player manual and still, I had some frustrations on my first battles.\nThe graphic could be better but are nonetheless accurate.\nAll the army uniforms, regimental flags and commanders are there and they are very accurate.\nI went through a couple of custom games as well as 2 missions from the Waterloo Campaign both at normal mode.\nThe AI act very strangely sometimes but is very good.\nOverall, it is an excellent wargame.\nWhile Napoleon Total war is very good and fun, the battles in Scourge of War: Waterloo are far more realistics.

Yes and no, The game is worth getting just not at the $50 mark.\n\n\n\nI would avoid in till the price drops, there are a few issues that turned me off from the game:\n\n- Graphics are really poor which is not exactly a deal breaker however even with poor graphics the fps is an issue even with a high end desktop.\n- THE cammera in game is SUPER slow and really sluggish.\n- No mini map in a rts.... is not ok. especially when the game has such a masive battlefield.\n- User interface extrememly outdate.\n\nI suggest if your looking for a game with HUGE battles that acutally runs really well I would suggest ulitmate gettysburg over this game.","February 23","true","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But price is always a personal thing.\n\nTo the game:\nGraphics are bad, no kidding, they are bad - really bad - as are the animations...\nSound follows the graphics... not synchronized, just random sound.\n\nHaving said that, the gameplay itself is really really good. You want to micro manage all - this game has it. You want to macro manage the war and let the AI do all the micro management - this game has it. I have only played for about an hour. Reason was the price tag and I wanted to refund. I am going to consider buying it at a later time. I loved all the litte details (Riders running off to deliver and receive orders or support requests. Requesting reenforcements at a certain flank might be granted by your higher generals and suddenly there is a battalion helping out, all the different uniforms and flags,...).\n\nLearning and mastering this game is challenging. But if you do, it will be extremly rewarding and you will feel as if you actually deserved that victory (or loss).\n\nDo not expect a good looking game for some fast action. You need to bring time and even more time. I would say, if you love Hearts of Iron and all the other games of that kind, you should have a feeling if that game is for you.
