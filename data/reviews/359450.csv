The price tag is fairly reasonable for the content.","July 18, 2015","true","10.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

You have to find the spaceship that fits your play style and equip it with your favorite tool of destruction. There are more than 160 combinations to master!\nI have really appreciated the balancing in all the possible combination of ship-weapon in each location.\nThe artificial intelligence is also very good, both for novices and experts, 4 difficulty levels.\nI totally recommend this title for your brawling night with friends and beers.","July 20, 2015","true","6.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The graphics are very bright, colorful and nice to see, along with the large amount of weapons and spaceships to play and make tournaments with friends.\nNot a single player game, since there is not a proper mode for solo apart from mode "Challenges", which is in effect a tutorial that guides you to learn all the tactics of the game, even if in the Arena mode to fill the game with bot (with different difficulty from noob to unfair levels)\n\nIt is practically mandatory to use a gamepad.\nReally fun to play nevertheless","July 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Fast paced matches, funny game dynamics, many and many ships/weapons/arenas to choose: perfect match to humiliate in 1001 ways your buddies!\n\nPersonally I fell in love with the combo Striker + Quantic Slinger, with which you can launch wandering asteroids and create chaos in the arena. Who need the rules? WOO-HOOOOO!!!\nI think this game isn't designed for online multiplaying, and the single-mode with the "bustard" bots is enjoyable, but not as the human one.\n\nA friend's advise? Take your combination or a random one, and play it BETTING with your friends!\nAnd don't forget to try all the voice packs! :D","July 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game itself good and enjoyable, with lots of combinations and maps to play. When played with friends this game become hilarious especially if you do what everyone wants to do: throwing meteors. Also the dub is fantastic, the new Magicka i would say.","July 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Only my TF2 stats is enough to demonstrate it :).\nHowever, nothing really beats getting friends together, sitting down in the living room and playing games with your favourite people.\nWhen I look back and think about my favourite gaming moments, almost all of them involve my friends in the same house or penny arcade. I can recall countless times spent to racing to the finish line in Crash Team Racing or to complete Metal Slug.  It turns out that the moments I cherish most are the ones I spent with good friends.\nSo what are you waiting for? Call up your friends and get them over to your place now for a spot of local multiplayer, and maybe even some drinks\nMost important!\nIf you’re tired of hearing what your mum’s been up you need to:\n1: Buy the game.\n2: Make your friends buy the game.\n","September 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The games don't last very long, theres no campaign, story, or online multiplayer, so what you are left with is an amusing game to play with bots or with a friend for a very short while. (kind of hard to get 4 people together locally on PC)\n- I feel like there's too much unneccessary clutter on the maps (mostly floating asteroids) that you are meant to avoid, but to me they just seem annoying and get in the way.\n- Some of the "special" weapons seem overpowered compared to others.\n- Really just lacking content overall in comparison to other games\n\nI'd say it's a good "party" minigame, meaning that it's very short-lived but might bring some good social fun if you have 3 other people in a room, and have the means to connect them all to your PC...\n\nOtherwise, I simply can not suggest this game without adding online multiplayer, and perhaps even a progression system of some sort.","January 17","false","24.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamingsfun/recommended/359450/","gamingsfun","gamingsfun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamingsfun/","776 products in account","I want to give this one a neutral rating. Everything is here for a great 4 player vs game. Bots, varied ships and weapons, fast menu.\n\nThe game feels like some things were rushed. There are about 9 maps, each feels the same and most have background objects that seem like foreground obstacles to new players. You can't play on a map without obstacles, can't make your own maps, can't download new maps and can't adjust the variables on the map (besides choosing small, medium, or large map size).\n\nThere is a singleplayer training mode that feels more fleshed out than the multiplayer mode. I found myself wishing for a singleplayer challenges mode that is along the lines of Worms Armageddon with the interesting tricks you need to pulloff using what they equip you with.\n\nOnline multiplayer would really benefit this title. It's hard to get 3 other players who will play enough rounds to start getting into the depth the game could have to offer, if they could only keep you playing long enough. Bots are okay but even on hard they seem to move erratically.\n\nIf you've got 3 local buddies that are into this type of game (and would be willing to invest a few hours to become slightly seasoned) then this is great at around $2.50. It's not good if you have casual gamer buddies or would play mainly against the bots.","May 13","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
