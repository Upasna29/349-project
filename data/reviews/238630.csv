Just to name Dr. Karate and the Beekeper, two of the starting characters. But as funny as they are, there is not much more to them: Gameplay-wise, there is not that much difference after a while: Almost every character learns a projectile and a dash attack, can autoheal and lift enemies. The main difference is their starting statistics, how soon they learn which skill and if it is better to spam the one special attack or the other.\n\nIt is similar with the stages: Their are fights in the subway, on a nude beach, on top of a truck, but again, besides scenery, it is all rather similar.\nThe same with the opponents: You fight thugs, guys in suits, nurses, zombies and many more quirky or absurd opponents, but with a very few exceptions, they behave all the same - except later, when they start to have guns.\nAnd again, so do the bosses: Most do the same.\nThey are further grotesquely large in comparison to the other characters, and while that is funny at the beginning, if you fight similar bosses for the uptenth time, the joke gets old.\n\nLater bosses can kill you with two hits. So basically, if you do not stick with one of the characters, which were unlocked at the beginning, you need to grind some time before you stand a chance.\nThat goes for the game in general, it gets very unforgiving pretty soon. You can always grind, but the combination of artificially heightened difficulty and repetetion was more frustrating than encouraging in my opionion.\n\nI know I am repeating myself, but I find no other description for the story: It starts out kind of promising, like a parody of the classic "save damsel in distress"-trope, then it more or less disappears while you have pointless and uninspired conversations with the bosses, just to end in a Twist with a cliffhanger.\n\nTo be fair, the game is cheap, so you will get your money's worth.\nI can imagine, having up to three friends over, and playing the game with its funny characters for a short while (preferebly while drinking) you can have great fun - as long as you stop before it gets repetitive or frustrating.\nStill, it feels largely like a chance, which remained unused. Like they used all their great ideas, than just stretched the game by repeating everything 5 times with increasing difficulty. Here's to hoping for a sequel which will be finished.\n6/10.","July 10, 2014","true","15.0"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","43","46","0","0"

We love Double Dragon, River City Ransom, Golden Axe, TMNT, Streets of Rage etc., so this seemed like a sure bet at the time.\n\nAfter a while we decide we like it, and want to show our friends. But we can't include our friends because that would mean grinding up their characters to our level so we could play (levels are attached to the 4 players, not to the characters themselves). So now we have to leave our friends out and just play by ourselves, but its no big deal. Now combat is starting to get stale and nothing is really jumping out at us. Then we decide we want to be daring and maybe try out one of the many new characters we unlocked, but oh bummer, they start at level 0 and would take hours to grind. Now we are trapped, just the two of us, playing a game where we aren't really free to use the characters we unlock with out going through the monotony of grinding. We went through level after level, unlocking all kinds of cards (achievments), characters, and secret items/areas, but really all we wanted to do was have fun. Packing in all this content doesn't really matter unless the game offers some kind of entertainment.\n\nI could go on about all this, but the bottom line is this: I was grinding so much I was surprised I didn't just unlock the next level in Tony Hawk.\n\nBy the time we reached the halfway point of the game, we were definitely not enjoying ourselves. Luckily, we ran into a bunch of difficulty spikes that really won us over.After simmering in our losses on the final level for what felt like hours, we finally beat it. The final joke did make us laugh, but I think the humor really came from how fitting it was that we made a mistake both in real life and in the game just by playing it.\n\nThe way this game artificially lengthens itself would make JRPGs blush. I actually feel unclean for putting in 20 hours to get %100, but that's my own fault. This isn't a terrible game, I enjoyed half of it, but I think it just spread itself too thin.","July 18, 2014","false","19.0"," 66 of 94 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","66","94","9","2"

I could totally see it being much more fun and replayable as a co-op game, but - alas! - the co-op is only local, which, in my opinion, is a big missed opportunity.","October 18, 2015","true","10.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

A lot of the content is okay to enjoyable, but the structure of the game is deliberately skewed to make single player unreasonably difficult, and they tied the "RPG-lite" system to individual character/controller-slot combinations (as opposed to character or player profiles), so multiplayer is a tedious leveling affair for all players, all the time.  You might cruise along fondly for a few levels, but the seams quickly fall apart as you reach the point where you have to have multiple players actually leveled up to proceed.  I'd be willing to play to the end, but none of my friends are tolerant enough to get there, and honestly, I don't blame them.\n\nIt's a shame, because the framework is there for a great beat-em-up game, but they didn't feel to finish the product by correcting poor design decisions and fleshing out the feature set.\n\nMy recommendation, if you really want a good beat 'em up, play Castle Crashers instead.  It's got everything present here and a lot more.  If you've already done that and want variety, don't bother here.  You're going to be overwhelmed with the knowledge that it's not nearly as good.","February 10, 2014","false","7.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

But if you approach it like any other game, it's quite solid and offers a respectable level of challenge.

I mean, come on. It’s a throwback to classic 80s and 90s brawlers with modern concepts like leveling up a la Castle Crashers or Guardian Heroes. And yet, it falls short. How so? Well sure, there are a ton of characters to unlock as you trudge through the streets, beating up all kinds of baddies…but most of them are pretty lame.  In fact, most of the starting characters are kinda crappy, too.\n\nOnce you get the ex-cop, you really don’t need any other characters. Besides that, the enemies aren’t that fun to beat up and take too long to beat up. Nevermind that it’s pretty easy because all you do is mash the attack button while moving…yes, while moving. You don’t stop to attack like in other brawlers.  The bosses are ridiculously overpowered and not fun to fight at all, the music is meh at best, and while there is an interesting amount of level variety, it never really goes anywhere. If you’re looking for another brawler and you’ve tried all the rest, I guess you could get this one since it’s cheap, but it’s really not that impressive.","March 16, 2014","false","3.0"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

As the title indicates, this game takes an exaggerated spin on classic side scroller fight genre.  It is best played with a group of friends.  One major flaw is the lack of online multiplayer.  Though I prefer computer master race keyboards, I found that this game plays much better with a controller.  Comparing again with River City Ransom, I would say that this was a fun spin.  Especially using smart cars as melee weapons. The gameplay and feel are not completely as polished but there is more challenge.  The game is not terribly long, but there are a lot of secrets to discover.  If you're not a fan of River City Ransom, I think it would be hard to appreciate this games absurdity.","December 28, 2013","true","12.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/238630/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Fist Puncher is a 2D beat 'em up game, highly inspired by the old 8/16bit era type of games like Streets of Rage and River City Ransom.\nAnd it certainly wears those influences on its sleeves.\n\nThis game features very crude humor, which was amusing, for the most part, although it's probably not reason enough for you to play this game over any other. Still, it fit the theme well enough.\n\nI have only played the SP mode, so it might be a fun game to screw around in Local Coop for a short while.\n\nThe graphics are very "retro" inspired. But, in this case, it's not retro in an innovative way... at all. The game looks quite ugly, in my opinion, but it certainly puts you in a similar mindset to when you played those older beat 'em ups, so hey... Personally, not a fan, but I don't mind it too much.\nYou'll visit several different looking areas, keeping the levels somewhat fresh (although only visually).\nWhat I will say, though, is that the enemies don't really telegraph their attacks a whole lot. Every sprite movement is a bit too subtle for the player to notice when being attacked by a whole mob of them... This creates a bunch of problems, along with invincibility-frames and the mini-stuns. But I'll talk about that further ahead.\n\nI can't say much for the music, in this case. This is the type of game that I like to play while listening to my own music since immersion is not exactly the focus here, is it?\nThe sound effects were pretty standard, but they gave that cheesy feeling of impact, as it should, so it's all good, here.\n\nBefore moving on to the mechanics, I'll write about the structure of FistPuncher.\nThis game has you go through a variety of stages (usually featuring a boss fight in the end), in order to save several of the Misses of the world. Typical damsel in distress affair(or... is it?). But hey, it's supposed to be cheesy and over the top.\nYou have an overworld map with different paths, so you can tackle levels in different order, if you're having difficulty somewhere.\n\nYou also have several characters to choose from. While each has its own backstory, the dialogue doesn't change at all, from what I've seen, so it's mostly a reskin.\nWhile they feature different moves, visually, they all behave very alike, which is unfortunate. Every character has the same type of moves, only changing one special ability (which is not that special), and their starting attributes.\n\nAnd speaking of attributes, this also has a progression system, giving the game some very light RPG elements (not as unique as River City Ransom did, though). By killing enemies, you'll gain experience, and occasionally level up. By doing so, you'll earn points to spend in attributes (Strength, Speed, Defense, Special Meter and Health Pickups), and also gain Perks. These don't change the game very much. Essentially, they just give you a special ability to choose from, and multiple lives later on.\nAll in all, it felt very shallow, since it barely altered gameplay, aside from the numerical standpoint. And it had one giant flaw:\nThe fact that experience was NOT shared. So, once you leveled up a character, you'll be making all other characters weaker by comparison. Which means that if you want to try out the different characters, you'll have the replay the levels to get to the same level. Otherwise, you'll just change to a weaker character that takes way too long to kill enemies, for no reason.\nThis is really bad design, from my perspective.\nIt renders the characters completely useless, in single player. Sure, it can be used to give the game replayability, but the game already stretches itself way too thin by having an 8 hour campaign that gets very repetitive...\nIt would have been much greater if it gave a shared pool of point to apply to different characters. That way, the player could feel free to try every character at will, right after unlocking them, and without feeling much weaker.\n\nI don't understand this design choice... if you think it's no big deal to you, then it's fine. I don't.\n\n\nSo, how's combat itself?\nWell, very basic. You punch fast, kick slowly, run and jump. Then you have a couple of special abilities, which are usually limited to a Dash attack, and Spin attack, and a projectile. There are also jump kicks and things like that, but overall, the combat was very spammy.\nAnd you don't really need to try and change your strategy around. It's basically about using the Dash attack while you have stamina, knicking enemies down and jumping onto them. You can also grab enemies, but since you're always assaulted by a bunch of them at once, it proves to be useless, and you're better offer just attacking multiple enemies at once.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the majority of the game plays like that.\nAll the enemies are VERY similar, although some had guns, others dodged a bit more, some self-exploded, etc. But they barely required different approaches. And do make things worse, every difficulty option just played the same!\nInstead of creating harder battle situations, with different types of enemies, they simply increased their attributes, thus making it harder.\nAn uninteresting and uninspired way of doing difficulty, in my opinion.\n\nThen, there's the stun and hitbox problem.\nBosses are usually just bigger versions of the standard mobs (with a couple of exceptions, of course), but since they're huge, you can just attack their head, and they'll be unable to attack you, since you're above their range.\nAs I said previously, you can't tell very well when enemies are stunned or not, so, if you try to combo your attacks, you'll simply be attacked back, out of nowhere, with no chance of escape. And Bosses can very easily 2 hit you, so that's not a good option, is it?\nSo, again. Just jump around, use the Dash attack and punch him 2-3 times at most. Then run away. And repeat. And it's about 5-6 hours of this.\n\nIt feels way too generic to me. The game didn't seem to try and make gameplay interesting in any way. It took the classic beat 'em up formula, and used it straight up, with close to no addition.\nWell... that doesn't make a very good game. That game isn't awful or anything, and I enjoyed it when I started out. But it just drags, and drags... The characters could have altered that, but didn't. The progression system could have been interesting. Again, missed the target.\nSo, you're left with very little.\n\nThen, there are a few deviations from the typical level design. There's a level in which you ride an ostrich through a desert mine field. Dude, that's badass! You simply have to focus on dodging the mines on the ground. But then again, you die in 2 hits...\nI personally didn't have a problem with this level in particular, but some people did.\nThen, there's a level in which you have to attack the thugs, but avoid hitting the lawyers, or they'll sue you. And one punch equals to a failed level, and you'll have to restart. The problem is that the AI of the lawyers is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Seriously. There are more lawyers than enemies on the screen, in a small space, and they jump in front of you out of nowhere. I spent waaay too long in this level. It made no sense, the way it was implemented. And there were a lot of frustrating levels like that.\nWhile the idea of breaking up the pacing is very nice, the levels didn't seem to be very well tested, and ended up being a frustrating mess, for the most part.\nThere are levels about deactivating bombs, trying to send ninjas off of a truck's roof, etc.\n\nSome were funny, and I liked the ideas! But the execution was poor.\n\n\nSo yeah. If you really like any kind of beat 'em up, then give this one a go. It's not awful. But if your standards are a bit higher, look another way. It does everything "by the book", with little to no innovation, and even the basic mechanics are dubious, with dodgy hitboxes and stun-frames. It also stretched itself thin.","September 4, 2014","false","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Premise was good, I didn't mind that but as I stated, games like this shouldn't be limited to local co-op alone, but just have full on Online co-op as well.
