There was not enough depth in the whole story and felt confusing at times. With 6 possible outcomes, one might thing that this will have a good replay value but after the second play through its pretty obvious how to trigger each ending and  manged to do all 6 endings in a few a hours with the help of the skip buttton. Also dont worry too much about the nude aspect even with the patch its pretty tame. being a kickstarter backer i paid more than i should have for this game £30 to be excact and was it worth that? not in a million years. and backers didnt even get the OST. Is it worth its now price of £9.99. again nope. wait for sales on this one.","April 15","false","15.8"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","0"

Told to take on 2 clubs so you teacher can write you a better reference as it will prove your "social skills". Upon picking your 2 clubs out of 3 you will meet a person of interest and have a story line added of interest, which run alongside the main trunk of story. Choose your responses and reactions to people you meet to carve your future. Will you be lucky in life? at your studies? at love? or can you master it all\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MvYLi0aB9oQ","April 13","true","6.0"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

I thought we're going to be like clubbing and ♥♥♥♥ but instead we are actually joining some School clubs.. wow\nMusic sucks, sorry to say this but I'd rather play ''Emotiona Titanic Flute'' on the background than listen to this poop.\nI mean if someone is SAD or DRAMATIC then can we have sad/dramatic music playing.. not happy or casual music -.-\nDuring the winter we still swim outside? Wear light clothes? I mean I have nothing against some cleavage but during the winter when it's snowing people wear more clothes.. just saying\nJanets story though.. is sad.\nGot the sixth ending at first: No love no life\nKylies story is AWESOME\nMelissa was in the end actually a good person.\nCONCLUSION: I was at the start a little dissapointed but later I was happy that I purchased this game. It was definetly worth it!","May 27","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The art work is similar in style to Beach Bounce, which is great in my book. Each Girl has their own unquie personalities and the routes felt different enough to play through each one. My only real wish is that the game was longer to flesh out the story and characters far more. All in all however it was well worth picking up.\n\n6.5/10","April 21","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
