This mission is different, however. See, on the Mili Atoll there's a supply port controlled by the Japanese and it's too close to home for comfort. Our admiral has requested that we wrest control in what has become a constant game of island hopping. Success means we'll have some much needed R&R and enough cash to scrape together another ship or two to join our fleet... failure means certain death. With no enemy patrols in sight we launch a night attack. My two destroyers and one submarine escort a dozen or so landing craft full of nervous, young men dead set on taking that beach head at any cost. As we approach an enemy destroyer and cruiser lurches out of port to meet us head on.\n\nThe thunder of war cracks around us and screams fill a previously quiet, still night. Landing crafts explode in plumes of water around us as the cruiser fires the first shots. Their destroyer turns port side and I spot the telltale wake of a torpedo headed my way. My lead destroyer comes into range and opens naval artillery, striking the antagonist destroyer's munitions, causing it to rupture and sink instantly. Alas, I turn too late to avoid the torpedoes and my lead is crippled, floundering in the open. The cruiser and my last destroyer battle it out for minutes, battering one another to near mutual destruction. Finally my submarine enters the fray just in time to strike a killing blow. The port is ours, at a heavy, noobish cost.\n\n“Victory at Sea” is a naval RTS set in WWII. Assuming you start off in the campaign you'll name your captain and choose his appearance. Then there's a brief, informative series of video tutorials and levels and you're off to do what you'd like. Take ports and slow the spread of the enemy's sphere of influence, stalk supply convoys, or take out the big dreadnoughts that menacingly cruise the seas. You'll have three locations to play in: the Mediterranean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic. You can fight as either the UK or the USA.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough. You direct your fleet towards, let's say, an enemy fleet on the main world map (which cycles from night to day). You can increases and decrease your ship's speed and the general speed of the game to get to the location as fast as you'd like. Once you hit your target you'll see a series of minuses or pluses that indicates their strength to yours. Choose to engage and you'll decide which ships you want to battle with and enter the tactical map. There you'll see your ships and the enemy fleet. You can switch between the tactical overhead map and a ship level map. You'll be able to manually control your ships or let them go on autopilot (I recommend micromanaging. You can pause the combat and switch quickly enough between your ships to give them orders, aim your shots, maneuver, etc.). You'll see your health displayed, the statuses of equipment and weapons, crew, and captain. When you see an enemy target you'll see a series of minuses or pluses that indicates their strength to yours.\n\nEach ship type has different combat options. Subs for instance can submerge and fire torpedoes relatively quickly from aft or bow, but they move slowly. Destroyers move faster but can only fire torpedoes off port or starboard side with a slower reload time (though their main guns have great range and reload quickly). Aircraft carriers launch planes to harass enemies and move at a snail's pace. And battleships... battleships are just really cool, floating fortresses of doom.There are a lot of ships to choose from, and choosing the right ship loadout for combat scenarios can really make a difference. As you kill, capture and sail you'll accrue experience. That experience increases your captain's level, unlocks ships, and earns you war bonds to spend on new ships... or to salvage ones you've lost.\n\nSo that's the campaign for you, but there's two other modes. Historical mode lets you fight out actual naval battles, allowing you to maintain the current timeline or alter history and create ROBO-HITLER YOU JERK. There's also a point battle mode that allots you a set number of points to spend on vessels for two combatants; choose a side and fight it out.\n\n“Victory at Sea” is very fun. Choosing your battles, taking out enemy ports, watching the map turn in your favor as flags are hoisted over friendly ports, and unlocking cooler, more powerful vessels to wage war is all very rewarding. But there are some flaws to note. Graphically it isn't going to raise any eyebrows – and I know, graphics really aren't all that important when you're playing an RTS. But ships will take direct hits and you'll see a little explosion, some smoke, and nothing else. There doesn't appear to be any gradual damage. Sometimes a little fire will break out but that's about it. And when a ship sinks it just sort of floats down. Don't expect any cool Titanic-esque sinking in “Victory at Sea.” There isn't any multiplayer currently (though the devs seem interested in possibly implementing it). At the moment there are only six historical battles (devs say they intend to add more). And the 25 dollar price tag is a bit steep, especially with similar titles like “Battlestations: Pacific” going for nine.\n\nSo does “Victory at Sea” sink or swim? I say it swims. Maybe not a strong enough swimmer to cross the English Channel, but a swimmer nonetheless. It isn't breaking the mold and it isn't flashy but it's fun to play – and that's what counts. If you have any doubts just wait and see what support the devs give it. Otherwise dive right in. And take out that frickin' OP Bismark.","August 8, 2014","true","3.1"," 138 of 171 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","138","171","5","6"

Other than engaging the heaviest enemy ports you won't ever stumble across convoys or fleets that will do any more than sink a few of your destroyers at best.\n\nThe developers need to make it far harder - have much bigger and stronger enemy fleets roaming and hunting you down. The game is far too easy. When you've built a force of 5 battleships, 5 cruisers, 2 carriers, 4 destroyers or whatever, you want to come up against enemies of similar strength. None exist.\n\nGameplay is good and the game has a lot of potential but this problem is fundamental. Hopefully will be resolved.","December 30, 2014","false","66.2"," 109 of 137 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","109","137","9","6"

I love naval games, cutting my teeth on the Harpoon series, this unfortunately, offers the depth of a paddling pool.  It is however quite fun, striking me as better suited for a mobile game.\nI have only played campaign mode, you start by picking either the US or GB then you are given a basic destroyer.  After this you simply go out and sink enemy ships...like the French and Italians...wasn't actually aware that the UK fought against the French navy, didn't they sink them at Mers-el-Kébir?\n\nFirst problem, no ability to play as the German Navy or the French, Italian, Japanese or Russian navy in campaign mode.\n\nSinking ships involves zooming the map out and looking for small forces to take on, it's so simple, too simple no radar, no visual ranges, no sonar...hydrophones, it's naval warfare, god mode.\n\nBattles are fought at a slightly more zoomed view, it's actually quite fun, but so so shallow, all you do is right click on the target, that's it!\nThere is no damage control, no distance calculations, just turn towards the enemy and flank speed, once in range (actually even slightly out-of-range) right click and keep clicking, sort of like Diablo with ships.\n\nYou keep going until you are destroyed (very unlikely), you destroy the enemy (very very likely) or they surrender (occasionally happens).\nAfterwards, you get "warbonds" with which to buy ships, simply sail into port and buy a ship.  The game play doesn't change at all, you just buy more or better ships.\n\nAfter saving enough 'money', you get to buy a battleship, basically cheat mode, they cannot be hurt, other than buy other battleships, your guns are to accurate, i took on 6 destroyers and 2 heavy cruisers with my Battleship, all were wiped out before they even managed a single shot on target.  Aircraft carriers somehow manage to be more useless than any other ship in the game, the planes are easily destroyed (automatically) and are incapable of offering even destroyer levels of damage.\n\nIt's pretty buggy, i can forgive that, Portsmouth was taken by the Germans and i was tasked with taking out the fleet (British Fleet) taking it back, despite the fact i was playing as the British, after it was taken back it was unusable to me.\n\nIt is a fun game, but it's to shallow.  It is over priced for what's offered, so i would have to rate it as a 'no'","August 10, 2014","false","13.5"," 92 of 115 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","92","115","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YOL0SWAG/recommended/298480/","YOL0SWAG","Zone FNF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YOL0SWAG/","293 products in account","Think of the gameplay as like a Mount and Blade game but set in WWII and with ships instead of soliders. There's two sides to the gameplay, in campaign you manage your fleet, you build ships, attack ports, raid convoys, and such on the campaign map all in real time. Once two fleets clash you then pick out the ships you want to fight with and ones you want to keep in reserve and duke it out as an RTS.\n\nIn the tactical battles, you can issue orders with the tactical view, and command a ship personally aiming weapons and steering it about. The orders themselves are pretty simple, you can order a ship to move, attack, defend, or retreat. The main thing about your ships is the varitiy and the modling of the different weapons on board. The game features, destroyers, various crusiers, battleships, carriers, and submarines, in along with some minor patrol and convoy ships. All of these ships have different subsystems in place modling the damage to the weapons and other departments of the ship. In the images above, the green central buttons are the weapons and the little icons below them are all the different subsystems that can be hit.\n\nI see Victory At Sea being a very ambitous game. I haven't had the chance to push through too much of the campaign so I'll just say that it looks highly promising. The game delivers not only one but three campaigns, one pacific, one atlantic, and a mediterranean one aswell. The game features seven different nations, though a couple such as free and vichy france aren't too fleshed out. I like the faster pacing to Victory At Sea though I can see it being a tad simplistic and too fast for someone looking for more of a simulator experience.

That being said, sadly this game falls short of my expectations. I had read other reviews that state this game gets too easy quickly. Typically I do not care much about the challenge of a game, but rather the experience. Unfortunately the challenge is what makes this game. There is not much for story here and there is no "base building" feature. The other reviews I had read were correct; once you obtain a decent fleet there is no match for you. Without the challenge I found myself to be bored rather quickly. Battles are easily won without your manual intervention, and although the tactical map allows for some micromanagement, you can just click start and fast forward to an easy win.

This one still earns my praise for trying, if in a very sloppy manner.\n\nPros:\n- Combat: Loving how you have to aim & guess where your shots shall fall. It's satisfying when you damage & sink vessels.\n- Combat - Extra: The ability to create a smoke screen with the ship's funnels, to create convoys, to be all tactical with submarines, and etc. Even the whole ability by using landing crafts to capture ports.\n- AI & Ship command: I love the ability to set the AI on auto-pilot or to take command of specific ones. You can set waypoints & even personally command any vessel on command. It's sweet <3\n- Hardpoints: What I absolutely love about VAS is the whole hardpoint feature with you able to cripple vessels in specific manners. The ability to aim for their turrets, to slay sailors, and etc.\n- World map: is free-roamy, meaning you can travel anywhere.\n- Factions: UK, Kriegsmarine, Italy, Japan & USA. Nice variety, yet needs far more in campaign. I love how New Zealand & Canada found their way into the UK, yet wishing they were their own mini-faction regradless of their size & value in other people's eyes.\n- Repairs: Having to repair back at docks and to resupplyl.\n- Ports: Having to capture them like flags to then purchase new vessels. Even having to use troop transports to take over enemy types while defending your own transports; Sinking the assaulting.\n- Reinforcements: Nice concept here that needs to be fleshed out more in combat. Nearby fleets join in to attack or defend you. Minus convoys.\n- Modding: I respect the developers for trying to make this game modable with various ways to insert different ship types, stats & faction stuff.\n\n=\n\nCons:\n- Repetition: Quickly becomes "same" formula.\n- AI needs work : AI at times is neat, yet at other times it's highly horrible. It's eager to team-kill just to sink the other enemy. It does silly things when you're not at the helm.\n- Go big, or go home: Becomes harder to bring in smaller vessels that you have to think like a younger individual to simply bring in purely battleships & aircraft carriers to win late-game. Granted, it may be more rewarding at higher levels when other features kicks in.\n- Ports: They're all the same with them needing to be personalized when you go to dock into them. The assault/defend battle maps needs actual landmass in variety & actual detail. More ports, more variety.\n- Map types: I'm aware this is naval with water, yet there's still a way to add in ice maps, port haps, harbour maps, and various other sorts. More variety needed.\n- Missing various ship types: Going through the forums I noticed ships were still missing from the game. I even notice missing Canadian vessels, such as the Minatour & the three Prince Robert/Henry/ David vessels. Germany, UK, & Japan all missing their fair-share also. Granted, this all takes loads of work to put into it.\n- Modding: Still missing mod support on the side of a map-maker, world maker, Model importing & etc. This game could be so much better with it.\n- Camera: Absolutely introverted. It wants to push you away by forcing you into the tactical map itself with grids. It doesn't want you anywhere near the units, or even to look-up to see far. It wants you to be "cross-eyed" with how awkward it is. This hurts when viewing smaller units & when trying to aim.\n- Hardpoint Lock: No way you can swap the hardpoints to make the vessels personalized to you & your situation. You're stuck with the default, unless you mod it.\n\n=\n\nThis game has so much potential, yet it's dragging its feet too heavily that it's sitting still in open waters. It can easily be highly engaging & rewarding, yet the developers are too focused on too many things to make this game overly epic. I genuinely enjoy it for the features it has added, how much fun one can get out of it, and all the stuff it's missing. RIght now I still view it as 70-80% complete product needing to add Russia, missing units, other countries, and even the promised multiplayer.\n\nI do recommend this to people, but only on the part that I want other game developers to stop being fearful of producing open-world naval games. Make more VAS, more Silent Hunter, and other sorts of games. Cash in on KanColle & Arpeggio of Blue Steel anime hype. People may say they're sick of war-games, yet they're seeking specific ones that actually matter by hitting actual sweet spots. How I would love to take command of the Canadian & Dutch navy, no matter how you may view their worth in the war. Tribute is tribute; Learning about history is what peaked my interest with this game. I learned some neat stuff from KanColle web game & this game, thus my slight bias nudging this game rating above "average"\n\nI rate this 70-80% of 100% (or 7 to 8 of 10) for it's sluggish & incomplete, yet well researched product. I also praise this game because it's not only about USA, but about the whole world.

The Campaign, Historical Battles, and Custom.\n\nIn Campaign you pick a theatre of war, a nation, your own Captain and then you disembark to change the course of the war. You start off with but a single destroyer, but as you complete missions, harass enemy convoys and sink subs, you slowly gain experience points.\nThese are then used to unlock different classes of ships, and during missions you earn vital war bonds. These are then used to acquire more vessels and expand you fleet.\nThe game has a brilliant selection ranging from destroyers, cruisers, patrol boats, carriers, battleships, subs, and even convoy ships.\n\nThe campaign is fairly simple, and so are the missions, but things slowly become more difficult and your tactics become extremely important.\nYou have the ability to simply control your flagship and let the AI handle the rest of your fleet, but opening up tactical mode brings up a grid based top down view. Something rather essential for large fleet encounters. Issue orders, set waypoints, determine fire arcs. You do all this from there, while the game is paused.\nPressing spacebar resumes gameplay, but you can press it again to pause and issue orders, choose which ships are AI controlled or which you manually want to manoeuvre.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, it’s rare to get a naval strategy game and the developers are rather ambitious. Although so far I’ve been greatly impressed.\n\nMoving towards Historical battles, it simply is what the name suggests. Although on a smaller scale sadly. Whether this is due to engine limitations or simply because the content has not been fully implemented at the time of covering the game; it wasn’t actually too much of an issue.\nThere’s something epic about taking part in sinking the Bismarck.\n\nThe visuals aren’t stellar, although the ship models are well done and have good detail. The only time you’ll say otherwise is if you happen to fully zoom in right against the side of the ship. Although if you’ll have the time to bother with that during full combat is up to you.\nThe fact that the majority of the game world is covered in water helps, as it cuts down on lots of extra rendering, meaning it should be easier for older systems to run.\n\nThe sound effects, now those are Loud, and powerful. Having the Hood and Bismarck go at it with headphones on might be a mistake as those guns and explosions can be deafening. It certainly sounds amazing!\n\nSadly I’m a terrible captain, easily failing at the campaign for forgetting that the more plusses/stars on an enemy fleet the more dangerous they are. I’ve often lost my ships against a measly german patrol for not paying attention, and forgetting you can pause the game with spacebar to issue commands. You can’t just play this like a normal RTS, you have to constantly pay attention.\n\nShip modules can be damaged, and although some can get repaired by you crew, severe damage means you need to return to a port for proper repairs and outfitting. A nice addition to the game, which keeps you on your toes.\n\nI’ve not done well in the campaign, but I really enjoy Victory at Sea. It’s certainly a game I’ll go back to again, and again.

In terms of represented navies the biggest ones are all there, Kriegsmarine(Germany), USN(US), RN(UK), IJN(Japan) RM(Italy) and both Free and Vichy French navies.\n\nI agree with the previously stated that it is similar to Mount and Blade series. With an overall world map and moving from fight to fight. building a naval squadron, losing said naval squadron and doing things like repair and support other captains. Though however simplified in the sense you do not have to repair the ships yourself or replenish any aircrew or aircraft.\n\nFrom personal experience, the tactical fight takes place in a setting similar to Navyfield and the naval action of Patrician IV.\nSporting a tactical map for bigger decisions and the ability to control a single or all ships, it's weaponry and targeting.\nIn terms of combat it's fairly straight forward, and comes supplied with some, dubious quality videos to show you how its done. It gets you the basics.\nOther than that, a typical destroyer battle plays out like heading straight for the enemy, cross the T and then launch a salvo of torpedoes and hope to higher powers they won't miss.\n\nSo for a diehard naval combatant, this game is really easy until you come up against something way outside of your class of ship (destroyers vs. Heavy cruisers for instance) Or the game casually puts your carrier right next to the enemy battleship. Close enough for crew to actually board. (And how it got that close to begin with is one massive miracle)  Then watch your carrier be blasted to bits. Goodbye ridiculous amount of saving money! A way to pre-deploy would be nice (And if the function is there, I have missed it and blame only myself).\n\n25.08 edit: Most of the glaring errors previously mentioned were fixed.\n\nReason I recommend this game, is because it is isn't in itself Bad. Or otherwise so buggy it ends up unplayable. It can become a gem with quite a bit of polish to it. It is an interesting concept, and naval action has been sorely missed for my part.\n\nI would personally argue its price does not justify what is contained within at the time of this review.

Having been initially quite sceptical about the realism of ship class balance, I soon realized that in fact this game is one of the very select few that hit the nail on the head. If you are a WWII history buff, you'll be pleased to intuitively recognize the major traits, advantages and shortcomings of historical navy ship classes and to be able to reason about them in-game using your prior knowledge of the subject.\n\nNow, on top of the tactical engagements the game features a "strategic" layer where you get to control your (single) fleet and upgrade it not dissimilarly from how you would in an age of sail pirate simulation game. This strategic layer is where things get a bit sketchy, unrealistic and essentially deteriorate into an open world RPG. However, it does set the stage for tactical naval engagements and that's where the game shines, so I suppose it's not the worst way to segway the player into individual combat scenarios.\n\nOverall I can recommend to pick up the game, especially if you see it on discount or if you're into the niche which it so neatly fills.","November 28, 2014","true","29.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Ive never found the "defend area" button useful at all either, it would be better to have a destroyer defending a cruiser as to offer anti sub support as the cruiser dont carry DCs.\n\nThe game uses a currency called warbonds which you get for sinking enemy shipping, unfortunately its all too easy to earn, ive been playing for about a couple of hours but within 30mins of gameplay i was already up to 30million enabling me to buy the light cruisers, which rip apart the enemy destroyers with ease IF you can get them into range before your destroyers do the job for you.\nI would recommend this game to others but if it wants to take itself sersiously there is a heck of a lot of polishing and buffing needing to be done before the game has any depth to it. its a very simple game and some will get bored to tears within 10mins, worth £17? not at the moment as it stands.","October 7, 2014","true","34.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

With three Campaigns that are sandbox (think "Mount & Blade" - you'll get it when you see it) spiced up with hit & run missions, escort duty and secret missions (sometimes supporting landing craft in invasions), yet also including Historical and Custom Scenarios (skirmish).\nThe three Campaigns are the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Pacific it is up to you how to outfit your flotilla - destroyers, a wolfpack of subs or a mixed taskforce.\nGraphics are superb for the depth and content of the title, and while you cannot control your subsystems or damage your enemy's, you do have to watch firing arcs, lead with torpedoes, dodge incoming shells and torpedoes and decide when to send your aircraft into battle if equipped with carriers. There is nothing like pulling off a daring hit with 3 Level 2 destroyers against 4 Level 4 German or Vichy French opponents, with your final opponent sometimes choosing to surrender (no reload of a savegame plays the same either).\nI have spent several hours since launch today exploring the myriad of of tactics to win a campaign, from attacking patrols, defending convoys or choking off enemy ports (all ports have limited supplies until replenished). A world map, for your campaign, a Tactical Map and a Tactical view with camera follow or free this is the best naval title I've seen in ages and well worth the asking price.\n\nP.S.

Back when war didn't have drones and auto aim missiles!\n\nWWII!\n\nAnyways ya to get back on point it's essentially a mindless little fleet command game with lite ship management aspect thrown in for good measure. But hey at least you can actually use the Yamato in combat now instead of letting it rot at the docks [seriously JN?]\n\nGameplay\nYou have 3 different modes to choose from, campaign which is further divided into 3 different theatre of war, the historical scenario where you can try your luck at changing the course of history and custom battle which as the name suggest are where you set custom parameter for your own little playbox.\n\nAnyways historical and custom battle don't differ much from each other so lets talk campaign! Your goal in all 3 different maps is to conquer the whole enemy base and claim it as yours which is actually a really daunting task seeing as you start the ship with a destroyer escort. That's right not even a full size destroyer, a destroyer escort sheesh. Anyways ya, you roam the map looking for weak ships to destroy so you can obtain money which are used for to purchase a better ships for your fleet and bring dead ships back from the dead. On higher difficulty repair costs are not free thus expending the already delicate money balancing act at the lower difficulty.\n\nYou could also go to HQ to obtain missions which usually reward you with dismal amount of money and the objectives sometimes really does not make any sense. For example they want you to capture an enemy base that is stock full of ships and battleships while you quaver in fear with 5 tiny escorts. Madness.\n\nAlso the game operates with a fog of war system in conjuction with day and night system. Basically your ships have a view ring around them that allows you to see other ships which gets reduce during night time. But having radar a and scout ships really helps by revealing the darken part. A fact that helps against enemies without them.\n\nAbout the actual battle system, you start any battle with the position screen where you can drag your ships around to position them, when the actual battle starts you can group your ships into formation and select them at the tap of a button, useful for when you start bringing in a lot of them into battle to group specific ship types together.\n\nYou can either let the AI does its job which they do a decent job of or you can choose to micro manage everything down to the last shot, speed and so on. The pause button really does wonder to help your planning along. Or you can just choose the hybrid system where you control 1 ships and let the AI does everything else with occasional intervention from you.\n\nEach ship classes has different weapon system and range and if you chose to command your own ship its just a simple matter of clicking the number button corresponding to the weapon and right clicking where you want to fire them and that is pretty much it. But hey the enemy won't exactly sit around you know and torpedo are true to its root they can blow up an entire ship system in a lucky shot.\n\nAfter all the splashes settles and the loser has their ship sunk each of your captain will earn exp which improves their AI level and for you unlocks more ships to play with.\n\nOne thing you should change is the battle ship slider though, the default is way too slow and setting it too highest actually change the game into an arcade style game. Weird.\n\nSound\nNothing noteworthy here, you can hear the seagulls squawk, ships burr along but in battle the shots effect sounds like someone took a toy gun and rig it to shoot plastic bullets which comes with the classic 'pew pew' noise.\n\nGraphics\nThe water are gorgeous with reflections can be seen, ships models are highly detailed and explosive effects are rather muted though. Nothing to say much in this department either but the stock graphics works well enough.\n\nConclusion\nThe oceon world of Victory at Sea is empty with convoys and hostile ships roaming its water and basics missions to pad it out. But! This is exactly why its a good game! They didn't bother to fluff it out with frivilous things but kept the core gameplay in a basic package which allows you to enjoy it! But yea it does gets monotonous towards the end with you chugging with 6 battleships on tow and obliberating everything in your path. All in all a good game.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The initial release while innovative had obvious weaknesses - submarines that never submerged, ships that never went in formations etc - but now there are very few obvious glitches to complain over. Now it is not, by any measure, an accurate portrayal of naval warfare - for a start ships are bought or turn up to fight that never, ever saw mutual combat. And yet in a strange way that adds to the appeal of the game since one is never sure as one plods along with one's mixed USN/RN squadron in the Pacific if you will run into Japanese, German or even French warships.\n\nHopefully at some point the developers will offer options that rigidly define opposing forces for those who insist on veracity, but in the meantime this has become (ONLY when played at the expert level) an often nail-biting, easy to play simulation.

This is a good thing:\n\nUpdate 2: TL;DR summary: A fun, naval action game (i.e not a sim).  Many of the AI and balance issues have been tweaked and fixed by Dev.  Not a game for those looking for deep sim experience but for those looking to watch WW2 ships blow each other out of the sea this could be the game for you!\n\nVictory at Sea is a fast paced, action oriented naval combat game.  The main campaign is split into two portions, the Strategic Map, where you move around your fleet and the battle map, where you engage in battle with enemy vessels.  As others have mentioned, this is similar to how Mount & Blade functions.\n\nDuring the campaigns, you start out with a single Destroyer and work your way up, earning Warbonds (Cash) by sinking enemy vessels which you then use to purchase additional ships.  There is an impressive arround of vessels available ranging from Destroyers to Carriers to Battleships.\n\nComabt is fairly straight forward, you manuver your vessels by left clicking on the map and fire the selected weapon by right clicking.  Aiming is done manually so leading targets is required but is pretty straight forward.  Weapons include cannons, torpedo's and depth charges and each weapon on a ship has a fireing angle so manuvering your ships to gain firing positions and evading enemies attacks is required.\n\nThe AI is not that great and acts in predictable patterns.  It will close range without attempting to evade and will then turn to bring the majority of it's weapons to bear.  As such it becomes rather easy to hit them.  It would be nice if the Dev's made it so the AI manuvered so to make themselves harder to hit.  This is also an issue for your own ships.  While you can manually control all your ships, as your fleet grows it becomes harder to control it all, thus giving control to the AI.\n\nThe campaign seems a bit bland, but functional.  There are a variety of different fleet compositions you can come up against including convoys of various sizes, patrols, combat fleets etc and there are various missions available as well as general free-roam and the ability to capture ports.\n\nWhile there are alot of ships available I would have liked there to be a bit more differentiation between them, but over all, each class feels and plays different, giving you plenty of tactical options on the battlefield.\n\nIn summary, Victory at Sea is a fun, fast paced and action oriented game.  The campaign is decent without being that engaging.  The combat is fun, but simple and the AI could be better.\n\nIf you like naval combat but are not looking for a deep sim experience, then VaS is a good option that I would recommend.","August 10, 2014","true","30.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I recall it being USD $24.99 according to TotalBiscuit's review on the same product on 12Aug, 2014, which is dated. The current asking price, HKD $148.0, translates to ~USD $20, which may be that this product has lowered its asking price or Steam being, well, Steam. The developer has also showed continuous support towards this product, which also factors towards this edit being more favorable towards the product.\n\nShort version: Victory at Sea subjectively straddles the line in terms for content versus asking price, with the deciding factor being how much you enjoy seeing WWII ships tear one another apart without being able to nitpick every inaccuracy the in-game vessel assets process.\n\nLong version\nVictory At Sea, or as I like to call it, 6x speed simulator, is a light RTS game featuring...ships! (*audible gasp*) To the best of my knowledge (I played Battlestations: Pacific once, so you know my naval knowledge is certified). You start off with a puny destroyer, accumulate war bonds (sole currency of this game) to purchase bigger and better ships via taking over hostile ports and sinking roaming hostile fleets, or to recommission destroyed vessels in your fleet, cumulating (hopefully) in a full fleet of battleships, carriers, subs and whatnot. During battles, you can choose to sit back and do nothing (you casual scum), issue orders via a tactical view of the battlefield, or manually control ship(s) in a more close-up fashion.\n\nBesides 3 (albeit somewhat same-y besides the flavor) campaign (you can choose sides), the game also has custom battles and historical battles, which does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\n...and that's about all there is, unfortunately.\n\nThe game seems to be geared towards simplicity and accessability, with the AI, both friendly and hostile, being moderately fustrating in some situations (they, however, become more competent as they accumulate combat experience and level up). Graphics and sound design are marginally servicable, especially aggrovating is the lack of puncture behind the sound and effects of a battleship firing its main cannons. Game depth is comparable to that of a peddling pool, with a rather skewed grinding curve and somewhat unexpectedly punishing consequences for losing vessels (any damage substained will be repaired for free upon visiting a friendly port, but a fee has to be paid to recommission a destroyed vessel, which somewhat prohibits experimentation and effectively locking you into a spiral if you lose too many ships in a rapid fashion). The skewed part comes into play by over-offseting the "death punishment" with most of the roaming enemy fleets being overly easy (end-game, you can easily accumulate, say, 5 Iowa Battleships and 8 Essex Carriers, while most of the enemy fleets will still be 4 vessels at most, each often no heavier than a cruiser). In other words, the game has a serious pacing problem, with the game over-rewarding skill and over-punishing mistakes.\n\nThe game also lacks some features that I would love to see implemented, namely vessel descriptions, vessel upgrading and customisation, capturing vessels (currently you get a new vessel whenever you accumulate sufficient XP from killing hostiles, I'd love to see the ability to capture crippled/surrendered vessels), and maybe even the ability to build your own vessel from the ground up (say, Yamato's cannons on an Iowa hull).\n\n\nAll in all, Victory at Sea is a somewhat pricy game for what it provide, but then again you don't really get one of these that often, so you may find it easy to let slide some of its aforementioned flaws.","December 26, 2015","true","70.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

However, several parts of the game work against each other that sours the experience.\n\nVictory At Sea wants you to pit fleets of ships against one another, but actually doing so begins to bring out one of the game's major failings. The Ship AI is competent in small fleets, but unreliable in large ones. When you are least able to manage all the ships in your fleet in real time, you'll find ships making bad decisions - choosing poor targets, navigating into torpedoes, closing distance needlessly - which means you'll need to micro every ship in hyper slowmode just to avoid losing vessels in safe engagements.\n\nThe game features an impressively wide variety of vessels, each one having a distinct appearance. However, there are comparatively few gameplay differences. The majority of vessels in a single class are often the same price, and have the same stats and loadout (+/- one torpedo, turret, etc). If there are more differences, it's not apparent or displayed.\n\nAlthough there isn't too much in history to work with, the few types of weapons in the game are also very similar. Since this occupies your entire gameplay, this becomes very apparent. There are small (secondary) turrets and larger turrets with varying shell caliber and barrel counts, but every projectile gun fires an identical-looking single projectile. All torpedoes seem identical. The only anti-sub weapons are depth charges.\n\nOn the plus side, aircraft carriers have a lot more variety, with each having a different sets and types of fighters, bombers, torpedo bombers, and observation craft, as well as normal shipboard weapons.\n\nUnfortunately, the game also has serious control issues. Feedback for many common interactions is often absent, leading to uncertainty about whether a click had an effect. Combine this with an interface that lends itself to misclicks, erroneous orders can be given with no way to quickly notice. Some orders, especially in the tactical screen, are buggy either in function or display, making it nearly impossible to know exactly what your ships are doing or will be doing.","June 29, 2015","false","9.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've had to content myself with the naval battles in the Total War series for a long, long time, and even those were pretty limited. Fortunately that time has ended and there's finally a naval game that's got sea legs.\n\nVictory at Sea is a well executed game on one of the best eras of naval combat, WW2. You get the standard cruisers and battleships with their booming big guns. Quick but fragile destroyers that can cripple even the largest ships with a spread of torpedoes, but could be blown apart by a single salvo from a battleship. Submarines that lurk in the depths and can torpedo battleships with impunity, but are sitting ducks against destroyers with depth charges. And the new king of the ocean, the aircraft carrier which can sink any ship well beyond the range of even the biggest guns, but are no better than a lightly armed cargo ship when all their strike planes are shot down. Victory at Sea has all these and presents them in a way that is fun and easy to get into, but can get surprisingly deep as you confront larger and larger enemy fleets.\n\nThe core of the game is ship to ship combat, where you can control a fleet of up to 20 ships against an AI controlled enemy fleet. The battles are also pausable, so you can take a look at how the battle is progressing, and change the fleet's orders while the game is paused. You can give individual ships orders to attack a particular target, you can group up a number of ships and give them orders and watch your fleet duke it out with the enemy. And best of all, you can get manual control over a ship yourself, controlling its speed and heading as well as its weapon systems.\n\nManual control is where the game comes to its own. Its not just a matter of pointing at an enemy ship and seeing your gun batteries pummel it to oblivion. To be the most effective you need to manually tell the guns where to shoot, which means firing at the empty water ahead of the enemy ship to make sure the shells you fire actually hit the ship as the shells come back down to sea level. This applies to torpedoes as well. Taking this further, you can take manual control of the lead ship in formation, and lead the line of battle, The game is at its best when you are leading a line of cruisers and battleships across the T of a superior enemy fleet, trying to maneuver so you can bring the most guns to bear on the enemy while minimizing the amount of return fire that the enemy can give, and dodging enemy torpedoes all the while. There's a great feeling of satisfaction when you take down a fleet twice your size with adept maneuvering and accurate gunnery.\n\nAircraft carriers though, change the game completely. As in real life, once you and the enemy both field aircraft carriers every other ship becomes either a screen or an escort as you send your planes off to sink the enemy's most valuable ships. They do however have a weakness: once their planes are taken out (either by your own fighters or by concentrated AA fire) they become no better than lightly armed fast cargo ships, and can be gunned down by your battleships and cruisers with impunity. Aircraft are very very fragile as well, so you can't just send a flight of dive and torpedo bombers into the thick of an enemy formation and expect many of them to come back. Carrier battles become a game of eliminating the enemy's planes, then sending your own planes out to take out as many ships as possible, and then finally sending out the rest of the fleet to mop up whatever is left. This makes carrier battles less fun, as you spend most of the time looking at the tactical map and making sure your carriers stay out of range of enemy guns and remain properly screened.\n\nI can't blame the game much for that though, as carriers did change naval warfare in real life in the same way, making naval battles less about crossing the T and more about plotting flight paths for the strike aircraft. I just wish that there was more depth to carrier battles, like allowing you to change your plane's targets and waypoints once they are sent out, which would allow you to do a feint in one direction while sending in the real attack from another direction.\n\nWhat the game is not, though, is a hardcore sim. There are no looking at temperature gauges to look for thermal layers, there's no damage control or manually plotting torpedo depth, spread and targeting solutions, or manually setting artillery facing and elevation. The engagement distances are also way, way too close for actual carrier combat (though that may be for the best). The combat is point and click, but is done in a way that is sufficiently deep that tactical considerations in real life (crossing the T, screening the carriers) still matter. The game is closer to Total War's naval battles than it is to Fleet Command.\n\nThe game, however, still has its rough edges. The UI can be a bit inconsistent and unintuitive, being more similar to simpler console-style games than a full blown PC RTS, though it seems to be getting better as the game is patched. The menus in the campaign are definitely this way, which huge font sizes and ship lists that go from left to right instead of top-down, forcing you to click the left/right buttons or manually use the horizontal scroll bar instead of just having vertically scrolling lists that have both the advantage of displaying more ships and working intuitively with the scroll wheel. The game's frame rate also seems to be a lot lower than it should be, given the quality of its graphics. The graphics themselves are competent, but not eye-popping, with the odd ship model-reuse here and there. They are, however, much better than staring at map screens that you usually end up with when playing more realistic naval combat games. The enemy AI can also be a bit weak, sometimes sending its ships to you piecemeal instead of attacking in formation, and at other times their destroyers stay in formation with much slower ships for no reason, making them a lot easier to kill. The game is still getting patches though, and is still getting better so hopefully these rough edges will be polished off as time goes by.\n\nVictory at Sea is a competently made game about WW2 naval combat, presenting the tactical rock-paper-scissors of battleships-carriers-destroyers/submarines in a way that is fun and easy to get into, but can get surprisingly (and realistically) deep once the difficulty ramps up. It has its rough edges but they are being polished off as the game is patched. In any case the core gameplay is sufficiently engaging to make it worth it despite its shortcomings. If you’ve been looking for a good non-sim modern naval combat game, Victory at Sea might just be the game for you.\n","February 16, 2015","true","67.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Hatte es mir im Jahr 2014 gekauft, da steckte das Spiel noch in den Kinderschuhen. Man musste mit Bugs und Abstürzen rechnen wie bei jedem Spiel, das noch in der Entwicklung ist. Man nahm es in hin und erfreute sich trotzdem an dem Spiel das wirklich in seiner Art absolut genial ist und wirklich Spass macht. Es gibt drei Kriegsschauplatze: Atlantik, Mittelmeer und Pazifik (mein Favorit).\nAls ich mit VaS anfing war es noch eher schlicht und einfach, nicht jede Nation war spielbar (Japan und Deutsches Reich kamen erst durch spätere Updates), es gab nur einen Schwierigkeitsgrad der mit der Zeit sogar etwas zu öde und einfach wurde und richtig nervige Bugs (abgeschossene Flugzeuge von Trägern wurden im Hafen nicht mehr ersetzt) aber es machte so viel Spass und gemeldete Fehler wurden sehr schnell behoben. Respekt an die Entwickler an dieser Stelle.\nIch selber habe mich oft dabei erwischt wie ich mal eben 4-5 Stunden am Stück dieses Spiel gezockt habe, da wurde die Nacht mal eben zum Tage. Egal, das Spiel war so genial und machte soviel Spass. Ja ich wiederhole mich da doch immer wieder gerne und schwelge doch gern in Erinnerungen an glücklichere Zeiten.\n\nAber leider sind diese Zeiten vorbei. Ich sag nur "Autosaving".....In vielen Spielen etwas das einem den ♥♥♥♥♥ und den Spass retten kann. Hier in VaS leider aber nicht. Es tötet den Spass ungemein und das schlimme dabei, man kann es nicht abschalten. Gut, aber mal mehr ins Detail gehen warum das so schrecklich ist:\nÜblicherweise wird in diesem Spiel vor jedem Seegefecht und bei Einfahrt in einen Hafen das Spiel automatisch gespeichert. Damals in den guten alten Zeiten als das spiel noch in der Entwicklung war eine geniale Sache, da man verlorene Gefechte so wiederholen konnte um es besser zu machen. Hat mir oft den ♥♥♥♥♥ gerettet und verhindert das ich meine Maus gegen den Monitor gepfeffert hätte. Ja damals, aber heute nur noch der pure Albtraum. In dem Moment wo man länger als 3 Sekunden den "Autosave"-Balken sieht, darf man davon ausgehen dass das Spiel grad übelst abgeschmiert ist und dem ist dann auch 100% so. Übelst frustrierend wenn man grad in den Hafen einfahren will um sich denn neuen schweren Kreuzer kaufen will den man endlich nutzen kann und dann merkt das alles für den ♥♥♥♥♥ war. Klar mag man jetzt sagen "Hey dann lade doch den letzten Autosave-Stand und machs nochmal"....spassig vorallem wenn dann ein Gefecht ansteht dem man nicht ausweichen kann und wo man vorher nur mit Müh und Not lebendig rauskam und 4 deiner 5 Schiffe das Zeitliche gesegnet haben. Den ganzen Mist nochmal ausfechten? Nicht wirklich lustig.\nAndere mögen jetzt sagen "Hey dann speicher doch selber immer ab vor jedem Gefecht oder Hafen"....klar, ist ne Möglichkeit und das Autosaving wird dann übergangen oder man hat nen Spielstand Sekunden bevor das Game wieder abschmiert. Aber auch das ist irgendwie nicht immer möglich. Man will also manuell abspeichern, klickt die entsprechende Option, dann wird man gefragt ob man wirklich speichern will, klickt ja, man springt zurück ins Menü, das speichern wird sogar durch einen gelben Text bestätigt....so ist es im optmalen Fall. Nach ungefähr einer spielzeit von einer Stunde funktioniert nicht mal mehr das. Man wird dann noch gefragt ob man speichern will und das wars dann auch schon, das Spiel speichert einfach nicht mehr. In dem Moment weiss man aber auch das es keinen Sinn macht  weiter zu spielen. Sobald man in einen Hafen einfahren will oder in ein Gefecht gerät, stürzt das Spiel einfach wieder ab und es hilft nur noch die elegante Beendigung über den Taskmanager.\nMehr als ne Stunde am Stück ist nicht mehr drin und danach ist man so sehr gefrustet das man keinen Bock mehr hat weiterzuzocken.\n\nNeu instalieren, Treiber aktuallisieren, Fussnägel schneiden und Nasenhaare trimmen hat alles nichts gebracht. Es bessert sich einfach nicht. In den Foren wird dieses problem sogar ab und an mal angesprochen, die Entwickler wollen dann immer den letzten Spielstand per Mail haben, aber eine Lösung wird einem irgendwie nie geliefert und ich habs einfach aufgegeben. Schade eigentlich, da dieses Spiel so viel Spass macht und einen hohen Wiederspielwert besitzt, aber durch diesen nervigen Bug wird einem alles zunichte gemacht. Vielleicht habe ich ja was übersehen und bin für Lösungen wirklich dankbar, aber bis dahin werde ich dieses spiel ganz sicher nicht weiterempfehlen.","March 30, 2015","false","55.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","1"

So that being said, I did not like how the computer can have its whole fleet while I am limited to 10. 120+ enemy ships causes some lag.. I have been waiting for a game like this for awhile and I am not displeased, I've enjoyed it.\n\nNow  I do hope you get the money for upgraded game engine for better graphics. I would enjoy being able to zoom in and seeing crew manning guns and what not as with total war naval battles. I would like being able to angle the camera view up and down as well. You could maybe increase the lvl of the ships that would increase crew skills. I am not sure if that is already in as it seemed my lvl 1 ship faired about the same as my lvl 10.

Its enjoyable and well worth it to pick up if you want something different from your other games and want a bit of campaign mode tactical battles with a "build your own fleet - feel".\n\nPros:\n- Easy to get into\n- Naval combat is decent and straight forward\n- Easy on the eyes\n- Good campaigns and decent battle format\n- All nations present with straight forward GUI\n\nCons:\n- Two button click is a bit of a pain.

Victory at sea lets you play as UK or US in campaign and there are tons of ships to choose from.  The things I like the most about Victory at sea:\n\nNice tactical naval battle simulator not to hardcore or lightweight just right.\nMany ships to choose from with nice artwork for the ships.\nManually controlling ships has an effect on the outcome which is nice to feel like you are in the battle\nYou build a huge fleet up and get to pick what ships are in it, do you go battleship heavy or cruiser heavy? Its up to you!\nFeels like you are making progress in the game with warbonds and your captains rank increasing\nThe battles seem pretty good as I am usually evenly gunned with the AI and so giving the orders to ships to focus fire on that annoying Cruiser or Aircraft carrier is great!\nGreat game that fills that naval battle niche that has been missing for awhile!\n\nThings that could use improvement:\nBeing able to play as Axis in large campaign\nI hope DLC is free because the price is a little high so would be great to see Axis and  DLC for free.\nSome AI, Graphic, and bug tweaks (hey its a new game I haven't had any issues with it though).\nI would like to see you be able to carry over a reward for beating the campaign like a flagship that gets better as you beat it,more, kinda like that old ssi game.\nmultiplayer (I don't care about this but some might I like singleplayer games)\n\nTips for those having problems with fighting subs with destroyers, just go around the sub and come up from behind, I do this and don't have many problems of course the area has been cleared of cruisers and other big ships first.\n\nAlso use the way points or slow the speed of your lower hit point ships so they don't get wasted by an enemy battleship. I usually send in cruisers and a battleship and then let the destroyers arrive to clean up subs, cargo ships.\n\nUse the pause and manual control if you are in a tough battle.  You can win alot of battles if you take control of your cruisers and focus fire as needed and face your ships at the right angle to fire all your guns.\n\nAll in all a great game!  I've been wanting a naval battle game just like this and hopefully with an Axis expansion and a few tweaks this will be a perfect game! I have played a TON of games over the years and this is a great naval war game I've been wanting to play for quite awhile!

Also, Depth charges could be a little more acurate, as i find they keep going over there target. [The AI keeps forgetting there attack target orders and instead go for the nearist target (Fixed)], and durring the ['Run the Blockade' battle, if you tell them to attack a target specificly they will instead keep going straight forward twords the objective (Fixed)], and finnaly the submarines could be a bit faster, i find that after all my ships have been blow up fighting battleships, they finnaly arive to mop up. And this is just a graphical bug/glitch [when you fire the guns at a long distance the guns will go higher then the projectile that is fired (Fixed)], and for the destroyers, the rear gun's smoke will go off to the side when fireing forward.

Like many games in this genre, the campaign has a strategic map in which you sail from port to port, and a tactical map for in-game combat.  The tactical gameplay is quite strong, whether you elect to pay it RTS-style by letting the AI control your armada, or if you use the quite versatile pause-any-time engine to control most of your ships manually.\n\nThe biggest gripe with this game is the mission engine.  At ports, you can request a mission from HQ, but these these missions are often wildly unbalanced or outright mechanically impossible.  The Mediterrean campaign seems to be the worst in this regard; sailing from base to base frequently takes longer than you're given to complete a mission.  That said, there's no penalty for failing, and you don't need to take missions to complete the game.\n\nLike many World War II naval games, Victory at Sea heavily emphasizes naval aviation.  Aircraft carriers are far and away the dominant class of ships in the mid-to-late game.  Besides their historical advantages, aircraft carriers in Victory At Sea enjoy operating at night just as well as they do during the day, and continuing landing and launching aircraft even while under direct fire from enemy forces.  As a result, much of the late game can be turn into great flock of aircraft carriers sailing from port to port, destroying defenders and capturing harbors for your team.\n\nOverall, the game plays rather well, and I'd definitely suggest it for any fans of theater-scale naval warfare in the 1940's.  It keeps the subject matter interesting without sacrificing entertainment value in the name of historical accuracy.  Each campaign takes about six hours to play, and if you're like me, you'll get at least 5 campaigns out the game.","June 21, 2015","true","23.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In my opinion nothing is overpowered when it comes to the ships you can command or vs,as I found out 3-5 destroyers can take on cruisers and in some cases heavy cruisers,so long as you have atleast some idea about strategic aswell as tactical thinking,Though stay away from carriers or battleships if you do not have your own ;).Mission are great and not overly challenging in anyway,Though I did only get to do 9 in total,as I think i might have done one that resolves in the end of the game,it was in the Mediteranian and it said Hitler and some guy starting with M had been killed/captured and that the hostile forces of those leader's surrendered to the British and American Allies. So a fix of sorts on that end would make it alot more entertaining.All in all this game has alot of potential and if you like M&B warband or any of the Total war series,you should find this entertaining.\nAnd one last thing,if you could perhaps(developers) add defenses to the ports and the ability to upgrade them(defenses aswell as ports),while also having the AI step it up a notch if one could do so, I really think alot more people would want this game not just wanna try it out :).\n","October 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

First, I was pretty excited to have and play a fairly simple sea-based warship game.  In that respect, I think this game really delivers.  Gameplay is easy, there are tons of types of ships to choose from, all in all not so bad.  The hate part of the relationship though, almost starts to outweigh the good of this game.  I've had several crashes so far that all seem to occur after you win a battle, which are really more annoying than anything else because the game autosaves right before you get into a battle.  Also, more than a few times while in the battle mode, the screen would flicker black continuously almost like my display or power cords were coming loose from my monitor, which I assure you wasn't the case.  Finally, more of a note to the developers, but the frequency in which the enemy tries to retake the ports from you is a bit ridiculous.  It gets to the point where I can't leave a certain area and try to continue the game because I have to sail clear across the damn world to try and save a port.  Meanwhile, I've got like 4 or 5 friendly fleets just chilling right next to the port that is under attack, but I had to sail 10,000 miles to come save it?  I give the game a 6.0 so far.

The SSI games Great Naval Battles and Figthing Steel made in the late 90's were head and shoulders above this game in a historical context. That said, this is an enjoyable naval combat game, if you can look beyond having unlimited ammuntion, unlimited torpedo reloads, unlimited fuel, or having 20 ships of any type in your fleet even if they are all Hood or Bismark class ships. Oh and you  can have them at any time point in the war as long as you have enough xp to open up their build option. (I did enjoy having 4 Shokaku class CV's in my fleet, but perhaps some limitation is needed?)\n\nThere are some glaring issues, like carrier aircraft that attack just as well at night, in the rain, as they do on a sunny day and Subs that cannot dive below periscope depth. Attacking bases is over simplified as well, no costal defenses, no minefields, no defending aircraft, (unless a carrier is present) even at the biggest bases level 10.\n\nIt is actually funny when you realize your 32 knot cruiser is barely able to out pace your landing craft. Fastest landing craft I have ever seen.\n\nAll that said, this is still a fun game that will keep you entertained for for many hours. It would be much better if the devs would add different accuracy level options.\n\nNOTE: Some of the early issues have been repaired, since I wrote this review. There is an option now for no night flying and subs can now dive deep.

Maybe it does not have Silent Hunter grade ship models (the game would be nearly perfect if it does). This however, is a good news for those of us who run low end machines.\n\nHowever, there are still many shortcomings in this game that need attention.\n\nFirst of all, aviation still need a lot of refinement. Escort carriers should carry only F4F wildcat. Only bigger, later carriers, such as Essex class, should have access to F6F Hellcat. Early fleet carriers such as Yorktown can retain F4F, though.\nIn this game, British carrier borne fighters are too weak in this game. They cannot even beat German fighters.\nRoyal Nay FAA's pilots in ww2 were not known for such poor performance when they were fighting against Luftwaffe's Bf-109s.\n\nHere's a little suggestion on how to manage fighters:\nAll of them goes to two tiers. Any two types of fighters in same tier should be capable of fighting one another with 1:1 kill to lose ratio\nAny tier two fighters should achieve 2:1 k/d ratio against any tier one fighters, thus making the task of balancing easier.\nTier one: Bf-109T, F4F Wildcat/Martlet, A6M2, Fulmar\nTier two:F6F Hellcat, A6M5(A7M did not enter service),Supermarine Seafire (forgive me but I cannot think of any German late war carrier borne fighters)\n\nOf course, the k/d ratio does not have to be that strict, but it have to give players an idea of how a carrier's fighters will perform against enemies.\n\nNeedless to say, early fleet carriers, light carriers, and escort carriers should get tier one fighters while later and bigger fleet carriers gets tier two.\n\nEven if game engine restriction means that you can only launch 6 fighters at one time, you should have a mechanism to replace lost ones from your hanger, until there are no more fighters left in your hanger. The total number of fighters and bombers should be based on historical datas.\n\nAbout France. During the war, France actually had a carrier, Béarn. If that unfinished Zipperin could be in game, there's no reason to keep France's perfectly operational Béarn out of this game (despite the fact that it did not see much actions).\n\nItaly had a plan to convert cargo ships into carriers, perhaps they too, need a "something is better than nothing" escort carrier...","December 14, 2014","true","31.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although I feel it's simplicity also takes away from what could have become a better WWII naval wargame.\n\nI wish the damage model was a little more realistic and gave you a little more data on the individual ships.  Although it overall works I feel the graphics could offer a little more with more interesting explosions and damage modeling.  It's uninteresting to see every ship sink straight down. I think ships should vary a little in how they go down.  They should list to one side, roll or capsize (especially the Japanese cruisers and battleships with the huge superstructures), they go down by the bow or stern.  If you read books and naval warfare of WWII you'll hear about pieces flying off, bows breaking off and the keels breaking in two.  Make it a little more interesting!  Show me a little more in graphic sprites of men scrambling off the ships as they began to list, roll or go down.  I think I'd care about each ship a lot more and feel for their well being as I see the damage they take as the game proceeds.\n\nI think the game's target is to appeal to a greater fan base with simplistic controls but with that the game feels a lot more generic.\n\nOverall I like the game a lot but a little more detail in many aspects of the game would really make it shine and give us a horrific glimps of WWII naval warfare that seems missing in games.","November 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've yet to come across a title that lets me command my little fleet and feel the satisfaction of a well-placed cannonade or the yells of helm officers, stating that we have hull damage.\n\nWhile Victory at Sea doesn't quite cover those requirements - it certainly does come close! And here's why:\n\nVictory at Sea is a neat little game, reminiscent of Mount and Blade and Sid Meier's Pirates! in terms of gameplay. The prospect is very simple. You are a Captain and you're given charge of a certain navy's dinghies. Sorry, i meant 'destroyers'. With said rustbucket, you must take it upon yourself to sail the seas (under orders or not) and violently introduce the opponent navy's ships to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe overmap gameplay is simple. You navigate the open seas in "Sid Meier's Pirates!" style, running across friendly fleets, enemy fleets and ports of varying allegiances. Now, unless 'swabbing the deck' is too complicated a task for you, you can guess the way to interact with each. Friendly ports repair and replace crew and planes automatically, enemy ports and ships are commonly known as 'targets', and your own ships can be helped or escorted.\n\nSimple? Yes. Too simple? Sadly, also yes. While the game has a nice, straightforward concept, I was left dearly wishing it had more to offer. It has the skeleton gameplay down, but not much meat on the bones. For example - your ship's systems can get damaged in combat, but said damage has very little effect (except for guns or engine being disabled). Your guns seem to also be ridiculously accurate, making low-level fights a breeze, even in your first rustbucket.\n\nHappily, though, what it lacks in gameplay 'muscle', it more than makes up for in content. The maps are huge, players can buy ships from a petty torpedo boat to late-war Battleships and every battle feels different. There's always a subtle change in objectives, enemies and tactics that always lets you feel satisfied when downing an enemy fleet while sustaining minimal damage.\n\nGraphically, the game does indeed look rather terrible. This is especially bad in ports, where you get a close-up of your low-def textured ships. Most of the time, the camera's sufficiently far up that you don't see it, but maybe some better textures would have been in order. Ship models are also heavily simplified, with only the largest batttleships showing some decent level of detail. While it doesn't distract too much from the experience, it would be a welcome update to get a higher-def texture pack for it!\n\nConclusion? Yes, i do heartily recommend it. If you've been missing a proper fleet command game as I have, then this will help you alleviate that urge.\n\nWhat would one hope for in the future? More complexity. An accuracy system for guns, based on level. Higher detail in ships, ship damage and feeling.","August 9, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, if you want to control all of your ships, which requires a combination of pausing, planning and executing a chain of commands, then you don't need to worry about your own AI. When your fleet get's above 5 ships your pretty much going to have to rely on AI to control some of your ships.

But if you want the rough, i rate the came between 6 and 8, so if you ask me, the game is promising.\n\nThe game is actually quite easy to grasp understand. The ingame tutorial videos may be annoying as they will spam you at first, then you find yourself thinking, ah bugger what do i do. Well just to warn you, don't skip the videos so arrogantly. :>\n\nYou begin with just a single ship in the campaign, but as you go on and sink ships and earn rewards you can aquire more ships to your fleet. My current campaign has a fleet of 5 destroyers and a couple of cruisers and they are doing quite well.\n\nI also like the custom battles too. Especially with the carriers which allows some air battles to take place with dogfights, which can make big battles interesting.\n\nAswell as the new formations and deployment feature, the 1.1 patch adds new factions for the campaign which adds a breath of fresh air into the game. I also like the 'fog-of-war' they have added to the campaign, so at night it adds a bit more of a strategy feel, a bit like Risk really, since you cannot see the enemies number of ships in that fleet, as well as what type.\n\nThese features i really like, as they offer a good challenge, but if i were honest there are a few negatives i can see from this game:\n\nThe game is a bit arcady if i were to be honest, but not decisevely so, sometimes naval battles can be won by a bit of luck and good maneuvering (though i find it easy to avoid them torpedoes, i just steer straight to them and sail between the gaps of the spread) aswell as some random chances like a certain hit rendering a ship completely crippled for you to finish her off, or hopefully to damage her where she is not a threat.\n\nAnother issue i find with the game is that after a certain time in the campaign, once you have unlocked your first heavily armed cruiser and maybe a carrier, from then on you find yourself able to engage most of the enemy fleets (aside from the odd OP fleet that has like 2-3 BB's and CV's).\n\nThe missions that the game randomly generates to you from time to time can be a pain aswell. As when you are still stuck with a bunch of DD's you are sometimes ordered to take some OP port with tonnes of cruisers and battleships that can be reinforced by other fleets that are stationed there, leaving you with either 2 choices sometimes: Do a kamikaze death run on the ship and hope that somehow of all miracles you defeat that OP cruiser with overwhelming micro torpedo spreads and maneuvering for each ship OR you choose not to engage, at which if you are meant to assist in a defence, the port will be taken, which at this point will leave you feeling fustrated and perhaps wanting to perform a rage quit.\n\nAnd finally, the aircraft, though this being a game focused on naval i pretty much expect flaws with the air department, but i find the air battles a bit dodgy at times in terms of the mechanics aswell as their models. I am not too concerned with this as i have no serious issue with it, but this being from my exerience, i cannot say this will be the same for you.\n\nThe game is actually quite fun if you stick at it, though do not get too engrossed in it as you may find yourself becoming quickly bored with all the mechanics. I would also like to point that you may find the campaign quite fustrating as in some cases you may find yourself going halfway through the map to do one mission, and then go all the way back for another.\n\nBut do not be put off by these issues my friends. Because guess what? The devs are actually quite loyal to the community, as i have found they do react quite alot to the discussions taking place over the game. So i can assure you they will be looking into improving the players experiences. Sure the price tag may be asking a lot, but with a dev team who interact with the community in what should be improved, i can say that as a result, this game will only get better (as the game is still in its youth so do not write this game off immediately)\n\n7.5/10\nA nice game to kill a few hours over, but not something i would not get too engrossed over as this game is still in its youth the last time i checked but dont let that discourage you, as i said, the game will only get better with a loyal dev team!\n\nNow if you don't mind, i'm off to hunt der Bismark!","October 23, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that it becomes kind of a chore.\n\nI would still recommend for those who love naval battles, wanted to find a ship to ship combat game, or command large navel fleets.\n\n","August 2, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, as a game goes i would give it 7.5/10, the improvements i feel could be made in more ship types being added, Italy being added as playable, and the graphics and sound improving a bit more, other than that im satisfied. Its a worthy buy if you hunger for some navy fleet battling. Its no Sim, Arcady. But still good fun.

It’s a good game now, which only seems to improve with each content-increasing patch. I’ve played quite a few WWII carrier / naval simulations and so far I like this one the best. It’s not Harpoon, if that’s your game, but can be quite challenging on advanced levels.\n\nThere are some good walkthroughs on YouTube of much, much earlier versions of the game. It’s not what we’re playing now, but they can give you a sense of the excitement and strategy in the game. This series was pretty good. The community is also quite helpful if you post questions on the forum.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk4Ln7cOTXU\n","December 26, 2014","true","92.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The campaign begins quite challenging, because you only have one destroyer and you have to be careful.  Discretion is the better part of valor in the early stage of the game, at least until you have a small flotilla of warships.  There are three maps to play on:  Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific.  Each map has historic factions to choose from.  The campaigns are fun and the random missions received at ports add some flexibility to the game-play.\n\nHowever, there are a couple things I must address:\n\nFirst, the visual aspect of the game is very disappointing.  The models look like they were made by an amateur with no 3D modeling experience.\n\nSecond, there are some annoying bugs that I hope will be fixed.  When a mission tasks the player with hunting an enemy ship or convoy, half of the time said convoy is very far away and is impossible to engage, and these missions end in default failure.  Another annoying bug is the fact that upon entering port there is a moment of “loading.”  This loading goes far too long, especially on a high-end system.  One might wonder why a game with such low visuals would need to load for so long.\n\nI have enjoyed playing Victory at Sea.  I have beaten the Atlantic Campaign as the Royal Navy, and am working on it again as the Kriegsmarine.  I would recommend others to play this game, but it is my hope that the two issues I have previously addressed will be looked into.\n\n- Confederate","January 2, 2015","true","55.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My second problem would be that a multiplayer game mode would be really really nice (but I bought this as a single player game anyway, but its appeal could be amplified if you could co-op with friends!).\n\ntl;dr: Great game for strategy players at £17.99, excellent game for everyone else in the sales :)","February 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

There is still a lot of room for improvement, especially on the campaign side of things. But it is a unique title with some intersting ideas.

The UI is both very simple and powerful. The game gives you a grand array of choice, both in ships, factions and campaigns. The campaigns are fully dynamic, in the spirit of Mount and Blade, and fully replayable. It has random events and elements you would expect from a roguelike. There is no annoying narrative or forced choices, you're more of a pirate than a naval officer. The game runs smoothly, takes up little space and does not crash. From what I have seen, the developer heavily supports this game post launch. It is over all a very well put together experience.\n\nThis being said, there are many things this game could improve on. First of all, the audio design is the worst I've heard in a while. This is very detrimental to the atmosphere in this game. The ships make silly noises, a la Willhelm Scream, when they sink. All the guns have the same 3 or 4 loops. The impacts of all weapons sound the same. This being said, the 2d and the FX are only slightly better. Namely, the charachter faces and shell FX.\n\nFor some reason, I can't edit the names of my Captains or ships. Something I got used to in these types of games. There is also no ship customization. However, the sheer number of different ships partially fills this role.\n\nThe Campaign could use a bit more bells and whistles. Such as larger number of mission types, enemy formations, etc.\n\nKudos to the Devs, hope to see a Soviet Navy soon!","February 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Enjoyable gameplay with graphics that are pretty crisp, and the interface is easy to get the hang of. Sandbox campaign and a number or challenging historical battles.\n\n*Edit* I significantly ramped up the difficulty and it handled much of the "want" in late game battles so that you have evenly matched foes and are not steam rolling everyone in sight. Great game.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-The price:\nCannot beat it, everyone harping about this and that needs to adjust accordingly.\n-Gameplay:\nI really enjoyed the naval battles, they were at times intense with some really fun combinations of ships to play with. -----Gameplay II:\nThe "sim" lite / arcade gameplay is great, because you can jump right into the gameplay and focus on blowing up stuff.\n-Manual control:\nVery satisfying to take manual control of a battleship and rip through the enemy.\n-Real time:\nI enjoy that this is "real time" vs. turn based, you can adjust the speed of the action to your liking and pause to issue orders to your fleet.\n-Ship detail:\nThe ships are rendered well, with some great detail...I wish there was a smidge more to dive into and really zoom in on...but meh.\n-Campaign mode:\nThree massive sandbox theatres to mess around within, and you can choose a number of different sides to play as...so adds to replayability. (note the campaign is also a con)\nAI:\n-The AI doesn't derp out. Not a resounding Pro, but it works well and I can issue broad orders and micro segments and the AI can handle itself and remembers to continue breathing on its on.\n\nCons:\n\n-Campaign mode:\nAs the thumbs down have noted, the missions are kind of meh...and once you assembly a pretty big fleet there isn't much to stop you. ON THE FLIP SIDE...I just take my massive unbeatable, uber armada and deploy peices of it to match my opponent. (ex: they have a battle ship, cruisers, and destoyers?....I drop my battleship, crusiers and destoyers....and I hold back all my crazy aircraft carriers).\n-RPG\nHard to say this is a con, but you have your character and your subsequent captains in your fleet and they rank up...but thats it. It would be amazing if there were some character building elements, and specialization + unlock proficiencies in your ships as they progress (al la warthunder et al.)\n-"sim" lite / arcade\nMind you this is also a pro for me...that being said I wish there was a tad more sim aspect to this game. Watch the vid on the store page, you will see how combat unfolds...its great!...but in the same regard I wish there was just a touch more simulation'ishness in the game, just a hair more.\n-Sandbox\nYes you can prowl around the seas helping your allied (or axis) homies...but there isn't a terrible amount of cohesion to the theatre. I mean you can rampage around and not really think twice about anything...honestly I dont know what would improve this..but there is a vague niggling sense in the back of my head that wants more to this. Maybe ease us in with more missions that work in concert with your AI allies?\n-Gameplay\nAnd now I am being critical of a game I love. It is a touch too arcadie, and as above I don't know how to improve upon this without ruining the fun...its like when homer simpson designer the perfect car with everything everyone wanted...but I wish there was just a touch more to the gameplay.\n\nOverall I have had a blast with this game, I wish there were more like it. I would recommend it to others if this is your thing, it's relaxing and just feels great to take your ships and head their ships. Intense naval sim this is not, C&C sytle RTS missions this is not...but for the price this is a great relaxing game.","June 21, 2015","true","39.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

If you liked games like 688 Attack Sub, or SSN-21 Seawolf, or Wolfpack, this is game for you. There is a lot of hide & escape, or seek & destroy in this game.\nGame have two modes. In global view, you cruise with you fleet (single symbol of ship from top view), wandering around, choosing what to attack or evade. Other fleets are also iconized by single ship. There is visibility range which changes with day/night time.\nIn combat mode, you fight with enemy fleet, with possibility of reinforcements arrival if any firend/enemy fleet was close to. It's point and click with RTS style battle, with possibility to stop any time, and with free cam to go around battlefield. There is fog of war however, so you will not see enemy ships which you shouldn't. Multiple types of weapons, including topedos, deck guns, anti-aircraft weapons, and anti-sub charges, there are also close-combat guns (but they are automated and only in close range to fight with open-deck boats). Each kind of weapon have got different reload time, different angle of firing, and range.\n\nPros:\n- Good feeling of naval battle with multiple ships.\n- Very easy to learn interface (with video tutorials in-game).\n- Nice tactical view.\n- Campaing is dynamic, war is going around, your battle group need to do different tasks, but in the same time other fleets are fighting around. You can help them also.\n- Nice damage system of ships, If you hit enemy you can destroy engines or guns. Close combat damage on boats by small guns is simulated also.\n- Elements of economy and resupply at the bases.\n- It's long-time grinding game with progression (this is what I like).\n- Many ships of different classes to choose.\n- Submarines.\n- Carriers with planes.\n- Port atacking and defending.\n- Convoys to protect.\n- Commanders, with levelling and possibility to reassign.\n- Possible to manual command every single ship from your fleet on battlefield any time you want\n- Assigning orders to ships and battle in AI mode.\n- Grouping ships (useful for larger fleets).\n- Updates and improvements are still done by devs (it doesn't happen too often nowadays on steam)\n- Mods. This gonna be fun.\n\nCons:\n- In some situations poor AI of your commanders, they are not evading torpedoes, however, what you can do is switch to manual mode and command every ship at you own, this is what I do, and it's even more fun than playing using AI.\n- Torpedos boats launch torpedoes at too close range, when are in AI mode. It means they are dead before their torpedos reach target. What I do is launching torpedos manually from long range and then evade enemy.\n\nOverall:\nNice game. Worth to play. I enjoy a lot.","May 10, 2015","true","80.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

What a selfless guy.\nI wonder what will happen next?\nlet's find out\n\n\nMarch 13th, 1938\n\nIt's been nearly four years since we checked in on our Austrian buddy and he hasn't let his new found powers go to waste whilst we've been away.\nHe's upset quite a few people, it seems he's not too keen on certain races and has no hesitation in letting them know it, maybe he wasn't such a nice chap after all.\n\nIt's not all hate though, he does seem quite keen on the German People and he hasn't forgotten his Austrian origins either. He's even managed to cement a union between the two great nations, he's telling a room full of people about it right now and they all seem very pleased, lots of clapping and flag waving.\n\n\nAug 25th, 1939\n\nIt seems that absolute power really does corrupt absolutely, our Austrian friend has clearly gone mad, he's murdering people he doesn't  like, he's recently taken over Czechoslovakia and he's been seen talking to the USSR about how Poland would be a lovely place for them to share.\nPoland doesn't really like this idea and looks to the little island of Britain for support by way of a mutual defence treaty.\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\n\n\nSept 3rd, 1939\n\nJust over a week later and Poland, like the last candy in the box, proved too tempting for Germany to resist, they marched on the country a couple of days ago, honouring its defence pact, Britain responds by declaring war on Nazi Germany, it's old colonial nations of Australia and New Zealand follow suit along with its neighbour France.\nWithin the week Canada will have also stepped up to join the fight for democracy.\nWorld War II has begun.\n\n\nWorld War II\n\nWar machines mobilise across the world, over the next six years, countless nations will be drawn into the conflict.\nEpic battles are going to be fought over land, air and sea, it's the latter that we'll be taking a look at today in Victory at Sea, a maritime RTS title developed by Evil Twin Artworks.\n\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nOk, so the history lesson is over, but why did I bore you with all that?\nWell because this is a niche title, if you have little interest in world war 2 then you've probably stopped reading by now, which is fine because I strongly suspect this game isn't for you.\nLikewise, if lightweight naval tactical battles aren't your cup of tea you're not going to find much to enjoy here either...\nbut if you are still "In the mood" then we'll sail on into the review!\n\n\nAt the Theatre\n\nVictory at Sea  places you in command of a fleet of ships, fighting your way through some of the epic battles of world war 2, wrapped up in an isometric RTS experience.\n\nThe game play itself is split into a few different options, There are historical scenarios which recreate some noted naval battles from the period,  there's a custom scenario editor where you can set up your own "fantasy battles" and  there is the all important campaign mode.\n\nThe campaign mode in Victory at Sea gives you the option to fight across three different theatres, the Atlantic,  the Pacific and the Mediterranean.\n\nYou'll then choose your side, pick a portrait and a name,  then it's off to the briny to fight the good fight.\n\n\nOut of your Depth\n\nFighting the good fight is initially quite difficult as you'll start the campaign with a little destroyer escort (not the finest ship of the era) which you'll sail around the sandbox seas hunting for prey (and trying not to get blown out of the water yourself).\n\nWhen you've found an appropriate target and "sailed into it" on the map, the screen will drop down into an isometric view and you're ready for battle!\n\n\nCombat and Coffee\n\nThe combat itself is fairly simple, get the enemy in your firing arc and click to shoot.\nDon't go into this game expecting a deep simulation of maritime combat or you'll be disappointed, describing the combat as  "Arcade-like" is probably a little deceiving, but it definitely favours simple mechanics over realism.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes simplicity can be good, blasting the bad guys out of the water without too much thought can be fun.\nYou can also let the AI control your ships in battle for you if you want the game to play itself whilst you go grab a coffee.\n\n\nWartime Profiteering\n\nAssuming you win the exchange and your prey is now on its way down to Davey Jones' Locker  you'll be awarded with some much needed funds which you can use to purchase new ships for your fleet (or pay for repairs depending on your difficulty level)\n\nAnother option is to earn money by completing missions for HQ, although this is a gamble as some of the missions they assign are optimistic to say the least, even if by some miracle you do manage to survive the potential suicide mission they assign you, the pay outs can be disappointingly low.\n\nIt's  better to grind away in the sand box to build up your fleet.\n\n\nBump and Grind\n\nUnfortunately a "grind"  is what the game play quickly degenerates into, find a target on the map, sail towards it until you bump into it, enter battle and sink it, earn a little money, then do it all over again, rinse and repeat as necessary.\nAs your fleet slowly grows as a result of this grinding process you'll hit a sweet spot where the difficulty level feels about right, there'll be an even mix of easy wins and tricky battles, but this won't last.\nEventually you'll cross a threshold where you'll have amassed a sizable fleet, everything in the ocean should fear you and the game becomes a cake-walk.\n\nWith regards to purchasing new ships for your fleet, there are plenty of different classes to choose from (over 80 in total) each with their own weapons  and range, this can lead to some interesting fleet compositions and does add an extra layer of tactical thinking when engaging in combat.\n\n\nNothing to Write Home About\n\nVisually there's nothing to complain about. the sea looks pretty, the ships models are solid enough, nothing special, but serviceable never the less.\n\nThe sound similarly isn't stellar but it's not awful either, the presentation does the job it sets out to do but fails to impress, it's another...

I don't understand why this game is so good and fun yet not much support of fan for hints, tips, all that, I been seached for tips/hints, didn't tell detail destoryers class vs other destoyers class.\n\nBut this game is worthy it, but I hope patch 1.4 might gave like custom Portaits and rename ship/fleet, but other than that, Game is great, better and more fun than AAA class of PC Game, but warning there is not much talking about or fansite of hints, seem you are on your own to discover what is work and what is not work. so go on.","May 9, 2015","true","50.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Plenty of ships, easy campaign flow, and hell of a lot of fun blowing up other ships! Definitely more casual than hardcore (definitely not a bad thing!) but I can tell that the campaign is great and the game (which doesn't feel like an early release!) is gonna be fleshed out a whole lot more.\n\nThere are minor quibbles: explosions sounds like thunder, missions sometimes get tedious, the UI in battle gets cluttered when there's a lot of ships (was thinking a tray like in the Total War series would be good), some minor visual glitches, and I thought this game was a tad expensive.\n\nBUT, and like all good things: there is a but, the negatives are so small (except the UI) the positives outweigh them by a ton. Yes this game costs a bit of a penny, but I can tell it's gonna be something great.\n\nTl;dr, great game, you don't need to be a WWII history savant to enjoy it, the developers (from what I've seen) are very active within the community and are listening, and it's moddable.\n\nSeriously though, change the explosion sound effects, it trips me up!","April 11, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Expert: Turn off your computer, go lie face down in your bed, and cry.\n\nThe difficulty doesn't change the way the AI behave, or make it so the enemy actually grows in strength along with the player, but instead just changes the amount of enemy ships in a convoy and makes those ships stronger. It just doesn't work with this game, and it makes it so that the normal difficulty is too easy, with every fleet having 2 of the weakest destroyers and a cargo ship. Hard makes it so that even from the beginning, where you have nothing but a single destroyer, every captain and their grandma is captaining a battlecruiser and 3-4 escort ships. Expert, you spawn in and theres a 50% chance theres a enemy battlefleet just a few km away. It's so unbalanced, that once you've gotten bored with the sheer easiness of the normal difficulty, you just can't play it anymore. in hard difficulty they make it so hard, you can't advance in the game.

Wasn't looking for a realistic simulator or even a big challenge, so that didn't bother me. As of 1.3 you can play as both the allied and axis in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.\n\nBasic premise for the campaigns is the same: start with one port and one destroyer and go from there. You get missions that seem to be randomly generated. Examples include: attack groups of ships in a certain area, deliver a document from one port to another (read: visit one port and then go straight to the next), destroy a given convoy, attack a port. You get the idea. Nothing particularly unique to see here.\n\nYou get war bonds by completing misssions and destorying enemy ships. You can then buy more ships. Let's talk about ships. By default, you can buy ships from any allied nation (e.g. a US player can buy UK and French ships). I'd recommend turning this off so you don't have dozens of nearly identical ships to choose from. Even within this constraint you'll find yourself comparing ships with tiny differences between one another. I still have no idea if having more crew is supposed to be good or bad. Campaing gameplay is basically grinding out experience and war bonds to unlock and purchase bigger and better ships, and then amassing a fleet that can overpower anything else.\n\nGameplay is alright. Calling the AI useless is the nicest thing you can say about it.\n\nThe UI is lacking in many ways. It would be nice if the game followed RTS conventions when it came to left and right-click for select and move/attack.\n\nThe game tosses up tutorial videos before each fight, which is okay but not the best method to get you the most important and relevant info. For instance, I got the lesson about formations when I only had two ships, so there was no need to actually consider using formations until later in the game.\n\nGraphics are worthy of a mobile game. Ships are arguably the worst, which is odd considering they should be the main focus. Water and smoke are pretty good. Explosions are unimpressive. Sound is generic. All explosions/crew dying/shots firing sound pretty much the same. As far as I can tell the soundtrack consists of precisely one track.\n\nThe day/night cycle's only affect on gameplay is that you cannot see other fleets from as far away at night, and you cannot tell their composition from any distance. In the actual battles, there's no difference that I can see.\n\nIn battles, nearby fleets will attempt to reinforce both sides, usually with a 5-7 minute ETA. Unfortunately there's frequently no way to tell before entering the fight what reinforcements (if any) will partake and how long it will be until they arrive. This makes it hard to plan on if you have enough ships to win the fight, or if reinforcements will cause problems. Additionally, port attacks require AI controlled landing craft to make it safely to shore. Given how slow these are you'd expect reinforcement times to play an important role, but as long as you destroy the initial defenders, you automatically take the port, and the supposedly one minute away reinforcements don't matter at all.\n\nThere's a good game idea buried in here somewhere, but for $25 USD you can get much better games.","August 3, 2015","false","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do know that this is quite early in development, but my god. I know graphics aren't very important in an RTS game but it's almost like they didn't try. There is no loading screen between campaign map and a battle/port because all the game does is zoom in on the gross oversized and warped map and make the ships bigger, giving you the ability to fire. The ship textures are OK, but nothing special. All in all I'd recommend getting it when it's 10 dollars, 25 dollars is WAAAAAY too steep to purchase.

This got some getting use to but added to the realism of WWII. User interface is very easy to use, also they give you several tutorials during the beginning. It has several theaters (Atlantic,Med, Pacific etc.) The only down side is that your not able to play Germany, Japan, or Italy in the campaigns just US or England. In the historical battles/famous sea battles you can play any side. Looking forward to see if there will be any DLC to play the AXIS side. If you like WWII naval battles this is the game for you also the price is really nice.","September 9, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is simple, streamlined and the graphics are nothing to write home about, but it is a very focused design that perfectly (if somewhat abstractly) captures the essence of WW2 naval combat. If you are an enthusiast of this period you will enjoy this game - as will anyone who enjoys sci-fi space battle games which draw their inspiration from 20th century naval tactics (Star Trek in particular). This game will show you why big guns and tight turns matter... as well as the power and fear of torpedo runs!","August 17, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
