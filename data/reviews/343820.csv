If you remember playing this game, and really loved it, get it for the wonderful nostalgic value.  It hasn't changed in both the best and worst ways possible.\n\nDéjà Vu is a pioneer game in the point & click adventure genre, making a visual transition from the classic text based adventures.  At the time of it's release, it was groundbreaking in giving players a true visual sense of the items and people they are interacting with.  Vibrant and distinct colors make the world come alive from text, but text is still used to give hard definition to the characteristics of each individual object and person.  Déjà Vu, along with the other MacVenture games, also made themselves distinctively different from the other games in their genre by allowing (or requiring) players to combine inventory items within the inventory, instead of only with the environment.  Many years ago, this game was ahead of it's generation.\n\nNow time has caught up with it, and it is more of a solid piece of nostalgia rather than a classic game.  Playing it again since the last time I played it more than a decade ago, I am getting a flashback of just how hard it is to play.  Just like the old text based adventures, it is very unforgiving, has a steep learning curve, and my require you to reset your entire game over and over again to line every event up perfectly to win the game.  Way back when these games were released, we were astounded so much by the actual colors and freedom that we wanted to suffer through hard challenge to really get the full potential out of the game.  Now that the video game market is oversaturated with more games than can need more time than a human lifetime can offer, people need to be more picky than ever for what they are going to spend their time playing.  While this game was considered a gem back in the day, it may look more like another hard rock to the newer generation of gamers.","March 25, 2015","true","2.0"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","25","26","3","0"

It doesn't visually depict all of the actions, but instead uses its creative writing to allow you to visualize the events yourself, creating a much more powerful image than what any animation or cutscene could accurately portray.\n\nThe porting could have done with some polishing, though, as the recreated interface looks very amateurish with its generic font, blank right click context menu and clumsily resizing windows, strongly reminiscent of a quickly made flash game UI. Fortunately, these are relatively easy to ignore as everything is still functional.\n\nThe puzzles can be quite challenging and might require use of the good ol' pen and paper to remember vital information. Overall, the game doesn't have many seemingly absurd solutions, so beating it should be doable within some hours.\n\nThe weakest part of the game is the amnesia. The game starts out only allowing you to perform a specific amount of actions before your memory deteriorates further, and keeps doing this until you lose the game, having a chance of leading to save games you can't recover from due to too many actions before finding the cure.\n\nYou should get this game if one of the following applies to you:\nYou enjoy point & click adventure games\nEnjoyed the original/ports and wish to relive the experience\nYou want it","April 5, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/343820/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","In Sum:  A frustrating adventure game with a good storyline and no replay value, but is overall satisfying.  4/5.\n\nAn old classic game that has caused a lot of headaches.  Deja Vu is the story of Ace Harding, a private detective with amnesia, in a film noir setting.  It is a kind of point-and-click adventure, I believe predating games like Maniac Mansion by a few years, and it requires quite a bit of thinking to play.\n\nGraphically, it is well-done for the time.  There are very few animations, rather the game is played with still images and a set of commands to use.  Sound is minimal.  One thing the game does to annoy even modern gamers is a primative version of QTEs.  Every now and then, a thug will come up to rob you, giving you a few seconds to react.\n\nThis game is frustrating.  There are countless ways to die, most of them are unexpected.  Unlocking the wrong thing, taking a wrong turn, or even random encounters.  You have limited resources and it is possible to block yourself from finishing the game with too many taxi rides or firing too many bullets.  Unless you are using a walkthrough, you will have to play through this game many times to learn the exact steps you need to win, and using a walkthrough ruins the game.  This also makes the game have little replay value, once you have solved the case.  The story never changes, and there's not enough depth to keep you engaged in subsequent playthroughs.  That said, it is very satisfying when you finally get to the end, and close the case.\n\nFor classic game fans, and those who want to look at the roots of adventure games, this is possibly an essential game.","August 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I would have preferred the Windows 3.1 version, but this will do until they decide to somehow include the Windows 3.1 version into this software or as a separate package. Definitely a solid if short game for lateral thinkers.","November 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Personally, I grew up playing this on the NES, so the controls are a little different, but it is the very same game. There isn't a lot I can say other than, I prefer the NES version, because I grew up with it. Deja Vu, would have been better released as a complete remake, with updated graphics, story and more, but for the Nostalgia geek out there, you will find a classic. Unfortunately, I think fans of the original for the NES are going to be disappointed with Mac version of the game so I need to give it a thumbs down. Nothing against Mac, still love you.","May 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","8","22","0","1"

Well, definitions of 'fun' might vary, but this certainly isn't 'fun'.\n\nI first saw this game the day it was released on steam, and bought it, hoping I could play it and post a review before others could. I tried to like it. I really did. But I just couldn't. Half an hour of frustration led up to the moment where I just shut down the game and left it to rot in my library. The following review is based upon these 30 minutes, and believe me, I couldn't find more problems with this game in this amount of time.\n\nThe game is a port of the 1985 original. (I thought) I knew what I was expecting; pixelated graphics and cheesy sound effects. I was right on the first part. The same goes for the second part, though I was only able to find one sound effect; you punching items and people (and yourself).\n\nThe inventory system the game has is very frustrating. You have to drag items you find to a little window which is labeled "inventory". You've got your inventory. You can move a jacket into your inventory. In your jacket is a wallet. In your wallet is your money and other junk. In order to get to your money, you have to open every inventory window separately. If you want all your items in your "first" inventory, you'll have to spend a lot of time just moving all your items, and when you're finally done doing that, your inventory will be a mess. Some items look alike, which makes it even harder to figure out what's what.\n\nThere are eight operations you can perform on items during the entire game, some of which just imply each other (operate->open/close/consume). The game is horribly unforgiving. There are multiple events, even at the beginning of the game, in which you have no idea what's happening and end up getting shot. You've got little to no time to open your inventory, open an inventory in the inventory, take out your gun and shoot. When you're dead, you wished that you saved at some point in the game. This game has no autosave whatsoever (well, it's 1985. What did you expect?).\n\nI see no reason why I should continue playing this game. There are no achievements. The story can be found in many other games/movies/comics. Not even the fact that it features trading cards would make me play it again. Avoid this game at all costs; even when it's on sale, it's not worth it. Even if you invent a time machine and go back to 1985, don't get this game.","February 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 7 of 51 people (14%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","14","7","51","4","1"
