I expected to play it for about 30 seconds and shut it off.\n\nBut the interactions with the beach balls are tactile and satisfying, and I enjoyed spawning dozens of them & smashing them with my wooden arms. There's also a simple minigame where you can bounce them through targets for points. Like I said, weirdly fun.\n\nHOWEVER, in its current state I can't recommend it, not even as an EA title. I ran out of things to do in about 10 minutes.\n\nI've played a lot of VR tech demos and this one actually feels ripe for all kinds of little activities. A touch of relaxing music, 2-3 juicier envrionments (a beach would be a nice start) and some more ways to interact with the bouncy balls and you could have a wonderfully theraptic game that would easily be worth $2.99 (or more).\n\nIf you want to help the devs come up with ideas to expand on this then it might be worth it, because I do think there's something worth exploring here. Otherwise hang on to your $2.99 for now.\n\n(I'll be keeping an eye on this one & will update my review as it develops)","April 7","false","0.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

It's relaxing, fun, and there's a bunch of great stuff coming in future releases. I love beach balls!","April 9","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Early days for this game, but it could grow in to quite a nice experience. There's something timeless about trying to get a ball through a hoop... launching the beachballs down the hillside was a nice surprise.\n\nControls need a bit more explanation and clarity, and a TP feature and Dart Blower would be great to take out some of the beachballs.\n\nBut a fun wee distraction which I'll give to some people to play around with during my demos of the Vive :). Thanks for creating and thanks for sharing.","April 23","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
