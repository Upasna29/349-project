I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.\n\nIt's fun.\n\nThe bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?\nSound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts.","November 25, 2013","true","32.0"," 122 of 131 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","122","131","0","0"

I do recommend it nonetheless, but keep in mind that the game is over 10 years old.","November 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 109 of 114 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","109","114","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/80/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine.\n\nWhat we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online.\n\nI also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men.\n\nOn each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle.\n\nWhile the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!\n\nThe difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode.\n\nLike I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties.\n\nI found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago..\n\nIn conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Condition Zero\n2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes\n\n1. Condition Zero\nBasically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions.\n\n2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes\nThis is a singleplayer game. It uses the same weapons and game mechanics as Condition Zero, but with some additions, including the awsome fiber optic camera. Level design is one of Deleted Scenes' greatest strengths. The AI is passable. The story is where it fails, in that each mission is its own self-contained story with practically no connecting elements. I suspect you don't even play as the same person in each mission. Immersion takes a serious hit because of this. It helps to pretend you are playing as the same person. I recommend Adrian Shephard before Black Mesa.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing Condition Zero and Deleted Scenes. I highly recommend these games as well as any other Counter Strike game (or any game by Valve for that matter). By the way, check out the first screenshot on the store page.

The single player campaign is a very short bundle of missions where you have few objectives during each missions. Like rescue hostages, defuse bombs and take out terrorists with a specific weapon.\n\nThe missions are incredibly short and you can finish all 12 within 2 hours.\n\nThe AI will make the hostage missions a living hell. Once the round starts the AI are on the hunt to find any enemy player on the field and will not help you so don't expect any help from the AI. Getting a hostage to a drop off, before your team kills the entire enemy team.\n\nThe gameplay is not much different from the original Counter Strike so don't expect a major change.\n\nNow for the feature everyone cares. THE MULTIPLAYER. It's almost completely dead. I had trouble finding a match and when I did get into a full lobby match, I felt bored and it's not as good as the original Counter Strike.\n\nThis game is not good, but it's not horrible either. The campaign is short and not worth the money and the multiplayer is slowly dying out. In the end only get this if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise get any other game in the franchise.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Okay\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you dislike post in the comments on what you dislike about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 7, 2015","true","2.2"," 56 of 72 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","56","72","3","3"

Deathrun, Gun game, Surf and more custom mods can still be played.\n\nThe Multiplayer version comes with Tour of Duty. These are small missions in which you assign yourself a team of bots and play rounds against other bots as a Counter-Terrorist until you complete them. As you progress, you will gain points to spend on better bots and have an easier time.\n\nBuying Condition Zero also grants you Deleted Scenes. This is where Valve tried to make a single-player version of Counter-Strike. In this campaign, you once again take the role of a Counter-Terrorist, but this time, you are basically solo, ♥♥♥♥ing up Terrorists like Rambo. Your higher-ups pretty much chill outside while you are doing the dirty work. In Deleted Scenes, there are some new items introduced, such as  radio-controlled bombs, cameras and blowtorches.

CZ Deleted Scenes are in deep need of polishing for todays standards, but give it a break it was probably made before you were born. Deleted Scenes has very good cutscenes that catch you up and are a great part of the game. Once again, the AI needs polishing for todays standards, but the enviroment still does its job even to today by giving you a slight unsettling feeling as you battle enemies. Deleted Scenes campaign is SINGLEPLAYER so you can play Counter-Strike offline, which is cool as hell in my opinion. Counter-Strike campaign offline. However, just like every other CS game you probably need experience with the FPS genre. Don't let easy mode fool you because it is really tough. Any CS fan will love CZ.","November 15, 2014","true","6.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

This is basically due to both games sharing the same engine, with Condition Zero being different only in the texturing and meshing department. With CS 1.6 showing its age, Condition Zero might be a worth a squirt if your feeling nostalgic.\n\nBasically once the game Is bought you have to two installation options, Counter Strike Condition Zero and Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.\n\nCounter Strike Condition Zero:\n\nThis is essentially the CS 1.6 variant of the game which allows for traditional CS 1.6 style online gameplay and a somewhat enjoyable mini campaign which spans across most of the original maps, where objectives are the same as multiplayer however you can build a team for each map with bots of varying skills with more powerful bots costing more resource which you will unlock as you complete the maps. This single player should be avoided since it offers no real value and you are much better off playing on servers with real players.\n\n\nCounter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes:\n\nThis installation covers the actual single player campaign for Condition Zero. Each theater consists of you playing as a different counter terrorist unit:\n\nGIGN, GSG-9, SEAL Team 6, SAS and Spetsnaz\n\nYou in turn fight againest a variety of different terrorist factions:\n\nArctic Avengers, Elite Crew, Guerilla Warfare, Phoenix Connexion and Midwest Militia.\n\nI rather enjoyed the single player campaign since it deployed a large variety of maps and global locations ranging from fetid jungles to war ravaged cities. Most missions have a pre deployment briefing but these just offer simple intel and not much else. Most missions range from hostage rescue, bomb disarmament to assassinations. In most respects the campaign is somewhat reminiscent to Call of Duty MW which often puts you in the boots of a different soldier serving under a different army.\n\nIn conclusion CS CZ is worth your time if you are a hardcore C.S 1.6 fan like myself. It is pretty much HD 1.6 with a enjoyable single player campaign.","February 15","true","2.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The addition of the much-required shield has an important balance factor; it counters the usage of the AWP.\n\nThe hit detection is once again, superior to CSGO, much like the previous Counter Strike, and the aim for the weapons isn't cartoonishly exaggerated where you have weapons like the M249 and the shotgun being actually viable.\n\nOnline play is head-and-heels above CSGO's.  In CSGO you feel like everythings a waste of time unless you're playing in competitive matches, while in CSCZ, and CS, pubs rule the game (like all classic multiplayer games).  I can't say how sweet it was when someone who was clearly a CSGO player who looks like he just started playing CSCZ, killed a team mate to defuse the bomb himself, and then got perma-banned by the moderator.  It was also the moment where I realized that the behaviors of players in CSCZ compared to CSGO are not just different, but the CSGO behavior is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful and counter-intuitive to team work.  You have people competing fo points to get a higher rank quicker so that they can unlock more skins, which they can trade/sell for a hugely over-priced margin (some skins being worth more than CSGO itself).\n\nI guess it just goes to show that if you're someone who actually wants to enjoy playing the game, CSCZ is the game for you.  CSGO is just another "competitive" game with nothing more to it than popularity, driven mostly by the market economy the game has created for itself, suffering the same fate as TF2 and Dota 2.\n\nI would recommend CSCZ over CSGO any day and not because it's what I used to play (since I have none, as I barely ever touched it for more than a few minutes back in the day), but because the balance, design, and overall aesthetic is just so much more satisfying and fun to experience compared to more modern online FPS games.","May 5","true","16.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

For Core Multiplayer CS gameplay, get 1.6.

The main reason you should consider this is for the Deleted Scenes section, which contains a variety of content not used by the base game. From a legitimate story mode (with rather cinematic and interesting moments) to fun new weapons (M60's and blowtorches, to name a few), it pretty much is worth the price of admission. The base game is decent as well, but it can be easily replicated by playing CS:S or Global Offensive with bots. Deleted Scenes features a story mode with, well, a story. 18 unconnected stories, sure, but the variety of locations ingame makes up for the lack of consistency.\n\nOverall, it's a fun diversion when you're yearning for another story-based game from Valve. At a price of 5-10 dollars, you're basically getting two high-quality games for the price of one. I would recommend it to Counter-Strike and Half-Life fans alike.","December 23, 2013","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So much in fact, a small studio completed it.\n\nA quick reminder, this game was designed around Half Life. Linear gameplay in a compact space should be expected. This doesn't mean its bad - plenty of single player games are linear - it just takes time to understand if you haven't played Half Life. Level layouts and item interaction are not going to be what you are used to. Is the game perfect? No, and no game is. Due to the for mentioned old game design theories, certain pathways and mechanics will seem odd. Getting players to do a 180, and come back the way they came can be confusing.\n\nI've always been a Counter-Strike fan. There's no denying that. If you are well, you will have a blast with this title (and the Deleted Scenes). This title brings you back to the roots of CS, which allows for a neat experience. Would you play it again and again because of that? Probably not, because I completed the game in 4 hours and that felt like it was enough. I can only really see someone playing this if they are using an old machine with poor internet connection.\n\nBeing an old engine, AI isn't very good either. The way around that is to place environmental hazards everywhere such as trip mines. Because of this, it feels more like Half Life then Counter-Strike.\n\nTo wrap this up, if you are a CS player, you are missing something by not playing this. If you aren't, go on in life, there's nothing demanding here for you to play.","August 19, 2014","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well ,it says "Decoy u 2" and allows to carry everything at the same moment, so you will be allowed not to snipe from range of 10 kilometres with your trustful MAC-10. Plus, you can say "Screw you camper, Imma bazooka the 300 dollars out of you". If that is not convincing enough, in Latvia you can see dude which plays Condition Zero, when you are playing Condition Zero(Counter-Strike C4-blow).

When Deleted Scenes was solo #YOLO, Condition Zero is multiplayer one, which is not as good as original 1.6 as few of you think. But I think it's opposite. This game shows best camping skills of bots http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=141869292 ,just like in CSGO Casual. But their camping skills ain't the best feature of this game.

You will start out with bots that are super easy, but as you progress and get to the levels on hard difficulty they will be so freaking hard. I have only pumped about a dozen hours into this and it has DEFINANTLY helped me with my accuracy and problem solving skills on global offensive. This counter strike is considered to be the worse, but I can tell you it is FAR from that. I would reccomend getting this game for training to be better on other CS games, or to just have and extremelly fun and VERY challenging single player experience. This game is a must buy for PC gamers. Make sure to tweek the setting so even people with the crappiest PC's can play it at a rock solid 60 frames per second.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilithAkuma/recommended/80/","LilithAkuma","Medusa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilithAkuma/","94 products in account","It's the successor of the original CS, released shortly before Source, which outshadowed this game. It's a reskinned 1.6 with mechanical tweaks and added visual fidelity, as far as that for GoldSrc, the Half-Life engine, goes.  It also comes with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, which is the work of the now defunct Ritual Entertainment Studios, before it was handed to Turtle Rock. CZ itself features a Tour of Duty mode, where you "secure" maps by doing challenges, and buy yourself a team of bots, which you can improve later on by gaining more reputation points. As for the multiplayer itself, it is just like CS 1.6, just slightly more refined, and more maps, and remade maps which are easy to recognize with the _cz suffix in the name. Condition Zero Deleted Scenes on the other hand, features a campaign consisting of multiple, disconnected missions. There is a remniscence to Call of Duty campaigns, but take note- this game is from 2004. The missions themselves are- as you'd expect- very linear, but sometimes also challenging and fun nonetheless. But no, there is a variety of objectives, such as defusing, locating, and whatnot. Rise Hard actually felt rewarding to complete, unlike some other linear FPS campaigns. If you seek nostalgia- go for it. If you want to go for Deleted Scenes, in my view it's more than worthwhile, although somewhat short at some points. All in all- Condition Zero is still a nice plaything, whether or not for nostalgia. It's fun, enough said.","May 30, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A single player Counter Strike experience? A campaign for one of the most played games ever? BOTS? Sign me up, right? Well, it would have been absoultely good if it was made by one company and published by Valve. You see, it was going to be made by one company, but for some reason that I don't know, they gave it to another company. Than ANOTHER company. It just finally ended up at whoever made it today.\n\nThe game itself is NOT bad. It's actually fun. I quite enjoyed playing the campaign, even though I had no idea what was going on. The only thing that lacked was the "tour of duty" thing where you play with bots. It was really short and I beat it in, what, 2 hours?\n\nI don't know why people always diss this game.

Unlike any other Counter Strike game, this one is more or less ment to be played on single player. With every location you secure you get something called Reputation points, and it allows you to hire NPCs to work with you, and no NPC is the same. They all have diferent skill sets, Different names, and Different weapons! Also , if you buy this, you get another, erm, Version of the game, bassed off of deleted scenes, which are more of you completeing missions like defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, and this version doesnt allow you to get team mates, its just you against NPCs. id say that game is worth it as well.","December 26, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But first, cast your mind back to issue 132 of PC ZONE. It was the one with the words 'Exclusive Review: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero' emblazoned on the front cover, replete with a balaclava-clad man about to be unwittingly run over by three helicopters. Inside was a six-page review - or should I say lamentation - about how the game was nothing like we'd expected it to be.\n\nThe thing was, right up until the moment the review code plopped onto our desks - and despite development having changed hands from Gearbox to Ritual - we'd been led to believe that Condition Zero would comprise of a group of ever-harder missions, in which you and a team of intelligent AI-controlled counter-terrorist bots would battle it out across a set of maps against terrorist forces in either bomb defusal or hostage rescue missions. So basically, just like online Counter-Strike, only with bots and personal tasks to complete in each map.","December 18, 2013","true","116.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nowhere near as popular as it's predecssor or successor, Condition Zero still provided a unique experience with an interesting change in visual design that is quite often forgotten.\n\nDeleted Scenes provided the first step towards trying to turn a very popular and successful competitive shooter into a single-player goal-oriented experience. While not inherently mind-blowing, the low cost of Condition Zero in combination with some neat ideas put together to provide a small, but interesting run through the ideas of what Ritual Entertainment was putting together for their contribution.\n\nSimple, basic, still interesting.","September 26, 2011","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's definitely a fresh new take on the game when it came out over ten years ago, and it still is today.\n\nAlthough most campaigns feels like your usual run and shoot, the pacing is quite balanced with a few puzzle and hostage/defusal/boss shootout battle scenarios insterspread to break the monotony.

I'm not saying this game is for everyone — The graphics heavily resemble those of the Playstation 2 — but I really enjoyed it. Also, if you were curious as to why I only have 5 minutes in the game, Deleted scenes — The game I played — appearantly isn't counted as its own game on Steam, so I had to idle in the base game to write this review.","October 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/recommended/80/","RYNOMAN","RYNO MAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/","93 products in account","Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the singleplayer addition to the timeless classic: Counter-Strike. The game adds a singleplayer campaign, bots, and graphical polish. While the game itself is very similar to the original Counter-Strike it adds many needed features that the first game lacked.\n\nFor starters the new graphical polish that the developers added (I think there were something like 4 total devs) makes the game much more believeable and more fun to play. I felt the the developers really took the time to make sure the weapons were as close to real as possible. Because of this the game feels much more tactical than the first. In my personal opinion, this is the most tactical CS game you will find (when I say that I am excluding CS:GO).\n\nAs for the bots they could've used a bit more work. From todays standards the bots are everything but smart. They often have trouble deciding whether they want to climb a ladder or not and frequentely stare at the wall hoping something exciting will happen. While these bugs are excusable for the age of the title, they do detract from the game. The singleplayer campaign is good and fun to play at times. If you are confused as to what to expect on the singleplayer campaign picture Half-Life but in the Counter-Strike world. Basically if Valve wanted to make CS a singleplayer game they probably would have done it similarly to how it was done in this campaign. It can be fun and actually quite exciting but anything far from challenging. The most challenge you will get out of the campaign is a big enemy with lots of armor and a machine gun.\n\nIf you are a beginner looking for a introduction to the world of Counter-Strike, this is the way to go. The bots are a perfect difficulty for any new player and the game maintains the feel of the original Counter Strike.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10\n\nFor my full Counter-Strike review please click on this link: http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/recommended/10/","February 5, 2014","true","55.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The campaign is much better in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a nice game and definitely worth playing.","May 17","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are 18 maps to play on those campaign (classics like dusts or aztec but also forgotten maps like chateau). Games are pretty much about getting better score, just like in any other CS with some changes:\n- Teammates Selection - Before the match starts, you get an option to choose up to 5 teammates. Each teammate costs points, which you get for winning the maps. Each bot is prefering different weapon, has different skill level, differently play as team, different bravery. So if you are playing map like aztec, you should get some snipers and on office get some guys with higher teamplay skills.\n- Mini-Objectives - While you play the match, you have usually 3 main mini-missions to finish during the match. Easier ones are like to get few kills with specific weapon, harder are to kill flash-blinded enemy. Sometimes you will have to kill two guys with pistol and survive the round, one of the hardest is even to kill an enemy with knife. To win the match, you have to finish all those objectives and be 2 wins ahead of terrorists. However, if you let them be 2 wins ahead, you loose and you can start all objectives over.\n\nCampaign is only playable as Counter-Terrorists, but there are a lot of downloadable campaigns, you can even easily make your own with your own bots and custom maps.\n\n+++ Single Player Campaign - you wont find anything like this in any other CS\n+- Its pretty old game, so graphics is just fine.\n- Forget multiplayer, i guess its not alive in this game\n\n80/100","November 4, 2014","true","84.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Hardly anyone plays the multiplayer, you have 1.6 and Source for that. But within its lengthy development time, all the developers did significantly was add bots to an already made game. You can't help but feel disappointed but nevertheless, the game is included with your purchase of 1.6 (which is worth buying at some point) and for that, I recommend it.\n\n6/10 - ABOVE AVERAGE","May 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though, it has a single player mode, somekind of campaign, in which not only you ahve to win rounds but complete objectives, a rather good way to train your skills.\n\nThe models for the guns though, they are different, obviously, some sound different, a bit.\n\nIt features new levels to the 1.6 counterpart, but it might not have some from 1.6.

And started a bit of Expert as of the time I'm writing this review. :) We got a lot of strong-shooting guns, and rifles for each team. The Terrorists which opposes the Counter-Terrorists. You also get to choose which team do you want to join, and your look. The Terrorists has a BOMB to plant so that they can DESTROY the place, while the Cops, NBI, or Counter-Terrorists will help save the citizens, or the hostages. They have to kill all the Terrorists or save all the hostages in order to win. For the rest of the features of the game, I'll entrust that to you to discover what FUN this games brings to me.

This game was the first CS game I got into and I'll always love the CS series.\n\nIn my opinion, this game will always be my favourite alongside of CS:S because CS:GO is a bit too modern for me whilst the original CS lacks a bit too much for me. CS:S has what I like in CS:CZ but more. CS:CZ was like the perfect game for me whilst CS:S was icing on the cake.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I love all the CS games.\n\ntl;dr, 10/10 would definitely recommend Condition Zero - and while I'm at it, all the other CS games as well. ^_^","April 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The development of CZ began in 2001 by Rogue Entertainment and was passed to Gearbox Software (Half-Life: Opposing Force), then Ritual Entertainment (SiN), and finally Turtle Rock Studios (L4D/L4D2).\n\nWhile Turtle Rock Studios' later collaborations with Valve, the two Left 4 Dead games, were a big success CZ didn't turn out so well. This hyped singleplayer Counter-Strike title gave us nothing more than a mappack, most of which were just remasterings of 1.6 maps, which had to be completed with the aid of friendly A.I. You have to assemble your team of counter terrorists in CZ, the better bots being more expensive in in-game currency than the weaker ones. Once your squad is all set you're off to beat terrorists X amount of times on a certain map to continue to the next map to do the same exact thing. The main flaw with this campaign is that in order to progress the player must often partake in counter-intuitive challenges, such as killing three enemies with the auto shotgun while surviving the round. It takes what could have been a nice simple campaign and making it very tedious and overly long. Hey, if Turtle Rock wanted a longer game, they easily could have whipped up more maps. Most of the maps in this game are slight redisgns of Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Oh, speaking of which:\n\nCondition Zero Deleted Scenes is an unfinished but functional version of Ritual's CZ. It's a mission pack of 18 levels and 99% of its assets are recycled in Turtle Rock's CZ. Deleted Scenes is a great campaign with mod support.\n\nIn conclusion, Condition Zero isn't that good but it's a worthy buy for Deleted Scenes. Valve must have known CZ wasn't as good as its Deleted Scenes since most of the advertisements show Deleted Scenes levels.","April 20, 2014","true","557.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The development of CZ began in 2001 by Rogue Entertainment and was passed to Gearbox Software (Half-Life: Opposing Force), then Ritual Entertainment (SiN), and finally Turtle Rock Studios (L4D/L4D2).\n\nWhile Turtle Rock Studios' later collaborations with Valve, the two Left 4 Dead games, were a big success CZ didn't turn out so well. This hyped singleplayer Counter-Strike title gave us nothing more than a mappack, most of which were just remasterings of 1.6 maps, which had to be completed with the aid of friendly A.I. You have to assemble your team of counter terrorists in CZ, the better bots being more expensive in in-game currency than the weaker ones. Once your squad is all set you're off to beat terrorists X amount of times on a certain map to continue to the next map to do the same exact thing. The main flaw with this campaign is that in order to progress the player must often partake in counter-intuitive challenges, such as killing three enemies with the auto shotgun while surviving the round. It takes what could have been a nice simple campaign and making it very tedious and overly long. Hey, if Turtle Rock wanted a longer game, they easily could have whipped up more maps. Most of the maps in this game are slight redisgns of Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Oh, speaking of which:\n\nCondition Zero Deleted Scenes is an unfinished but functional version of Ritual's CZ. It's a mission pack of 18 levels and 99% of its assets are recycled in Turtle Rock's CZ. Deleted Scenes is a great campaign with mod support.\n\nIn conclusion, Condition Zero isn't that good but it's a worthy buy for Deleted Scenes. Valve must have known CZ wasn't as good as its Deleted Scenes since most of the advertisements show Deleted Scenes levels.","April 20, 2014","true","557.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's a plus, it comes for free with the original counter-strike.\n\nCondition Zero is amazing.  It's the Counter-Strike gameplay we all expect, but with a teambuilding menu and a campaign that bears similarities to Unreal Tournament 2004.  Across all the different maps, you'll be fighting the terrorists with your co-op bots, all of which have custom statistics, weapons and stats for Skill, Bravery, and Co-op.\n\nNow, let's talk about CZ Deleted Scenes.  I've always wondered if Valve ever considered making a Half-Life style campaign for Counter-Strike.  It seems like such an excellent idea... and this seems to be a direct message to me saying "Been there, Done that."  That's right, this is a campaign, complete with events and mission-specific objectives.  In Counter-Strike.  EDIT: OH DEAR GOD THIS IS TERRIBLE SAVE ME TAKE THIS UNFINISHED FIEND OUT OF MY SIGHT!\n--\nThese two games along with 1.6 knock GO out of the park.  If you want a Counter-Strike game for both online and offline, look no further than the CS 1.6 + CZ bundle.  Probably some of the greatest $10 you'll ever spend.  Also, there's no chance of an MP shutdown, since Valve holds the servers up with Steamworks to this day-- not that it would shut down, 1.6 is 20,000 concurrent players strong at all times.\n\nEDIT: Okay, maybe 30,000 50,000 people... not bad for a game from the 90's.","September 25, 2014","true","47.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/80/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the first official sequel to mod Counter-Strike, released in retail in 2004. It was pretty much same Counter-Strike on same engine and minimal changes when it comes to multiplayer experience, but it had more to often to solo players, with addition of bots and "Deleted Scenes" pack of single-player missions.\n\nNow, for multiplayer community... Is as good as ever. While it's not on the level of Counter-Strike 1.6, you will still be able to find few almost-full servers, whetever it's yet another De_Dust2 map or some server that actually rotates maps. Just more smaller tighter community. BUT it's kinda way too high-skilled by now for newbies to be able to enter in easily.\n\nSo, when it comes to the main, expected, multiplayer part of the game, it didn't recieve many changes. Explosive grenades are stronger. Hostages are a bit more realistical. The end.\nOh, and you will ntoice that graphics got a small boost, as far as HL1 engine goes ("GldSrc"). Models got more detail to them. Few tweaks here and there. Maps are much interesting as far as graphical design goes. If you are going to play de_dust2 non-stop then better do it at the less bland one.\nAnd yes, I don't really like Counter-Strike realistical gameplay much here either.\n\nNow, for single-player, you finally get some bots to play with. Which are less frustating for new people than online play and helps to hone aiming skills as well better. Though, while they navigate through default maps quite nicely, they don't always make best decision. As a protip, always send them a voice command to stick together, team. They also try not to steal your fun of defusing bomb, waiting for commander to do it, even if said commander is in opposite end of map. Yes, it's a flaw.\nAnd like Quake 3 Arena and UT, CZ single player consist of repeated matches with bots, as you will progress through trio of maps, being able to pick less and less stupid teammates over time, always being on side of Counter-Terrorists. And on each map, you have to have more than 2 wins over score of Terrorist team and have to complete each of three objectives, which go like "rescue <x> hostages", "kill <x> amount of Terrorists yourself", "finish some round in <x> time" and "kill <x> terrorists with <y> weapon".  So, fun for a while, but more of "just so something was there".\n\nAnd now for Deleted Scenes. This is what Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was supposed to be at some point, a full-blown single-player campaign. It was "cancelled" once Valve saw magazines giving it low ratings to preview, just to have it put along as bonus into final game. All just to get low ratings once again due to being "more of same". Deleted Scenes had 12 missions in retail release, with Steam version adding 6 more that you can select anytime from World Map.\n\nNow, Deleted Scene is a mix of good and bad. The excellent level design and repetive core gameplay.\nFirst, good things. Level design is quite good one. You will have to take control of unnamed heroes of counter-terrorist operations all over the world, with missions having great variety, with enough lenght to keep you playing, having to stop terrorists from taking over nuke in snowy part of Russia, defending yourself in Arabain town or fighting your way through the jungles. Seriously, some of the missions just have a bit of that scripted hollywood love that would make them worthy of being in Call of Duty and alikes, quite epic! Levels themselves are also build with knowledge of pacing and a bit of exploration, albeit linear.\nAnd it really tries to push GldSrc engine! In order to make it look like it's capable of more than expected, developers made a lot of animations of death for terrorists as well as destruction animations. Hell, I was amazed to see a stack of boxes getting squeezed by a door in the third mission, it's all quite joy to look at even if it's scripted. And well, it does hurt occasionally when it comes to enemies deaths. Like, when you shot with pistol at melee enemy into knee and he suddenly teleported half-meter away to the door, swirled and fell toward the door, just to get it open.\n\nBut core gameplay of Counter-Strike doesn't translate well at all into linear levels of single-player. What you bassicly will do, is to shoot few bullets into heads, while taking some hitscan bullets back. Repeat it on every enemy. Until the end of the game. It really is repetive and boring. Weapons don't matter much, all of them are good enough for bursting enemy again and again. Grenades aren't given often and flashbang don't seem to be as useful as in multiplayer. Smoke grenade is more offensive there though, making enemies cough instead sometimes. There is little enemy variety as well, you just got whatever hitscan stupid enemy, stationary snipers with laser, whatever melee enemy that rushes you and terrorist with freaking bazooka that is pain to avoid too! So, burst headshot, and burst headshot, repeat repeat repeat.\nIt also finally get to have some music there. For once. So, something definitely good.\n\nCounter-Strike Condition Zero is better offer than Counter-Strike 1.6 and has more value for solo players, but it's still not good enough to get me much interested in such twitchy realistical shooter. I still wouldn't recommend new people, especially with newer CS titles out there, only those who already play Counter-Strike should check out this one.","October 17, 2014","false","19.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnimuGrill/recommended/80/","AnimuGrill","EMP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnimuGrill/","436 products in account","Condition Zero comes with 2 modules:\n1. Condition Zero (CZ) - Provides a slightly different MP experience to that of CS1.6, mostly graphical changes with a few gameplay changes. Also has a player vs. bots singleplayer mode, which is essentially just multiplayer with bots instead of humans, but with added objectives to make it a bit more difficult.\n2. Deleted Scenes - A scripted single player campaign similar to something you'd see in Quake or Unreal Tournament.\n\nFor simplicity's sake I'll go over the changes CZ introduces, just keep in mind this isn't something I've thoroughly researched or anything of the sort, just what I know from playing multiple versions of CS for around a decade now. If you don't know the core gameplay of Counter Strike to understand these changes... well then go buy 1.6 and then consider picking up CZ.\n\nChanges\nLighting - Lighting is updated to be more smooth and natural, shadows and darkness is generally not as harsh and saturation looks much more natural, in my opinion this is a good change both aesthetically and gameplay wise, excluding the saturation change. I would prefer deeper saturation to make things easier to see and more colorful. You can somewhat counteract this by using a setting called digital vibrance in the NVidia control panel. If you have an AMD card they have a similar setting, though I do not know what it is called.\nGun Models - Gun models are updated to look more realistic and metallic, most have changed color palettes or just added color in general and a select few have new animation, mostly just moving parts, for instance the bolt on the FAMAS/Clarion now moves when firing. Also the knife has a new animation which I think looks awful. Overall this is a positive change though.\nCharacter Models - Character models are completely changed. They are higher resolution but in my opinion the new models look lame in comparison to the 1.6 models.\nTextures - Pretty much every texture on the maps have been changed and made higher resolution. For the most part the changes are welcome to me, though they do effect the visual feel of the maps a little. I think I'd consider this a positive change.\nOutside of the additions I mentioned at the beginning of the review, that's really the extent of the changes. Mostly all visual changes.\n\nSo the question is... do these changes warrant a purchase? Not in the slightest. For various reasons, if you're buying this for multiplayer, you're better off just playing 1.6.\n\nIn my eyes, the only reason to pick up CZ is for the Deleted Scenes. However I don't believe Deleted Scenes is actually worth the $10 CZ goes for.\n\nBasically the campaign is a collection of missions with no overarching story or really anything of interest in the way of plot. They are all linear. They take place in different locales around the world. They are all played on the CT side, although the factions will differ. They offer a very small amount of puzzle solving. They have boss fights. They have forced stealth sections.\n\nHere is what I dislike about Deleted Scenes:\nLinear as hell, wouldn't be a problem if it didn't give you the illusion of choice with multiple hallways and doors just leading to dead ends, often without an item reward.\nSecrets are hidden pretty lazily and without thought, even when you go out of your way to look for them you probably won't find a majority of them, and when you do find them, they are mostly useless.\nEnemy placement has very little thought, often times they are placed in dark corners or closed doors. If they are placed somewhere that requires a scripted animation, they are completely invincible until the animation plays out.\nBoss battles are awful, all of them but the final 2 bosses are insanely easy. The 2nd to last boss is just a bullet sponge that can take literally several AK clips to the head and numerous grenades before he dies, but he can kill you just as quick as any other enemy, not to mention he's surrounded by 2 shot kill snipers AND you are on a timelimit to kill him. Just awful. The last boss is actually pretty good and a satisfying finale, but he also has 2 bullet sponge troops that will kick your ♥♥♥ if you don't cheese them somehow.\nThe game is incredibly easy, even on hard. The only time I was challenged was the aforementioned bosses and when I had to escort the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI.\nEscorting AI is just plain awful.\nThe most fun guns run out of ammo quickly.\nYou can get trapped by AI very easily.\nSome puzzles are very difficult not because they require you to use your brain but rather because they require you to go around knifing random things (MULTIPLE TIMES) until something breaks, and it's rarely obvious what you should be attacking.\nAllied AI is useless\nEnemy AI is braindead. Most of the time they just stand in one spot and shoot at you, never trying to get to a better position.\nThe forced stealth is AWFUL. It's dreadfully boring and boils down to crouching behind a box, waiting for enemy to turn back, moving to next box, waiting for enemy to turn back, rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat, over and over again and it always left me wanting to just quit playing it was so boring and uninspired. More guns, less sneaking. PLEASE.\nWith that said, I think Deleted Scenes is a fairly average FPS when it's at it's best. When at it's worst it is just plain bad. Unless you're a die hard CS fan that wants to experience it, there are so many other games to spend your time and money on.\n\nOh and I didn't even mention the fact that this came out in 2004. Half Life 2 came out 7 months after this. Take a second to think about that.","January 24","false","12.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It seems a joke. These are the reasons to not buy this game ever:\n\n1. Very repetitive\n2. Non sense puzzles to solve to make the game last longer: Stupid like a switch does not work until you kill an enemy that is hidden somewhere.\n3. Everything is scripted: Sometimes there is friendly fire and sometimes not, some enemies can be killed with barrels some not, enemies will teleport infront of you.\n4. Very poorly scripted: NPC can block your pass to finish a mission so you have to load a previous save to finish a mission. NPC are ridicously exposed so they can be killed and missin fails.\n5. Very buggy: Sometimes you cant climb a ladder or sometimes you have to load a previous save because something that was supossed to happen didn't happened.\n6. No realism at all: Things like killing bosses with 5 headshots with an sniper rifle, enemies shooting behind bushes where you cannot see through, enemies shooting you in darkness, etc.\n7. Really poor difficulty level: I played in hard mode. The first missions were just fine in difficultie but for some reason, the more I played, the more overclocked the enemies are: yes, overclocked. Enemies will run faster, shoot faster and need 3 headshots to be killed. The last mission I played (in japan) was so ridiculous that enemies could kill you in 1ms after you cross a wall, or walk 30 meters in 1 second, just like the first half life ninjas but with bigger guns.\n8. The saves are broken: I've never seen this in my life. The save files have two major bugs. The first one is that each time you load a save file, your weapon starts firing until you switch weapon. This makes you loose a lot of ammo. The second bug is that when you load a file, you dont appear exactly were you should be and you dont have the same ammo and health. Actually I got stuck in a situation where I was appearing in front an enemy who killed me in 1 millisecond after loading.","April 9, 2014","false","17.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","6","17","3","0"

Not only does it have a huge variety in game modes and also community mods, it is the best game to reach a decent aim you can profit from in other shooters.\n\nWhat mods can you play in CS:GO?\nThere are plenty, the mods variety is huge. I really have not played a lot of mods, since I am more into the competetive Counter-Strike, but I for example played zombie-mods, hunger-games-mods, surf maps (with and without rpg mod), bunnyhop and awp_noscope. BUT there are many more mods to that.\n\nWhat are the key aspects of the game?      Casual: Bomb/Hostage Maps\nDemolition: Bomb Maps\nGungame\nDeathmatch\nCompetitive (Matchmaking)\nCasual\nIn casual play mode, you will basicly spawn every round (1 life per round) and fight agains the opposite team (10 vs 10). You can play either bomb maps (where you have to plant/defuse a bomb) or hostage maps (where you have to defend hostages or rescue them). You can choose between the official competetive map pool (which does not include hostage maps) or reserve group (where you have both types). You will usually spawn with kevlar+helmet, and defuse kit (not on hostage maps).\n\nDemolition\nIn demolition play mode you play 5v5 on small bomb maps and you also have only one live. You spawn with kevlar+helmet and a weapon that will change ever round where you have killed an enemy (+grenades if you make multiple kills the same round).\n\nGungame\nIn gungame play mode you will play 10v10 on small gungame maps, where you have to kill an enemy with a pre-set weapon (everyone starts with the same weapons). Once you killed two enemies, you will progress to the next weapon. You win after you reached knife level and killed a player with the "golden knife".  Note: Every player must go through the same exact weapons to win and the weapons are randomized.\n\nDeathmatch\nIn deathmatch play mode you will play 10v10 on the same maps as on casual play mode. You will spawn with the weapons you choose through the buymenu (kevlar+helmet are already purchased for you). You have multiple lives and can always change your weapons after you died. One game ends after 10 Minutes and the winner with the highest score wins. You gain points by killing enemies or assist in killing them OR by killing chickens (which gives 1 point only per chicken).\n\nCompetitive (Matchmaking)\nIn competitive play mode, you will basicly play like casual but different. You will play 5v5 with people of your same skillgroup on the same maps as on casual (You can choose specific maps!!). If you want to get serious with Counter-Strike this will be the game mode you are looking for, BUT keep in mind that you need a lot of knowledge about the game for this type of play mode (and you need at least community rank 3 to play competitive).\n\n\n>> Note:   Keep in mind, that the game changes a lot, so do the game modes. I wrote this 29.01.2016, so any changes after I probably did not predict ;)\n\nSo all in all Counter-Strike is at the moment my favorite shooter, since all others (even new ones like "Rainbow Six Siege") are not as much fun as Counter-Strike is. Especially the competitive aspect of the game is way better than others.\nOriginally posted by WolfRefleXxx:I hope this helped you :)","January 29","false","0.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/recommended/80/","Dekonega","Dekonega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/","508 products in account","One of the worst FPS games I've ever played. Weapons feel terrible and behave very differently compared to the multi-player versions of those exact same weapons. AI is horrible. Visuals are decent for a game running on top of the goldsrc engine but at the same time visuals are not very optimised causing slowdowns now and then. Sounds and music are low quality stuff. Voice acting is ridiculously bad. There are plenty of issues to talk about. But all this is mostly forgivable stuff.\n\nWhy you might ask? It's because of the mess that is the development history of this game. It was originally conceived in 2000. It was announced in 2001 at E3. However the studio that started the development, Rogue Entertainment, went defunct later that year. The development was then handed over to Gearbox Software but they were not allowed to complete this game after missing out the 2002 deadline. Then the bits and pieces were sticked together in a rush by Ritual Entertainment in 2003 but that work was for naught. It's a miracle that CS:CZ was even released at all. The fourth studio to work with this game, the newly founded Turtle Rock Studios, abandoned the whole single-player campaign to make their own thing. CS:CZ was eventually released in 2004 as a multi-player focused training game with bots.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311274615\n\nCS:CZ:DS offers a curious peek into the future of what could have been. More refined version of CS:CZ:DS is what the grand single-player Counter-Strike game should have been. Instead we got a campaign about series of matches against bots with challenges in CS:CZ. That's all fine and dandy but that isn't very interesting. What's interesting about CS:CZ:DS is that here we have a game, that's more of a precursor to Call of Duty, and a game that has a lot in common with the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games, and other "Modern Military Shooters" in-general.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311286905\n\nCS:CZ:DS is a long pipe FPS, that features series of disconnected missions, extremely heavy scripting, NPC interaction similar to the Call of Duty, similarly boring repetitive gunplay, vehicle battles against Hind helicopter, explosions, terrorists launching nukes from old Soviet missile silos, and all the other stuff except the high quality craftsmanship that goes into the Call of Duty games.\n\nI bought the game when it was originally released in 2004 and it was pretty bad even then. I just installed CS:CZ to replay it since it was release for Linux in 2013 and I'm mostly spending my time in Linux thesedays. The CS:CZ:DS can be an interesting precursor for the modern military shooters if you're interested in playing that kind of stuff but in-generally people should avoid this game for what it is. It's an unfinished single-player Counter-Strike game that features normal Counter-Strike multi-player mode with slightly updated graphics and bots.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311288388","September 7, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","13","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xip1ngu/recommended/80/","Xip1ngu","✪ Xip1ngu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xip1ngu/","48 products in account","This game is all about the mission and the offline campaign that was created with it, called the "Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes". It was way easier than 1.6, headshots and spray kills happens way easier than in 1.6, and whereas some spam points has been removed in the old maps (and in the added CZ maps), it doesn't really change the layout all that much. It's still the same game - just easier, imo.\n\nI don't recommend it, since the campaign is dull and boring, gameplay answers to 1.6, just easier, as previously mentioned, and lastly, the "Call of Duty" offline bot campaign is so boring and repetitive, you might want to just beat expert, never to come back. It's that terrible.\n\nBuy 1.6 instead if you want the game in it's entirety, because CZ, while Source added some new elements and better graphics, is just a blatant copy with extra features thrown in there, for people who doesn't care.","March 30, 2015","false","244.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","3"

Just boring, since I'm neither a really dedicated CS gamer, nor am I really good at FPS games, maybe I'm not the right to judge.\n\nThe AI is not really good, and sometimes buggy, some enemies didn't even bother shooting at me, while other just hat lightning reflexes. That doesn't matter, because even on Medium the enemies bullets don't really do any damage. The same applies to your bullets, but since you got about 2 seconds time to aim, you can simply do all headshots, which kinda works.\n\nAmmunition is always a problem, which adds some kind of difficulty to the game, since you are forced to engage close combat with sniper rifles and long range combats with shotguns, just keep one mag an a long range weapon and it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe grafics are like Condition Zero grafics, not fancy nowadays, but better than CS1.6 and are well enough.\n\nThe main reason I dislike this game is the complete lack of any story. There were some minor "plot" - like parts, where you are told why to go there and kill all those guys, or sometimes sneek past the guards you could easily overwhelm. Another thing is the sometimes really hard to find routes through the level, some pathways are blocked by a locked door, others by invisible walls, and the worst kind are the pathways, which actually are blocked by some kind of fence, which you are supposed to climb over, but you are never given any hint to do that.\n\nAll in all it is a training program for CS: Condition Zero and maybe some other counter strike games, but does not really have any motivational aspects for me.","June 11, 2015","false","7.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odatruh_/recommended/80/","Odatruh_","(Odatruh) Fool Diesalot LXIX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odatruh_/","80 products in account","In my opinion, this is the best Counter-Strike. The multiplayer hasn't really changed, besides the fact that the graphics look better compared to Counter-Strike 1.6. However, if you could care less about graphics and care more about gameplay, then don't worry. The multiplayer, again, hasn't really changed, but it's still really fun. What makes Counter-Strike: Condition Zero different from Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source, and Counter-Strike: GO, is that this game has a dedicated story mode. Yes, a story mode. There are 2 campaigns that you can play. One is in Counter Strike: Condition Zero, where you play as a team leader and you must make a team of your choosing. The catch is that the soldiers that you pick have different abilities. For example, one soldier can be a coward,  but he will co-operate to the fullest and will help you out. But this campaign is just the maps except you have to have certain conditions in order to progress on to different and more challenging maps. Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, however, has an actual story mode. I've played through some of it, and it is actually very good. You have objectives, different tools and guns to choose from, it's just a masterpiece of a campaign. I don't know why they were Deleted Scenes, because the missions are very fun to play over and over again.\nOverall, this is a pretty awesome game and there's very little to complain about. I will rate this game a 9/10. It is a very good game, but the only thing that I have to complain about is the extra game that you must download if you wish to play the dedicated campaign, and that might be a problem for ones such as me who don't have the patience and the effort to put more time into downloading another game which is just the same game.\nI hope this review helps.","December 1, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
