And it will let you know the moment you discover that little "+" on the top right next to your currency. Because why play the game when you tappitytap your currency with real money?\n\nThe game itself is pretty basic. What happens on screen is out of your field of view because you are busy tappitytapping the right cards or you are screwed and hit the wrong ones which utterly destroy whatever little army you have build so far.\nOn top of that you get abilites which you have to restock (of course with currency) to tap or swipe across the screen via mousecursor while tappitytapping the cards below. I do not have the extra hands at the moment to make this possible or the second pair of eyes to see what's actually happening.\n\nIn short: There has been better flashgames and this game is tappitytapping straight to your steamwallet.\n\nPS: I hate (these kind of) mobile games and their developers and everyone who buys the currency. Please die in a fire. Slowly. Painfully. Curse upon your children. You most probably like pineapple on your pizza. You are weak. Your bloodline is weak.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/recommended/440740/","Farlander13","Farlander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/","445 products in account","Tap Tap Legions is one of those games that would probably entertain you while you wait in a restaurant for your order to arrive, but will get old long before your order actually arrives.\nBasically, the entire concept of this game is simple to click the "good" things as fast as you can, while avoiding the "bad" things, picking up gold along the way to upgrade your troops.\n\nNow, this game is not a mindless cash grab, nor does it maliciously try to part you with your money.\nBut if you want to actually finish the game without playing it for 50 hours, you'll have buy the gold required to make upgrades, as you'll notice the enemies strength far outpaces the strength of your own troops without extensive upgrades.\n\nNow that I've actually gone and DONE that, and farmed up all the gold required to upgrade everything, I can tell you it requires approximately 4 million gold. You can get about 2000 gold per battle, with all the gold upgrades in place.\nIf that sounds like a lot, that's because it is.\n\nAnd what do you get for reaching the final level? What do you see after Tap Tapping your way to Carpel Tunnel Syndrome? A giant, cloud filled screen that informs you that the final area, and the ending itself, have not been finished yet. It is all "coming soon."\n\nThis game is a very good example of what happens when an exceedingly shallow concept is stretched out across far too many levels, and far too many hours.\n\nI played this game for far longer than any sane human being should, mostly because I am NOT a sane human being.\nI got all the achievements, and saved myself from a horrible death at the hands of my OCD. But you...you might not want to do that. Unless, of course, you're as crazy as I am.\n\n","April 24","false","12.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","11","11","4","0"

The English is absolutely horrendous, with the first screen of the game having a typo. The best way to play the game is to honestly mash all of the keyboard keys at once, and said keyboard keys are horrible for a natural typing position. The power ups are useless as they require you to have a third hand to use. You can't gain any gold from repeating levels, the only gold you get from failing a level is from what you pick up, and there's a very "handy" in game shop.\n\nTap Tap Legions is a very, very poor mobile port. Oversized UI, in-game purchases for gold to boost your troops, and really? The battles aren't that epic, especially considering you can't see most of them because you are too busy trying to get your guys out. It also feels odd that the "good" bomb to use is the one with the skull, and the bad one is golden. Sure, it fits with the fact other "bad" power ups are that colour, but it really just doesn't look right.\n\nAvoid Tap Tap Legions at all costs. It's an absolutely disaster. If you really insist on playing, have fun mashing ASD/JKL a lot. It does at least win you levels!","February 16","false","2.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I was hooked moments after playing the game for the first time. Best of all, it is free to play and, while it does have a cash store for gold, you NEVER have to buy anything to fully enjoy the game.  I have easily played halfway through the game, yes I have had to do some gold grinding, but I have never made a store purchase for gold nor felt like I needed to do so.\n\nIt plays much like the family card games one would play in real life where you have to have a sharp eye to quickly slap the correct card you need as fast as you can.  Only in this case you are competing against the computer for time instead of other players, and every card you slap sends out troops or battle effects in order to seige a horde of monsters in bloody mayhem.\n\nGame play is simple: click on the "card" of a unit at the bottom of the screen to send them into battle, but you only have so much time to get as many units out as possible before you have to just sit back and hope your troops can achieve victory. However, there is actually a lot of strategy involved. The six cards that you can click on at the bottom of the screen can quickly change as you click on other cards, and the cards that appear vary from helpful troops, bombs, time gains, and gold to hurtful bombs, time losses, or just no action. So you have to pay attention and make quick decisions without adversely affecting your troops.\n\nThe action stays frenetic, and unlike other games where you have to hire troops with gold and must wait for an amount of gold to accrue before sending out your better troops, you can always send out any troops you have unlocked in the game as long as it appears in your bottom bar. I found the game pretty well balanced as far as what appears in your six card slots. Many times there are loads of troops to select from and all good effects, and sometimes there are only bad effects available, but not enought to feel like the game is slanted against you. It's not so easy that the game plays itself, yet it is also not so challenging that it scares away anyone who is not a master player.\n\nAfter beating levels you accrue gold which you can then spend to upgrade your troop types, monetary gain from cards, and lower card cooldowns. While there is a cash store to buy gold for upgrading purposes, it is the same as the gold you make in game, and so you would never have to buy anything in the cash store to fully enjoy this title. This is an example of a Free-to-Play with a cash store done right. As you are buying the same currency as that which you make in game, nothing is locked behind real money payments, plus you can upgrade the amount of gold you gain while playing, and go on "gold runs" where you click on as many gold cards as possible instead of focusing on sending out more troops. The cash store is really there so that people can donate money to the game designer as it is a free game, while still giving something back to the player for doing so. And it's there if you are a really impatient person who just can't grind their own gold for upgrades.\n\nAll in all, this is a really fun game to play, it's free, and if it sounds at all like a game you might want to try, I wholeheartedly encourage you to give it a chance. I happened to download it on a whim when I was browsing different games, and I'm sure glad I did because I found a real treasure in this title.","April 23","true","12.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This one has some interesting elements but ultimately is a different animal all together. This game does require a moderate amount of clicking, but the game progress can't be achieved passively or in the same mindless way. You basically, create soldiers by clicking on them for 15-30 seconds before a wave; based on the number of troops you successfully "tap" or click will determine your success.\n\nI really liked the originality; using icons and a shot clock to create my army. You will have the opportunity to earn gold that will upgrade your units in order to complete the full 64 levels. There are also upgrades such as bombs, enemy-bombs, timer alterations and more! I was honestly looking for something that could be played a little more passively; this game requires you to be active the whole time in order to win the game.\n\nIt's Free so try it; if I want a mindless game like Clicker Heroes...

The developers have changed it though so re-fighting the same levels over again does produce gold that is the only plus to this game.  With that said I spend 30$ yes thridy US dollars not pesoes and this is what i have to say.  Sure it got me to stage three and now all my characters are maxed out but its pointless.  I am only half way through stage 3 and I cant continue no matter how much more i spend I have reached the end of the game where its so difficult I cant continue even if I was to spend 100 more US dollars.  This game is pure garbage worth trying for 5 min since its free but it will take u longer to remove it than to get feed up with it.  Biggest piece of garbage I have ever played!! Well except for that game called Candle something I actually got a refund on that game but here if you spend real dollars you wont get the satification of feeling loved by steam.   This is a warning to all idiots like me who thought I'll give it a try all the negative review are correct the positive ones are from the DEV's or their friends :)","March 14","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I was hoping for more like that.\n\nFirst of you cannot change the resolution, my resolution is 3840*2160, and it fills most of the screen. It would be nice to have the ability to choose the resolution.\n\nNext of and the deal breaker for me is that when entering the castle to buy something, it zooms to the item, if you cannot afford it, it never zooms back out. So I need to close the game, and load it again.\n\nOh well.. they are updating the game along the way, so hopefully they can fix it.\n\nEven though the gameplay isn't as enjoyable as Battle for blood, so I hope they would add some more levels to that instead.","February 20","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can also be a great co-op game if you want to share the keyboard with someone.\nIt is a shame there are so many negative comments from people with  less then a hour played thinking they have to spend money.  At level 5+ you can earn gold from repeating levels, you don't need to spend any money to enjoy the game.","February 20","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has 64 levels, you unlock more powerful units and spells during the campaign, and you need to balance where to invest your gold next to be able to beat the game. It is quite unique in that you need to quickly decide on which fields to click during each mission, as some of them have good but some also bad effects for you, and your different units to spam the opponent... Also, its all about time, you can unlock additional time by clicking on gain seconds, which allows you to have control on the battlefield for longer... These features make it quite unique and thats why I liked to press on, despite some heavy grinding for gold, to unlock all achievements.","May 8","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
