Having said that, I persevered with the Campaign, and after you take Fulcrum and push into the enemy's territory, which is around the same time you unlock missiles for your Mantas‚Äîand around the time the AI starts pushing back!‚Äîthe game finally lives up to its promise and gets awesome.\n\nTaking the islands become a real tactical challenge each time, and your strategy of which islands should be Production, Mining and (oh so important) Defense becomes critical to success. When you get to that point, the Campaign is actually pretty good and the game finally lives up to its potential.\n\n\nWhether or not you can stick it out that long is another story...I have a LOT of love and nostalgia for Carrier Command, having played it ad nauseum on my Amiga when I was a kid, but without that good will, I'm not sure I would have had the gumption to push through the bad bad BAD start of the Campaign game. If you can, though, I think you'll find you are rewarded.\n\n\nSubjective Assessment: 7/10","November 25, 2013","true","34.0"," 145 of 175 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","145","175","0","8"

The A.I. in this game can be called many things, but "competent" isn't one of them. Which is a problem, because if you have to manually move every single unit because it manages to get stuck every 200 metres, the game becomes a chore (this gets borderline hilarious at the first muddy island - the one where you get the flying unit for the first time - where a more complex level topology and mud makes for a physically painful experience instead of fun). Now don't get me wrong, programming competent realtime A.I. is one of the hardest programming challenges, but that's the thing - if you can't do it properly, don't even try, because it will end badly. They could have try to work around the A.I. by designing the game differently, instead they went in guns blazing and just failed to deliver...\n","March 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","39","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/65740/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Back in 1988 a company known as Realtime Games created a game called Carrier Command for multiple home computers such as the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. A crossover between a vehicle simulation game and a real-time strategy game, players were tasked with colonizing multiple islands in an archipelago and destroy the enemy aircraft carrier before they can colonize the archipelago themselves. The game was well received receiving high marks from various publications, and gaming magazine The Games Machine even awarded it the number one game of 1988. In 2012 Bohemia Interactive released Carrier Command: Gaea Mission, a modern remake of the original Carrier Command. Did the game hold up over all these years?\n\nFor starters, I‚Äôve never played the original Carrier Command, so I can‚Äôt really compare the original to the remake.  From what I can tell, the main goal of Carrier Command‚Äôs campaign is to take control of various islands on the planetoid Taurus in a war between two factions: the United Earth Coalition and the Asian Pacific Alliance. The Campaign portion of the game starts out with you leading an attack on a moon called Taurus in an attempt to take control of it for its resources, to help sway the battle against forces who have taken over Earth. Unfortunately something goes wrong and your squadron crashes on the moon and only a few survive. From there you set out on foot with another soldier who guides you as you roam about in a FPS-style game. Your first goal is to make your way to a damaged carrier. You will venture through a very linear path with just one gun, shooting at very generic looking robots.\n\nAfter this short and dull FPS sequence, I came across the first vehicle in the game. My squadmates started directing me how to control the vehicle and what I could do with it. I found that controlling it was difficult using a mouse and keyboard, so I switched over to using a game controller, where one analog stick steered and the other aimed my gun. Playing with a controller honestly felt more rewarding. Your ground vehicle‚Äôs health, fuel and ammo could be topped up by just driving up to various refilling stations shown on the map and pressing the right button. Topping off the vehicles various items is quick, which came in handy when you are on the run. You have two viewing choices when moving your vehicles: a first person or 3rd person view. I stuck mainly with the third-person camera angle because you need to see more of the surrounding area so you don‚Äôt suddenly find yourself sliding down a hill, out of control.\n\nAfter becoming familiar with your new toy, you eventually make your way to the damaged carrier, dock at its side, and make your way inside. Once again you are back on foot in a short FPS segment taking out more robots. After all the robots are cleared, the surviving soldiers join you on the carrier, and you take command of the ship which turns out to be completely remote controlled, so you don‚Äôt need to leave your command chair. However, the carrier is badly damaged and in need of repair. So from your new seat you are able to remotely control the vehicle that brought you to the carrier.  You wil then drive it to the nearest island on your map to search for supplies. This is where the game‚Äôs focus shifts to the main campaign where you will be taking over various islands you come across by hacking into base computers.\n\nI quickly found that this is not that simple because all the islands have defenses in the form of ground roaming robots, vehicles, as well as small and speedy airships. Not to mention most of the bases have gun turrets. Much of the time you will be running around activating switches to shut things down to gain access to areas and bypass enemy defences. Different islands have different properties: some have production facilities which will produce new equipment or vehicles; others are rich in resources that you need to repair your carrier and produce your equipment. There are up to 33 islands in the game all with various environments. Some can be swampy, others more temperate and others more desert-like. In the swampy areas it is really hard to control ground assaults as you slip and slide in the mud and wet grass.\n\nThis is where a real time strategy-like gameplay element comes into play as you dive deeper into the game. Some islands get tricky and require you to have more than one vehicle on the go. You can have up to four ground and four air vehicles executing orders at the same time, each equipped with various guns and devices that you produce to aid you in taking over the island in question. I found the AI for the game as a whole to be very hit or miss, with spots of brilliance followed by some completely bizarre behaviour.\n\nOther than the main campaign, you have one other mode called ‚ÄúStrategy Game‚Äù. Here you are pitted against the computer in a large randomly-generated battle, but you have various settings at your disposal like the number of islands, enemy strength, what resources you start up with and how fast islands generate the materials you need. You can also set winning conditions too, like a number of carriers destroyed, or islands that need to be taken over. It‚Äôs a fun mode if you want to avoid the single player story and get into the thick of things quickly.\n\nIn terms of the visuals, the game is nice to look at, but nothing blew me away. Weather and environmental effects are nicely done and you can see a bit of influence from the ARMA series in it. I did experience some weird clipping issues while driving vehicles. I would be driving along and suddenly part of the screen would flash like I drove through something. The music in the game is odd. It‚Äôs very big and orchestra-sounding with a large choir, but it only plays at certain times. The rest of the time it‚Äôs just environmental sound effects mixed with sounds of vehicles and gunfire. Voiceovers from the characters work quite well, and no one seems to be overacting their roles, but as you progress through the game you do get somewhat tired of hearing what they have to say.\n\nFor a game that attempts to mix in some First Person Shooter sequences with some Real Time Strategy elements, Bohemia Interactive did a decent job. Unfortunately, the overall experience falls a little short due to some of the issues with the AI as well as the lack of any multiplayer and some technical issues.","March 24","true","26.3"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

Flying around with mantas, driving walruses, you have everything, aerial dogfighting, small tank charges and ship-to-ship combat.

There is no manual time compression, so taking poorly defended islands can be tedious and boring.  There is no explanation how flares work or any indication from which sides missiles are coming. Some of the nicest weapons (bombs and torpedoes) have bugs which cause you to explode when you try to use them. Auto-aim glitches in the final dogfight mission, so it takes quite a few tries to do it right.\n\nAlso, the game crashed like 15 times during my campaign playthrough.

Pretty awful bugs not to fix. Very sad as they probably never will given the age of this game.\n\nBut despite that the game is actually very playable if you accept that you have to nurse maid your Walruses along, keeping them together until the last minute so that you can deliver them into engagement as a unit. Once middle/near field targets are assinged their idiosyncratic movement problems cease to be relevant (even or perhaps especially if the targets are moving). Admitedly the game would be faster paced if you could just plot a route and leave the Walruses to it, with less intervention. But the other aspects of this unique game combination, namely that of commanding a carrier and its compliment of remote drones, and the combinations of loadout, and logistical elements is unquie and exciting. (Unless you count it's illustrious and highly succesful ancestry going back to the Atari ST and Amiga.) The first 'personell' combat is not up to much but it's not the main point of this game, just an interesting interlude to help tell the story campaign.\n\nYou really can't go wrong at the sale price.\n\nIf you are listening Bohemia... please try again with a remake/relaunch. I'm sure if you got it right which you are definately capable of doing, this could be a viable and easy hit. Most of the work is already done. Just execute the AI properly (you've done it since for other games I am sure), and flesh out the load outs and missions.","September 9, 2014","true","82.2"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","2"

It operates as a first-person strategy somewhat similar to the days of Battlezone and Hostile Waters.\n\nCapture islands, maintain resources, sink the enemy carrier. Not necessarily in that order.

Island-hopping with your newly upgraded units is pretty fun.  Enemies attacking your islands add a sense of urgency to a normally slower-paced game type.\n\n+ Easy and intuitive multitasking controls--The controls range from basic to advanced to accommodate all play styles.\n\n+ Aircraft carrier is badass\n\nCriticisms:\n\n- Painfully awful forced 1st person missions in campaign mode--I don't know how any of the devs could defend these missions and say that they were fun or well-designed.  Why?  To name a few reasons:  You can't jump, you only have one gun, the autoaim is crazy, and you kill the one enemy type (in 1st person mode) 3 bullets a piece.  90% of the missions you literally just need to W+M1 to the next objective marker and you'll win--which reminds me that you can't pick a difficulty mode.  I would recommend playing the 'strategy game' mode.\n\n- Story--You crash land on a planet and you hijack an aircraft carrier to take it over.  Good blue guys shoot red bad guys and vice versa.  They should have left it at that but the game crowbars in cut scenes of the unrelatable Lt. Australia and his inconsequential friends.\n\n- Aforementioned AI--Unless your units severely outclass the enemies on an island, trust the AI to only take out buildings.  There seems to be no way to suit your walruses up nicely and send them into an area without taking very heavy losses.\n\nThere really could (and should!) be a lot more to this game but if you like games like Endwar, check it out.","October 26, 2015","true","51.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

That the carrier is not just a solid model, but it acctually contains the vehicles and elevators used to launch them.\n+ Mixed sound quality, but mostly good.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- The indoor FPS part is not particularly fun and here the game really dips in terms of graphics. Outdoor FPS is a bit better.\n- The friendly AI is bad and you will lose units thanks to it. I have learned to live with the AI and its limitations so it's not as big of a problem any more.\n- No fast forward. Having to wait for fuel shipped by the supply barge is not very fun. Also, if you miss a hacking capsual for instance, I have to wait for the production time and the delivery time.\n\n\nThe game really hits a soft spot for me. I love to undock the walruses and send them away then giving them air support manually of lifting them behind strategic positions. The feeling when you stand on the carrier bridge and watch your war torn units struggle back is fantasic. There might not be many others who gets the same war romantic feelings as I do when playing this game, so I only recommend it with a cation that you might be disappointed if you do not share my taste in games.\nReally too bad the game does not have a proper online multiplayer co-op mode or team vs team.

You command a carrier, with 4 amphibious vehicles and 4 airborne helicopter-thingy's, all of which are commandable by you. You can even control them directly, taking the wheel.\nSince launch, the AI was a biiig problem, but thankfully, commanding your 8 units now makes much more sense and they mostly do what you want them to do. You'll still want to jump in against some enemies to ensure they don't get chopped up but they can handle themselves for the most part.\nYour job is to island hop onboard the carrier and capture the islands. The island variety is fantastic, and while enemies don't change that much, finding yourself on peculiar and different islands is a solid point in the books. It's also worth noting, the weapon and gadget variety for your vehicles is pretty good too. Nothing ground-shattering, but useful and fun.\nThe voice-acting is pretty bad and the storyline is paper thin, but that's really not the point.

All I know is that this game is worth at least $10, $15 at most.\n\nCampaign is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, basically just a huge tutorial. The Strategy Game is where it's at. Your carrier is placed on a random island controled by the U.E.C. (Basically N.A.T.O.) or a neutral island. The enemy carrier is place on a random island controlled by the Asians or a neutral island. And it's off to the races.\n\nEach carrier can hold 4 amphibious assault vehicles and 4 aircraft, plus an array of ship defences and other such delightfuls. As the game progresses, you'll unlock more tech.\n\nThe idea is to either destroy the enemy Carrier, capture all islands, or both, depending on your setup. What makes the game sweet is that, while a strategy game, you can also control any of your units, including the carrier itself, while still being able to issue orders to other units. It's a hybrid, really, and fairly well done.\n\nAll in all, take it for what it's worth, there's a demo, try it out.\n\n7 of 10","December 2, 2013","true","16.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The models and sceneries are nice and enjoyable, while not state of the art. And flying around with mantas or riding the island in a walrus is really pleasant. Also the added single player campaign sheds some light as to how the whole war there started in the first place. A weird mix of FPS and skimpy storyline is added as a little bonus or big tutorial maybe. As the game is now however it's like a raw diamond, lots of potential, but all locked in. The terrible AI and even worse walrus AI pathfinding is disturbing. However as the makers of the game are going to release/open up more and more to the modding community. (Including ways to design and import/share islands.)  And are bringing out patches, I have high hopes this game will be great in the future. Probably what I will do is shelve the game soon and then try it again next year with a dozen mods and patches installed ;)","October 6, 2012","true","58.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Then like me you might decide that its not worth the pathfinding frustrations to keep the game on your harddrive. The walruses tend to loose their pathing as they move to the extent that cause them to repeat and repeat the same movement, loosing the lead walrus tank, so unless you play to babysit each and every one of your walruses this is probably not the game for you. In fact I have clicked a walrus to go not even far from where it is trying to get just to watch it fail repeatively. You begin to realise you have to get in and drive nearly each one up, till they are at the door of the enemy. Yet the design of the game is to sit back and enjoy the action and take control if you want a little explosive fun for your own satisifaction. Overall its worth buying around 60%+ on sale but brace yourself for pathfinding frustration. Overall its a game to love just be patient. I did find that the walrus behaved better on the more advanced maps [more water less hills] when you get to the helicopers/drones level. Some have tried to fix the problems with mods and such but nothing seems to fix the pathfinding issues when valleys are involved. So buy this game on sale and you will be fine for the moments of babysitting.","December 20, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is very different in style from almost any other (except the original). It's representative of a game genre that has never taken off because its games (Battlecruiser Millenium and the ilk) have seemed amazing in theory but never yet in execution.\n\nThe game mechanic seems sound until you realise it only takes defeating the enemy carrier once (not all that hard or satisfying) to win what could otherwise be a long drawn out strategy game. That's broken.\n\nHowever, there's little cooler than watching all your walruses and mantas launch from the ship with all the picture-in-picture displays, then hooking up the land vehicles with the carry-all hook and invading an island. Very few games let you do that.\n\nThe single player mode here was ambitious but is as broken as the strategy game but for different reasons. The voice acting and character animations are painful, and the first person shooting (an aspect not present in the strategy game, sadly) is just not fun. It just doesn't feel good.\n\nI recommend as a morbid curiosity. To see what games could be, and to demand better in future, not for any particular thing that this title does well. Don't pay full price for this though.

An enemy carrier is doing the same. However, CCGM added a few segments where you have to play first person shooter. You sometimes have to control a vehicle directly as well... which makes you wonder "why am I risking my own neck? I'm the captain!"\n\nThe developers, Bohemia, added some backstory where the UEC is fighting against the APA (apparently mostly Chinese), and UEC is losing, due to lack of water, so they decided to colonize this "Taurus" planet, take its water back to Earth, but obviously APA is there to stop them, and apparently they got there first. You, Lt Myrik, is ordered to land and hopefully make your way to an old carrier, reactivate it, and use it to help you reconquer the islands in the "Dead Zone".\n\nThe problem with the game is while the starting islands (first 4 or so) do introduce the game to the RTS player, the really important part of the game, such as setting up defenses of the island, so it can survive assaults while you're out island hopping, is left virtually unexplained. You're simply told that you can convert the islands to 'defensive' by building a "defensive module" and rebuilding the command center, but that was too vague. And it doesn't explain how to actually IMPROVE the island's defense rating, which ranges from weak all the way up to "deadly".\n\nThe ship itself also needs fuel which is also used for damage control / repairs. And the only way you can get fuel to carrier is through fuel packs sent via the cargo barge (submarine) which can also bring you various other goodies from your "stockpile" island where all the stuff your manufacturing went. Transport capacity is limited, and it takes time moving from stockpile to you (and back). The more islands you conquer, the faster your resources accumulate or the faster your manufacturing goes depending on what type of island you got.\n\nPathfinding is a major problem in this game. The AI units have a tough time pathfinding in groups, which makes the game at times, comical. Often you have to assume direct control to push the unit beyond the chokepoint, then the AI does a decent job of pathfinding, but it can't manuever around other friendly ground units. The atrocious pathfinding means you have to micromanage each vehicle for fuel, ammo, and repair, rather than give simple orders like "group fuel" or "group ammo" and see the units take turns by themselves.\n\nThe vehicles can often even get lost by themselves, often with hilarious results, not to mention some odd physics. Send a vehicle to go from one end of island to another, and it may end up falling off a bridge, or making a 360 turn when a simple left or right turn would do, or get stuck on some rocks. Once, one of my Walrus managed to turn turtle (upside down) in the middle of the ocean on the way to the island. Somehow that makes it move BACKWARDS instead of forwards. (Huh?)  Yet another funny is with the hook. Tried to retrieve a Walrus that ran out of fuel with the hook. Had to be flown manually, and I got too low and the Walrus is dragging in the waves... but I was flying with nose straight into the water, and my VTOL engines were pointing 45 degrees down into the water, yet I'm still moving across the water... dragging the Walrus along. Somehow the hook is still attached. Hahaha.\n\nThe game tries to mix up the bits by giving you many First-person shooter segments. You need to actually jump out of the vehicle and use your personal weapons, such as assault rifle, laser, and later plasma rifle. Usually, you go into the enemy base and do your various bits of sabotage, raid computer terminals, and so on and so forth. There are a few segments where you have to jog across the whole island. You mainly face battledroids and a few soldiers, but occasionally, turrets and vehicle (but you usually bypass them. The bases are pretty easy as you do have a personal shield and as long as you don't take too many hits at once your shield powers up again much like HALO. However, some bases have regenerating enemies (until you shut that down) and you have to watch out for exploding barrels (which can kill you).  Those segments are just... weird, out of place, even.\n\nThe end of the game, well, that gets ridiculous really fast. Spoiler ahead.\n\n\nTo accomplish the end game, you need to...\n\n1) Conquer 2 out of 4 volcanic power plant islands that is supplying the big enemy bastion with shields that damages everything nearby. You need to check all four islands though.\n\n2) Once you've disabled the shield, then you can start the invasion proper, but you're in an FPS segment, where you can take direct control of one of several Walruses, and the others will follow along as AI. You can jump out and change to a different vehicle. You have to secure 7 different "zones" on the island shooting all the bad guys. Fortunately, you do get a "repair walrus" to tag along and repair your squad if you conquer the first zone.\n\n3) Once you secure the final zone (don't run into the forcefield!)  you have to drive up to the research center where you get the control software of the torpedo, and you enjoy a cutscene where the enemy carrier goes to the bottom, but the bad guy is getting away in a Manta (flyer)  so you jump in a Manta and follow him too.\n\n4) The bad guy's Manta has a shield... yours does not. However, you do have a super gatling. You have to chase him amidst enemy defenses (all of them trying to shoot you down), without crashing your flyer into the hills or whatever, while you try to overload his shields, then shoot him.\n\n5) Once you got him down to 20%, a timer starts. He goes one particular path, then heads for his submarine pen where he will escape. You have to kill him (shields and all) before he gets to the pen.\n\n6) The game then turns into a "rail shooter" where you're the gunner and the AI drives, and you have to shoot enemies all along your path... UNTIL the next segment... when your vehicle's toast, but you survived. Then it's...\n\n7) Yep, back to first person shooter. Fight your way across the bridge, down a mountain pass, to the submarine pen, for the final cutscene.\n\nThe game is also quite happy to crash here and there. I'm on a pretty standard setup and the game crashed many times, losing a hour or two of progress each time. Most of the time autosave works, but sometimes, the game just crashed when it tries to load a cutscene.\n\nAll in all, I should be playing Hostile Waters (which is now available)","June 15, 2014","false","28.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

It has stunning graphic, the islands maps are so detailed and well made in order to suit vehicle gameplay that I almost feel like it would be a waste to manage all your units in the RTS map mode.\n\nBut I wouldn't recommend it to others. It's just that I found the gameplay somewhat unrewarding and repetitive. Although you got lots of weapon and modification types, the basic structure of every battle is pretty much the same. You drive your carrier to capture an island, deploy 4 Mantas (hoverplane) and 4 Walruses (armour car) with various weapon and tools and head to the command centre. You don't have any other type of units except those two.\n\nAlthough the campaign start with a FPS experience, you don't get to play as foot soldiers anymore after the first level. I was expecting the player to be at least able to walk around the commanding bridge of the carrier, staring outside the window as you wait and watch your units coming home, and I was disappointed. Even though you did walk around inside the carrier in the first level.\n\nYou can't move your carrier in anyway besides the preset waypoints of warp positions. You can't direct control anything other than those 4 Mantas, 4 Walruses and a main gun on your carrier, dispite how many droids and turrets defences you own on an island and that even though you did play as a droid in the first level.\n\nThere are just too many little disappointments such as these, and too few variations or distractions to keep you entertained besides the main objective, which can be frustrating at times. The game really appeared to be an nice and huge open-world playground, but far too often I feel myself restrained in actual gameplay.\n\nIt's a well-made game coming from one of my favourite developers but IMO got loads of wasted potential. I got this game from humble bundle for a few dollars, along with ARMA series I believe, and it's well-worth it. But the full price of $32.99, I don't think so.","May 26, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developers seemed to have missed the point that they could actually design the game so it would work properly. At times u can tell that it's not a matter of lacking IT skills but the lack of inspiration and distance to their game. Sometimes u feel like no1 ever playtested this during development.\nThere's a ton of things that they simply should have left out (pretty effortless to do).\n\nThe land unit: a boat-tank kinda hybrid with custom loadout. Would be a fun idea if it wouldnt have a god awful pathfinding and a handling like a wobbly shopping cart. If this thing would be a hovercraft it wouldnt get stuck on the randomly gnerated terain geometry. This coulda been implemented easily and would solve a huge ammount of issues. Why does it have to have wheels in first place if it clearly conflicts with the gameplay.\nTerrain: Enemy Unit Wreckage blocks the paths and  the AI can't react to it ...absolutely idiotic design,,,just unspawn the stuff or make it non collision.\nDifferent environmental conditions...Disastrous..some of the arctic islands are covered in snowstorms wich totally obstruct the vision. Then theres muddy terain wich is horrible to maneuver and serves no purpose .\nThe placing of the structures is annoying in most of the missions u have to cruise around the whole island to deactivate stuff wich is located on top of hills that take ages for the units to get up to, just to get shot to pieces since they often waste all their ammo on enemies they can't hit anyway.\nThe units will also nonsensicly burn all their fuel by circling each other either to get unstuck or even when actually supposed to be idling in place^^\nEvery structure has to be approached really closely to activate...yet again simply impossible for the AI to do properly ..You have to micro manage every move of each vehicle just to refill stuff.\n\nThis reults in overall extremely slow gameplay, Everything seems like an unnecessary drag and u find yourself save-scumming all the time just to avoid all the AI issues. The FPS parts are simply hillariously bad and extremely generic. The writing is plain stupid and illogical.\nI heard that the game is supposed to get better when u made it past the first 15 hours or so..(i have a hard time to believe that due to the AI problems tho) ...that might be true but noone in their sane mind has that much patience to get through this cheese up to that point.\n\nThe only thing wich really makes this a cool experience is the fact that u got alot of time to think about all the flaws.\nIt's sort of inspiring to ramble about how this could have been made better at no cost. Lots of the things that cause issues and micromanagement simply wouldnt have to be in the game in the first place cuz they server no purpose anyway.\nAnd then theres a ton of smaller gameplay bugs, stupid logic and wasted labor of love in the art department. They certainly botched the great idea up bigtime and u feel kinda sorry for them that they wasted time to make features wich just don't work towards  gameplay.\n\nAt times it's grotesquely bad.. i wonder why i actually play it, think it has a B-Movie charme in a way.","March 10, 2014","false","16.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has a ton of rough edges and desperately needs more developer attention, but it has tons of potential and I've (mostly) enjoyed my time with it.\n\nThe concept of the game is amazing and mostly works, it's awesome to be able to seamlessly switch between FPS and RTS controls. Unfortunately the AI for your units is pretty bad so you'll have to micromanage them (and frequently take direct control) so they don't get stuck and killed. The poor AI is probably the single biggest issue with the game in its current state.\n\nI found the most effective strategy to be to order my units to move to a staging area and take control of one unit at a time to manually chip away at the enemy defenses, retreating after taking too much damage and switching to the next unit and ordering the damaged unit to head back to the carrier for repairs.\n\nOne area that I would like to see improved is the addition of controllable ground troops for capturing objectives (remote control robotic infantry is available in the campaign for certain scripted missions but is unavailable outside of that) that you would ferry in using the APCs. More variety of vehicle weapons and attachments would be great as well.\n\nThat said, the current asking price is too high for this game. It is still a beta, don't buy at the $30 asking price, wait for a deep discount (the happen semi frequently) and pick it up then, otherwise you will likely be disappointed due to all the rough edges.","December 11, 2015","true","49.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I felt it was not a very nice way to send gaming time.\n3) You cannot play with your own human player.. only sometimes.. and when you do you cannot command the other units at the same time.\n4) Cannot map my mouse keys.. what?\n5) no coop.. what a miss.","December 29, 2015","false","11.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The gameplay is solid and the concepts are promising, but the game becomes repetitive after the first hour.

Also for those who have noted that mouse sensitivity is super high - this can very easily be changed in the game settings though it is a bit silly that it's so high by default...\n\nI also noticed that mission objectives were often very vague and the game doesn't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing whch led me to look at a few youtube videos to work out what the hell I was supposed to be doing. In my first hour of play I managed to cripple a save where I had completed an objective wrong but not realised so I could no longer progress, however it took me a while to realise this and eventually had to revert to an auto save.\n\nThe game probably would have been much better if the developers had ditched the story and voice acting element of the game altogether and instead focused on the core mechanics of the gameplay. Vehicle AI is a very important part of the game and it's something which has been done to a very poor standard.\n\nThough saying all this the game does have potential and if you can get it cheap it might be worth it, especially for nostalgias sake but don't expect anything as groud breaking as the orginal.\n\n+ nostalga, graphics, interface. that carrier is pretty cool\n- poor AI, poor voice acting, ropy campaign story/missions, no multiplayer\n\nGranted I haven't played long yet but I think I have a good idea of the issues.

A mediocre quality game at best.  Not horrible but then also not good either.\n\nThe controls are quirky.  The mouse seems laggy but also also over-sensitive.  It feels like a console port.  I tried messing with the settings but I cannot get it where I like it.\n\nWhen you move, the speed seems to change wildly.  Almost like you hit a patch of ice or something.  It's not smooth or fluid at all.  You fell as if you are playing the game through a remote camera on a robot or something.\n\nYou get caught on every edge around around you, even the most innocent things will block your movement.  You must move along path very precisely down the middle.  Even the walls seem have an exaggerated no walk zone around them.  For instance you cannot walk up against a wall.  You will actually BOUNCE back from them before you touch them!  It's annoying.\n\nYou have no view to your feet.  It stops at about 30 degrees downward.  It's not a true 360 view FPS at all.\n\nThe graphics quality is fine.  The sound is good.  The acting is good.  This could have been better but between the poor controls, movement, and path issues, the game just falls flat.\n\nBTW: That is just the start of the game and is forced upon you before you even get to the RTS portion.\n\nThe Steam price is way too high.  I picked up a steam key for this for 74 cents on a different site!   Seriously, 74 cents and that is all it is worth.","October 25, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not the HARD person shooter or the Very Specific Simulator of any type. But It's a very good MULTIPLE game experience. The KEY of the game is COMMAND.

It's like playing a strategy game like StarCraft giving orders in real time viewing the battlefield from the inside! Another good option you have in this game is taking control of the units and playing as an FPS. The ideology is like Hostile Waters, another very good game of the same kind.\nThe difference between those games are that Hostile Waters had any unit with a specific pilot model called AI. The AI as much missions completes , so much its abilities raise(RPG style). In Carrier Command there is the ideology of complete control through the carrier. SO there is no indidually AI. Just you taking control a specific unit and the others that work automatically. In Hostile Waters AIs was like agents. In Carrier Command we talk about small army.\nBut as much some people compare it to ARMA game, NO. The Command interface make it a completely different game. Other "Feel".\nPlay the DEMO.

A mediocre quality game at best.  Not horrible but then also not good either.\n\nThe controls are quirky.  The mouse seems laggy but also also over-sensitive.  It feels like a console port.  I tried messing with the settings but I cannot get it where I like it.\n\nWhen you move, the speed seems to change wildly.  Almost like you hit a patch of ice or something.  It's not smooth or fluid at all.  You fell as if you are playing the game through a remote camera on a robot or something.\n\nYou get caught on every edge around around you, even the most innocent things will block your movement.  You must move along path very precisely down the middle.  Even the walls seem have an exaggerated no walk zone around them.  For instance you cannot walk up against a wall.  You will actually BOUNCE back from them before you touch them!  It's annoying.\n\nYou have no view to your feet.  It stops at about 30 degrees downward.  It's not a true 360 view FPS at all.\n\nThe graphics quality is fine.  The sound is good.  The acting is good.  This could have been better but between the poor controls, movement, and path issues, the game just falls flat.\n\nBTW: That is just the start of the game and is forced upon you before you even get to the RTS portion.\n\nThe Steam price is way too high.

The graphics are beautiful, certainly, but I felt a little betrayed by the trailers which appeared to promise a trifecta of gameplay, as if it was Battlefront meets the rts/resource management of games like Savage!\n\nI mean, why even put in those segments of "hacking" into computer systems to control androids, if you don't have any real control over them in the multiplayer or singleplayer aspects? You don't even produce androids- they either stick around for posterity (to show that you now control the island you spent fifteen minutes breaking into) or die with, no joke, two or three hits from your assault rifle. Why not just advertise the game as it really is, where the only units you can directly control, modify, and upgrade, are some amphibious tanks, VTOLS, and the titular Carrier itself?\n\nWhy, Bohemia?

Then the cart flies off the tracks when the Tropic Thunder A.I. that manages your pathfinding clashes with the enemy's Skynet's A.I..  Units equipped with grenade launchers will stand still point their guns in the air upon receiving a command to attack a structure, or straight up murder your own carrier if you deploy them to chase a nearby enemy unit.  Thankfully, the air unit's A.I. is on point, and probably better than your own flight skills.\n\nI would be amazed if you could lose an island at all to the A.I., as conquering an enemy island requires you to do a side mission, including fuse-boxing scramblers so that your units can reach the command center, or fuse-boxing firewalls so that capturing a center doesn't take five years.  It's 50/50 that your unit will reach the area and activate the point without getting stuck on a rock or tree.  Units even get tripped up on things as nebulous as water on the main map screen.  By the time you've spent half an hour taking an island the size of five minutes, the game crashes on the very next move you make.  If you won't save your money, at least save your game after every conquest you make here.\n\nThe game makes other bizzare decisions: You aren't told how long an area you've captured will be ready for production.  You can't speed up time outside of running out of gas and trying to gun it to an island anyway.  An invisible tech tree that you make random progress in when you capture an island or click a factory.\n\nThe other reviews here are accurate.  I'm not deterred by a few glitches here and there, but this game made me throw in the towel.","May 16","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #32 - Command Carrier: Gaea Mission\n\nThis is another example of a very mediocre game from Bohemia Interactive.  The production values are not that great.  The graphics aren't bad, and the sound effects were alright, but honestly I could have just played this with the sound off and been just as happy not to listen to anymore of the voice acting or music.\n\nThe opening of the campaign just plays like a straight up sci-fi based shooter with some dull characters and story.  But eventually you get command of a carrier, and the game morphs into a real time strategy.  I did not get very far into the strategy part of the game, so I may be missing some of the better parts of the game.   But even in the short time I did play, I could already get a sense of how bad the AI was.  I admit I am not the biggest fan of RTS games to begin with, so if I have to fight my own units AI on top of that, it makes it even more difficult to look forward to.\n\nPerhaps fans of the original game will be more forgiving. I actually didn't realize ahead of time this was a remake of a classic game.  Somehow I missed this the first time around.

Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is primarily a strategy game with first-person elements. What seems to have been an opportunity to harness a very gorgeous and expansive universe is squandered by clunky, non-functioning, or restrictive controls, a narrow and unchangeable field of view and, most egregiously, terrible AI. The fact that the voice acting and the sound effects are poor are nearly forgivable but the fact that the AI - an absolutely essential component of the game - doesn't work is this game's undoing.\n\nThe AI, through commands that the player gives to units that operate independently due to this game's first-person perspective, should work well enough to perform the tasks delegated to them. They don't. Telling a unit to dock on the carrier does not guarantee that the unit will dock on the carrier. This is important when a unit that is low on health, the death of which means a game over in many cases, because the unit will not take anything resembling an "intelligent route" to the carrier. It will wantonly engage enemy units that it should try to avoid, making the AI entirely unreliable. This is not a good system, because micromanaging the units to the scale needed for them to do their jobs is unreasonable. Even worse, this game requires automated tasks like moving units back to the carrier, to continue the game, which may mean spending a long time just leading units back to the carrier after a mission. Once, I drove one unit manually while allowing the other to navigate itself. I got the controlled unit to the carrier, only to find that the AI controlled unit was repeatedly hitting the side of a bridge, wasting quite some time. These mindless tasks are piled on random tasks that do not serve the "story line" and are clear attempts to prolong the game, and the system that moves the carrier from map to map also takes a long time of doing nothing for absolutely no reason at all. Speaking of the story, the "Story-Driven Campaign" with its "immersive storyline" is more a very long tutorial. The story itself is initially very unclear and does not begin in any manner that could be described as ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù.\n\nI was excited when I first got Gaea Mission because it looked great and the environments look stunning. Unfortunately, that's the only part of the game that I can bring myself to like.\n","July 4, 2014","false","7.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It has a huge amount of potential but there are so many bugs, so much stupid AI, and so much lack of attention to detail by the programmers (i.e. hearing bird chirps and wildlife sounds while deep underground in the bowels of a research center - kinda funny actually).  But what is monumentally irratating, beside of the fact that the game does not produce your upgrades fast enough so you are constantly more poorly equipped than the enemy you are fighting - and consequently die a lot, is the fact that your save file will randomly become corrupt and when you restart, the game will crash.  Sure you can re-load an older save file but all that work and time spent is gone and without fail, it will happen again.  Very frustrating.  The game is finishable and I don't have the patience to continue.  Sad considering how long this game has been out and how many patches have been pushed.

After playing Hostle Waters way back and loving every moment, I so very much wanted something somewhat close to that... I wanted a b scifi plot and laughable voice acting. I wanted a long drawn out battle for an island from an attack carrier. I wanted a game like this... or atleast what I thought this was.\n\nThis is a BAD game. Not because of the voice acting or the path finding, Or even the buggy "AI".\n\nThis is a bad game because it was designed aginst the player. Example:\nI command 4 manta to attack a single AA turret. The turret will be killed in a flat second normally. The AA turret is alone, no backup, nothing in range to attack around it, this is a cake run. Alone I can take out one of these with minor damage in a few seconds.\n\nI proceed to watch all 4 manta literally dance around outside of their own attack range [As dictated by the "AI"] and get wiped out VERY SLOWLY. I let them die just to see how it would go, it took 45 solid seconds of being pounded on and not once firing back. There was no reason they could not kill that turret. NONE. The game designers dictated they act this way intentionally from what I can tell.\n\nThe game is riddled with these design choices meant to punish the player for trying to think out side of the little, tiny, braindead box they use. As far as I can tell - The "AI" is nothing more then a set of scripts that decide how that battles will go.\n\nIf you wanted something close to Hostle Waters - sorry, this is not it.\n\nI'm not going to go any further than this except to say - To the Devs : REALLY GUYS? A SAND STORM ON A TINY LITTLE ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN ON A WATER PLANET JUST TO BLIND ME? WELL BACK AT YOU BUDDY!\n\nUpdate 1/10/2015\nI was looking at this game and thinking about giving it another try. Then I thought about the game again. What the hell?! I can't even want to play this as it is just made to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the player off. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU DEVS! no seriously - ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU. How dare you make something this offensively awful. WHAT THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•?! I can't even play this pile of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• without remembering how terrible the AI was scripted. You could have made something good. You could have made a game that wasn't full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t like "well ofcourse air craft can't take on AA guns! HAW HAW THEY WILL BE SCRIPTED TO DIE! LAWLS!" And how about those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing sand storms? Eat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Too bad I can't go back and not give you money for this.

Therefore your supporting vehicles are not available for assistance when you really need them. It also happens that they are out of ammo because they have been firing away at untargetable units (so much for defensive stance), which can be embarrassing when you are in a tight corner. Sometimes units simply won't carry out orders (and no, their program was not suspended). In short: the AI is simply BAD.\n\nRidiculously small action radius of vehicles (some 5 km on a full tank?), while it's unclear how this makes the game more interesting.\n\nMoreover, the 1st person game play (when on foot) is rather bland.\n\nThe game's concept is ok, the graphics are decent, but its execution is less than mediocre.\n\nOh, I forgot: the game frequently crashes.

Loving it so far in Campaign mode.  Lots of neat nuances and strategy approaches like taking the hilly rough terrain to get around to a good advantage to take out enemy lasers, or going all the way around the island to get a better tactical approach than the normal front and center.\n\nRead the game manual as well.

(right click the game in your library)\n\nBuildings are destructible (especially that big SAT DISH), so use this sometimes as leverage, hit the parking garages of Walruses and helipads of Mantas with grenades or lasers to lower the numbers of enemies that come at you.\n\nI've heard tips that to learn the Strategy mode part, it's best to set the sliders down and start with a very, very small strategy setup to learn how the enemy carrier thinks, then move sliders up to 20 islands, or 50 or 100 for that 1 or 2 month epic strategy experience.","February 15, 2013","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Load times are pleasingly short (only good thing), graphics look decent by yesterdays standards and lighting and weather effects are not too demanding so one can say the game wont get any uglier when you turn down high graphics.\n\nThe settings are alright graphics wise, key remapping is standard simulator stuff with reminders of what key functions will be overwritten so it is best to keep the standard controls on. MOUSE settings are atrocious but at least you can fiddle with horizontal and vertical sensitivity which is good to compensate for the forever accelerated mouse view.\n\nBiggest thing against this simulator is the fact that it is far from a simulator. It just dumbs down anything you know from ARMA and makes it controllable with a gamepad (hurr durr thats why theres an extra gamepad settings menu). The squad selection is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and requires you to HOLD Ctrl + 2 trough 9 to select specifically those units which will get orders. Otherwise EVERY unit will receive the quick command orders from the circle selector which you activate with the Space key... oh yeah NO JUMPING, NEVER! This also means, no loopings, dodging or any other stuff you can perform in ANY real simulator be it on foot, in a vehicle or aircraft... HOORAY for Bohemia stooping to these caveman standards of gameplay.\n\nTo go about your business you equip your units with gear that gets unlocked during campaign or randomly after taking an island ... that's right. You do not control the building process on any of your islands except what special purpose it should focus on (ressources, manufacturing, defence and one single central stockpile island or the island which will  spawn anything you put into production queue)\nDefence function is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•T since it gives you only a few more hours before a well equipped enemy carrier cleans house.\n\nBTT: You set waypoints and wait for the brainded AI to steer your units on automatically chosen paths in a single formation which is always a line / convoy... another dumbed down feature but it is probably better because pathfinding is  a real ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! Sometimes you forget to put the command into execute mode and suddenly realize that your spearhead attack unit is alone against a whole base. Autoaim is strong in this game (because its the future ... oh no because it is Bohemia and they cannot ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing program merciful AI if their life depended on it... EVERYTHING has AUTOAIM except the player controlled unit.\n\nYou have to LOOK at the target, check if the reticle is YELLOW (wtf y u no red?) and select the ATTACK order from the cricle menu AND press E for execute... then you watch how awkwardly misplaced gunfire does magical one hit kills or the laser beams get bent in a weird way around your cockpit and magically do damage.\n\nThe biggest GRIPE I have with the weapons is that they are pretty useless even if you have the superior guns. The AI is too dumb to attack from afar (no comparison to ARMA Tank crews) and the early AA weapons suck ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because the swarm of bullets you keep spewing is 1 pixel OFF so the target just laughs and keeps dodging and attacking you.\n\nThe balancing is overall ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!\n\nWhile on foot in the campaign you can take a lot of shots from enemy droids and infantry but piloting a vehicle or aircraft those droids become a real pain unless you manage to take em out from afar or slam into them. A small group can easily bring down half if not more armor depending on their weapons.\n\nHEAT turrets... oh god why!? There is a fire and forget weapon for almost anything. HEAT slugs can oneshot any light armored tank and the AUTOAIM can lead to your whole platoon to be wiped by a SINGLE UNIT! This means most of the time you will have to reload a save (if you saved at all or restart the island since you wont get reinforcements in time to continue where you left off.\n\nYour carrier is equipped with a front turret that is made out of the weakest armor in the game. One hit from another plasma turret will wipe it out and the reconstruction takes a LOT of time.\n\nThe enemy carrier can OUTRUN your aircrafts... thats right. The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• naval units in this game are as fast as a VTOL and once they are out of radar range THEY MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR -.-\n\nBringing down the enemy carrier is ridiculous. You'll go trough most of your turret ammunition, your idiotic bots can't replenish ammo while the carrier is moving since the pathfinding is TOO DUMB TO LAND on a moving ship (but manually you can do it one by one while flying just above the carrier bay doors)\n\nBasically what you do is switch from map to first person or third person camera behind a turret all thetime.\nTo take out turrets you switch to manual control, to kill anything up close you switch back to map and do the trategy game thing (select units then click target) ALL the while the CURSOR moves like it has parkinson disease making you feel like the game runs on 10 FPS ... it is the pinacle of awkward having to manually select everything with mouse acceleration and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cursor design that (3 times bigger than the unit you want to select (TO APPEAL TO the console RTS crowd ... WTF BOHEMIA?)\n\nTL;DR\nGAME IS PLAYABLE but at the same time a HUGE UNFULLFILING TIME WASTING EXPERIENCE thanks to the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•iest simulator controls ever from the bunch who specialized in making military and squad sims ...\nThey should be ashamed of themselves for wasting this games potential. It could be much less frustrating.","March 17, 2015","false","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one is a mixed bag.   Similar to others, there are pros, but overall more cons than the game is worth.  Given that, I still enjoyed replaying it as I bought it on sale and was worth the cost but I can't really recommend the game as a worthwile purchase for most people.\n\n2.5/5.\n\nPros:\n1.) Nostalgia.  For those that enjoyed the original game, this is a welcome homage (if somewhat mediocre).\n2.) Graphics.  It's pretty.  All I can really say about it.\n\nCons:\n1.) Crap controls.  Flying the Manta (the game's version of a VTOL fighter) is a crap-shoot.  Not very intuitive and a pain to work properly.\n2.) Instanced islands.  The original game could "render" all islands and their inhabitants all at once.  This version only simulates each island until you get into radar range.  One of my favorite tactics from before was flying a Manta with a long range communications pod to an island before actually approaching it with my carrier.  This game can't do that\n3.) Clunky FPS mode.  It looks like the FPS mode was added as a narrative tool than a gameplay item.  It comes off as odd, unwieldy, and ultimately a useless feature.\n4.) Odd AI.  'nuff said.  It behaves oddly at best and crap at worst.","March 1, 2015","false","115.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The walrus pathfinding is still unreliable, although nowhere near as bad as it was at launch.  You'll also spend most of your time flying Mantas, rather than driving Walruses as the Mantas have much greater tactical flexibility; if you're wanting to play a drive-and-shoot game, this may not be a great choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mantas handle well, the islands are fun to crack and the unit loadout and upgrade paths are enjoyable to work with.  There's a certain satisfaction to driving a Walrus around armed with flak cannons simply obliterating anything you can get into your crosshairs.  Choosing whether to arm your mantas with missiles to make your life easier, or rockets for greater firepower, but necessitating greater handling skills (which isn't easy when you're dodging missiles yourself) is a choice worth making and if you make a poor choice, you'll find out quickly (and possibly painfully) enough.\n\nTo do well, you'll have to work out approach and escape routes as often enough you'll find yourself sneaking around a building corner to come face to face with a flak-armed Walrus, having to flee, dropping down to wave-skimming height with Hell's fury erupting around and behind you as you limp back to the carrier to repair and try again.  There's a frisson to these moments that is well worth experiencing.\n\nIs it worth the full asking price of ¬£20?  Maybe not, but it's definitely worth playing, and one run through of the Campaign (linear story) and the Strategy Game (non-linear island hopping campaign) will keep you entertained for a fair few hours.  If you're willing to add mods, that might make the Strategy Game worth playing through a second time, but basically all they'll do is increase the difficulty (and remove some possible exploits) as opposed to introducing anything really new.\n\nThere's a free demo available, so try the game out and work out what price you think the game is worth.  There are plenty of newer games with more bugs and less polish being given far better reviews than this received upon its release.\n\n8/10 - Would fly backwards into trees again.","April 10, 2015","true","59.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the nagging problems of path finding, crashes, etc that everyone has been complaining about are essentially gone.  Now is the time to buy it for great action, strategy, sim fans.

Lots of neat nuances and strategy approaches like taking the hilly rough terrain to get around to a good advantage to take out enemy lasers, or going all the way around the island to get a better tactical approach than the normal front and center.\n\nRead the game manual as well.

Sounds awesome right?  Well... it's not.\n\nTo be fair, I only played it a total of 2 times, but even then I think that was enough to form a verdict:  this game is seriously broken.  Bad voice acting, a paper-thin plot, a vague tutorial, AI that's not even capable of the most basic navigation, only three vehicles to build, and a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-poor excuse for an FPS mode given today's standards (you can't even properly adjust mouse sensitivity!)  Sure, the game looks great and the world you're in is huge, but there's just too much wrong to enjoy any of it.\n\nUntil this game gets some serious patch updates, I can't possibly recommend this to anyone.\n\nUPDATE 6-20-14: This game is still broken as hell.  Yeah, they've patched pathfinding, terrain clipping and some of the dumber AI behavior, but the rest of the game is still abysmal.  The core problem is that the game requires you to heavily rely upon the AI's scripting and for your vehicles to be at least half-way competent at navigation and combat, but they are incapable of handling themselves and will require you to personally assume control in almost every situation.  So in reality, it's not an RTS or even team-based game in any way; it's just you jumping from vehicle to vehicle to avoid getting them killed and fighting every battle for them, or driving them around the more complicated terrain cause they all got stuck.\n\nAvoid this, at all costs, even if it's going for a dollar.

All I know is that this game is worth at least $10, $15 at most.\n\nCampaign is basically just a huge tutorial. The Strategy Game is where it's at. Your carrier is placed on a random island controlled by the U.E.C. (Basically N.A.T.O.) or a neutral island. The enemy carrier is place on a random island controlled by the Asians or a neutral island. And it's off to the races.\n\nEach carrier can hold 4 amphibious assault vehicles and 4 aircraft,  As the game progresses, you'll unlock more tech.\n\nThe idea is to either destroy the enemy Carrier, capture all islands, or both, depending on your setup. What makes the game sweet is that, while a strategy game, you can also control any of your units, including the carrier itself, while still being able to issue orders to other units. It's a hybrid, really, and fairly well done.\n\nAll in all, take it for what it's worth, there's a demo, try it out.","December 28, 2013","true","64.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, during those three hours I learned that the campaign was terrible. I feel that somebody somewhere failed at quality control.  I then switched to the other game type attached to Gaea Mission that is called ‚Äústrategy game‚Äù. A very interesting take on the hybrid-genre of rts/fps that has hardly any notable games. The launching of Manti and Walruses into a beautiful ocean was fun, for a while. You could tell that a lot of effort went into this part of the game. However, it did not live up to my hype. Overall the concept is great but the final product is sad. I have come to the opinion that unfortunately this game was probably a victim of time and money running out.  I cannot recommend this at the price range of $32.99, because you can do much better things at that price range. I purchased the Humblebundle pack which included several other games such as ARMA: II for $6. That should be the price range of this game.\n\nThere are hardly no mods of substance for the game as well. This came as a surprise to me because it seems to be almost a cult like game such as Mount & Blade or ARMA II.\n","January 21, 2014","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Realistically though the RTS portion is broken as even that is pushed to the wayside since you will find less frustration by taking 1 walrus(thats a tank) and playing it manually rather than let the AI do it as it tends to just lemming rush your tank into a firing squad showing its ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to them.\n\nStory - Don't expect much as its quite cliche and the voice acting is not bad but not very good either\n\nGame breaking bugs are something to be considered because in the game you have use the supply barque aka supply ship to resupply your carrier EVEN if you have docked at your supply island where you have all your gear. the problem here inlies with the supply ship which sometimes will glitch and be stuck and no matter what you do to try and trigger it to move again nothing helps.

The gameplay takes damage from necessity of manual control over every unit. Every casualty is a hefty blow to your arsenal, and thus you can't completely commit to the games inbuild AI command mechanics. Taking down an island is very delicate work and fun, but slow and tiresome, because of the almost "chess"-like method you have to take down batterys that cover each over. It gets tiresome though, as you have to do everything manually, and adding a very simple, yet extremely slowdragging resource and manufacturing system of units tests your patience, as you wait for the cargo submarine to reach your current location with that expensive gunship chassis for hard needed air capabilities, which you are too afraid to dip lower than 70% HP, due to the risk of having to wait for an additional 20 minutes for yet another new single critical utility to arrive. The "flow" of units to and on the battlefield is simply too low. Thankfully the AI enemies gladly let you sit around for hours to ready 3 landingcrafts, or more correctly they don't care what ever you do, as they doesn't seem to take any initiative what so ever. This game would benefit strongly from having a coop function, where people controlled different roles in a larger conflict, from strategic down to tactical command. If you like to pick away at a fortified island, costumize every craft(air and ground) and experience an all in all epic feel of BATTLESHIP. Then play it. My bet is, that you just won't bother to see it to the end, or start a second playthrough.","April 9, 2014","false","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was only 4 or 5 years old at the time, so I wasn't able to fully grasp the concept of the game at that time. But I do remember enjoying many hours of Atari gaming with the original Carrier Command. So when I came across Gaea Mission on Steam, I just had to check it out.\n\nThe playable demo did not disappoint. As the commander of a large carrier (hence the name, Carrier Command), it is the player's job to colonise numerous islands scattered within a vast archipelago. These islands can then be used to perform research and production of superior weapons and technologies that can be used to enhance the combat effectiveness of the carrier and support vehicles. Meanwhile, the opponent is doing exactly the same thing. War is inevitable, it's just a matter of how well prepared and equipped you are vs your opponent, when the time comes.\n\nSupport vehicles consist of four aircraft (Manta) and four amphibious vehicles (Walrus). Each can be kitted out with various upgrades such as armour, weapons, sensors etc, some of which are only available for either Manta or Walrus. For example, Capsules enable the player to comandeer islands and can only be fitted to the Walrus. Similarly, the Hook allows the Manta to pick up and transport Walrus vehicles, therefore it can only be fitted to the Manta.\n\nMost computers may be out of their depth trying to run Gaea Mission on maximum settings, but a high-end gaming machine will have no problem. Having tried all the settings however, I can say that the graphics are still very attractive on the lowest setting. Either way, there is so much more depth to this game than I am able to portray with a brief review. So if you're a fan of the RTS genre and/or you've played the original Carrier Command and/or you fancy exploring uninhabited islands and/or you like my review, I highly recommend Gaea Mission.","June 29, 2014","true","71.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You hop from island to island while the enemy does the same.

You will frequently find you cannot leave your troops alone with them getting stuck in the terrain every minute or driving straight into an enemy base and blowing up. The planes will hover above enemies instead of shooting them. Your jeep you just spent a million resources upgrading will ram into buildings and turn into a pacifist, utterly choosing to kill himself rather then attack the enemy. You will find your bots will obey an order for 10 seconds and decide to sit and do absolutely nothing.\n\nI loved the concept of the game and really tried to get into it.

Sounds awesome right?  Well... it's not.\n\nTo be fair, I only played it a total of 2 times, but even then I think that was enough to form a verdict:  this game is seriously broken.  Bad voice acting, a paper-thin plot, a vague tutorial, AI that's not even capable of the most basic navigation, only three vehicles to build, and a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-poor excuse for an FPS mode given today's standards (you can't even properly adjust mouse sensitivity!)  Sure, the game looks great and the world you're in is huge, but there's just too much wrong to enjoy any of it.\n\nUntil this game gets some serious patch updates, I can't possibly recommend this to anyone.\n\nUPDATE 6-20-14: This game is still broken as hell.  Yeah, they've patched pathfinding, terrain clipping and some of the dumber AI behavior, but the rest of the game is still abysmal.  The core problem is that the game requires you to heavily rely upon the AI's scripting and for your vehicles to be at least half-way competent at navigation and combat, but they are incapable of handling themselves and will require you to personally assume control in almost every situation.  So in reality, it's not an RTS or even team-based game in any way; it's just you jumping from vehicle to vehicle to avoid getting them killed and fighting every battle for them, or driving them around the more complicated terrain cause they all got stuck.\n\nAvoid this, at all costs, even if it's going for a dollar.

You stand NO chance because the basic enemy carrier and its vehicles are miles ahead of yours from the start.

Load times are pleasingly short (only good thing), graphics look decent by yesterdays standards and lighting and weather effects are not too demanding so one can say the game wont get any uglier when you turn down high graphics.\n\nThe settings are alright graphics wise, key remapping is standard simulator stuff with reminders of what key functions will be overwritten so it is best to keep the standard controls on. MOUSE settings are atrocious but at least you can fiddle with horizontal and vertical sensitivity which is good to compensate for the forever accelerated mouse view.\n\nBiggest thing against this simulator is the fact that it is far from a simulator. It just dumbs down anything you know from ARMA and makes it controllable with a gamepad (hurr durr thats why theres an extra gamepad settings menu). The squad selection is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and requires you to HOLD Ctrl + 2 trough 9 to select specifically those units which will get orders. Otherwise EVERY unit will receive the quick command orders from the circle selector which you activate with the Space key... oh yeah NO JUMPING, NEVER! This also means, no loopings, dodging or any other stuff you can perform in ANY real simulator be it on foot, in a vehicle or aircraft... HOORAY for Bohemia stooping to these caveman standards of gameplay.\n\nTo go about your business you equip your units with gear that gets unlocked during campaign or randomly after taking an island ... that's right. You do not control the building process on any of your islands except what special purpose it should focus on (ressources, manufacturing, defence and one single central stockpile island or the island which will  spawn anything you put into production queue)\nDefence function is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•T since it gives you only a few more hours before a well equipped enemy carrier cleans house.\n\nBTT: You set waypoints and wait for the brainded AI to steer your units on automatically chosen paths in a single formation which is always a line / convoy... another dumbed down feature but it is probably better because pathfinding is  a real ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! Sometimes you forget to put the command into execute mode and suddenly realize that your spearhead attack unit is alone against a whole base. Autoaim is strong in this game (because its the future ... oh no because it is Bohemia and they cannot ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing program merciful AI if their life depended on it... EVERYTHING has AUTOAIM except the player controlled unit.\n\nYou have to LOOK at the target, check if the reticle is YELLOW (wtf y u no red?) and select the ATTACK order from the cricle menu AND press E for execute... then you watch how awkwardly misplaced gunfire does magical one hit kills or the laser beams get bent in a weird way around your cockpit and magically do damage.\n\nThe biggest GRIPE I have with the weapons is that they are pretty useless even if you have the superior guns. The AI is too dumb to attack from afar (no comparison to ARMA Tank crews) and the early AA weapons suck ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because the swarm of bullets you keep spewing is 1 pixel OFF so the target just laughs and keeps dodging and attacking you.\n\nThe balancing is overall ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!\n\nWhile on foot in the campaign you can take a lot of shots from enemy droids and infantry but piloting a vehicle or aircraft those droids become a real pain unless you manage to take em out from afar or slam into them. A small group can easily bring down half if not more armor depending on their weapons.\n\nHEAT turrets... oh god why!? There is a fire and forget weapon for almost anything. HEAT slugs can oneshot any light armored tank and the AUTOAIM can lead to your whole platoon to be wiped by a SINGLE UNIT! This means most of the time you will have to reload a save (if you saved at all or restart the island since you wont get reinforcements in time to continue where you left off.\n\nYour carrier is equipped with a front turret that is made out of the weakest armor in the game. One hit from another plasma turret will wipe it out and the reconstruction takes a LOT of time.\n\nThe enemy carrier can OUTRUN your aircrafts... thats right. The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• naval units in this game are as fast as a VTOL and once they are out of radar range THEY MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR -.-\n\nBringing down the enemy carrier is ridiculous. You'll go trough most of your turret ammunition, your idiotic bots can't replenish ammo while the carrier is moving since the pathfinding is TOO DUMB TO LAND on a moving ship (but manually you can do it one by one while flying just above the carrier bay doors)\n\nBasically what you do is switch from map to first person or third person camera behind a turret all thetime.\nTo take out turrets you switch to manual control, to kill anything up close you switch back to map and do the trategy game thing (select units then click target) ALL the while the CURSOR moves like it has parkinson disease making you feel like the game runs on 10 FPS ... it is the pinacle of awkward having to manually select everything with mouse acceleration and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cursor design that (3 times bigger than the unit you want to select (TO APPEAL TO the console RTS crowd ... WTF BOHEMIA?)\n\nTL;DR\nGAME IS PLAYABLE but at the same time a HUGE UNFULLFILING TIME WASTING EXPERIENCE thanks to the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•iest simulator controls ever from the bunch who specialized in making military and squad sims ...\nThey should be ashamed of themselves for wasting this games potential. It could be much less frustrating.","March 17, 2015","false","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At times the lighting effects are blinding when the game time is around dusk or dawn on some islands.\n\nGameplay - The FPS part of the game is good and nothing amazing but as for the RTS portion which comprises most of the game oh god its fun when the AI doesn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. Realistically though the RTS portion is broken as even that is pushed to the wayside since you will find less frustration by taking 1 walrus(thats a tank) and playing it manually rather than let the AI do it as it tends to just lemming rush your tank into a firing squad showing its ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to them.\n\nStory - Don't expect much as its quite cliche and the voice acting is not bad but not very good either\n\nGame breaking bugs are something to be considered because in the game you have use the supply barque aka supply ship to resupply your carrier EVEN if you have docked at your supply island where you have all your gear. the problem here inlies with the supply ship which sometimes will glitch and be stuck and no matter what you do to try and trigger it to move again nothing helps. Only way to fix it is by loading an earlier save or starting a new game.\n\n\n\nOverall was a great idea but due to the horrendous AI and the Supply Barque game breaking bug this game is impossible to enjoy.","January 21, 2014","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The remake of the venerable Carrier Command was eagerly anticipated by me, but the reviews put me off. ¬£3 from Steam though in a sale? A must. So I bit.\n\nSure enough the basic game play is the same but the graphics have been massively updated as you would expect. The game is deeper, and the pathfinding problems are mostly dealt with now. Most problems have been well described by other reviewers.\n\nBut.\n\nNo one has mentioned what happens if your carrier deliberately or accidentally ends up near the enemies carrier.\n\nI`ll tell you.\n\nYou get stuffed. You stand NO chance because the basic enemy carrier and its vehicles are miles ahead of yours from the start. I have not managed to get more than 1/4 way through a strategy game without this happening. So here`s the trick - do not attack the enemy carrier until you have a fully tooled up carrier of your own.\n\nAlso it`s slow burn. That`s normally OK with me but this is SLOWWWWWWWWWWWW and there`s no way to speed it up. If you don`t like slow burn, don`t buy this\n\nI wanted to like this, and at first could not recommend it. Not even for ¬£3. But after playing a couple of games and WINNING one I can now say it`s good.

This new reboot of the game isn't bad, though it has some very frustrating aspects.  The controls can be very jumpy, leading to some really irritating gameplay.  Feels more like you're fighting with the mouse to aim where you want than enjoying a game.  They decided to add some first person shooter missions to the game, which I could *really* have done without, as they're not very well done.  Overall, it's not a bad game, and it's nice to have the updated graphics and everything over the original.  Given a choice, though, I'd probably go back and play the original on my Amiga.\n\nUpdate: June 2015.  While my old video card wasn't that bad, I upgraded video cards and the game is now much more playable than it was before.  Gameplay is much smoother, and I haven't had the feeling that I'm fighting the interface as much as I used to.  I still don't really enjoy the "sort of fps" portions of the game, but they are also a bit better with smoother graphics.

Different situations outside your control that involves it.  This is why there is no jump and not the best shooter expereince.\n\nA true gamer will appreciate this because so many games would rather exclude rather than include this sort of different point of view.\n\nA true gamer will yell at friendly AI, but recongize hey there has been worse.  Basically I must say you get the hang of the bad AI of your guys in ways that make you surprisingly effective.   Chiefly... if you do not set them to travel to specfic places individually then ones following you who are getting shot ... may just stop and take it till they die..  They honestly panic and dont know what to do, as if there was some evasive function they attempted to program in, but it is incomplete.\n\nThe badguys however are no so smart that you should be losing forever.. You can leanr how to group attack... use one unit at a time to attack keeping the others back a ways ... little lessons on how to control this really awesome game that i dare another game do better.","May 16","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Story is ok, Graphics are nice, very nice concept, But there are little things that will constantly annoy you. The biggest issue is the AI pathfinder Ive muttiple times where I head off somewhere and a few minutes later I look to find my other units not around me. There all in a massive crash that takes half of there health away and the only way to fix it is to take manual control of the vehicles to clean it up. I have searched the forums constantly and there is no patch in sight. Another issue I have is that everything takes forever. There is a real world time aspect like something on a free to play game where you need to wait in real time for something to happen. Supply ships that go to the carrier can take a while and when the carrier is out of fuel it is the worst.  At the moment I don't recommend this game.","June 6, 2015","false","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
