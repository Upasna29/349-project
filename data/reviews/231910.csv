It was the early 90's remake, but obviously this isn't that version (which you can pick up on GOG by the by if you're interested).\n\nIt's a short but enjoyable game. There are no dead ends in this game, but you can die, although it's relativly cheap, but funny.\n\nThe funniest moments in this game are when you just use certain things on other things. For example, use the zipper icon on ANYTHING you can find. It will draw hilarious lines from the also very funny Narrator.\n\nHowever there is some negative here and there. For starters, this game loves to let you know that it got Kickstarted, Alot.\nAlso the humor can be hollow at some points (I'm looking at you Comedian at the Casino, you're not funny.) The game also adds some things that feel kinda unnecesary and pads it out.\n\nReguardless, if you want a funny remake that knows the best kind of humor is juvenile, then I'd grab it.\n\nOtherwise I would just go play the original, or something else.","November 25, 2013","true","12.4"," 65 of 74 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","65","74","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/231910/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Leisure Suit Larry is a point and click adventure game which was initially released in 1987. It was originally written for DOS and Apple, before being ported to the likes of Amiga and Atari.  In mid 2013, Leisure Suit Larry would get a remastered released which was funded by KickStarter.\n\nI had never played the original, so was going into this game with no knowledge as to what I was getting into. As with all point and click adventure games, we have a series of puzzles, some of which make no sense what so ever, whilst others are pretty straight forward. The "world" in which you play has a number of different locations to explore, such as a bar, casino, a love chapel and discos.  You are able to travel between all of the locations using a taxi service which costs money.\n\nA lot of progression in this game is based off how much money you have, and whether you are able to get past "pay walls" such as buying gifts for your lady friends. You are able to generate more funds by playing Blackjack in the casino. If you by any chance run completely out of money, like I did one on occasion, you may well find your self stumped with what to do, but if you find the local bum, they will spare you a bit of loose change ironically.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry is a very nice looking game. All of the scenes are well illustrated, and the cartoon style is one of my favorites to look at. There isn't really anything special to say about the graphics, given that it is all 2D though.\n\nWithout wanting to spoil too much of the plot, and for those who haven't played the original, Leisure Suit Larry is based around a 40 year old virgin who sells software for a living. He goes on vacation to Lost Wages, which is a paraody of Las Vegas, to try and find the lose of his life - obviously he hits a few bumps in the road along the way, but the story ends sufficiently well, and does a good job of tying up loose ends.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry is fully voice acted; I absolutely think voice acting is a must in any point and click adventure game now. I probably wouldn't of enjoyed the plot as much as I did if I had to read the text myself. The comical voices and accents here really make it so much better. There are also plenty of comical sound effects too; this game is a walking innuendo joke, be warned.\n\nLike I said above, Leisure Suit Larry offers a handful of puzzles that can be worked out quite easily, whilst others forced me to look up online what to do to progress. That is probably down to my ineptness with point and click games though - The puzzles range from creating a new perfume for a potential lover, right the way to finding a way to marry someone after one hour after meeting them...some really whacky ideas.\n\nThe game world is very well designed. If there is something that looks interesting, you can probably click on it and get some form of interaction out of either Larry or the narrator. This gives plenty of opportunity to let you explore each scene to your hearts content. All of the other characters in the game also offer some sort of interaction, whether it be a simple conversation or something else.\n\nA playthrough from beginning to end took me just over two hours to complete, this was with the aid of a guide so bear that in mind - I also don't really see there being any need to replay the game once you have finished it, as there is very little replay-ability or different ways to complete the game. The game does offer a large amount of achievements, of which I only managed to get 19 out of 40 from a full story run, and I didn't go looking for them either.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry runs extremely well on my rig, it allows you to play in resolutions up to 4k and runs at a sky high frame rate all the time - I doubt any modern day PC would struggle to run this game.\n\nTo conclude, Leisure Suit Larry is a well put together experience, with a lot of comical value, however the price of £14,99 is a lot considering the game is not even 3 hours long. I would only recommend people pick up Leisure Suit Larry when its on sale for more than 50% off so you get your moneys worth. Players of the original may want to skip it too, since it also offers no new story elements, it just improves the technical side of things in every degree.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqHu5VoiIg\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The gameplay in this 'Reloaded' version is essentially the same, with updated graphics, interface & full voice/audio support.\n\nBeing from an earlier generation, the gameplay can feel basic by modern standards and there is no real direction from a story perspective to guide you either. You only know that you need to guide Larry (the 40yr old virgin) to find love. With limited guidance, the ability to visit any of the locations in any order & a lot of abstract puzzles to solve LSL can leave you scratching your head for long periods.\n\nSimplicity aside, LSL is full of personality. It's a small point-n-click adventure, but each of the 5 main locations is filled with things to distract & amuse you. This is where the real charm of LSL comes through; if you rush through the plot you miss much of what the game has to offer. Achievements have been well utilised too to encourage exploration of 'Lost Wages' . Many are only obtainable by exploring the many these hidden 'side quest' dialog click-points or finding the Easter Eggs around the game world. Some will even need a second play-through.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable elements of LSL is the amazing voice acting! The highlight undoubtably being the narrator. Besides having an awesome voice & a good dose of sarcasm, he is ongoingly degrading to Larry with some genuinely funny dialog. I just wanted to click everything just to hear whatever perverted thing the narrator or Larry might say next! The dialog & the entire game on the whole is full of sleezy sexual innuendo, political incorrectness, stereotypical 'one-dimensional' characters & toilet humor. If you don't find these sort of things funny then you probably wont like LSL.\n\nGraphics look good, but the animations are a bit average. Perhaps they are meant to be a bit retro in design (keeping to the original on purpose), but I would have liked to see them more detailed. Also there are a number of audio sections mentioning an 'action' you do that has no animation at all. Would have loved to see (not just hear) these in the Reloaded version. UI is good enough, but take the tutorial! Also, I would have liked to see controllers supported for big screen play in the lounge room & an auto-save function.\n\nAs a kid playing LSL back in the day, it aways used to remind me of a naughty, very risqué game I needed to hide from my parents. Now it seems tame, more an ongoing tease filled with a lot of cheap, tasteless one-liners & gags. Despite my change in perspectives, the core essence of the game remains fun & true to the original cult classic.\n\nI find my fond memories renewed on playing through the Reloaded version, all these years on!\n\nLeisure Suit Larry remains a true gem of an adventure game!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","August 29, 2014","true","14.8"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","37","40","0","4"

(Tiers of Joy was really good!) Not much has been changed that wasn't necessary. The game controls solidly and the voice-acting is excellent. Timer has been removed, meaning you can play at a fair pace without the rush.\n\nCONS: The graphics are a bit weak. Animation is not very high quality. Some people had problems with the dated/US-based questions at the beginning. Some jokes don't land, though the cheese factor is sometimes intentional.\n\nWORTH: I find this remake to be worth full price due to nostalgia, though others may not agree due to the widespread availability of these games. If this is not your first round with Larry, you may want to consider getting it on sale, as a fair amount of the charm of it returning will be lost on you.\n\nOVERALL:  A great remaster of a classic  Point and click adventure game.

I was willing to end it all there but then one night, while I was sleeping, Larry Laffer came to me in a dream and he told me "It is okay my child, I can show you the way"\nAnd then, at that very moment, my PC roared to life and then on my monitor was none other than Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards! "This is what Larry was telling me about!" I told myself and then, at that point, I was never the same. The true me awoke. For days I trained, learning the moves, the pick up lines, the style. I had to give up my personal routine in order to learn the secrets of the Louge Lizard. On the last day of training, Larry put his hand on my shoulder and said "You're ready to fufill your destiny"\n\nThe next day I went into college in my very leisure suit, armed with the knowledge that Larry taught me. And there, at the door was the girl who I was dreaming about for months. With my swagger I slided up to her, moving and grooving and she looked at me with an intrigued look in her eyes. I moved my glasses down my nose, looked her straight in the eyes and said these words:\n\n"Hey baby, you must be tired, running around in my mind all day"\n\nI finished with a wink and a smile and without warning the entire campus was flooded with female pleasure juice. Neckbeards, weebs and bronies were trying to find safe haven in this river of sexual erruption. And amongst it all was me, drowning in so much ♥♥♥♥♥ you needed to call the lifeguard.\n\nThank you Larry.

It's perverted to the point of stupidity, and that is what makes it so glorious.  It is a point-and-click adventure with only the basic aspects you would expect to find from such a game, and not much more. But the simplicity is fitting as the game's defining feature isn't the gameplay but rather the ridiculousness of the narrative.\n\nYou can speedrun what you need to do to beat the game in about 20 minutes, but that’s not how you are meant to enjoy it.  There are little quips and perverted asides hidden within the hundreds of hotspots scattered throughout the game, each of which having about a dozen ways to interact with them and each combination of interaction producing different dialogue.\n\nAs I alluded to, the actual gameplay is quite minimal. The “puzzles” are pretty simple and nothing requires any extremely nonsensical actions that one would never think of without a walkthrough… mostly. And what you actually need to do to beat the game isn’t much, but there is a decent sized world to explore for auxiliary fun or achievements.\n\nIf you are easily offended then this game is probably not suited for you.  Almost all the humor is sexual, perverse, and low brow in tone. If that kind of thing would bother you, you should turn back now.\n\nBut, if you like point-and-click adventure games, and can get in the mood for a childishly low brow, purposefully offensive, and pretty humorous experience: then I highly recommend you check this game out.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 15, 2014","true","8.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","2"

Never, ever, ever. Then it was suprise gifted to me by a sweet friend and it was in my library. It sat there. For all my concerns about this game actually dirtying my library, the thought to delete it or hide it never occurred to me. Then I decided. I am the Pointnclickster. I have to play this. Like it or not, this is a big part of gaming history. So one night-one late late late night- I got loaded on caffeine and chocolate and decided to try it out. The results, for me, were very suprising.\n\n(Bless you if you are still reading) It was fun. It was actually very fun, and extremely funny. I really tried to take the high road in this game, but it really doesn't exist. I'm getting ahead of myself. First of all, I love the look of this game. The bright colors and the cartoony world really spoke to me in a way that said that for all of its low humor, it was just a fun game for adults. Yeah, men probably get a lot more out of it, but I had a lot of fun too. The narrarator is just hilarious. His incites about the world that Larry has been dropped into and Larry himself are hilarious. Seriously, I loved the dialogue in this game. It may be low brow but it fits.\n\nDo I even have to go into what this game is about? Well, apparently getting laid in a parody of Las Vegas isn't always that easy. Watching Larry try and find love (thats what I am choosing to call it) is hilarious. He tries so hard, and it usually ends so badly.\n\nNow the puzzles can be a bit of a pain. This game calls for exploration and really immersing yourself in this world. Sometimes I was just at a loss at how to advance, and it made the game feel tedious. I hated the fact that you constanly have to watch your wallet and take time to gamble in order to continue in the game. I love minigames but the need to constanly play black jack felt like filler.\n\nApart from the snarky dialogue, the other things I really loved were all the different achievements that you can get. You can do a lot in this game, and while it is possible to do it all in one sitting, one would probably have to play it more than once or load a save file. I also liked the fact that even though Larry can die in multiple ways, they are really funny, and it doesn't set you back.\n\nFor all of its low brow humor and sexual innuendo, it is very quick to remind the player that it is just a game. As morally narrow as I am, I really enjoyed this game. To say the least, it broadened my horizons. This is a fun game for adults to enjoy after midnight.\n\n","April 27","true","5.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","4"

I don't remember the original game to be that short or is my memory playing tricks on me? But if you're the kind of guy who think the price tag should reflect the time you will spend playing then this game will feel like a rip-off. It's short, it's really really short.

This is your goal, and it remains constant throughout the game. The world and story are ripe with colorful commentary, self deprecating humor, and loads of adult humor that bears an air of sophistication slightly above your run of the mill flatulent anecdote. While you control Larry through the adventure, he is actually only half of the ever present characters, the other being the deliciously sardonic and condescending narrator who finds no shortage of ways to put you down, even when you are doing well.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nA far cry from the original EGA graphics of it's originator, the graphics manage to successfully capture the cartoonish nature of the world in which Larry inhabits. While nothing is groundbreaking, and the animation loops are very noticeable, you'll never be left wondering what it is you are looking at or feel the need to desperately click on every tiny pixel hoping it's something you missed.\n\nSOUND:\n\nWhile there's no music to speak of beyond a title screen, the ambience of the environments is rather basic and simple enough to convey the intended atmosphere. The voice acting ranges from excellent to subpar, the voices of Larry and the Narrator are done very well and you will rarely tire of hearing them (which is a good thing, they compromise 90% of the game's dialogue), the other characters however bring no real presence to their voices and feels like the casting call stayed within the offices if you catch my meaning.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nTrue blue classic point and click magic! You are presented with a variety of interactions you can perform including looking, touching, sniffing/licking, exposing (unzipping your trousers), talking, walking, and using whatever object from your inventory you had selected. The game is ripe with entertaining and colorful commentary which often makes the quickest path not always the preferable one as hearing the narration on the variety of actions you can perfom is half the fun.\n\nIn addition to standard point-and-click fare, the game uses money as a commodity, and you will need quite a bit to solve certain puzzles, buy certain items, and to transition between areas as each requires a cab ride. You can pad your income by playing slot machines or blackjack machines, or if you completely run out of money a friendly bum spots you a $10. These games are entirely luck driven but nothing discourages you from save scumming your way through it and simply reloading until you win enough to not have to worry about it anymore.\n\nOne blessing is that unlike some point and click games of yesteryear, this game is devoid of any dead ends or no win scenarios, you may get stuck for awhile, but no puzzle will ever force you to have to start over.\n\nCHALLENGE/LENGTH:\n\nFor anyone who has played a point and click adventure game before, they will feel right at home, even without the short tutorial gives you all you need to know about how to play the game. For beginners to the genre the game could prove to be a bit more challenging and lengthy but for veterans you can expect to breeze through. The game isn't very long, and the puzzles tend to be on the easy side once you have the proper equipment at least. On average the game should last you about 5 - 10 hours depending on how stumped certain puzzles make you.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nIf you enjoy adult risque humor that possesses a bit of wit and point and click adventure games I can see no reason not to play this game. It is short but is packed with entertainment and humor. If nothing else at least pick it up on sale!","February 21","true","6.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"

Also I missed Larry Laffer. Yes we grow up, it doesn't sound as dirty as it used to be, but it is still same Larry. I recommend this game for only old school gamers. I have some complaints, but at the end of the game, I had a stupid smile in my face because of all the good memories that I made while playing this game for the first time.\n\nWhat is good about this game you say? First is graphics. They are really smooth and really funny to set the mood of the game. It is a good feeling to see the old characters in this newly designed looks. It is a really colorful and perverted city. Second is the humor of course. Because it is Larry there are lots of +18 jokes and references but I didn't find them too dirty. They are fun. The sound is also great. Larry has the same voice as Larry 7 and most of the cast fit perfectly (I should say I am a little dissappointed for the change of old narrator, but his one is not bad). Music is classical Jazz and suit the tone. Gameplay is old school, if you are familiar with the old Sierra games, it won't take too much time to get used to it. Other then that it is almost same game. And adding the achievements is a good call I think.\n\nSo what do I don't like about it you say? Game is short. I know it is the same game, but I expected a little more. I know it is too much to ask but may be making it more than just the first game could be a better. There are small bugs that bugs you sometimes (like a graphic glitch or froze) but it is extremely rare. Money thing is an issue of course, you have to gamble to pay for taxi and stuff, it is unnecassary and dumb I think. It would be great if they add a cheat or something to make it easier and then joke about it may be? And for new gamers, some of jokes are old. Questionnaire in the begining is totally unnecassary. There are some fun in there but making it a requirement is bad. And I think it is a little expensive for the experience it offers.\n\nIn the end it is an old game with a plastic surgery. If you know who Larry is and why he is funny. This is a game for you. If you are not that old, you can try it, but don't take it so serious. And for the developers, please make other games reloaded too..","December 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

From beginning to end I have enjoyed ♥♥♥♥ing hookers, Dancing with Fawn & then getting cheated out of $200, Talking to the girl who is obsessed with perfume (I had to abuse a whale in the process), Talking to a sexy female security guard who later rejects me because she has a boyfriend & finally Eve is the cherry on top which Larry wins his true love I think (Sorry for the spoilers but I want to be very accurate since I enjoyed this remake a lot, I never played the original 80s version of this game but I already had a blast from this remake).\n\nPros:\n\n1. Perverted Humor (The comedian from the Hotel's Cabaret doesn't count)\n\n2. Sexy girls well except for the hooker\n\n3. Hilarious Narrator (I heard that the original narrator from the 80s version of the 1st Larry game is better but I still liked the narrator from the Reloaded version)\n\n4. Good puzzle solving\n\n5. Hilarious Deaths\n\n6. Good Art\n\n7. A few references like for example an arcade machine called Angry Broads (Doesn't that remind you of a popular bunch of birds?)\n\n8. Good Music\n\n9. Good Voice Acting\n\n10. Great Tutorial (Al Lowe Made Himself A Cameo In this Game)\n\n11. This Short Game Has A Lot Of Replayability If You Want To Gain Some Achievements\n\nCons:\n\n1. The game likes to talk about Kickstarter a lot (I understand it got a lot of support but don't remind me all the time I get it)\n\n2. The gambling in this game kinda annoys me since the slot machines are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Black Jack is a cold ♥♥♥♥♥ too)\n\nOverall If you want some dirty humor in your games then let Larry Laffer teach you how to score girls (I'm kidding don't take his advice).","December 9, 2013","true","7.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Graphically it's charming for the most part, despite a conflict of styles when talking to people close-up, and the soundtrack - bloodless lounge jazz though it may be - is the highlight.  It fails in a couple of major ways, though.\n\nSierra games from the era of the original were in a bit of a transitional stage from text adventures to what we'd think of as a point-and-click nowadays.  The remake replicates the awkwardness of this, but goes a stage further by adding to it: you now have three ways to access your various options, be it walking or picking things up.  Yes, you actually have to cycle to walking as an action, like the 'good' old days.  The purpose of a remake is surely to streamline and remove the clunkiness of this kind of thing, but this seems to be more about recreation rather than improvement.\n\nAnother thing adventure games of this era were known for was insta-death on making a mistake.  This is gone, you'll always be resurrected at the time before you made a particular mistake, but in its place is a weird reliance on money and gambling.  You can literally - and I'm using literally in the correct sense here - get completely stuck and not be able to finish this game without doing a dance of saving and reloading as you play slot machines, as there is no way to move around the map without paying to do so.  If you go broke you will tediously have to build your way back up from $10, but nobody does that as they reload when they lose.  Broken game mechanics right there.\n\nOn top of this...  well, it's Leisure Suit Larry.  Never as funny or as naughty as it thought it was, just that pub bore who has one joke and a mean streak that becomes more apparent the more you talk to him.  Play it for the nostalgia maybe, but then move on.","August 18, 2014","false","3.7"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","1"

A few things have been changed and they added a whole new girl to go after extending the game length. The graphics fit the game perfectly and the voice acting and narration is great. If you ever played the original and enjoyed it, you should at least check this game out for the nostalgia factor alone. Never did I think I would be playing a lesiure suit larry game on steam. The humor is hit or miss, however you play the game to see what crazy antics the larry gets himself in.\n\nThe achievements are pretty creative for an adventure game and I found it enjoyable trying to get all of them. Their is one that is a huge pain though.\n\nThe Bad:\nIt stays faithful to the original which means all the bad points come with it. Puzzles don't make a whole lot of sense and may require a walkthrough to help you. The biggest flaw is that you have to gamble in order to get money so you can travel and complete the game. This causes you to save/load while gambling over and over again until you have enough funds. Not fun at all.\n\nThe one achievement that is a pain requires you to hit a jackpot in the slots.\n\nConclusion\n\nI bought it just for the nostalgia factor alone and I am not disappointed at all. I wouldn't pay full price though. If you never played a Leisure Suit Larry game, maybe now is a good time to do so so you can see what games were like back then (ignoring the graphical updates of course).","September 11, 2014","true","5.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's humorous, punny, and dirty. The narrator is fantastic, and reminds me of the wit from the stanley parable. I have not played the original, but I love this game. There are a few moments where you might get stuck, I did and used a walkthrough, but it wasn't too hard. ALSO, if you don't usually have patience in games, I wouldn't get this. To really immerse yourself in the story and the humor, you have to click on A LOT of stuff. I have never played a point and click with this much dialogue on random items and scenery. I liked it, but if you are bothered by that sort of thing it might ruin it for you. Overall I thought this was a fantastic game.

It can at times leave you stumped which is why i reccommend you save often and save each time you gamble and gamble alot. Yet gambling is not the entirety of the game this is something to experiance rather than just hear a rambling of it. If you were ever a fan of Larry than get this game, but if you're unsure of who Larry is or not a big fan of point and click adventure games i suggest you look elsewhere.

The current remake features modern graphics and introduces voiced dialogue, but other than that, the game stays basically the same. This means that there is a lot of unnecessary repetition, some actions required from you are so far from obvious that you may be stuck forever without a walkthrough, and the game is still laughably short.

The animation is shoddy, telling of a kickstarted game, but the graphics of the characters and backrounds stand out in a colorful manner.\n\nFor the fan who never owned the game or was never a big fan of adventure games, the most you're going to get out of the experience is just clicking everything with the various icons and watching the amusing reactions since, gameplay wise, there isn't much to it.\n\nIn summary, great for adventure gaming fans.

But it's pretty funny at times, especially thanks to the narrator.  Besides, supporting this game may be the only way to get a new LSL game that has Al Lowe attached to it, and since the later LSLs were varying degrees of fun and/or classic, a new LSL from Al Lowe is something I'd like to see.","July 5, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a fact of life when dealing with a Larry game, so it won't be your cup of tea otherwise.\n\nPositives:\n\nIt's very densely packed with jokes. Pretty much every time you look, smell, touch, "zipper" a random background objects, you get at least even odds of a unique comical reaction. And the jokes... well, they're not terrible, and given the sheer density, you get at least few funny ones in every room.\n\nThe voice acting is perfectly adequate. Even the narrator emphasizes the jokes rather than distracts from them, so I often let him finish (something I almost never do once I'm done with the subtitles)\n\nThe translation is... adequate, as far as I can see. Not brilliant, but adequate, with attempts to find a suitable replacement for anything culturally specific. You can probably give this to friends that don't really speak English but are into adventure games.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe game is hella short. You probably won't be playing for the plot, but even if you exhaust every possible action on every object, you'll still only get a few hours out of the game.\n\nThe remake is kinda pointless. LSL 2 and 3  were begging for a remake from the ground up (http://www.richardcobbett.com/codex/therichardperspective/leisure-suit-larry-2-preloaded)  but LSL1 was already remade once. The voice acting doesn't contribute that much, and the art style...\n\nThe art style isn't a huge improvement, nor is the opportunity taken to add a lot of jokes. Larry and the settings don't look that much better than they did in 1991. Larry seems like a character destined for some slapstick hijinks, but (LSL7 aside) the jokes were/are almost in the form of smug replies and innuendo rather than anything that is actually portrayed onscreen.\n\nMost of the stupid puzzle solutions remain intact from the 1987 original (!). There aren't even any hints. One inexplicably mind boggling decision - hiding the entrance to a new room that's necessary to your progress ofscreen, with absolutely no hints that such a room exists until you blunder into the entrance / read a faq.\n\nFor some reason, the one puzzle that was added to the remake involves a LOT of animal cruelty. Baffling to say the least - particularly given that Larry was a fairly decent chap by adventure game protagonist standards, despite his hornball antiques.","December 2, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since Larry 1 also got a revamp, this game actually borrows heavily more from the first Larry 1 remake than the original game. Most noticably, the interior of the casino has the double helix elevator that was in the remake as well as alot of the exterior look to Lefty's was also lifted from it. However, even if you've played all three previous versions of this game, alot of the puzzles are updated or changed so as to keep the game fresh.\n\nVoice acting was actually pretty good. Some old Sierra alums came along to voice some of the characters, which is a nice audio easter egg.\n\nOverall, very fun for a few hours, and a few more playthroughs to unlock all the achievements.","December 20, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played the original in the eighties, the remake in the nineties, and now this - The second remake. Was this version entirely necessary? Maybe not, but here's hoping we'll eventually get a brand new Larry adventure in its wake.\n\nI mean, Larry 1: Reloaded clings perhaps a little bit too hard to the past. Sure, they took out perma-death, but they left the supremely annoying gambling mechanic virtually untouched. Didn't like it in the original; Hate it with a passion now. Otherwise the game is serviceable, a dose of nostalgia just like the donators ordered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/231910/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","You ever feel like you play something, you finish it, and you think "That's almost three hours of my life that I could have done something useful with, like learn to lead a kazoo symphony or teach a turtle to tap-dance"? Welcome to what I'm currently experiencing after playing the latest game knocked off my backlog, "Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded".\n\nYou get to play as Larry Laffer, who pulled off the 'forty-year-old-virgin' bit years before Steve Carell ever tried it. He's come to the city of Lost Wages in order to fulfill one of his life's goals- to find true love (even if it's just for a night). The airline lost his luggage, he's got no hotel reservations, and $94 and a squirter of breath spray to his name... and the game drops you off in front of a bar and tells you to "have at it". Things kind of go downhill from there.\n\nThe interface... well, it was all right. I'm not a fan of the whole "switch icons to do different actions" bit, but at least it was rather easy to do so- the actions are available from the top of the screen, or you can cycle through them with the right mouse button. Each one makes Larry do something different- move, look, use, use item, taste, even... unzip.\n\nYeah. It does exactly what you think it does.\n\nThe game just throws you into the deep end- without any inkling of what you have to do, or what you can use, or what you can really interact with. Maybe I'm just spoiled by recent games, but hotspots are actually useful so you don't get frustrated by trying to click on everything or use everything with everything. I lasted for forty-five minutes last night before I just gave up and went searching for a walkthrough because I got so frustrated at not knowing where to go or what to do. Granted, I was running on caffeine fumes and gummy candy at that point, but... at least give the player a general idea of what they have to do next, yeah?\n\nThe graphics... well, they're nothing really special. They look all right, but you're not going to see anything you shouldn't. Apparently they wanted to keep the spirit of the original alive- but in all honesty, the game could have used a better update. The voice acting isn't really all that much to write home about- they did get some of the original cast to come back and voice characters, but... honestly... I've heard better.\n\nI have two pretty major gripes with this game: the first is the grinding. You're going to need a good bit of cash to proceed through the game- and the only way you're going to get that much cash is to play blackjack. Literally a third of my playtime on this game is grinding and save-scumming blackjack to build up enough cash. One of the goals about a third of the way through the game is to break the bank at the casino- by winning more than $10K total and running the blackjack machine out of cash. There are few things less fun than grinding away at a crappy blackjack game because it's the only way to get more cash. (I may be personally biased- I don't exactly care for blackjack. I'm more of a flashy-lights slot machine kind of guy). It can take you forever and ever and ever to get to that point in time.\n\nThe second thing... is the humor. Good grief. To put it simply, this is the kind of game that aims squarely for the "teen sex comedy" bit and faceplants directly into it. It's juvenile, it's rather childish, and to put it honestly, I was more going "...really?" than I was going "LOL!". There are a lot of tasteless jokes here, and yes, the game will go to the bottom of the barrel over and over again to try to be funny. This is the kind of stuff that might be funny when you're about sixteen or so; when you're in your mid-thirties, jokes like this just make you wonder why in the blazes you're subjecting yourself to things like this. There are people out there who might give it a pass simply because it's from 1987; in my opinion, it ought to have stayed there.\n\nThe Kickstarter for this game somehow gained over $650K to make this remake of a remake; to be honest, now that Al Lowe has left Replay Games (on apparently less-than-wonderful terms, according to the wiki page), hopefully Replay can focus on something else.\n\nSteam wants twenty Gabucks for this. That sound you hear in the background is my laughter at somebody thinking this is worth twenty bucks. If you must buy this, wait until it gets at least a 75% off sale so you don't risk as much cash. You'll get maybe three or four hours out of this; maybe more if you don't just break down and use a walkthrough like I did (but in all fairness, I was just swimming as fast as I could towards the end so I could legitimately say I beat it).\n\nTL;DR - 1987 called; it wants its games back. 2/10.","March 14","false","2.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

The game hasn't evolved in 20 years.  The crude humor is still exactly that, and while it can be appreciated as such, the game is probably best fit for a teenage or pre-teen audience... and not the adult audience I had assumed it was for when the game was created 20 years ago, before I was "old enough" to be "allowed" to play the game.\n\nTitilation, but no nudity, and mildly goofy.  There's much more risque content readily available.  Again, it doesn't compare well with what was (un)available 20 years ago.  In an age where the Playboy magazine is doing something radically different and NOT include nudes because the times they are a-changing, because of the internet... well, LSL should have sought to do something radically different as well.\n\nI'm not sure it's even worth $2, because even the 60 minutes it took to follow the game through the walkthrough were 60 minutes of my life I wished I had had back.

I kickstarted the game based on reviews of the original - hailed as a filthy, funny sex game, implied to have multiple girls to bang. Instead, it's a super corny, cheesy, completely linear adventure game with only one girl to bed, and she comes out of nowhere and has no personality or connection to Larry. All the more interesting women are completely unattainable. There's also suprisingly little sex (almost none, and no actual nudity) for a game that I always hear hailed as a porn game. It's way more about puns than porn.\n\nThis is super confusing to me, because it's not all that funny. I know humor is subjective and all, but the game really seems to bank on being about sexy stuff and sexy jokes, when it's really like 50% sex puns, 50% loser jokes, and 0% sexy stuff.\n\nI'm sure a lot of this has to do with people being easier to shock in 1987, but it really doesn't hold up well today. I'm frankly boggled that they didn't ramp up the quality for the remake.\n\nIf you have nostalgia for the original, then this is probably a good buy.

Larry was a nerdy geek all his life and eventually became a computer programmer. He now finds himself in Lost Wages, in front of the bar Lefty's, with a bottle of breath spray and $94 dollars in his wallet.\n\nI guess I was around 12 years old when I played the original Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards with my friends and even though we never managed to leave Lefty's, Larry introduced us to new words from the English vocabulary, like "mount". I think we even got our hands on an uncensored version at some point, but in all its EGA resolution glory, I doubt we really noticed any difference.\n\nWhat has changed from the original game? Not surprisingly, there has been a major overhaul of the graphics, sound, music and  there is now fully vocalized audio. There are also new jokes, new puzzles and even some new characters. One of the Kickstarter tiers allowed you to pay to be one of the drinkers at Lefty's, and although this was a great idea to rob someone of $5,000 (yes, that was the actually amount you had to pledge to drink at Lefty's), it introduces an element to the game that just seems shallow and unnecessary. The Kickstarter drinkers should have been replaced with over-the-top fictional characters instead.\n\nThe HD background graphics is beautiful, but the character graphics and animation have a lot to be desired. They seem rushed and most of them, expect for Larry himself, stand so much out from the backgrounds, they look a bit like something I could have drawn myself. This especially goes for the Kickstarter drinkers in the bar. Maybe they had to draw themselves, too, who knows? While we're on the subject of Kickstarter: It permeates too much of this game, Al Lowe even appears at the end, thanking the Kickstarter backers. Get off the set, Al!\n\nMoney is an important aspect of Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded, and the $94 dollars in Larry's wallet won't last you long. To get more money you have to gamble, and thankfully there are slot machines, blackjacks and other mini games everywhere you look. It does, however, become rather tedious to play these games to get money, and you'll find yourself saving and loading quite a lot. To go ahead and build up a solid cash balance at the start of the game is probably a good idea, so that you don't have to back and save/load/gamble time and time again.\n\nMore often than not, understanding what you're supposed to do in the game is far from logical and your play style can easily turn into a click fest, where you try to use the hammer with the squid, the squid with the bungee cord, the bungee cord with the Tabasco sauce and the Tabasco sauce with pretty much every living and inanimate object in the casino, Caesar's Phallus. Although this is not something that is unfamiliar to point-and-click adventures, it's sort of in the name of the genre, it just feels like too much in this case. Clicking on everything will eventually pay off in the end, though, but it just seems so random. This kind of game style might not appeal to people who prefer to play adventure games where logic is in fact something that matters.\n\nBut logic is not what Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded is about. It's about Larry Laffer's crazy adventure and there's nothing logic about it at all. If you laugh at fart jokes, start to drool at the thought of digital honka-honkas and enjoy clicking your mouse a lot, this is a game you should go ahead and buy.\n\nPersonally, having finished the game, I'm left with a feeling that it was 5 hours I probably could have used on something more entertaining. The jokes are OK, I laughed every now and then, but I think I expected more. Maybe the game simply isn't for the adult me. Perhaps I left Larry Laffer behind at some point in life, when I actually grew up? But all that said, it was nice to meet Larry Laffer again and realize that the first time I saw Larry Laffer back when I was 12 should have been a warning sign about become a computer programmer myself.\n\nThis review is also avilable on https://www.vegard.net/.","March 8, 2014","false","5.3"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

I'm sad to report that I hardly noticed Wintory's score, but glad to report that LSL is still hilarious as an adult. It won't go down as one of my favorite games or anything, but it is great for it's intended purpose. A few hours of laughs. Buy on sale.

It captures the feeling of the classics well while removing many of the annoying things about classic Sierra adventure games (like missable objects, pixel hunts and "moon logic" puzzles).  The puzzles are just the right difficulty for me, and Adventure games are NOT my strongest suit.  They might require some "rub this thing against EVERY OTHER THING" trial-and-error... BUT, and this is a huge but, the clever "that doesn't work" messages and easter eggs add humor and enjoyment even to failing to solve the puzzle right away.\n\nThe Bad:  Very short for what you pay (about 5-6 hours of gameplay, if that, even without a walkthrough), little to no replay value.  The amount of self-referential humor is typical for the series but may turn off some users.  The kickstarter references are a bit tactless in my opinion.\n\nIf you like:  Crude humor, classic Sierra adventure games,  sex jokes, classic gaming.\n\nI'd pay:  I paid 19.99 and I felt the game was too short to justify that price, with no replay value.  Get it on steam sale for 5 or under and it's an amazing deal.

Played all the squels too, many times. This is more a review if you played the original and VGA versions.\n\nPros:\nThe graphic got a nice upgrade.\nVoice acting is good.\nNew items.\nNew location.\nSome quests are not identical than the original. You might have to search a bit to solve some, instead of just do the exact same thing, like the original.\nCons:\nLots of stuff and jokes got replaced by something with Kickstarter in it. It's really annoying.\nAnimations sometimes freezes and it's usually when you're getting an achievement.\nThe new kickstarted characters looks a bit out of place with their different styles.\nGood game. I still prefer the VGA version. If it wasn't for all the kickstarter related stuff, it would have been near perfect.","January 4","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played it before. I'm not a big Adventure game guy, but this game wasn't too hard -- even though I did go through the walkthroughs about 4 times whenever I got stuck.\n\nThis game was too short, but it was very enjoyable. I would get this game only if it's on sale; but I would say that it definately gives you a nice relaxing feeling. The jokes aren't that funny any more, but if you grew up in the 80's (and you appreciate corny jokes) , I think it's worth it. It's even worth playing this game over watching the youtube videos, because you can do lots of silly things which other people may not do.","December 27, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the chatty crass cheeky Love It or Hate It narrator (he could grow on you eventually or become the worst part of the game especially if you can't stand endless snark) this is a good and pretty funny adventure game. Fairly balanced difficulty too so it's great for adults that have never played the other games to start here.
