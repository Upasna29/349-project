You have a base to defend yourself in, but during the day you can explore the area around you to find scrap metal (currency) and survivors, and the areas change each day so it's an interesting feature.  My only complaints are the inexplicable lack of multiplayer and the fact that instead of being able to choose your class right off the bat, as you play the game you can find survivors and magically switch between them. Which is... I dunno, just really weird. But again, it's a good 3 dollar buy, if you think you'll like it you probably will. It gets really difficult really fast, so it does take a while to beat. Luckily it saves after every night, so i f you make one big mistake you don't have to go back to the beginning. Also, the soundtrack is really well done, so that's a plus.\n\nI think a sequel will definitely be worth investing in, and if they create multiplayer for this it would be a very fun experience and worth the money. Keeping in mind this was a two man team making a game for $5, I think it's worth supporting, and I would like to see what they can create in the future.","January 10, 2014","true","7.6"," 80 of 110 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","80","110","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/recommended/264730/","DrFrogAddMe","Dr. Frog ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/","500 products in account","Deadly 30’s storyline is essentially 3 very different people, trying to survive in a WWII zombie apocalypse. You start as a rugged american soldier and recrute, or rather, join up with a German Nazi girl and vodka loving Russian. The playing is able to switch from the 3 characters, each with their own weapon skillsets.\n\n\nThe Gameplay revolves around a survive at night and build during the day, but quickly changes to exploring during the day. The 2d game provides 2 directions to go; left and right. once heading in one of those directions you have a chance to fight more docile zombies and collect ammo and scrap, the games currency. When the morning after a wave comes you get a modest amount of scrap to build better walls, fix the walls, buy ammo and guns, upgrade your armour and boots, purchase medkits, boxes and turrets. Scrap can also be acquired by killing zombies and picking them off the round. The farther left or right you go, the more zombies there are, but also more scrap. The world has a wall at the far left and right but at the end there are always chests, shooting these will give the playing more scrap. There are also “Big scrap” On the outer areas of the map. Old cars or tanks that will provide a large scrap reward after a few seconds. You also can then find the other characters and play them once they join you.\n\n\nThe map isn't overly large and is easy to run from your centre base to one side and back before night comes, implying there were no zombies to slow you down. Buying boots helps with the scrap collecting but if you're too far away from the base, surviving at night is almost almost imposable on later rounds.\n\n\nThe tower defence aspect of the game isn't the best of its kind, however after unlocking the turrets in the store and getting all 3 survivors, it becomes much more fun.\n\n\nDeadly 30 has an old-school style of flash game graphics, that being stated, it's not necessarily a bad thing. The animations are a little rough but all in all the game looks pretty good. The AI of the characters you're not playing are a little dumb as they like to fall behind and stand on the roof of the basecamp.\n\n\n\nThere are a few little things this game does wrong:\n\n\nThe difficulty ramps up very quick, if you’re new to the game\nYou have to play and replay to unlock most of the store items\nThe game takes a surprisingly high amount of ram to run\nThe lack of real story makes the game less compelling\nThe lack of online or co-op makes it a rather lonely game\nThe controls sometimes lag behind making it hard to control your player in bad situations, sometimes killing the player\nThe voice acting isnt the best\nThe player will auto knife a zombie when it comes in range, this should have been an easy fix and have a knife button.\n\n\n\nDeadly 30 does a lot of things right:\n\n\nThe characters, although static, are still rather comical.\nThe achievements are rather easy to get\nThe game has steam playing cards\nSurvivors can be found again after they die\n\nOverall the game is fun, implying you don't mind a challenge and minor issues. If you like the style of game, then it is worth the $5.49 (CAN) price tag, however if you’re not a fan of the 2D shooter style, then try to get it on sale. Overall, I liked the game however, I did suck at it.","May 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","39","45","2","0"

I like the art style and overall idea/gameplay of Deadly 30. However it feels like it is lacking a certain polish and certain aspects. The game would be great with some good old fashion co-op! Even if the co-op were just a horde mode style of play. I think co-op alone could change my entire outlook on this game. The other main issue, at least at the time of me writting this, is that there is a very noticeable drop in frame rates(seems to happen mostly during day/night cycle switches). It feels like really bad lag! It is still playable but definetly detracts from the game. All that said if you have a chance to get this in a bundle, or for at least 75% off I would recommend getting this title. And although it's been out almost a year I hope there are some updates and follow up along the way for this game.","October 28, 2014","true","17.4"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

You control a survivor and your goal is to survive the night, while you go out and find materials to upgrade your hideout and find survivors. Movement is limited, because it's played from a 2D sidescroller perspective where you can go only left or right.\n\nIt starts off with easy to kill zombies, and after pretty much every night a new zombie is introduced. By night 10 you'll probably die because you have to manage your survivors as well as fighting off some of the tougher zombies. You have to make sure that they have enough ammo, health packs, or a better gun and do not let them fight off zombies by themselves, or they will probably get killed in the process.\n\nThe faces of the characters are absolutely hideous, but the rest of the game looks just fine. The resolution options are limited though so I had to play it in a window to make it look somewhat decent. The (limited) voice acting is decent and actually better than expected.\n\nDeadly 30 is fun for at least a couple of hours, and the price is right. Grab it when you can.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","March 3, 2014","true","1.7"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"

I'll admit, I was drawn in by some simple zombie-shooting fun at only about three dollars. Mostly good feedback, stupid but fun. How can one possibly get buyers remorse over three dollars?\n\nPretty easily, actually. The thing is that the game just isn't fun to play. As I played it, the entire time I was fantasizing about playing something more fun or getting some work done. It's not entertaining. It's boring at best, frustrating at worst.\n\nThe game looks, feels, plays and tastes like a poorly polished free flash game. The only difference is that it's three dollars, and that's on sale. It's horrifically repetitive, all the weapons feel the same, all the fences seem the same, there is just nothing that dynamically changes the gameplay at all. Walk forwards and shoot while spasmatically crouching for extra damage, and sometimes holding E by things. It literally never goes past that, the game gets old about 15 minutes in.\n\nTo make matters worse it's very unpolished. The AI is at first hilariously stupid, quickly becoming infuriatingly idiotic. The animations are ♥♥♥♥-poor, the artstyle is an eye-strain, the gunplay is weak. Again, it just not fun to play.\n\nDon't get lured in by the tiny price, it's not even worth the time.","January 8, 2014","false","1.0"," 329 of 578 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","329","578","0","12"

Was it worth it? Hell yeah!\n\nI have tried many (very) cheap games (in price value) and I can say honestly this have been maybe best of them.\n\nGame plot in short: You have to survive 30 days and nights. At first you play as American (who clearly loves his country) but later on you will meet Russian guy (who loves Vodka and Bears) and German woman (who likes to hit things using pan when those are close enough). American uses Rifles and SMG, Russian is sniper and German uses shotguns.\n\nIn gameplay this games is not best one. You can see they have used flash but it didn't stop me. Graphics are good ones in my opinion and I didn't face any bugs. There is only 5 zones. Two on left, two on right and the middle one.\n\nSo what you are supposed to do? How you should survive 30 days? Well you have your base. Best tactic to survive nights is stay at that base because you can build turrets there and they are really powerful. At least the better one. You can also build walls and stay behind them. And from base you can buy better weapons and armor. When night is over and day is coming you go to explore and try to get as much as possible currency to upgrade your armor and weapons. And to buy better wall and turrets.\n\nGame have little good things like XP bar and achievements which are not so easible earnable or either ridiculously hard to get. I see those as little plus. Even though you can get your max level (which is more account bound than character bound).\n\nAnyway I recommend this game to everyone who likes "Shoot 'em up" -like games. Or who just likes to combine really simple tower defence to really simple exploring or who just likes simple Indie games. And yes, this is simple game but I see it as good thing!\n\nPS. Oh and if you want to get achievements remember that they are game session bound. So if you save game and come back after that your progress is _not_ saved. As example I could say achievement "Golden Shells" achievement where you have to shoot 20 000 bullets.","June 9, 2015","true","32.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

In this case: the "fun" equals to ceaselessly shooting hordes of zombies rushing towards your gun, trying yo swarm you. Other games, even some very simple ones (such as Yet Another Zombie Defense), have proven that this straightforward concept can indeed deliver fun. But somehow, Deadly 30 does not work for me. I have to admit: I played it for nearly six hours, and I almost had to "force" myself to uninstall it and not play any further. There is something addictive to the mindless slaughter, performed as one of three soldiers clad in WWII outfit (American, German & Russian). But there is no sense of "fulfillment" at all, just of some vague feeling like "just one more try, then I will survive longer and I can maybe get one more achievement this time".\n\nBut with so many excellent and much more interesting games out there waiting to be played, that vague feeling is not enough anymore for me. Although I can totally understand that Deadly 30 could and probably will work for other players, who are pretty happy killing the hours with this game (excuse me the pun). Sadly, the game has some structural issues that does not make it well suited even for that modest purpose.\n\nI don't mind that the Flash-based graphics are unremarkable - they have a cartoonish quality to them and have a style of their own. Since the game is a 2d side scroller, there is only "left" and "right", and only two "levels" at each side. So it does not take long to "explore". Still: no problem, since it's all in the action. But the action is blandly repetitive, without any choices about tactics required: just walk and keep shooting. Even reloading happens automatically, and if zombies attack while reloading, you'll automatically use a melee weapon. Just keep that mouse button down!\n\nStill, if there was a truly good designed system which would save my progress and remind of how far I've got into the achievements (which feel like they are the final "aim" of the game), I wouldn't care about the mindless action. But the designers have made one crucial mistake: lots of the achievements are of the grinding-type (shoot 200.000 bullets, gather 50.000 metal etc), but they can only be got during a single session. And that's a bridge too far in my opinion: this forces players to just keep playing on and on, because when you quit, progress (achievement-wise) will be lost. General progress (leveling up and surviving more and more nights) does get saved though, so it should be perfectly possible to distribute those insane numbers of zombies to be shot, beheaded, stabbed or burnt among multiple sessions. The fact that it's not, makes I can't recommend this game.\n\nNot recommend: even though the game can be fun for some time, it becomes boring and very repetitive.","October 9, 2015","false","5.8"," 55 of 92 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","55","92","4","13"

Post a comment if you have questions.\n\nGenerally, I stay away from these sorts of games. I tend to dislike all those various free flash games on the internet. You know, the ones that contain pretty much no depth in gameplay and just involve you moving to one side of the screen while shooting? They are usually not particularly enjoyable to play, and often don't keep me entertained. However, Deadly 30, although it has some issues, has managed to hold my attention long enough for me to beat it, and it may even get a revisit from me in the future, which is incredibly surprising considering the sort of game it is.\n\nMuch like all those free flash games online, Deadly 30 is simple. VERY simple. If you're looking for any complex mechanics at all, look away. In Deadly 30, your aim is to survive for 30 days, and 30 nights. These go by very quickly, only a few minutes per day and per night. During this time, your main aim is to collect scrap, and kill zombies.\n\nIn Deadly 30, you start off as a machinegun weilding US army solider, trying to survive the apocalypse. You can move left, and right. You can go to 2 areas to the left, and 2 areas to the right, as well as going to your base which is in the middle. This never changes. There isn't much to explore, and you will most likely reach a wall in your first few nights, as the paths only take about a minute or 2 of traveling to get to the next. On these paths are A LOT of zombies. The game starts out with a few dozen zombies on each of these screens, and then gradually builds up to have hundereds of them. Some of you may be asking "If there is nothing but zombies on these paths, why should I go down them? Am I not safer in my base?" The answer is simple. Scrap.\n\nScrap functions as your main resource that's used for upgrading your weapons, armour, speed, and barricade, as well as purchasing ammo, turrets, medkits, and boxes. It's basically cash. Scrap can be found in 4 ways. Killing zombies, finding it on the ground, surviving nights, and breaking down vehicles/boxes. Zombies don't give you that much scrap, so you'll need to focus your effort on finding the stuff on the ground, and breaking down vehicles to get it. These are only found on the main paths left and right, You need as much of this stuff as you can get. Scrap is your lifeblood. Without scrap, you can forget about surviving at all. If you think this is a game that you can play as some sort of cheap tower defence, you're DEAD wrong.\n\nThe reason you need so much scrap is to upgrade and buy things, which you NEED to do because this game is... well, it's sort of hard, but at the same time, not really. It's not difficult to aim and shoot. It's not difficult to move left of right. This is really all you need to do. But the game is relentless. It throws so many zombies at you, and gives you such a small amount of time to do what you need to do, that it makes it feel that if you don't spend every second collecting scrap and killing zombies, that you're doomed to fail. This gives the game a pretty good sense of tension. The enemies constantly get harder and more numerous every night. This basically forces you into buying stuff, otherwise, you stand no chance, which is why you need scrap so badly. However, as long as you collect scrap, aim for the head, keep an eye on the time, are semi focused, learn to hold down "e" to repair your base walls while crouched and shooting, and don't waste too much of your scrap on temporary crap (boxes), you should be able to win without an issue.\n\nThere's also an experience meter in the game, but it's nothing that you need to pay attention to. As you kill zombies, you level up. Each time you level up, all that happens is is that you unlock a new gun/store upgrade. That's it really. There's no skills to choose from, and you'll pretty much want every upgrade anyway, so there's no sense to worry about this at all.\n\nWhile playing and going through the game, you will also find 2 companions. A Russian sniper and a German shotgunner. Once found, you can switch between them. Not that it really changes the game that much, but it's nice to be able to use a weapon you like. You will NEED these companions to survive the game, so be sure to explore far every night, at least until you find them. Don't lose them. They may be dumb, but they can at least keep themselves alive and are useful for surviving the nights.\n\nWhile you can explore the areas to the left and right during the day, you all but need to get back to your base before night, since at night, the number of zombies multiplies drastically. You might get away with this early in the game, but later, you have no chance of survival. The zombies come faster than you and your 2 teammates can fire. Your base has fences/walls that you can repair, as well as higher ground, turrets, and other such things that you will need to live. It's nothing complex, but it's absolutely vital for staying alive.\n\nAs for the music, sound and visuals? Well, the music/sound is fine, if forgettable and nothing special.  The visuals are from a guy known as Gonzossm, who makes pretty damn awesome (if offensive and dirty) youtube videos. Gonzossm also made the visuals for a semi well known newgrounds game called "Toss the Turtle", which while simple, was also a great deal of fun. Personally, I absolutely love his art style, and I think it really suits the game, and greatly improve it from what it could be otherwise. There's not that much animation in actions, but blood splurts out fine, and everything is pretty clear. Of course, not everyone will like this style, and it could make or break the game for some.\n\nAs for story, The Walking Dead this aint. This is a cheap flash game about shooting zombies and walking one direction. The story is completely ignorable, but at the same time, sort of charming.The characters are likable for the most part, despite having nothing to them. The voice acting is hilariously bad (the first time I heard the voice for the Russian guy, which was an obviously English speaking person trying their hardest to be as stereotypical as possible, I burst out laughing), and lines are repeated often, though it never interrupts the game or gets annoying. There are a few cutscenes, which are pretty short (around 20 seconds each), though cool, but these are generally just to give us a quick joke or 2. The jokes are usually funny and I have no problem with them. If you like Gonzossm's videos on youtube, you'll like these. There's no le random le funneh may may XD spouting to be had here, which is a huge plus.\n\nAs for cons, apart from being incredibly simple (seriously, you don't EVER need to use the jump button), the game also has issues with slowdown, and framerate drops, which is sort of expected from flash. These are generally fixed by putting the graphics settings to low, and possibly turning the resolution down, which doesn't make the game look that much worse. I hear making the game play in windowed mode also helps greatly, but that's kind sucky. The game is also solo only, which may be a deal breaker for some.\n\nNow, if you're actually been reading all this, which 99.99% of you won't be, then you're probably wondering why I still recommend this game, even though there's not much too it. Well, it's because despite its simplicity, Deadly 30 is still a lot of fun. Killing enemies is fun, shooting weapons is fun. upgrading youseld and collecting scrap is fun. It's just fun! It's tense, and it looks awesome. I know it's strange, but despite it's simplicity, it has charm and is engaging enough to play through at least once. It's also cheap, so that's a plus. Deadly 30 is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably not for most people. But if you want a short thrill, this is it.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

Chances are you may have played Flash games with a similar setup. This is no different.\n\nI admit liked Deadly 30 when I first played. From the first few screens I thought I'd get to experience a large world spanning dozens of screens. Nope. There's just five. It's not even random, it's the same five screens each time you restart the game. This alone makes the game feel unfinished. Couldn't there be a campaign where you try to survive in other countries? How about some towns? How about randomized backgrounds for each new game?\n\nWhile I like how levels carry over from game to game, they almost feel mandatory. It's a peculiar design choice to reward the player for being able to play poorly. Furthermore, they're not exactly insignifant upgrades. So just keep playing until you hit max level, and then try for some real runs, which doesn't take too long.\n\nWorth noting is that this is done in Flash. Flash tends to be poor in optimization, and so the game will occasionally run sluggish even on high end systems.\n\nThe only reason I am recommending this game is because it can be found in bundles for attractive prices. On its own, I can't really recommend it. Sure it was fun... at first. But that goes away very quickly when you realize just how small this game world is.

Sadly, that is true for the Headup Gamesathon. Today is day ten of ten. I feel that we’re ending things on a really positive note with one of the most popular and well known games in the Headup Games catalogue. Deadly 30 is a survival game where the player must build and develop their home base in order to aide them to defeat waves of zombies. It’s one of the most simple games on Steam and is aimed at mindless fun.\n\nDoes it achieve the fun experience that it was hoping for? In my opinion it does. It’s mindless. It doesn’t take a lot of thought to be able to play. It’s perfect for short periods of game play but can extend into lengthier periods so long as you don’t find it monotonous.  You can complete the game in about three hours but the game is made with replayability in mind. Strategies can be refined, altered, etc. You can try any number of different things. Some may work better than others. How you decide to play is almost entirely up to you.\n\nThe only thing that I really want to criticize about the game is that it was made in flash. Flash, as everyone knows, is prone to running wildly inconsistently. This means that the game can play slowly or sluggishly even on the most modern of machines. Had it been made in almost any other engine the game could – would – have been optimized a lot better than what it is.\n\nDeadly 30 is a simple game but it is fun and that’s all that you can possibly ask for from this. It’s not an award winner but is playable and accessible to most.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group please join us at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified\nFor our Steam Curation please follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 9","true","14.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Like the art-style, the stereotypical characters who are funny as hell and just the premise of the zombies and needing to defend your house/base at night. Trying to get as many scrap metal as you can to upgrade your weapons, turrets, fences etc is adicting.\n\nHowever, a few big big problems keep me from enjoying this title and getting frustrated while i'm playing. First of all, there is the issue of Full-Screen and Resolution. Why can't this game just be full HD?\n\nSecond, there's the linear levels. When I saw screens, I thought this would be a Metal Slug kind of game, with zombies! But you never need to jump on a platform. It's just walking from left to right, right to left and that's it. The enemies also seem to be very strond and some excist just to annoy you. There are zombiedogs and zombiebirds that are almost impossible to hit before they hit you.\n\nAnd the biggest issue is the controls are getting clammed up and start to lag whenever there is a lot of action on screen. Your character keeps walking, even when you do not press a button, it aims in all directions except the one you want and you die a lot because of this.\n\nThis results in a unplayable, frustrating experience. It's like you get a chocolate suprise egg. You love the chocolate that's around it, but when you get down to the core, you get a worthless toy that doesn't work.","February 15, 2014","false","2.6"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirpencil/recommended/264730/","sirpencil","Sir Pencil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirpencil/","1490 products in account","A decent attempt at a zombie survival WW2 game. What the game does succeed at is having a fairly tight control scheme (which is not rebindable) and a decent mixture of action and base-building.\n\nIt fails however to have any sort of real content or optimization of what it already has. The world is one flat horizontal plane divided into 5 areas (Mountain, corn field, base, snow world, castle). You have enough time every day to race through one side of that plane (from your base, to the end of the mountain and back). That's it.\n\nDifficulty slowly increases at first and then rampantly accelerates. Not due to the simple AI, but because enemies eventually become supreme bullet sponges and the engine itself begins to bog down once there are more than a few dozen objects on the screen at once. Input lag causes you to lose control of your character, often running you into zombie hordes, and once you've established a decent base (read: more than a few boxes and turrets) things don't get any better. Your AI companions only add to the lag. I spent the last dozen days just sleeping and repairing the base because dealing with the input lag was unbearable.\n\nThe inability to rebind controls is also a minor annoyance. The game requires you to press A and D to travel across the flat plank of existence the developers have created. Reloading is R. This means that in order to reload your gun (or a turret) you're going to have to perform some pretty interesting finger twister.\n\nDeadly 30 has a solid core of gameplay, when it lets you have it. Unfortunately the tiny world, limited base building/upgrading options and lack of optimization make it a very tough pill to swallow.","January 9, 2014","false","1.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

And it's true, She is ruthless.\nThe animation is nice and unobtrusive, sometimes pretentious funny.\nBy itself, the game is a 2D platformer with survival and containment of the waves. Who know Don't Starve, he will immediately ovladet parallel. The essence of the game is simple and intelligible. We Military world war II (as of early American), it is unknown what happened, but began zombieapocalypse that hooked war of all Nations. The game is reduced to the retention base and maintain its vitality (generator, that was the light; bed, shop, barricades). All you need to repair, build and add. Cartridges seems that a lot, but believe me, they will end you on the first night, so they have to buy a lot and often. Added facilities for defence, buy new armor and guns. The most important thing is to survive the night, when the zombies attack on the base, then the morning, evening.....looking for resources as a zombie is not particularly active. The farther and more zombies and the farther we must move away from base to Supplement the resources that we build and buy. BUT remember to return it before dark, or to the database you are alive you will not reach.\nOn the First day all easy, but the second night is already fierce nightmare. In Fact the game has hooked me into this respect it and Don't Starve. As shown sensor time of day and just have to hurry and around like a squirrel in a wheel, clearly setting priorities and not try to go far. Just need to find tanks and cars to disassemble them is the biggest source of resources.\n\nMany different guns and as I understand the new characters, including Russians and Germans.\n\nI will not dwell on the pros and cons of the game (such as graphics, gameplay, etc.), but I will say one thing, play really, it is inexpensive. Now very few hardcore games and this game is one of the few. Addictive.\n\n\nМного был наслышан о игре в своё время, добрался до неё только недавно....и хорошо что добрался\nБольше всего говорилось о лютой хардкорности игры. И это правда, Она беспощадна.\nРисовка милая и ненавязчивая, порой пафосно смешная.\nСама по себе игра представляет из себя 2D платформер с выживанием и сдерживанием волн. Кто знаком с Don't Starve, тот сразу углядит параллели. Суть игры проста и доходчива. Мы Военный второй мировой войны (по началу американец), неизвестно что произошло, но начался зомбиапокалипсис, который зацепил военных всех наций. Игра сводится к удержанию базы и поддержанию её жизнеспособности (генератор, чтоб был свет; постель, магазин, барикады). Всё нужно чинить, строить и добавлять. Патронов кажется что много, но поверьте, кончатся они у вас в первую же ночь, так что их покупать придется много и часто. Добавляем сооружения для обороны, покупаем новую броню и пушки и тд. Самое главное это пережить ночь, когда зомби нападают на базу, затем утро, вечер.....ищем ресурсы, пока зомби не особо активны. Чем дальше, тем сильнее и больше зомби и тем дальше надо уходить от базы, чтобы пополнять ресурсы, за счет которых мы всё строим и покупаем. НО помните, вернуться надо засветло, иначе дло базы вы живым не доберетесь.\nВ Первый день всё легко, а вот вторая ночь - это уже лютый кошмар. По Сути игра зацепила меня так же в этом плане как и Don't Starve. Так же показывается датчик времени суток и так же надо спешить и крутиться как белка в колесе, чётко расставляя приоритеты и не пытаться заходить далеко. Так же нужно искать танки и машины, чтобы расбирать их - это самый большой источник ресурсов.Много разных пушек и как я понял новых персонажей, включая русских и немцев (напарники, но за них можно играть)\n\nЯ не буду расписывать плюсы и минусы игры (такие как графика, геймплей и тд), но скажу одно, поиграть дейсвительно стоит, благо она недорогая. Сейчас мало хардкорных игр и эта игра - одна из немногих.

I've check the forums and apparently it's a common problem so i guess the dev solution is that dumb message when i start the game blaming the processor...\n\nSo, do i recommend this game? No, only if it's on promotion (around 1~2€/$) or in a bundle, you want something to waste time and, of course, if they actually fix the problem.","July 13, 2014","false","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Two years later Deadly 30 popped up on Steam and I thought why not?\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you start up the game is the art style. It's definitely Gonzo's style and it's done really well. The game combines cartoony graphics with with less than child-friendly themes and creates a nice atmosphere.\n\nOnto the music, the music is done well and serves its purpose well but isn't memorable. There isn't a theme you'll be humming to yourself later and for a game like this, maybe that's not really nessesary.\n\nNow the gameplay. When you start a new game you're put into a hostile side-scrolling world with only your gun to help you. As you travel you find an empty bunker and decide to call it home. After the game teaches you the basic controls the zombies start spawning. The zombies are divided into three colours: Green (being the weakest), Blue and Red (being the strongest), along with other more interesting zombies.\n\nAfter surviving the first night you explore either left or right and start to salvage scrap metal, the currency of the game, and have a chance of finding other survivors. The other survivors consist of a Russian marksman and a trenchgun-wielding German. After forming this unlikely alliance you a challenged to survive thirty days and thirty nights untill you are rescued.\n\nNow this is easier said than done, the game is hard and on your first attempt you will die, there's just no way around it. However, when you start a new game your level is kept the same and anything you unlocked in the previous save will be available for purchase via the shop found in the bunker. You will definitely want to get to your bunker before nightfall. Nightfall is when the zombies are at both their fastest and deadliest.  Buying and upgrading defenses is critical to your survival. You buy things like weapons and defenses through the ingame shop found inside your bunker.\n\nThe shooting and moving in this game feel very arcadey, which isn't nessesarily a bad thing. The movement is nice and the shooting feels satisfying. You move your character around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys and shoot by aiming with your Mouse and firing with Mouse 1.\n\nNow I mentioned before there were two other characters, the Russian and the German. While their character art is done really well the voice acting does tend to create some cringe-worthy moments. I could tell that Gonzo and Iggy did the voices themself (with some help for the German). The Russian talks in a deep voice which wasn't convincing at all and the German's voice is very quiet and has some mic distortion at times. While the voices are a bit off it doesn't subtract from the gameplay.\n\nSteam's asking me if I recommend this game; for $5 there are certainly worse things to spend your money on. This game is fun arcadey shooting action with open-world exploration and base-fortifying holdouts and, to be honest, is the most fun I've had with a zombie game in quite a while. One thing I would recommend would be a multiplayer option. I was gutted when I didn't find any multiplayer within the game. I know it would take a bit of coding and a bit of time but I think it would be well worth it in the end. Other than that, this game is one of the better indie titles I've played.

Two years later Deadly 30 popped up on Steam and I thought why not?\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you start up the game is the art style. It's definitely Gonzo's style and it's done really well. The game combines cartoony graphics with with less than child-friendly themes and creates a nice atmosphere.\n\nOnto the music, the music is done well and serves its purpose well but isn't memorable. There isn't a theme you'll be humming to yourself later and for a game like this, maybe that's not really nessesary.\n\nNow the gameplay. When you start a new game you're put into a hostile side-scrolling world with only your gun to help you. As you travel you find an empty bunker and decide to call it home. After the game teaches you the basic controls the zombies start spawning. The zombies are divided into three colours: Green (being the weakest), Blue and Red (being the strongest), along with other more interesting zombies.\n\nAfter surviving the first night you explore either left or right and start to salvage scrap metal, the currency of the game, and have a chance of finding other survivors. The other survivors consist of a Russian marksman and a trenchgun-wielding German. After forming this unlikely alliance you a challenged to survive thirty days and thirty nights untill you are rescued.\n\nNow this is easier said than done, the game is hard and on your first attempt you will die, there's just no way around it. However, when you start a new game your level is kept the same and anything you unlocked in the previous save will be available for purchase via the shop found in the bunker. You will definitely want to get to your bunker before nightfall. Nightfall is when the zombies are at both their fastest and deadliest.  Buying and upgrading defenses is critical to your survival. You buy things like weapons and defenses through the ingame shop found inside your bunker.\n\nThe shooting and moving in this game feel very arcadey, which isn't nessesarily a bad thing. The movement is nice and the shooting feels satisfying. You move your character around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys and shoot by aiming with your Mouse and firing with Mouse 1.\n\nNow I mentioned before there were two other characters, the Russian and the German. While their character art is done really well the voice acting does tend to create some cringe-worthy moments. I could tell that Gonzo and Iggy did the voices themself (with some help for the German). The Russian talks in a deep voice which wasn't convincing at all and the German's voice is very quiet and has some mic distortion at times. While the voices are a bit off it doesn't subtract from the gameplay.\n\nSteam's asking me if I recommend this game; for $5 there are certainly worse things to spend your money on. This game is fun arcadey shooting action with open-world exploration and base-fortifying holdouts and, to be honest, is the most fun I've had with a zombie game in quite a while. One thing I would recommend would be a multiplayer option. I was gutted when I didn't find any multiplayer within the game. I know it would take a bit of coding and a bit of time but I think it would be well worth it in the end. Other than that, this game is one of the better indie titles I've played. Definitely recommended","January 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple and fun.\n\nBut it's not. The game started with a petulant: "This game runs heavy on the CPU, and your computer is below the minimun - you have been warned". That alone drove me insanely mad. How could a SNES-looking game possibly require more from a computer than some ridiculously low specs? I own a top-notch XPS and, after a few plays, it really lags!\n\nThe game is pretty bad, another generic flash title in which you start growing stronger, little by little, as do your foes, providing that mildly pleasant sensation of reward, that we all learned so desperately to crave from these "modern" titles. But that's all there is. Unless you are 10 years old and have serious cognitive issues, I strongly recommend not buying this. I don't even understand why does Steam keep pushing us these games, considering them "releases". This title itself is far worse from any browser flash game I have ever played, and I payed for it. It is so bad that it couldn't even occupy the "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaming session" on my week's schedule. How I wish I could get a refund...\n\nThere is no fun, refrain from this game!","January 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What you can usually expect from zombie games with day cycles.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is horrendous. The controls aren't only sticky, but sometimes downright impossible to use. Moving your cursor from side to side on the screen, which is necessary if you want to shoot on both sides of yourself, can produce unpredictable results. Sometimes your cursor doesn't move all the way, or at all, sometimes it moves to the very edge or off screen, and when it does this, you lose complete control of your character. He/she continues walking without you being able to stop it, and you have to try to yank your cursor off the edge of the screen which it won't let you do. Because of this, you'll be walking right into many of the zombies in this game.\n\nThe day/night cycle doesn't work as anyone would hope for. The days are quick, though this can be expected, it makes it difficult to journey anywhere else in the game, seeing as I can only find the one base/fort that I started in. I go out to scavenge, and have to take my best guess as to when I should start running home. By time I get there, zombies are already innevitably destroying the base, and my health is low because of my guess work.\n\nI would reccomend refraining from playing this game at all.","May 3, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The devolpers of the game have posted only a few times that the game will most likey never be multiplayer because this would require them to redo areas that Flash covered before but doesnt when multiplayer gets involved.\n\n~ AI ~\nThe AI of Deadly 30 is still not wonderful, but has imporved nicely over time. The developers expect to do more work on this topic later on.\n\n~ Price ~\nUnless its a free to play or on sale, $5 for a game like this one is a pretty good deal. The game offers hours of enjoyment, and fun levels, most indie sombie games are the same thing, at least this one brings somthing different to the table.\n\n~ Fun ~\nBeing fun is the most important part of a Flash game. This one hits it out of the park. The constant need for more items drives you to leave your home, but when you need shelter, youre just going to come running back in the nick of time before being swarmed. The retro style of the characters and envorment will draw you in, and the endless improvments to be done to your base and you keep you coming back.\n\n~ Difficulty~\nThe first few levels of the game (1-7), are easy, but as you progress you will find new zombies, and more supplies. Although, at some points the game can be quite hard, and I wouldnt expect a casual gamer to get as much enjoyment out of the game as someone whos always been gaming.\n\n~ Worth It? ~\nThere is no doubt in my mind this game was worth every penny I paid for it. The games offers to much for $5 that some even more modern games are still put to shame in this ones wake. The AI needs improvement, and multiplayer would be nice, though extremley hard to implement. If this game wasn't so awesome I really wouldnt type all this up.If you are still debating about buying this game, quit debating, buy it.\n\nThanks for reading this reveiw guys, please enjoy the game.\n\nLater\n-Cedar2000\n\nHurry!

It's still an annoying bug for many though, and I hope the devs make a permanent fix.\n\nDeadly 30 is a blend of tower defense and run-and-gun zombie shooter. Very simple mechanics to the point of being a time-waster, but entertaining with a somewhat unusual flow of gameplay that I'd love to see more of in the future. Basically, your time is split into days and each day consists of a morning, afternoon, dusk, and night. Your choices during each phase will dictate whether you can survive to the next day. The first two phases are relatively peaceful, a time spent upgrading your base, weapons, and abilities then venturing out into the lands surrounding your base to collect supplies from enemies or scrappable structures. All of your effort is put toward becoming strong enough to survive that night. You can also run into allies that will join your cause. There is an element of luck as you never know if that day will yield plentiful resources and spawn needed allies, lack of both can result in some very hectic nights. In later chapters, dusk is usually spent fighting off enemies as you hurry back to the base to hopefully upgrade some stuff in time for the night phase. The nights of the game are spent facing a giant slew of zombies, ideally you make it back to base in time to set and upgrade some blockades to serve as a distraction while you pick them off zombies by the hundreds. As you successfully complete each night you can gain access to new upgrades, level up, and view tiny and very goofy cut-scenes. There are also a wide variety of zombie types that are unlocked almost every other day. This is a short game but the frequency of new upgrades/enemies/weapon types are regular and keep the pace running well.\n\nFor me this game is a lot of fun in the short bursts it can be played, but too shallow and simple to have real longevity. It's disappointing to discover for example, that the various explorable areas are all the same but for palette swaps, and don't contain any defining unique features like bosses, hidden areas, or unique items- content is plunked down randomly.\n\nAt the end of the day, the concept is what remains compelling about Deadly 30  and is one I'd like to see in future games. I'm a big fan of games that integrate day and night systems in meaningful way, time management features make every moment count, the "just one more day" flow of gameplay keeps things addictive, and the element of randomness to each day is not unlike the joy of each run in roguelikes. The difficulty of Deadly 30 is on the low side though. While death comes easily and some zombie types are colossally strong, the game is pretty lenient on failure. Each successful night is autosaved and you can repeat a failed day. If you really run into an unbeatable situation, starting from a new game saves a lot of progress and should result in a much more success.\n\nThis game has been on sale or bundled a lot lately, it's worth the money in my opinion but I hope future updates or sequels expand significantly on the depth of the world, and strategic options and aspects to help offset the repetitive and monotonous nature of the combat. Overall, a fun and strangely relaxing shooter/survival hybrid.","June 2, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's very simple, although it's difficult. Soon you'll have many zombies coming at you. You don't have enough money to buy for defense. Once you're dead, you'll stay dead.

Got this on sale so i can't argue that it wasn't worth it.\n\nGameplay-\nThe actual controls are your basic set up, move with WASD and Shoot with the mouse, the game has pretty good pacing, making each night increasingly difficult and making you actually jump at some moments.\n\nVisual and audio-\nBeing as it is a flash game, don't come in expecting Skyrim. The graphics were never an issue until there was massive dips in the frame rate, causing the mouse to sporadically move around the screen with a huge amount of lag. But, its understandable due to its actual engine. The sounds on the other hand are GOD AWFUL, the voice acting (yes there is voice acting) is pretty much terrible, the quality of the sound bytes are awful. During cutscenes, it triggers the question in your head if the voice actors could get any closer to the mic? (Very crunchy sounds, terrible audio spikes)\n\nMulitplayer-\nThere is none, this game was crying out for multiplayer, due to the game having 2 AI team mates.\n\nOverall-\nEnjoyable, certainly not a 1 game sitting start to finish. Quite challenging and fun to play from start to middle, later on it dips.\nI would certainly purchase this again IF it is advertised for a lower price, currently its just a bit too much and there are many more games worth the same price.\n\nImprovements?\n- Multiplayer. Hands down.\n- Fix the frame rate issues.\n- Sort the audio out\nThen it would certainly warrent full price.\n\nSeeing as i've 100% this game, you can tell i enjoyed it.","January 28, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I like this this game. It's simple arcade-style fun packed up in a casual-game-like package.\n\nEasy to get into - hard to master. Just the way I like it.\n\nRegarding lags of the engine I can only say that I'm still playing on XP with a Dual Core AMD CPU equiped with 4 GB RAM and SATA-HDDs and, yes, the game does lag on my system, but only very seldom and short. And it's not really a problem, because most of the time you're aiming straigt ahead so it doesn't really matter. Just play further as you would without the lag and it will be no big problem. Of course it will be a problem if your aiming around like a maniac (which is definitely not necessary in this game) or run around like an olympic sportsman on speed. If you play calm and focused the few lags are no problem. And to be calm and focused is the only way to survive a game like this anyway as it is a zombie survival game I'd say ...\n\nMaybe my system is just setup the right way, for example I only buy HDDs with minimum 64GB cache, I have a 4 GB RAM Drive holding my Swap Partition, and I've killed all unnecessary background tasks and services by standard ...\n\nThe lagging problem seems to me like a problem that can be solved as usual: By intelligence (keep calm and play straight forward) or by money (buy a better CPU). Anyway ... Choose your style and then enjoy this game because it deserves it!\n\nWhat in fact annoys ME about this game are two (or three) other things:\n\n1. The Key Bindings (thank god you can finally change them at least) in the options menu don't show the keys you actually mapped but some really weird and strange ASCII symbols instead AND what annoys me even more is that you can't remap anything to RETURN. That sucks big time in my case, because I'm playing with cursor keys and I use RETURN in every other game for RELOAD.\n\n2. Steam Achievements won't work. There are achievements listed here, but the game doesn't seem to recognize, when they're fullfilled. I like to get achievements in my games so this does annoy me!\n\n3. Both of these problems wouldn't be sooo hard IF THE DEVS WOULD ANSWER to these questions in the game's discussion boards. But they don't!\n\nAfter all this really is a fun-game every classic shooter and / or zombie survival fan should play. If it wasn't so I wouldn't have even talked as much about the quirks in it. So I still recommend it, but it seems you would have to live with the little bugs in it as support seems to be pretty dead ... :(\n\nMaybe you should wait for discount ...","February 27, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had to set my 15" Mac PB Pro laptop to 800x600 resolution and I am still not close to a full screen window.  That's right, this game only runs in window mode and cannot be set for full screen.  You cannot set the screen resolution either, so you will have to scale down your PC/Mac resolution for this to be playable.\n\nSince this game can only be played in window mode, I clicked off screen by mistake and died in the first few minutes of the game.  The Steam window covered the game window and I died fast...  Graphics are very old school and controls were okay.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I got mauled in the first few minutes of the game trying to find the game screen behind the Steam screen.  It needs a tutorial bad.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for this game.  It's just not that fun.  You move with the w,a,s,d keys and aim with the mouse.  Press the mouse button to shoot.  You can't hold the mouse button down to shoot.  At least not with the machinegun I started with.  Not sure about anything else as it just was not fun enough to continue.

Actually it is a very impressive flash-game, a mixture of tower-defense and shooting. It is fun, the art-design is like-able (if you like stuff like Metal Slug & Co.) and it's gameplay - even if rather monotonous - can be addicting. BUT ... it really get's laggy after the 20th day or something. Too many zombies, too many effects for this kind of engine - I don't know, I'm not a programmer, but my control inputs were lagging like hell during the last few waves. Only survived, because I kind of stood still and let my machine gun towers do all the work, while barricading myself with an infinite number of boxes to slow those zombies down. If this game had a better performance, I would definitely recommend it! It's good for what it is (even if it's not what I hoped for: Metal Slug with Zombies!) and it's worth a few bucks - even if there is absolutely no replay-value and no multiplayer. If you like the idea of the game and think you can handle the lag during the final waves, give it a try.","March 21, 2014","false","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It could be a fun little game, somewhat addictive, but it lags so much. For a 2D platformer in today's world, that must be a sign of really poor programming. And you can't save your progress if you want to get achievements.\nWith that out of my system, I must admit the game grabs you and won't let go until you finish. On the other hand, that is like three hours of gameplay, So no big investment, timewise.\nGetting all the achievements basically makes you run a second time from the very beginning. When I realized what firing 20000 shots meant, I got some sticky tape and taped my mouse button clicked shut, which actually proved to be a good strategy overall. Now I have my achievements, finished the game twice over, and I guess I'm done with Deadly 30.\nBTW, it you are on Linux, achievements do not work and collector cards do not accumulate.

It's not much of tower defence either, 'cause lack of resources to build up really automated defence.\n- Game is fast, but controls aren't. I felt quite clumsy both in fighting and building fences.\n- Zombie theme and flash games... for some folks it's "instant "NO!" and I can't blame them...\n\nOverall - you may buy it for 1$ or in bundle, but only if you want easy achievement stats on steam.

The idea is simple. You start off as one character who makes his way to an abandoned outpost in the dead of night. Having activated the power generator, you are now in charge of protecting the generator for a full 30 nights. You have two entrances that you need to cover, using fences and the like, and the horde of zombies one their way to your location grow stronger every passing night. Ammo, medkits that heal your entire party when consumed, armor, and new guns can be purchased while your in combat, pausing the game as well. After completing each night, you will praise the sun, repair damage to your fence, and head outside to scavenge for more scrap pieces, ammo, and kill more zombies. Leveling up your character will give you access to new weapons and equipment, such as a turret. Remember a bit ago when I mentioned medkits healing your entire party? That's right, you aren't alone in this, so to speak. There is no multiplayer or co-op, but you can search across the wilderness to find friendly AI-controller partners to help you fight off the undead. You can switch back and forth to control each of the different partners, and your AI-controlled pals will attempt to fight off the horde with you while the zombies make their way into your house. Death doesn't quite need to mean The End though, as your progress is saved each night that you survive to allow you to try things differently should things not work out for you.\n\nGonzossm has a very unique art style he uses with all of his animations and it's very easy to spot his work at a glance. If you've enjoyed his previous games on New grounds or his flash videos there or on YouTube, then this may already be in your shopping cart. It's a great game, at a price I can't argue with. Even if you end up deciding that you don't like the game after playing for a few hours, it's unlikely that you'll regret the $4.00 you spent.\n\nI don't typically put a space betwen New and Grounds, but for some reason, Steam has a filter that turns it into hearts.","January 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Overall, the art reminds me of Dragonball Z more than Metal Slug and the gameplay is much less refined.  There are some systems that could have been added to make the obvious frustrations of the game much less annoying and it's disappointing to see that they were overlooked.  The clock really could have used some units instead of a very low-res set of imagery, the resolution maximum seems a bit weird (1330 X something?), the game gives clear instructions regarding the simple things that the player can figure out on their own (WASD to move, click mouse to fire) but says nothing at all about things like bonus cash (scrap), leveling your character, what building boxes will actually do for you, etc.  The method of zombies appearing and clustering is also very frustrating, as is the method of controlling your aiming: there's no way to change your aim and field of view at night to the exact 180-degree opposite direction.  The game will rush the character's aim there as fast as it can but this can be very jarring at night to see your flashlight beam constantly sweeping up to the sky on its way to/from your extreme right or left.

Overall, the art reminds me of Dragonball Z more than Metal Slug and the gameplay is much less refined.  There are some systems that could have been added to make the obvious frustrations of the game much less annoying and it's disappointing to see that they were overlooked.  The clock really could have used some units instead of a very low-res set of imagery, the resolution maximum seems a bit weird (1330 X something?), the game gives clear instructions regarding the simple things that the player can figure out on their own (WASD to move, click mouse to fire) but says nothing at all about things like bonus cash (scrap), leveling your character, what building boxes will actually do for you, etc.  The method of zombies appearing and clustering is also very frustrating, as is the method of controlling your aiming: there's no way to change your aim and field of view at night to the exact 180-degree opposite direction.  The game will rush the character's aim there as fast as it can but this can be very jarring at night to see your flashlight beam constantly sweeping up to the sky on its way to/from your extreme right or left.  Not a good choice.","November 7, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/recommended/264730/","brainwashguy","Jefferson Davis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/","158 products in account","This game can be pretty fun, and it is a good concept, but this game is a borderline clone of like a billion other games. This game isn't really original, and nothing else makes up for that. This game really lacks in a lot of ways, and there aren't a lot of pros. If you want to judge it yourself, here is a pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\n- You more or less know what you're getting into, so it's not something you'll have to learn how to play.\n- Characters are decently interesting, and balance is interesting too.\n- Good choice of weapons, building, turrets, armor, and boots which have some fun progression.\n- A way to support Gonzo if you like his videos (I don't really, but it'd be nice to just look at this if you like him).\n- Pretty artwork to look at (this isn't important).\n\nCons:\n- Really, really, unoriginal gameplay. It can be incredibly boring if you're used to these games, especially since the game gets unbelievably hard towards the end since turrets can be destroyed and they're very expensive.\n- Voice acting is hilariously bad, it sounds like one guy voiced it (and there is a girl character in the game).\n- While there are a bunch of weapons, there is really one line of progression for each character and no balance between weapons.\n\nOverall, this game is ok but is nothing, more, just a decent game. There are actually better games on Kongregate than something like this, and a game feeling like a bad flash game is a horrible thing. There isn't any reason to buy an ok game so you really shouldn't buy this when there are many other games that are much more fun.","August 10, 2015","false","9.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While some of the humour consists of stereotyping and some toilet ones, most of it a genuinely funny.  The character design itself, which is cartoonish, makes the light colour and humour fit with each other perfectly.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit complex, yet perfectly understandable. In the morning, your job is to gather scraps as much as possible before night, and while it is unremarkable and repetitive (just walk through from your base to the end of a map, either on right or left side), it can be tense as you're fighting to gather many scraps while racing back home as fast as you can, as well as occasional zombie ambush. Also, if you're feeling lucky, there might be vehicles or boxes (gives you lots of scraps), as well as a chance to find survivors (if you either don't have one, or as a replacement), so this motivates you to move instead of skipping the night (by clicking on bed).\n\nAt night, during the defence, you must protect yourself, and the generator, in order to survive a night. It wasn't hard, until as the days progressed, the monster hit harder, and harder until they manage to kill you. Luckily, there are some fun options to defend yourself, or at least helps you. From boxes to walls, to an awesome mega auto turret, which you must keep an eye for it's ammo. While it's infinite, you have to periodically load it, so it isn't a place-and-forget gun. Also, it is not immune to being destroyed, so you have to guard it well by assisting it, as well as loading munitions. Besides those useful objects, there are different upgrades for your characters as well. New upgrades may change their appearances, as well as increasing their strength and defence. This is why scrap gathering is very important.\n\nEnemies here have a huge variety. There are the standard zombies, upgraded versions of it, bloated zombies that will blur your view if they vomit or explode on you, etc. These will also affect how you will use your characters. The Russian rifleman has penetrating effects, but slow reload, so it is good to use it for bloaters so that their parts won't cause you blindness and attract zombies as well. The Nazi shotgunner is ideal for scrap gathering, as her shotgun can quickly blast through the zombies to give more time for scrap gathering. As for the American machine gunner, it is your standard shooter: nothing special, though ideal for defence.\n\nThe thing is, while instant character switching is possible and easy, you can't set them to do anything, such as when you need them to defend a side while you do the other, or kill a specific target. This is a bummer, as it can add more strategy and ease. Also, you must be a good manager as poor management can leave you stuck in a day forever, as the game saves your progress each end of the night, like it or not. While the shooting mechanic is straightforward, it gets repetitive, as all it matters is a strong gun, and no matter where you shoot, you only damage the enemy: no instant kills on headshot, no limb crippling, nothing advanced as that (though shooting a zombie head will double the damage, and leaves a dead, headless zombie).\n\nHowever, these issues are minor, and compared with the number of positive points in this game. Overall, the game is fun, and it has good strategic depth. Surviving 30 nights isn't easy as you think. For the price of $4.99, it is a bit of a bargain for a game with a good depth and length.

The game centers around the 3 survivors in this area. And the premise of the game is to survive for 30 nights by grabbing scrap metal to build better defenses and get better guns. You also have to take the time to find the other 2 survivors and take them back to the base. Its not necessary but its completely worth it for extra gameplay since you can play those characters and when not played by you they provide spare firepower against the undead hordes which is nice and definitely good to have especially in the later nights but y'know w/e. Definitely give this game an 8/10 for being a good game with a suffecient amount of good gameplay and its certainly interesting enough to keep your attention so go ahead and buy it if you get the chance.","February 17, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't know, it just feels lacking I'm really sorry to say. And I'm kind of sad to say that because the two guys at the head of developing this are really great animators, and have made really  sweet flash games before... but this isn't really one of them. It lacks story, music, any kind of interesting upgrade system, a meaningful scavenge system, customizable base, etc. Anything that would have made it more than just a bland sidescrolling zombie survival, and made it into a memorable and fantastic one. The closer for me was probably how buggy it is. Like, my aim would constantly spaz out, or I couldn't properly alt-tab, or that I'd hit fullscreen and the screen wouldn't fit right (and I know what my resolution is).

Each has their own specialities and unique advantages and disadvantages. Randomly finding them throughout the map adds diversity to the game, and adds a layer of unpredictability to scavenging runs.\n\nThe scavenging and weapon/base upgrade system helps to establish a few long term goals.\n\nThe Vodka easter egg.\n\nNow the cons\n\nEnemies aren't very varied aside from colors and the occasional exploding zombie, all with the same attack.\n\nThe map is quite small, with only four zones outside your main base, with the backgrounds frequently repeating themselves.\n\nThe game does get repetitive after your ninth or tenth night.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a 6.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/V_Shaft/recommended/264730/","V_Shaft","Shaft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/V_Shaft/","313 products in account","I wish Steam would have a neutral summary of a review, instead of just "THUMBS UP" & "THUMBS DOWN".\n\nBecause "Deadly 30" is a mixed bag. It could've been an awesome game, instead it's average. Why?\n\nYou are a zombie plague survivor - an American soldier, and you have to survive 30 days and nights, while finding two other survivors - A Soviet and Nazi soldier. A fairly straightforward premise. You have your base, which is just a bare shack at first, and you have to upgrade it into a fortress with turrets, barricades, boxes, etc. You have to upgrade your default equipment (weapons & armor) as well, replenish ammo, health packs; repair the shack regularly. You do that by gathering materials during daytime, and during nighttime you have to haul yourself back to base and get ready for a hard-as-nails zombie assault. When the sun comes up, repeat. For 30 days.\n\nSimple, yet full of potential. But how the game's realized is a bit botched, and here's why...\n\nThe AI of your teammates is simply atrocious. They shoot, generally, yes; but it's always gonna be you who does 95% of the work. During day-time wanderings It's manageable, because they stay out of harm's way mostly (behind your back, that is; and it's gonna be you who shoots first). Occasionally they even blast away a zombie. But during night-time, the situation is wholly different. Your base will be assaulted from two sides - left and right. Once the zombies break the outer  barricades, they're inside, and then you're as good as dead. You can switch between all 3 characters, but control only 1 at any given time, and it'll have to be you runs left and right, repair the barricades constantly (and repairing is slow as hell), reload the turrets - and shoot because your teammates will aim everywhere but the head.\n\nSo this is a typical situation...\n\nYou repair the left barricade (which is on, like, 10% health after the last wave). You work like a maniac, while simultaneously holding off a horde of super powered red giant zombies. Then you hear the same group of zombies gnawing the barricade on the other side. Your teammate just stands there, aiming at nothing. The other shoots at the legs. You gnash your teeth; this zombie group on the left is dead, and you want to run to the other side - because, oh! they're gnawing, tearing down your defenses! - but the left barricade is only on 25% health; if you leave it now... hell! You have to go now, or the right side'll be breached. You run, jump, start shooting, there's like 10 zombies on the right, barricade on 20%, you finally clear them, barricade now on 5%... start repairing!!!!... but what's that? The already weak left side is being torn down - again! - as you repair the right! If only your teammates would run there and shoot them - in the damn head! - but no... so you leave your ramshackle blockade, run back to the left... when a new group springs on the right where you just left. Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu----!!!!!!\n\nYour teammates can't do any work on the base, when this is vital for a successfully survived night. They can only shoot, and they're not really good at that either. As I said, they don't aim for the head, and on shooting stronger variety zombies anywhere else takes ages and a lot of ammo. And, with each passing night, the zombie assault is stronger and more relentless. Also, since this is basically a flash game, during the thick of it you'll frequently experience lags and slowdowns which'll be just the distraction that makes the difference between life and death.\n\nOn top of that, the scavenging relies on pure luck. Beside the base in the middle, you have 2 areas to the left and 2 to the right to explore. Each time you re-enter them, area length, amount and type of zombies, and amount of material to scavenge spawns randomly. Which means that occasionally you'll come back with bags full of scrap while encountering light resistance, while other times you'll encounter just the congregation of zombie's toughest that'll obliterate you and not a piece of scrap on the floor. And all the essentials you HAVE to buy are pricey, and you can't afford a bad day's scavenging, really. I had to resort to "cheating" of sorts. If I didn't get the desired loot, I'd quit and reload the day (the game saves automatically every morning), and hope for better luck. If any one of my teammates died, I'd reload again because you need to switch between all 3 to make it through.\n\n"Deadly 30" is challenging, yes, but for all the wrong reasons. And even though technically on each playthrough you'd be having a different experience, the night-time assaults are always the same, and there's really not much to maneuverer around. For example, If you don't upgrade your barricades to lvl. 3 by the, let's say, 7th night, you're gonna get squashed. If you don't have the last lvl weapons by the 15th night, you're done for. If you don't buy this and that by n-th night, it's game over. It's just a matter of finding the right formula by trial and error, and then to rely on luck to grant you some extra materials while scavenging... or you reload and try again.\n\nDESPITE it all, it's fun - but for one playthrough only. And yeah, it's cheap. So, I'd recommend it for the price. Buy it, survive, forget about it.","March 5, 2014","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Brought to you by an indie developer team which worked on such documentaries as Black Sunshine, how to wear pants and other works on Newgrounds, the game has a distinct artstyle and humor, from diarrhea to The German's melee weaponry. In terms of gameplay, you must collect scrap used to upgrade things and buy/make ammo for night when the hordes come. The game isn't too difficult due to the ability to medikit spam, and that The German, is overpowered with the shotgun (as they should be). The majority of the early waves can be beaten easily if you explore and even stay out at night and put the majority of your points into armor/speed upgrades. The story is generic zombie fair and there are enjoyable cutscenes throughout, however it is more of an afterthought with the game's focus on gameplay/survival. The flaws in this game are the arbitrary lock ups and frames per second drops, which can be dealt with by pausing, so it isn't gamebreaking, and that there are limited options for the game (although for one of this nature its not needed).  The game despite the overall objective, is relatively short to complete. Overall its recommended as a casual sidescrolling survival shooter experience.","November 9, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is an extremely simplistic zombie side-scroller however it is extremely entertaining as well! The voice-overs were a little cheesy but the gameplay is definitely worth the money. There are only 5 "maps" that you can explore before you need to rush back to base to defend. You may upgrade your team or choose to upgrade your base. There needs to be a balance of both or else you won't have a chance of surviving. It was challenging at some points; monitoring when the sun goes down is huge.\n\nMy only criticisms would be that I wish there were more than 3 characters with more than 3 weapons, I wish there were more maps, I wish that there was at least a local co-op with partial controller support, and most of all I wish that the game had more content for after you survive the 30 nights.\n\nIt is extremely repetitive but I found myself playing this game quite frequently.

First and foremost it's un-optimized resourse use, i.e. it lags for no apparent reason. Secondly it's voice acting of the German girl. The lines are pretty fun (espec that nein-nein-nein which I assume was taken from Inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), but the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Lastly, you can't control your party-members, where as it would be nice to make them defend one side and you defend the other with turrets or something like that.\n\nStill, it's a fun game with all those stereotypical characters like super-macho American, supremacist German girl and a reatard Russian. Even if you die, you can continue from the lastest auto-save and basicly can restart if the recource drop was crappy (yeah, it's randomized, so you can get all or nothing dependong on your restart).\n\nI don't regret buying it, but a) there could a muliplayer mode, b) better optimization is highly required in a patch if there is one planned.\n\n6/10","January 12, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I suppose you could argue with the fact that it is made in Flash, and it can get rather "rinse and repeat" after an hour or two, but the combination of variety each level, and the terrific art style of Gonzossm (who is a Youtube animator, not normally a fully fledged game designer). There are some slowdown issues when there is too much happening on screen, but that is remedied by reducing the graphics a tad.\n\nThis game would have been fantastic with multiplayer elements, such as 3 player co-op, or a mode where a 4th player spawns the zombies and the other three have to kill them. This game has potential, and hopefully an update is thrown out to resolve the lag and slowdown issues, but overall, you should get it.\n\nAnd for those who say that the price doesn't justify the game content, many games such as the likes of VVVVV, the Bit Trip series, The Binding of Issac, are quickfire games that have succeeded in the past, and began off at the same price point as this game.

The problem with the game is after a point you can just skip through the nights like nothing.  Having 6 heavy turrets all you gotta do is repair and reload the turrets.  Also there is only 5 zones with the only difference being the background.  Near the end of the game it's impossible to survive outside.  50 zombies charge you constantly and just over whelm you.  If the game was any more then it is I would probably say "OH GOD NO" but if you're a fan of old style flash survival games...  Then you'll be into it.  Oh and the weapons are not balanced...  The US soldiers gun is terrible.  While the shotgun chick can mow down 5 zombies with a single shot.  And the sniper...  Is good for taking out little babby zombies.","January 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

While there's nothing inventive in the game, it's pretty cute for what it is and is worth a few hours of mindless fun/achievement whoring. As many do complain about, the game lags the more you play it, which shouldn't happen for a game as undemanding as this. Setting its processing priority to as high as possible while lowering the asset quality helped me immensly, so I can't complain about that too much. The game scales well in difficulty, the exception arguably being the end.

This is especially true when you take into account that everytime damn time you die you start off at the beginning of the day and have go bloody salvaging all over again just have your damn mouse click off the screen forcing you to find the stupid window again, often just in time to watch your character being mawled to death by the undead SO THAT YOU HAVE TO SALVAGE ALL OVER AGAIN!\n\nI haven't had a game make me rage-quit in a very, very long time, but Deadly 30 made me want to quit, delete it and never ever ever ever play it again.\n\nThe sound is great the graphics are as good as one might expect. The system design is pretty decent and the world is laid out in an interesting way. The f***ing melee is like trying to eat soup with a splayed popsicle stick. The difficulty curve of the game makes me wonder if the devs actually wanted me to play it or just buy it and feel very annoyed.\n\nMaybe you really enjoy being frustrated? Maybe you'd have a lot of fun playing Deadly 30. Maybe when you played Rings of Power (see Genesis) and Void showed up and was like "Yo, what's up you're dead, hope you saved." you had a jolly chuckle and jovially reloaded your save file you twisted weirdo you.\n\n","January 9, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

During the day you pick a direction to go in and find random amounts of scrap to buy upgrades and supplies(ammo, medkits).  As you scavenge you have a chance to run into two other characters who are placed randomly, the german with a shotgun and a stronger melee, and the russian with a rifle that pierces multiple enemies.  When you kill zombies you get experience towards leveling up which opens up more upgrades to buy.  There's a level cap of 13 which I hit at around night 18 or 19 and there's a few unlocks that seem to be purely asthetic.  Running out of levels to unlock changes killing zombies from fun to more of a chore.\nAt night your (and possibly you're two other) character has to hold back an increasingly strong wave of zombies.  You have to save your scrap as much as you can in order to purchase expensive turrets and fence upgrades or by the time you hit night 30 you will just get steamrolled no matter if you've maxed out your characters upgrades.  Each character has four guns to upgrade to but the even the best guns feel impotent towards the last five nights.\nLastly the voice acting makes me wish I could turn the volume of the dialogue down to zero.  The german is a grating female nazi stereotype, and Russian is a painful Yakof shmirnoff impression, and the American is the usual gruff patriot constantly saying that he loves america.\nPotentially worth several hours of fun, but if you try to play it in anything but windowed mode it will constantly suffer from horrible slowdown.  every time you start to enjoy yourself everything slows down to almost stand-still and your character starts acting on his own, sometimes causing unavoidable cheap deaths.  So you have the option of playing in eye strain vision, or in full screen slug motion.   Pretty generic, you could find something equally entertaining on kongregate for free.","January 8, 2014","false","5.1"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

It actually says "you have been warned!"\n\nThis is slightly annoying, because the minimum specs for my OS (Linux) are "Processor: 2.33GHz" and I have a quadcore CPU that runs at 2.80GHz. But also because I can not for the life of me figure out why this rather simple game should need that much CPU in the first place.\n\nThen, I realise that the game runs in 800x600. Only. The settings menu offers no way of changing this, and the game runs in a 800x600 window, no matter what. This means that you will click outside of the window in the middle of the action, sooner or later. Sure, the game pauses when this happens, but it kind of ruins the flow...\n\nBut I still give the game a chance. And it is a bit of fun actually. Braindead zombieslaying action with a hint of levelling, good enough to kill off a couple of hours. The difficulty ramps up very fast, but you keep your level and unlocks between playthroughs, so that helps at least a little bit.\n\nBut then I realise that I have gotten a whole bunch of the achievements in the game - but they are still locked in steam. And even on early nights/waves (night 8/9 for me) the game starts lagging like I read about in so many reviews.\n\nSo my advice is to avoid this game, at least until it runs as it should. Beacause right now it is NOT worth your money - I bought it very cheap on sale, and I still want my money back.","June 7, 2014","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a base where you can play tower defense in, and you have to use crouch effectively and aim for headshots so that your generator will take only minimum damage at most.

Monetary value is likewise harder to define as a result.\n\nLet it be said that this game is not polished in the slightest. That being said; this game has it's own distinct charm, albeit obfuscated by rather sophmoric humor.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in the gameplay. It has some interesting ideas on gathering supplies by day and mounting a defense by night; two elements that are intertwined together pretty nicely.\n\nThe graphics are a bit hit or miss. They are colorful and quirky, and are at least fun to look at. My quips tend to derive from some of the exaggerated upgrades; the game themes itself as a WWII zombie survival game, yet incorporates nerd elements like Samus Aran's armor and Saiyan armor amongst the upgrades; which admittedly is somewhat cool yet also clashes with the theme more than I'd prefer anyway. I'm not even a history buff really; it just seems somewhat out of place.\n\nFor the feel of the game; it feels like a very well crafted flash game at the end of the day. I've played a few other zombie survival 2d shooting games and have had relatively the same amount of fun there than I'm having here with Deadly 30. It can be guilty of repetion to some extent; the grinding for salvage probably being the main contributor to such fatigue, yet at the same time I can't not recommend it. It's a pretty good game for what it is; just be sure to pick it up in a sale. Fatigued as I am of zombie games in general this game turned out to be a pleasant surprise; if you can look past the poop jokes (there will be poop jokes).","September 25, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I think this game is easily worth the 25 cents.  If it is still going on, get it.  If not, read the following review to help you decide.\n\nDeadly 30 is a side scrolling, 2D shooter.  You play as an American soldier who finds himself fighting zombies during WWII.  He later becomes friends with (ironically) a female German Nazi, and a Russian Soldier.\n\nWhile this games story isn't that great, the gameplay is pretty fun.  During the day you walk along a path, collecting scrap metal and killing zombies.  During the night (assuming you make it back to your base), you hide inside a building and try to fight off the zombies until morning.  You use the scrap metal to upgrade your weapons and fence, and to build sentry guns.  To some, this may seem repetitive, but I liked it.\n\nThe dialouge isn't anything to brag about.  It's just some witty one liners.  Also the Russian soldier is basically a stereotype, spouting lines about fighting bears and eating potatoes.  If you are offended by that, I wouldn't suggest this game.\n\nMy only major complaint is that the game tends to lag a lot.  There doesn't even have to be that many enemies on screen in order for it to lag.  It also has a limited resolution, only going to about 1300 x 700.  While they aren't game breaking, I hope they fix these issues in the future.\n\nIs this game worth $5?  I'd say yes.  While some may say it's just another zombie flash game, it still held up.  This is really impressive since it was made by only two men.  If you think you would like this game, then chances are you will.","September 20, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaist/recommended/264730/","Gaist","Gaist Heidegger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaist/","1036 products in account","Gameplay for Deadly 30 is a fairly straightforward mashup of genres.  You begin play with a machine-gun-toting American soldier in a dark forest and stumble upon an abandoned building, soon popping a generator online to shed some light on the situation: there are world war II era zombies about and they'd very much like to break into the place and have you for breakfast.  To prevent this, you go about the business of undergoing forays into neighboring areas looking for 'scrap' to fund bolstering your newfound base's defenses, upgrading your gear and resupplying your ammunition and med-kits.  Character control is accomplished through WASD for movement and aiming with the mouse cursor.\n\nBy day, you range and gather--and by night, increasingly difficult hordes of zombies (and other assorted enemies) assail your headquarters.  Whether you're out ranging or hunkering down to defend the base, your line of sight is limited in that the camera focuses primarily on what's ahead of the direction you're facing--and at night, you can't see terribly far beyond the light the base throws off.  I found this to be a fairly clever method of adding tension given the presentation, as especially during the nightly sieges you can find yourself focusing on defending one side of the base uncertain of how well the barricades are holding up on the other (which can lead to being caught by surprised from behind.)\n\nYour base is positioned in the middle of the 'black forest' and the map spans two regions to either side of it--a cornfield and mountain to the left and a snowy field and 'castle' to the right; bear in mind that these areas exist entirely for scrounging for scrap and turning up the other characters.  Most of the core gameplay revolves around weighing how far you risk ranging from the base in order to retrieve more valuable scrap--as being caught outside the base once night falls is exceedingly dangerous; additionally, there are always more numerous / harder enemies on your way back to base than your way away from it.\n\nAlong the way, you'll also gain experience and level up--which serves to make progressively better weapons / defenses available to you; you also have the chance to come across two other characters by way of a shotgun-toting German woman and a rifle-bearing Russian man with a strong affinity for borsch and vodka.  When it comes to upgrades, you can strengthen the barricades on your base, add stacked crates as a cheap fallback to stall zombies that breach them and later add automated defense turrets to help alleviate some of the heat during sieges (though the turrets require manual reloading, adding some periodic tension at tight moments.)  In addition to purchasing progressively better weapons for the characters with scrap, you can also upgrade your armor and boots in order to better weather enemy attacks and more quickly traverse turf as you scrounge for scrap.\n\nOnce you have more than one character, you can switch back and forth between them and leave the others under relatively tame AI control; they'll accompany you out on your foraging for scrap during the day, and when you're back at base they'll perform a (reasonably) OK job of helping to cover your defenses.  Any given one of the three characters can be killed during the course of play--if there is a character remaining, you'll swap to them when the one you're controlling dies.  It is possible to re-discover characters who have died during future days to add them back to your roster, but you may be stuck for a day or two before they turn up again.\n\nIt becomes quickly apparent that Deadly 30 doesn't take itself terribly seriously and is often pretty intentionally goofy with how over the top the characters are portrayed--primarily through cutscenes which crop up from time to time as you progress through the days.  One of the enemies which crops up, the 'red giant', is a decisively silly looking menace, but it's all played fairly tongue-in-cheek (as also evidenced by the final weapon upgrade for the Russian being an alien laser blaster.)\n\nHealth doesn't regenerate and med-kits take a decent chunk of scrap, so you're incentivized to minimize the damage you take from zombies; as well, you do more damage crouching when you fire and (as one might expect) landing head-shots.  There is no manual saving--instead, the game saves your progress upon each successfully completed night.  Your ultimate goal is to survive 30 deadly nights, culminating into a brutal final siege as you await helicopter extraction from the roof of the base.\n\nThis is a curious little game which ended up surprising me quite a bit--after having purchased it as part of a Steam sale previously as so many folks who stockpile big backlogs, I finally decided to give it a go on a lark and see how it was.  What was initially going to be a quick stretch to see just how Deadly 30 played turned into making the full trek through thirty nights of survival and clearing the bizarre besieged finale.  Some of the art is rather peculiar, but I felt like it ultimately came together to be pretty cohesive and fit with the tone of the game.  I had a surprising amount of fun with the game and can safely say that I recommend it--but in the interests of fairness, there are some caveats to be aware of:\n\n-By default, Deadly 30 plays in a fairly tiny windowed mode; the fullscreen resolutions are bizarrely sized and also still pretty small (iirc the highest was a 1300x1100ish resolution.)\n-Despite being a relatively simple game visually, there are some performance issues; when there are quite a few enemies and sprites flying around (shell casings, etc.) I occasionally experienced slowdown.\n\nI've read of folks having more severe issues with this (especially with their cursor being delayed) leading to getting killed.  I've got a pretty beefy machine, but during the final day 30 finale siege there were points where it brought it to a crawl.)  I didn't run into any crashes or the like while playing, otherwise.  Those elements can be frustrating, but the game itself is fun enough to put up with them in my opinion.\n\nOverall, Deadly 30 is a fun, quick romp with a surprising amount of heart and I'd like to see more from Ignatus Zuk and Gonzalo Villagomez in the future.","July 11, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It challenges you in multiple ways and can really become quite hard. Getting caught out at night really does change the game a lot. It can be a little overbearing, and so you can quickly learn what time to head back home. Searching for scrap is often about luck. Sometimes you can find 2 or 3 tanks in an area to scavenge from, other times you can only ever find what is left on the ground. The game has basic movement and controls and because of this is very easy to learn.\n\nIf I were to point out any issues, it would be the lag. I have played a lot of games with lag before, but in this game the lag has killed me more times than zombies. I assume this would be a problem with the game as I have heard other similar complaints. I simply suggest turning down the graphics to minimise the problem (It won't remove it completely). I believe with a high end model computer this game would not have these issues.\n\nBut with that aside I still recommend the game. The graphics are bad no matter what setting you have them on, but I feel like it adds to the game somewhat. The gameplay is great and I would say this game is well worth the time and the money that it would cost you. So what are you waiting for?
