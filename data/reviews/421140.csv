Not because I'm any good at testing stuff, but because I genuinely enjoyed playing it.\n\nBlades of the Righteous is a turn-based strategy with two main aspects - managing your fantasy kingdom and fighting battles with the vile spawns. As the wise ruler that you are you get to recruit an army, choose individual skills and equipment for each unit and participate in random events that occur on the map - gather resources, deal with merchants, necromancers and other wanderers. And then there are battles - these can get rather challenging as the game progresses and will require careful tactical approach and planning.\n\nThe main campaign of the game can be completed in 3-5 hours depending on the chosen difficulty level and your skill. One way to prolong the experience is to delve into side-missions - these are pretty straightforward and there is a repetitive element to them, but as the events of the game and spawning enemies are random, each mission plays out differently.\n\nFor me personally the game has a fair amount of replayability - after completing it twice I am still eager to start a new playthrough, try various team setups, develop units in a different way and maybe finally beat it on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe video and audio of the game are simple, but pleasant to eyes and ears. The battle theme is quite cool, and the graphical models for units are awesome. My favorite are the peasants - they just look so well animated.\n\nTo sum it up - I have no hesitation recommending this game, especially if you enjoy games like Heroes of Might and Magic or X-Com and are down to play something similar, if a bit more simple in design.","March 7","true","32.8"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","23","38","4","2"

A (tiny) bit of base building, simple tactical battles and that 'one more turn' addictiveness that keeps you playing for hours when you only meant to spend a few minutes.  You customize your units by buying skills, and those skills improve in interesting ways with use.\n\nSatisfying and worth the purchase price.","March 11","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Definitely seems like a good deal for the price, especially if you catch it on sale.\n\nFor the actual review:\nThe concept of the game is nice. Simplistic and good. The option to stop and continue anytime is great (autosave is included after every turn).\nThe graphics - again, simplistic and nice.\nThe UI is a bit problematic IMO. You often have tooltip windows being blocked by other things, I've seen a typo or two, and in general it's not as responsive as I'd like it to be.\nAlso, fullscreen mode is a no-go until the graphics setting are tweaked for different screen sizes.\nWhat would I change? Again, the UI a bit. Make some parts of the game more obvious (like stating that every single action outside the castle spends an entire turn, or that new conscripts arrive every single turn). Maaaaybe add an option to remove existing skills from soldiers. Add a reward indicator to the mode selector in the screen between modes (the one for spending XP on new units and such). Not much more.\n\nSo yeah, a good game, needs more work, good deal for the money - especially if you catch it on sale.","April 13","true","4.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","1"
