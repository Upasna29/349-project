You're a dead rabbit, who's also the prince of Hell, who's primary mode of transportation is a buzzsaw with an assortment of guns attached to it. That says plenty, right there.\n\nThat said, if the silliness of the game doesn't interest you, then it's not for you, as the gameplay is less than stellar. The platforming and shooting is mediocre at best, and frustrating at worst. If you're interested in this game, I'd honestly reccommend watching a playthrough rather than playing it yourself, as you'd probably have more fun that way.\n\nThe personality IS pretty great, though, not going to lie. Hell, if it does well enough, maybe we can see a sequel with enough of a budget to improve on the actual gameplay and be a truely radical game.

Quite liked its graphical style and sound assets for most of it but in the end its not enough to way up for the bad parts of the game.\n\nMost achievements are things you will get simply by progressing forward in the story which is quite nice. One of the few that require more focused time is the JACKPOT! achievement that requires you to get the jackpot on one of the games slot machines. There is litttle you can do about this one as its based on luck so be ready to spend a fair amount of time on it.\n\nTime to 100%: ~7-9 hours","January 3, 2014","true","9.5"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","40","48","0","0"

The game feels like it was made for the 360 controller, so I never played with the keyboard.\n\nThe game has low system requirements, so it should run well on most computers. For me it always stuttered for about half a second each time while auto saving, but this was the only issue I encountered.\n\nMain review:Hell Yeah starts off with a story just as wacky as the rest of the game. You play as Ash, the skeleton bunny prince of hell, who has gotten private pictures of him bathing with a rubber ducky leaked, so to not seem like a weakling, you have to kill the 100 hell monsters who have seen the pictures.\n\nThe game itself is mostly standard platforming. You jump around, avoid obstacles, shoot stuff and navigate the levels to get to the 100 monsters. Each time you encounter one, and get its health down by shooting it or using objects in the environment (depending on the monster) you will get to play a mini-game for a chance to land the killing blow. The mini games are often just matching the right button(s)/get the timing right, but there are a few other ones. There are a lot of different ones, so each one isn't used more than 3, maybe 4 times.\n\nYou get to upgrade your health and weapons, and some levels have vehicles: in one you control a submarine, and another one a space ship, and the game turns in to a twin stick shooter. This was quite a nice change of pace.\n\nWhat the game does best is all the wacky things happening:\n\n*Killing a monster by lifting weights, turning in to a super sized muscular bunny that kicks the monster into a soccer goal so the net slices it up? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482545\n\n*Starting in hell, but after a few levels placing you in an overly cute world, with background music with lyrics, where a woman with a French accent sings "You're a fancy bunny - Together, we're happy"? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482634\n\n*Low on health, health bar reads "F**K"? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474286510\n\n*Shop with rap music and a bunny robot clerk, bouncing lowriders in the background? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474286379\n\n*Get the controls reversed and the game writes "LOL" at the screen, troll style? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482603\n\nI really enjoyed all these things, and I realised that for me, I didn't come back for the gameplay, I came back for all the wackyness. To come around a corner, hear the muffled rap music indicating a shop nearby, enter and hear the full "Money, money gold!" rap parody. The music in the game is very enjoyable and well done.\n\nOne design choice I didn't like is that after you stop moving, your character "glides" a bit, which makes it really hard to make certain jumps. You get the jump just right, but when you land at the very small platform, you glide over the edge. This makes the controls not feel very "tight". Combine this with the level design, which has the checkpoints maybe 3-5 minutes between, and some sadistically hard jumps with insta-death spikes if you miss your jump, and I guess that this will send quite a few gamepads airborne and lead to rage quits. When you repeat the same 3-minute section for the 10:th time and have to play it all over again, yet another time. You also have to rewatch any "cutscenes" that appear during that section.\n\nI'm no pro platformer, so there were sections where I had to try many times to get it right, and even though I have lots of patience, I was close to quitting a few times.\n\nSo, I wouldn't recommend this game only for the gameplay. It's fine but it has its drawbacks. If you think you would appreciate all the crazy stuff happening, and can ignore the annoying parts, you're up for a good time with Hell Yeah!","July 3, 2015","true","9.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

If you find a metaphor in Hell Yeah's relentless assault on your eyes and sanity, it's only because it's about to get dropkicked by an angry demon rabbit riding a giant spinning death blade with a jetpack on the back.\n\nThis is one of those games where the design process didn't involve whiteboards and long discussions, but some chemist's secret stash being ground up and dripped into the artists' eyeballs. You're Ash, disgraced rabbit prince of Hell, on a quest to kill 100 wacky monsters who saw paparazzi photos of you playing with a rubber duckie in the bath. That's as sane as Hell Yeah! ever gets. It's a game where firing shark missiles is all in a day's work.\n\nHell Yeah review Hell Yeah's drillable rocks look delicious. You'd eat that at the funfair.\nGetting to your enemies is relatively standard platform fare, with the twist that you can often drill through obstacles, boost jump around the place, and acquire different weapons. Actually killing your foes, however, involves playing Warioware-style microgames such as stealing honey from a suspicious bee to unleash an appropriate fatality move, which might be having a dinosaur bite their head off for you.\n\nIt's the chaos of Earthworm Jim in the levels of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with a little Ren and Stimpy/Invader Zim (delete according to age) thrown in for good measure. Gags and minigames repeat more than they should, but still survive the repetition of gags and minigames repeating more than they should, which both gags and minigames do.\n\nThe action itself, while enjoyable, soon lets things down. While Hell Yeah! is a fantastic looking game, it's one that paid more attention to looking good than playing great. There's so much going on most of the time that it's often hard to take in and get a proper read on the levels and what's going to hurt if you run straight into it.\n\nMore routinely irritating are the controls, where double-jumps, skids and simply being knocked back by enemies will often frustrate you. You want an Xbox 360 controller for this one. You could play it with a keyboard, but only in the same sense that technically you could fly if you flapped your arms hard enough. Either way, prepare for unhelpful checkpoints, and the irritations of repeated cutscenes and similar hold-ups soon being promoted to fully-fledged annoyances. They take the shine off the chaos rather than the fun out of it, however, and you soon return to the forward momentum Hell Yeah! needs.\n\nThe game's obvious enthusiasm carries it over these bumps in the road, and if you can forgive, you can easily forget in the race for the next bit of insanity. Hell Yeah! is no platforming classic, but it's cheap enough to be worth a punt if you like the idea of its craziness, and crazy enough to get your money's worth long before the end.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n72/100\n\nHell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit\nGory, beautiful chaos, if a little frustratingly rough behind the scenes. A good afternoon’s chaos, and that’s what matters.","February 17","true","4.2"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","33","48","9","1"

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is a zany comedy action-platformer where you go on a bloody rampage as a skeleton bunny, fighting to regain your throne as prince of Hell while armed with drill (more like a ring blade) and a huge variety of improbably heavy weapons. I won't go into details because humour constitutes the game's greatest value but Hell Yeah! will keep you amused for a couple of hours, or for about 25 to 30% of its overall content. It's just the sort of product that makes me apprehensive of "comedy" games; past the initial chuckle you'll find that there's very little in the way of content.\n\nStill, I'm giving Hell Yeah! a Thumbs Up because although I was apprehensive of its many questionable design decisions, I've found nothing too offensive during play and the shock humour DID succeed in making me laugh. Design decisions such as mapping jump to a face button, aiming to the right stick and firing the right trigger; it seems cumbersome to do everything at once but there is enough leeway preventing you from getting frustrated. Or like holding jump for a floaty "jetpack"-like super jump. You dread the moment where you'll have to "float" just underneath a set of ceiling spikes but such a situation never occurs.\n\nThere's A LOT of material to go through so you're certain to get your money's worth, except that it does get repetitive after a while. Hell Yeah! makes an earnest attempt at providing as much monster variety as possible but inevitably, monster patterns and executions loop around and the game turns into a slog. You gain about a dozen different weapons but little to no difference in strategy. There's even extra value in the form of post-story extra missions; but they usually involve platformer racing or killing a certain amount of enemies within a time limit. The most pedestrian of added content.\n\nIf you've already obtained this game during the Sega giveaway and haven't played it yet, then save it for a rainy afternoon or during a period when you're particularly down in the dumps. Avoid reading about it as much as possible and simply allow the story to surprise you for as long as it can. If you do not already have this game in your library and are currently staring down its 16,99$ price tag, then no, I most certainly do not recommend the purchase. Steam sale only, with the understanding that you're playing this game strictly for laughs.","April 7","true","9.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

You will kill a hundred of different monsters by a wealth of ways. OK, maybe a lillte "bloody" for some gamers. You can really enjoy yourself by playing this crazy devil rabbit. Don't worry about the achievements, because they are neither missable nor demanding your micro-operations. The single tough one is about a slot machine, on which you will maybe spend around one hour by pressing "start" (E on the keyboard). So if you don't want to waste your time but you indeed want this last achievement, you may need a automatic clicker.\nIf let me to score this game, I will give more than 90/100.\n\n这是一个非常诙谐幽默有趣的游戏。可以把这个游戏叫做，怪物的100种死法？可能对有些人来说觉得有点血腥，好吧，其实那些怪物最后都被收服了，而且本来就在地狱里，还想死到哪里去。如果你是完美成就控的话，完全不用担心，没有成就需要你二周目或什么高端技巧，基本都是通关就可以得到了，想补齐也很简单。唯一一个难的是要求在赌博机上得到777，可能需要1小时来刷，但是如果你用个自动按键的话，就非常轻松了。总之，我愿意给这个游戏90/100的分数，的确非常适合让人放松愉快。","March 23, 2014","true","10.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/205230/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Hell Yeah! is an action-platformer where your goal is to slay the 100 monsters that saw your embarassing photos. Ash, the Prince of Hell, definitely wants to protect his image. The game packs plenty of jokes and copious amounts of blood. It's also built like a metroidvania, but at the same time, doesn't feel like one.\n\nAlso, there are a number of problems with this game that interfere heavily with the fun experience of slaying and collecting monsters. Let's start with those problems first before going into what the game does right.\n\nThe Issues\nThe game resolution seems to be 720p and is upscaled to any higher resolutions. This gives it a blurry look which is unpleasant. I was able to look past it because the gameplay kept me engaged until the other problems revealed their final form.\nThere is a slight momentum to Ash's movement which causes the game to feel clumsy. This can result in unintended falls if landing on the edge of a platform or slipping since angled surfaces cause Ash to automatically slide down.\nThe wall jump in this game is Hold A and bounce off the walls type of deal. This kind of button assignment creates a frustrating number of incidents that result in bouncing backwards when you're just trying to platform normally with the double jump where if you hold A for each jump, you gain more height.\nThere are some trial and error sections and blind jumps with the latter being rare.\nWhen you die, any conversations or camera pan movements that highlight an area of the map are reset and play again. And again. With each and every death. This is one of the most annoying things about the game.\nThe checkpoints are not the greatest.\nMonster slaying minigames can kill you if you're not quick enough to figure out the gimmick. Most of them are ok. Others are annoying.\nVery barebones options menu.\nI didn't like the sections where weapons are taken away as much, especially since you lose the rocket (wheel) jump and have to deal with the wall jump.\nAiming can be difficult and when jumping around at the same time.\nYou don't explore for hidden items. It's mostly a finding cash type of deal to spend in shops.\nHell Yeah! has good points too. I liked the silly customization. The humor seemed fine to me. I liked the monster descriptions. Drilling through things felt pretty good. The visual style looks good. Some of the monster slaying mini-games are fun or over-the-top (some of them are repeated). It has a weird management meta-game. Finally, the action portion seemed just fine and the weapon variety is there to support it.\n\nI can only recommend this game to people that have more patience than me for trial and error. Based on my experience, I have to give it a thumbs down, which is a shame since I enjoyed most of my time with the game, but lost any desire to continue. For reference, I slayed 60 out of 100 monsters.","February 20","false","5.5"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit may look like an engaging platformer at first glance because of its cartoony art style and a promise of a crazy, adrenaline-fueled adventure but the actual product gives its players nothing more than a mediocre experience and unchallenging gameplay. Granted, the game starts off strong and sets its comedic tone in a mature yet quirky fashion but it quickly goes downhill once the lack of difficulty becomes apparent and the looming repetitiveness sets in. I'm still giving this a recommended even though I didn't enjoy it that much because I can see the potential and it's hard not to see its appeal over a select audience. If it works out its kinks in a future update, I may change my opinion about it.\n\nHas a mature yet comedic tone though some jokes fall flat and may make one cringe, especially the pop culture and self-referential humor.\nAppealing art direction. What you see in the store page is what you get in the game: a cartoony version of hell that's oozing with style and gore.\nMetroidvania-style gameplay albeit at a much relaxed pace and with simpler mechanics. Too bad that the level design is so-so for a platformer and exploration doesn't yield rewards.\nControls quickly change according to what peripheral you're using at the moment and can be rebinded. Also, KB+M can be used in the menus and UIs which is a really nice touch considering that most AAA ports don't do this stuff. The problem with the controls - which many players are experiencing - is that there's some sort of extra momentum with every action, making everything feel slippery.\nPC-exclusive options are very limited.

But after a while, the spare checkpoints start to infuriate you as you die countless times in some of the places. Make no mistake, this game is HARD. It starts to get boring and the game feels like I chore. If it wasn't for my OCD for unfinished games, I'd have stopped playing this at about 50th or 60th creature. After that limit, the game gets very bland very fast.\n\nThere are some neat ideas though. "The Island" is a very fun addition to the game. It helps keep things interesting and fun for a while. The creatures are really funny and most of dialogue is above average in terms of creativity (there are some old, boring jokes and memes though).\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game only if you have a lot of patience and an insatiable hunger for platform games.

It's a mix of both. Let me explain:\nThe humor is hit and miss - at times it's genuinely funny, at times it's extremely childish. You could say it's for both kids and adults, but in my opinion that's nonsense and it just isn't consistent.\nPlatforming and killing is the heart and soul of this game. It performs well in the killing aspect, especially the finishing (mini-game) moves, and not too bad in the platforming aspect, but the controls take some time getting used to and the platforming is at times very imprecise, which results in you falling off ledges regularly.\nAnd I really disliked the backtracking, even if it's for short distances. This is no Metroidvania game. Backtracking in this game is an artificial way to extend the game and it's highly unneccesary if you ask me. It is already packed with content so there's plenty of other stuff to do.\nSeriously, if I had the chance to buy this game again I would've waited for a discount.\n\n[Rating: 62/100]","October 7, 2012","false","2.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","2"

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is I guess an action platformer with puzzle elements.\n\nIts an enjoyable experience clocking in at around 4-6 hours depending on whether you go for 100% of the achievements. Its a very easy game to perfect, so if you're looking to improve your completion rate and its in your library play it.\n\nThe graphics are cartoonish. yet work well with the game and atmosphere. Hell Yeah! is split up into different worlds, all as colourful and imaginitive as the next. Your objective is to kill the monsters(mini bosses) in place, there are also main bosses and a final boss. Your main way of getting around is a spinning wheel with spikes on it. You also have an assortmenet of weapons like machine guns, RPGs, shotgun, etc. You can customise your characters look and wheel, these customisations are just cosmetic but they're humourous.\n\nThe story of the game is also quite entertaining where Ash(protagonist) has pictures taken of him in the bath and called out as being a ♥♥♥♥♥ so he goes on a search for said pictures. The soundtrack on the game works well with the game and further immerses you into the game, where each world has its own track in place.\n\nThere are some negatives and they're that the game even at 5-6 hours does slightly drag some of the monsters you have to kill maybe could of been removed. When you kill main monsters(mini bosses) you have a little mini game with a death animation. There are only a certain amount of death animations and mini games and where the mini games don't get annoying the kill scenes do and they break immersion from the game itself.\n\nOverall though the game is enjoyable its worth a look for a couple of pounds/euros/dollars but there are better action/platformers on the market.","February 22, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You play Ash, the skeletal bunny prince of Hell. Your dad croaked and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ demon took scandalous photos of you so your mandate to rule is in question. The story is dumb and the humor errs on the side of trying too hard, but it's a good enough setup for murdering tons of demons. Which is your goal, killing 100 demons in all kinds of gruesome ways. Your main weapon is a sawblade (they call it a jetpack and I have no idea why) that lets you kill normal enemies by touching them and wear down the big named monsters. Once you wear them down you get a little WarioWare-style minigame to finish them off in some bloody, goofy way.\n\nThe platforming is solid, though the emphasis seems more on exploring to find money and secrets for upgrades than on fighting. Combat really is mostly a non-issue since you kill things by touching them and you have a ridiculous amount of health.

It has its flaws, I'll get to that, but it has so many killer merits that it is just a pure pleasure to look at and especially to play. How a great game like this gets a 64 metacritic rating displayed and a truly awful game like house of dead ice skating ninjas gets a 79 displayed is beyond stupid. Metacritic and the dimwit reviewers they combine are all ran by blindfolded monkeys banging on keyboards. This game is easily a 75 or higher. It can get absolutely frustrating at times but with a little effort you will get by. Seems like that's a trend now: try finding a game made in the last 6 years that does not have at least one part that is astronomically frustrating. The game has somewhat loose controls meaning that you will careen into things, fall off a platform when you don't want to, and other minor control issues, but amazingly it isn't that big a deal. Like I said, with practice, every ♥♥♥ is totally kick-able.\nOne of the most wildly creative games I have ever seen. It has great graphics with everything within a level pleasing to look at. The art direction is some of the best and most creative I've ever seen in a game. I could not ever tire of looking at this game. The real gem of this game is how you kill the main enemies. You go through the game and your goal is to eventually find and kill all 100 special monsters. Once you whittle its life bar down, it shows a screen where you do a brief mini-game to finish him off, ranging from tapping the A button (I'm using a wired xbox 360 controller, a controller is highly advised) to matching up a symbol or answering a question. After that, it shows a really hilarious kill animation. One had me do a little driving mini game where I avoiding things on the road for a little bit with a semi, then the kill on the special monster was a giant semi smashing into it then backing over it about 20 times. Another had a satellite shoot down a kill beam and a NASA control voice counted down from 5 and it destroyed the monster. There are a bunch of different ways and they are all cool to see. But of course there aren't 100 fatalities, one for each boss. No there are much less than that so you will be seeing repeats of fatalities but, for me anyway, they mostly never get old.\n\nHouse of Dead Ice Skater Ninjas is a pass. Pass it and play this. I am mentioning that game because at the time I had just beat that game right before I started playing this one. This game is a lot of crazy fun so you can forget garbage indie games like that. Loving every minute of this game. Besides this games (minor) flaws, I can overlook them because of how wildly fun it is and how intelligently creative the whole thing is.\n\nSuch good work done here, 8/10\n\nPS – TAYLOR SWIFT IS SO ♥♥♥♥♥ HOT!!! she wont return my calls =(","October 27, 2014","true","11.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Both meet very high standards in most areas.\n\nEverything else is proved to be an underwhelming experience.\n\nYou go about killing some "mini bosses" to unlock doors for bosses. If the idea of mini bosses excites you don't get your hopes up too fast. They have one attack pattern, are easily killed, although sometimes you must kill them without weaponry.\n\nWhen you get them to low hp, a mini game starts. The mini games have a lot of variety which ranges from tapping one key, catching falling stars, to tapping several keys at the same time, all placed in an awkward position (e.g. x+v+spacebar+e). The mini game you are given decides what will be the killing animation, which are all silly. What they do have in common is that they get boring quickly and can't be skipped. Some minigames have a timer so if you are not quick enough to read the instructions you will lose the minigame and actually take damage, potentially killing you which is highly annoying.\n\nThe platforming itself is mundane at best and worst, although you do get to fly with a spaceship, pilot an aircraft and drive a submarine. But even those things didn't offer a big enough relief from the overall boredom I was feeling. The most annoying thing in the game happens when you get hit: Similarly to oldies like Ninja Gaiden, you get knockbacked when you get hit. The damage immunity after the hit doesn't last long enough, so it is possible that the enemies play ping pong with you, you get knocked back into instant death spikes, or lose half of your hp because you got knockbacked into a wide boss and can't escape without getting hit a few more times.\n\nIf the beautiful background and fitting music is enough for you, by all means, this game has one of the the best I've seen.

Its a platformer where u can also use various guns or rockets to kill your enemies. Some positives about this game are the various ways in which u can damage your enemies and the variety of minigames u have to do for the sweet kill animations on each monster (shark rocket is my favourite). The game can be a bit frustrating to play at times but aside from 2 issues which are the enemy respawns (too often) and the use of instadeath spikes (too many) its the right kind of frustration. I would recommend though not getting this game at full price because while its a fun experience its also very short. If u are gonna buy it u should definitely go for 100% achievement run because getting all of the achievements is pretty easy. I would give this game about 8.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/205230/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","You know how you've always wanted to play a demonic stygian rabbit prince with a buzz saw and missile launcher?  Now you can!  This is the strangest tale about a bunny in Hell since Matt Groening started drawing.\n\nHell Yeah! is a platformer (shooting type), which feels like a slight throwback to Sonic The Hedgehog in areas (especially a casino level).  I say slight because the similarities are superficial.  As a platformer, it is not the best, and far from the worst.  The design is good enough to be a fun game.\n\nWhere the game really shines, though, is the creativity of the design, but that is not without criticism.  You will quickly forget that you are in Hell, and there is no logic to the levels or encounters.  It's as though the designers put whatever was on the top of their heads and said "that's cool, do that".  It gives the design a random feel, overall.  I don't say that as a bad thing, but the Hell theme gets lost in the craziness of it all.  Awkward ideas like healing from blood showers become commonplace very quickly.\n\nThe game has a major overreliance on unlocks and minigames.  Fighting a monster opens a Mortal-Kombat-esque finishing movie, which is done by playing a minigame before performing the fatality.  These are very simple games that are extremely easy, often parodies of other games like Guitar Hero, but they are not always clearly explained and have very short timers.  There are sections of the game which require specific costumes to pass, which can be confusing when there are between 100-200 masks to go through.  There are sections of the game where gameplay changes entirely, with different vehicles or losing your wheel, these are practically minigames in themselves.  None of which are fully realized enough to be a full game.\n\nThe major sin of a bad platformer, of course, is poor controls.  Tight controls are what separates great games from bad ones.  This game has almost good controls, but the issues that it does have make the game frustrating, and are very apparent in the side-missions.  You continue to move after you stop moving sometimes, rolling off of ledges or into obstacles too easily.  The jetpack isn't always reliable, though when it works it is useful.  The worst problem is with getting hit.  Most classic platformers had the sense to give a player slight immunity after getting hit, not for easy playing but because the consequences for getting hit can be catastrophic.  This game sucks at that, and is a good example of why games like Mario were made like they were.  A single hit throws you back without control, where you can immediately get hit again and start bouncing around like a pinball with limited movement.  When this happens, you can still move, but the results can be unpredictable.  When one-hit-kill osbstacles are present, the game just becomes frustrating.\n\nThere are a variety of weapons and cosmetic unlocks for the game, which are accessed as rewards, or through the in-game shop (not real money, fortunately).  The guns are interesting, but you can pick one you like and use it for most of the game, there is not much reason to switch weapons around.  The shop quickly becomes irrelevant when you get enough money, which is plentiful, and you buy out the store.  At that point, you still collect money, but why bother?\n\nFor all of its faults, though, it is a fun platformer and an easy game to get 100% achievements on.  Not awfully difficult, and not awful.  It certainly is worth it just for the craziness of it.\n\nYou're a fancy bunny.  Together we're happy.  You will be my honey.  We'll never be lonely.  Little rabbit, oh my little rabbit, deep inside you...deep inside you, you're not a nasty one.","February 26","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sometimes they get angry or sad and you have to straighten up that attitude.\nZone maps and monster radar.\nLoad times are less than a second.\nCons:\nHitboxes are always questionable.\nMovement is sometimes floaty and awkward.\nOne of the abilities you get early on can screw up your platforming by activating unintentionally.\nThere's QTEs or minigames that only give you enough time to figure out what to do, and no time to do it, so half the time you're doomed to fail(and you'll take damage or die from it).\nSome minigames ask a multiple-choice question that you could not possibly know the correct answer to, because it's just randomness in an attempt at being funny.\nPure RNG achievement for winning the jackpot on a slot machine.\nMissing achievements for many things such as 100% completion, collecting all weapons and upgrades, completing all side missions, buying everything, finding every hidden item or various island tasks. So doing those things seems pointless. There's potential for challenge runs too where you restrict your health and weapons.\nA lot of the fights were very easy, including endgame.\nThere was no ending. As soon as you land the final blow, it just immediately cuts to the credits.\nThe death scenes are repetitive after a while and can't be skipped.\nIt's easy, and I didn't even use some of the items from the shop that make it easier.\nThe game seemed to drag on a bit. It felt like there were way more monsters than there needed to be when so many were killed in the same way as multiple other monsters in the zone that weren't challenging in the first place, only time consuming.\nGraphics options only consist of resolution and a fullscreen toggle.

It stars you as this undead bunny that rules hell and has to travel through it kicking hippie ♥♥♥.\n\nIt features a modern cartoon style and in general it's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. My main gripe with the game is the platforming aspect is too lose and simple. There's just not enough challenge in the game and it's unfortunate considering everything else feels alright.\n\nMy favorite aspect of Hell Yeah! is the customization.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megaseven/recommended/205230/","megaseven","MegaSeveN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megaseven/","334 products in account","This is a quirky little almost-Metroidvania-like platformer that doesn't require too much skill to get through. You spend most of the game riding around in a spinning blade wheel (that doubles as a jetpack for limited flight) and fire various weapons to take down 100 bosses and all the little minions that get in your way. But there are segments where you pilot other ships with their own special weapons and even run around on foot without any weapons. The real selling point is the WarioWare style "microgames" you play once you've depleted a boss's health. They're all pretty easy and the end result is usually the same, but they're a fun little reward for your work.\n\nWith so much variation in the gameplay, it's a shock and a shame that it all ends up feeling so repetitive. Despite the large amount of boss microgames, a lot of them play similarly (stop something that is moving in a specific spot, press/mash specific keys/buttons, etc.). Add on the fact that there's far less than 100 of them and you'll start to get tired of them near the end. The special vehicles are a little bit of a letdown too with a couple of them playing exactly the same. Finally, outside of a few special cases, most of the weapons act essentially the same. To make matters worse, the shotgun is so overpowered and can blast through walls you normally have to drill... it's hard to justify using anything else once you buy it.\n\nThat being said, I'd still recommend this game. Overall, it's pretty fun, not too long, and has a silly sense of humor.\n\n7/10","March 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The other play style without the wheel allows double jump, climbing up perpendicular walls. In this playmode sometimes you don't have your guns so you have to use the ones provided by the stage. The variety of guns in this game is great you have a pistols, machinegun, minigun, rocketlauncher, flamethrower, holy water gun (yup, this is a thing) and much more.\n\nGraphics and performance\nGreat variety on stage design you sometimes can get lost but the map is really handy and will help you find the way.

You can't go wrong with at least trying the game. Some of the scenes are comic and everytime you kill a monster you play a "minigame" in order to finally defeat the monster. Said monster is then added to your Island; it's another game-mode that monsters you've defeated basically "work for you" by finding money, gifts, HP, etc. There are about 101 monsters. All of them must be defeated to finish the game. There's plenty of missions to go along with your quest but do not need to be completed to finish the game.\n\nControls ARE sloppy, it was really frusturating when I kept wallkicking and falling unintentionally. The wheel that you're in does not have traction so you'll 'slip' whenever you stop moving. Some of the dialogues from monsters are repeated when you fail to defeat the monster so you'll have to go through the whole dialogue again after you die.\n\nI give it an 8/10. I only wish there was more replay value. After you finish the game, you might be getting that "thank god it's finally over, now I can finally uninstall this for good" feeling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/205230/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","Product received for free\n\nHell Yeah! is... complicated. There's a large cast of enemies with unique (often disturbing) designs, each with their own little tidbits about them and name, there's very few repeats and recolors amongst them. The game itself is energetic, chaotic, and every stage will usually add something new to play with. On top of that the game plays well. The issue is that there's a lot of components in place that MAKE a great game it's just the execution ultimately makes Hell Yeah! mediocre, but still memorable enough to garner some sort of affinity - either postive or negative.\n\nSo let's start with the design. Hell Yeah!'s plot is essentially "compromising photos get out that undercut the ruthless and cruel nature of the Prince of Hell, Ash (which is you), 100 monsters saw it so 100 monsters (and the so-and-so who took those pictures) have to die, go get 'em tiger." As soon as you get into it, you'll notice how brightly colored and animated literally everything is. It's VERY difficult to pay attention to everything and Ash moves pretty quickly meaning you'll likely run into things. As nice as all the animated things are, the fact that the background is as alive as it is most of the time, it'll be difficult to spot the various traps and shots going your way. Meaning you'll die, a lot.\n\nAsh attacks mostly through use of his giant saw-wheel-jetpack which can drill and shoot. You won't really be drilling much unless to kill simple enemies who get too close and to drill through certain rock formations. As soon as you hit zone 2, drilling enemies is overall a bad idea and is replaced by shooting them. Soon after that you realize that with the proper upgrades, you can have your guns drill much more effeciently for you (hint: buy the shotgun and missile upgrades, you'll rarely need the gun later in the game) meaning that drilling isn't that great. Same thing for a dash upgrade which requires you to stand completely still to charge before going forward a rather pitiful distance. Great for drilling certain structures but ultimately very niche and you won't be using it much because - again - missiles and missile type weapons are better for drilling. Finally, certain enemies can only be shot and killed from certain angles so you might be jumping and shooting a lot, which is hard given that you have to aim with the right stick (if you used a controller like I did, as the game recommends) and jump with the A button. Which is really awkward. Meaning you'll die, a lot.\n\nFinally, the game is cluttered with somewhat invisible checkpoints at moments where the game decides it's important to save your progress. If you die, you lose everything you got from before you activated that checkpoint. Typically there's a checkpoint after killing one of the many monsters and through important stretches. But these are numerous enough to be useless at certain points and agrivating when they don't come up after particularly difficult stretches of a level (I'm looking at you underwater zone 3). So if you go through a long maze-like area, grab a lot of money which you need for upgrades and better weaponry, and then get killed by a boss or by the level itself and have to grab it again. Even better, the game will record how much health you had at the checkpoint, meaning that you can respawn in a difficult area only to be severely handicapped until you find a health station somewhere, often much too far away. As if to remedy this there are items you can purchase that will temporarily aid you and boost your survivability until death but these are even RARER so they're never really useful even when you find one of the few shops. Killing a monster also requires beating a short mini-game each and every time, some are difficult some aren't, and they all increase in difficulty as time goes on. There's enough variation that they aren't annoying features, but what is an annoying feature is that failing them recovers some of the monster's HP and takes away a scaled chunk of yours, depending on how far into the game you are. Meaning that you'll die- you catch my point yet?\n\nMost of this review has been negative, but I don't want to take away the fact that I am recommending this game because despite these flaws it's still very entertaining and unique. Well, as long as you can tolerate the emo cute theme, I liked it so I was fine with it. There's a lot in here that makes it feel bloated, but still not to the point that undermines what this game does effectively. Exploration is encouraged and fun, yet restricted from a linear path that you HAVE to take. There's a little management game that you can play with defeated monsters in the background, but the rewards are pretty much worthless and there's very little interactive elements to it. Weapons are unique with their own abilities, but are typically beaten out by its upgrade or weapons you can buy from the shop. Levels and stages are unique so you can't guess what'll come next, but there's no real feeling of progression as every level is disconected. Defeating monsters is cathartic and a large majority of them are absolutely horrifying and wonderful, you can see the love put into them, but the minigames make some more annoying than difficult and pad out every fight.\n\nReally every thing this game does right is hindered by another element. But it still tried to do these things and they almost worked, it's really really close. To me that's what matters and that's why I recommend it. Though more around the $10 mark than full price.","May 30","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today, I installed this game to try it out, because the DLCs were on sale... Well yeah, finished the game in 1 sitting of 5-6 hours with 100% achievements. I have to say it was addictive, even though if it was pretty short. Also, the game was very easy, I did not get stuck for more than 5 minutes on something.\n\nThe graphics are just plain nice, the game has an intense amount of gore and the soundtrack is awesome. There's alot of old video games reference in this game, the characters are well done and they have interesting personalities, the game has alot of bosses ( Around 100 or 105, ) the level design is good and it's an amazing platformer. The game had some humor too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it has it's bad points too:\n\n-Double jumping sometimes makes you wall jump, which can kill you.\n-Sometimes you can reach places you shouldn't have reached that early, so you either need to die or have a hard time backtracking through that part.\n-Somewhat short.\n-The same ''Fatalities'' are re-used at least 4 to 6 times each, there's still about 20 though.\n\nOverall, yes, I definately recommend this game.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is a modern day take, and parody, of classid 2D platform games.  I found it very entertaining, with fun gameplay, impressive visuals (seriously, the aesthetic of this game is incredible, it looks really good), and lots of beautiful, gorey, gratuitous violence.\n\nHell Yeah! sports great controller support, a nice soundtrack, and really reminded me of Jazz Jackrabbit in a way - it's the closest game I've ever played to it, and it really took me back.  If you've ever played Jazz Jackrabbit (if you haven't go play it now) you'll immediately see the resemblence, and you'll be reminded of a game Epic would have made had they had the resources modern day game creators do.  It has snappy load times, great optimization, a *huge* amount of customizable hats and skins for your character to unlock and find, and lots of weapons at your disposal to destroy your enemies with.\n\nThat said, it isn't a perfect game - the controls aren't very tight, they're actually pretty "floaty" (in a bad way), and dying can make you feel at times that it wasn't your fault, but rather the controller or keyboard.  It's not like Super Meat Boy where you know it was you and not the interface.  This, coupled with the fact that the respawn locations can get pretty far away from each other towards the later part of the game, can cause for some aggravating gameplay mechanics, where you're backtracking through stuff you've done 10 times before and keep dying at the same spot because you couldn't stop on a dime like you wanted to.  The game also doesn't have many options (graphical or otherwise) to set, it's really plug and play, and you can tell it was designed for consoles as well as the PC.  I couldn't even remap my buttons properly.\n\nBesides those negatives, Hell Yeah! is a riot.  There are fun little minigames every time you kill a "boss" monster, but they do repeat themselves (there's 99 monsters, so this isn't too bad, as there is a large variety of the mini-games and they're all grapically pleasing and end with a huge explosion of blood).  There's also a section of the game called "The Island", and it's where all the "boss" monsters you've killed go to hang out - it's a neat little feature as you can micromanage them to earn you extra money, life, and special rewards like new hats and skins for your character.  I did find it a little weird you had to actually quit out of the game and go back to the main menu to access this area, but, as stated before, the game is optimized well so it wasn't a huge issue.\n\nIn conclusion, Hell Yeah! is a funny, fresh, current, and hip platformer that has a great aesthetic style.  I enjoyed it, although found it tedious at times.  Had it had better controls and a few more tweaks here and there this would be a must-play, but unfortunately as it stands it sits at the middle of the pack.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit you play as the prince of hell, who was photographed secretly by paparazzi while bathing, now you go on a quest to find all 100 monsters in hell who have seen your nudes and exact revenge.  Gameplay wise I feel like it sits in a place in between platformer and twin stick shooter.\n\nThere are a variety of weapons and tools to use in your quest including but not limited to, Rocket launchers, mini guns, grenade launchers, giant buzsaws, shotguns, and lazers. After defeating each monster to finish it off you are brought into a variety of WarioWare type minigames to get that final hit. if you fail the boss heals a little and you have to do it again. While not complex the finishers were pretty fun, in my opinion.\n\nThe game has a lot of stuff in it to do, you've got customizations to collect, weapons to purchase, and even an island where you keep your monster friends who do jobs for you (slave labor). There are even side missions you can complete for extra rewards. While the game is not very long if oyu rush through it, it can be quite substantial if you try to collect everything and 100 percent it.\n\nI recommend Hell Yea! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit to fans of platformers, adventure games, sidescroling shooters, and anyone who just likes and indie game with cheesy comedy.","April 26","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Solid platformer gameplay, good graphics, toilet humor and violence.  It holds up to that promise for a good while too.  Much like most of anything involved with Whitesnake, it really doesn't hold up in the long run though.  Perhaps it's the coke and booze, but I'd guess it's more from a bad case of repetitiveness and tedious boss fights that start to get frustrating the further you make it through the map.  Still, if you can find a copy for cheap, it's a good way to while away some hours, especially if you like platformers and hair metal aesthetic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/205230/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Product received for free\n\nA cartoony metroidvania-esque game.\nIts gameplay consists of the typical shootyshoot and platforming like many other metroidvania titles have although it's incredibly underwhelming in the metroidvania area since there is very little reason to go back to anything aside from the few points when you have to near the end of the game. There are some cosmetic gifts you can try to find and some simple side missions but they're not very rewarding themselves.\n\nPlaying with both a KB+M and a controller are both doable. During some segments though it's far more ideal to use the mouse for the faster aiming since for some reason using the right analog stick for these particular sections is incredibly slow whilst the mouse is as fast as you move it.\n\nThis game likes to emphasize about its loads of violence & gore but it's hard to take seriously since the entire game's animations look like something I'd see in a mobile game. With its groan-inducing humor and cartoony artstyle though I guess it shouldn't entirely be taken so.\n\nThe main goal throughout the game is just to platform your way through extremely standard maps to find and kill special monsters so you can unlock doors where you're to platform and kill more monsters so you can unlock more doors to do the same thing and eventually fight a boss, which itself is a part of the special monster pool. The special monsters are basically the keys to unlock doors when they're dead and for most of them it's an incredibly tedious process since the method for taking them down are usually either shoot them down or grind them down with your sawblade. Afterwards, as their HP reaches 0, you have to go through this Warioware-like minigame each time. If you fail the minigame you take loads of damage and they remain alive so you'd have to hit 'em a small bit again to get their HP down enough and do the minigame again where upon actual victory, you'll be treated to an unskippable slideshow-esque Adobe-Flash-like cutscene of a kill. Because there are loads of these special monsters in the game you'll encounter the same minigame and cutscene again and again, so even if you're a fan of the eye-rolling humor in the game they'll lose their appeal. As I got bored of seeing the minigame's reused cutscenes I tried alt+tabbing to another window for a bit and apparently it pauses the entire game sort of so the cutscene itself would just hang there until I went back to the game where it'd finally continue the little slideshow.\nWhile much of these monsters are tedious to kill there are quite a few that get pretty clever in terms of finding the method of killing special monsters but these mostly appear at the later half of the game. At these times the game turns into a puzzle platformer sort of.\n\nNearly all weapons have unlimited ammo as they constantly recharge themselves. I never found myself using all of them since I didn't particularly need more than but a few.\nIf you're using a controller, trying to use the sawblade and a gun can get confusing. By default you press RT to drill with the sawblade but to shoot your guns you have to aim with the right analog stick and then press RT. I found myself drilling accidentally when I should shoot too many times.\nFor some wad of a reason anything that's even mostly off-screen is invincible. You can shoot in their direction but if you can't see them you can't hurt them no matter how big of a target they are. This becomes a serious problem against enemies that require you to move a lot to evade anything that'd hurt you. It's as if your fired projectiles disappear from the game as soon as they leave the screen.\n\nCheckpoints aren't the best and are made a little worse plenty of times when they're right before a cutscene of sorts where characters speak. Each time you die at these times you'll have to go through the cutscene over and over again.

It's an incredibly slow platformer that doesn't have the best controls and the only real reason the game is difficult because it's unfair.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game that would probably fix most of the other gameplay issues is that the screen is INCREDIBLY zoomed in. Too many deaths were caused because I was moving somewhere and an obstacle came up before I had time to react. There's a button that lets you zoom out and see more of your surroundings, but it pauses the game, so it kills momentum and you don't think to do it often.\n\nBut besides that, the cartoon gore gets dead quick, a lot of the screen effects are incredibly hard on the eyes (I didn't use 2 high powered weapons because they make the screen flash white), and the humor is unfunny and unoriginal.\n\nOnly reason I would recommend picking this up is if you want to easily 100% a game.","May 23","false","8.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is not good, and it is quite the example of false advertising. In fact, I'd rather go to Hell than be forced to play this game again.\n\nThis game appears to be targeted to the "I'm 14, I play Five Nights at Freddy's and I'm so edgy and random lolz rawr XD" crowd. Everything revolves around this motif. The protagonist is a cartoon skeleton rabbit that shoots his way through a Hell, flled with more cartoon animals. The artwork looks like doodles in a notebook, and the sound effects and music do not particularly fit with the theme and the concept. Listening to "The Crunge" or "D'yer Mak'er" on repeat for a few hours is a far more fitting soundtrack. At least the memebers of Led Zeppelin realized how ridculous these songs are, which maes them enjoyable. The game developers, however, lacked this self awareness. The unskippable and repititive dialogue (more on that in a moment) is filled with bad one liners and attempt to be funny. You know when an adult tries to be relatable and cool? This game does exactly that. In fact, I'm surprised that Hillary Clinton hasn't used it as part of her strategy to reach out to millenials (this is not a political post please don't attack me Valve mods).\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is marred by several serious flaws. The controls are incredibly awkward, and they somehow feel both stiff and slippery. It feels like someone coated the character in cold butter and threw him onto an ice skating rink. I know that WASD is not great for platformers, but it still is so strange. The rabbit has trouble dodging objects in mid air, which is something you need to be able to do well in order to advance in this game. He also seems to slide after you let go of the movement keys, which has gotten me killeed multiple times.\n\nI tried using a controller, as the game promised controller support, but guess what? IT DIDN"T WORK. I even tried it with multiple controllers, so I am sure it is not a problem on my end. With a controller, I couldn't jump or shoot. These are the two things you need to be able to do in order to play the game. I tried remapping the buttons in the options, but it wouldn't let me. This false advertising irritates me, and I'm suprised at how many games keep doing it.\n\nSpeaking of options, the option menu is absolutely pitiful. There are two options from what I remember. These are very basic keyboard remapping (no controller for you, peasants) and the option to change the sound from stereo to mono. That's right, no opton for changing the graphics settings. The game runs at a constant 720p, and upscales to your resolution. It already looks strangely upscaled on my 1080p screen, so I'd hate to see it on a 1440p or 4K monitor.\n\nThe action in the game is very mediocre. You get to choose between a variety of weapons, such as a sawblade, a rocket launcher, grenades, and assault rifle, etc.. The only problem is, however, the game restricts weapons to specific enemies. This only raises the question: WHY EVEN HAVE WEAPON VARIETY IN THE FIRST PLACE?! It's a pitiful attempt at diversity and longevity that I cannot appreciate. The whole gimmick with the bosses is that once you defeat them, you get to play a minigame to watch a gory death animation. These come in two varieties. You get to mash a button, you you get to hit a button at just the right time. These animations are reallly just glorified quick-time events. The horse is dead far before this game stops beating it.\n\nThese issues are made even worse with the fact that there is no post hit invincibility. If this was just restricted to a certain game mode, I'd be fine with that. But, ths lack of protection makes the bad controls even worse. You can be bounced all around the map and quickly go from 250 to 0 in a matter of seconds. It is downright infuriating how cheap this game can be because of it.\n\nThe godawful cutscenes are another issue. I mentioned that they were repetitive and unskippable. I stopped paying attention because every dialogue feels the same. Ash is a teenage punk, and talks back to authority figure because he is so edgy. It gets old quick. Also, you can't skip them. You just have to mash the mouse in order to go through as quickly as possible. There isn't even voice acting. IT's just reading. I don't mind reading, but if I wanted to read, I would grab a book. Also if you die during a boss fight, which you most certainly will beause if the garbage controls. you will often be forced to go through the dialogue you just read again. This is so annoying, and I hate it when developers don't fix this issue. No one wants to read your stupid text bubbles again.\n\nOverall, the game tries to be something that it's not. It tires to be a cool, edgy game with a unique feeling and concept, but it falls flat on its face with boorish storytelling and incompetent implementation. In fact, it eerily reminds me of Shadow The Hedghog. Both games star male animal protagonists that shoot and kill their way through dark, gritty, yet cartoony settings. They each have notoriously bad controls and serious game design issues. To give it that extra touch of cringe, both were published by none other than SEGA. You'd they they'd learn after their first try at such a game. Overall, I give it a 4/10. Maybe I'm just being too critical. After all, it is only a SEGA game that I got for free.\n\nHowever, if you are one of those 14 year olds I was talking about...\n\n10/10 edgiest game I've ever played\n\nCRAWLING IN MY SKIN","May 30","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The writing is super cringey, with plenty of references to memes that were stale even when this game came out in 2012. The graphics are all super saturated and vibrant and you never know what to focus on, and the level layouts are that unsatisfying, Jazz Jackrabbit-esque platformer layout where you just kind of meander around a stage until it's over instead of progressing in a meaningful path. The controls are insanely floaty, like uncomfortably so, and the game's got no gamefeel to speak of. There's no impact from any of your attacks or jumps or anything, it just all feels weightless and weak. The music also just kind of drones on; it's white noise at worst, tiredvideogamemusic.mp3 at best.\n\nThat being said, some of the art assets are really nice looking. The HD sprites are appealing and some of the character designs are decent. The animation is alright too and I appreciate that they tried to make the game colorful even if they overdid it and it's hard to focus on anything.\n\nDuring my 20 minutes with this game I just thought "I could be doing literally anything else.

I've played Sonic and Mario before so I have some expectations about the genre.\n\nThis stylish game has an amusing story about the prince of hell (who is a rabbit), who sets out to restore his dignity by killing 100 monsters after photos of him with a rubber duck in a bathtub were affecting his street cred.\n\nThe game runs flawlessly on my Windows 7 64 bit Core2Duo 1.87 Ghz, with a Geforce GT 430 1024 MB.\nThis game features Steam Cloud and Overlay Support, Achievements, and Leaderboards.\nIt does not have any cards.\n\nI found the overall presentation and style of the game to be very good with decent music and sound effects, but I did not find the gameplay fun at any point during my 3 hours of playtime, and that is what matters the most.\n\nAs I mentioned, I've never been a fan of the genre, but I personally found this game to be rather boring.\nBasically you run around a large (ish) map, collecting money and killing weak enemies while searching for the bosses that are your targets. You will often kill them in unique ways that feature a small mini game event. Once the enemies are killed, you can order then to do things for you in a seperate mini game such as collect coins or treasures. It's a unique feature for sure.\nYou then proceed through the door that only opens based on your current boss kill count and continue the process until you reach the stage boss. Sometimes you come across a store where you can buy customization skins for your character, or new weapon and health upgrades.\n\nUnfortunatley, none of this felt fun to me.\nThere are not a lot of mobs to kill in the first couple chapters, there are a lot of annoying instant kill hazards, (though the game seems to have unlimited lives) and a lot of bosses to fight...but the whole process just feels like a chore to me.\n\nI certainly don't feel this game is worth the full price of $16.99 CDN, so unless your a huge fan of the genre, I would avoid this game,\n\nThere are better games to spend your time on.","May 13","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's a simplistic Metroid-vania style of game. 100 monsters saw incriminating photos online of the main character so he's gotta hunt them all down so he won't be embarassed. As they are killed, new areas of the world open up. The plot is paper thin, but that's fine. There's a few mini-bosses in the beginning of the game, but after I reached around 50, there wasn't another boss until the final boss(es). Most of the weapons I didn't really use much at all. I kept with the trusty machine gun for most of the game. The cartoony graphics were reasonably well animated, but all the colors looked kinda washed out. At some points, there's just too much clutter on the screen and the game just looks like a bunch of random flashing lights on the screen. The DLC for the game is essentially pointless. I wouldn't get it if you have to buy it seperately. It's just some costumes and time trials. Hell Yeah! is just ok, and you might get some fun out of it.

About a year ago I played the demo for Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit. I thought that it was simply mediocre. The final game is a complete mess. Level design is incredibly odd. Platforms just seem to be strewn randomly all over the game with no thought put into their locations, making the areas incredibly awkward to travel through and the slippery controls don't help. I was constantly falling off of platforms, often landing on top of enemies or instant death spikes. Navigation only got worse once I got the wall jump. Most of the time when I tried getting onto a platform, I would brush up against the edge of it and the wall jump would launch me to the side, usually into enemies or instant death spikes. The visuals are incredibly drab consisting of red, red, and more red. There might be some blue or purple put in every now and then, but it doesn't make the visuals any more interesting. The music is always either utter garbage or completely forgettable. I wouldn't even classify it as atmospheric, as it never enhanced any of the areas. The dialogue is just awful. Characters are given little to no personality, the jokes are never funny, and are often pointless, and the set up for the story is just stupid. Photos of the Prince with rubber duckies have surfaced on the Internet and 100 monsters have seen them, so the Prince has to go kill them. Who thought that was a good idea? The rest of the dialogue is just an overused joke about the Prince being naked because he's just bones. Overall, I would not recommend this game. It's a boring, horribly designed mess that doesn't deserve your time or money.","March 20, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The environment and backgrounds are eye-poppingly colorful, detailed and stylized, but sometimes a little too much so--it can be easy to lose track fo what's going on. One really specific thing that I found frustrating, kind of a pet peeve of mine, was how far you get knocked back when you take damage--getting hit once often led to getting hit several times as I got launched into other hazards and enemies. In general I didn't actually find that much to like about to game, so I abandoned it partway through.","February 12, 2013","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The cutscenes for killing monsters are cartoonish and enjoyable at first, but gets repetetive after a while.\n\nColourful candy graphics.\n\nNothing in it has sense, though there are some lame atttempts. Like, when you kill monsters, they appear in your monsterpedia to bring some joy in the game by giving you scraps of information. You control a rabbit full of killing desire, but nothing else. Lousy attempts at comedy are the only ways he can surface anything in the game about himself, and that's it.\n\nThere is nothing to complete here whatsoever. Everthing you can get is straightforward along the path, and sidetracking is next to impossible. The weapons in game are uninteresting and you get them in bundles, instead of making it more fresh and funny to gain them (like for instance, take them from a corpse, or a secret compund, or some plot giving event, form the weapon from soemthing). The characters used in game to help rabbit, are episodic and at the end of it dissapear completaly (Nestor, the giant eyeball thing is more of a decoration). Shops are put in rare areas, the last area doesn't even have a shop I'm afraid, making player to relocate himself for whatever reason before the final battle.\n\nThe game mechanics are the ones that get the biggest blow. Using the pad its pretty much impossible jump and shoot anything due to lack of thumbs on your hands and index fingers. Enemies can shoot you from a great distance without problem, whereas when you try to shoot them, even when they're just pixels away from you main view, is impossible. The save system is just damm annoying. Its kind of hard to go anywhere in the game, once someone decides you can respawn with almost 0 HP, granting you eternal pain in the ♥♥♥ of finding any way to replenish your HP, which are scarce (either buy in shop, or find fountain or island).\n\nAnd speaking of Island, I know its an in-game mini feature that shouldn't bother needlessly... but why does it have meat factory? Its purpose is to give our chap 30HP a bite, replenishing it.  What's the point of giving your character 30HP when you have mx 550HP and enemies hit you for 120 HP a hit? Its like toying with player.\n\nThe ending of the game is terrible. Let me just say: the mid fighting long non-skippable dialog is annoying, and the fact that after the final fight there is no after story for ash (did he got back his pictures at least? What about future himself?) leaves player craving for bloodlust. Judging by the game's title "Hell Yeah". you'd think people care about grand entrances in game.\n\nAll in all everything seems like a bad case of Castlevania clone.\n\nPro's:\n\n+  candy graphic\n+- many weapons... repetitive design and bundle gift\n+- killing minigames!... which after a while get boring and you wish they were not there\n\n- non-skippable cutscenes\n- quirky controls\n- save games that wants you to spend eternity dying looking for save spot\n- childish brutality mixed with childish humour = bad taste\n- most anticlimatic video game end ever,","March 22, 2014","false","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That's all the time I need to know that this game just isn't going to do it for me.  The "tongue in cheek" humor is obnoxious, part of the whole disingenuous state of modern games and even culture on the internet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IloveLightning/recommended/205230/","IloveLightning","Dramamine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IloveLightning/","35 products in account","Hell Yeah! is a game about the prince of hell, trying to discover who took a picture of him playing with a rubber ducky while taking a bath. The picture is then sent out and 100 monsters have seen it. Your goal is simple. Figure out who took your pictures, and make your minions pay. You do this by jumping around and slaughtering said minions of hell using both your giant wheel of death, and a wide range of weapons, like Bazookas, Miniguns, and Grenades.\n\nHell Yeah! is a game full of charm, and every main monster you slaughter is greeted with a fun mini-game that upon completion gives you an insanely well crafted animation of you destroying the monster, ranging from the Invaders shooting rainbows at it, to a satellite shooting a laser down from space to obliterate the creature. A lot of the charm also comes from the great writing, which also teases some of the cliches that come with a platformer, as well as the fact that the game never takes itself seriously.\n\nThe level designs all feel varied, and the game also introduces tons of little mechanics that give you a sense of variety beyond just jumping and running, such as jumping into a cannon to shoot yourself around the level. The minions you kill are also varied in style and attack. Some enemies will require you to just go up and attack, taking them out quickly and efficiently. Some may require you to solve a small puzzle or discover some element of the stage that can interact with them, possibly harming them in the process. Through it all, fighting these enemies never feels like a chore due to the large amount of killing animations, and varied ways the game requires these enemies to be taken out.\n\nThe game also features several bosses, while the bosses so far have hearkened back to a normal playing style, they don't feel boring or out of place. They're all varied in mechanics and provide more humor as the main character and the boss banter a little before combat is initiated.\n\nHell Yeah! is a well crafted metroidvania style action-adventure platformer filled to the brim with great humor, and comical gore that's perfect for anyone. The achievements are also easy and great for any Achievement Hunter (or player) who wants a break from a serious game to net a quick 100%\n\nIf I had anything negative to say about the game, it would be about its length. It only took me 8 hours to beat and collect all of the achievements. The length of the game is slightly alleviated by having hats and wheel skins for you to collect, as well as the Virtual Rabbits DLC which is supposed to provide a few more hours of entertainment; however, these don't completely shift the weight off the games length, but it does at least provide some replayability.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10.","February 24","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play the rabbit Ash, the Prince of Darkness. Your mission is to find 100 zany monster in the depth of hell to recover incriminating pictures of yourself. The story is completley bizarre and thematically fits the game well.\nThe whole thing plays like a comic book come to life and the art is the main selling feature by far. Cartoonish violence and gore abound as you travel different parts of Hell, each weirder than the next. It works well.\n\nUnfortunately Hell Yeah! suffers a number of suicidal gameplay choices that kill the fun, especially as you progress into the game. Tragically most of these are extremely easy to fix if the developers had the inclination to do so.\n\nPlatforming in this game simply doesn't feel right. it feels incredibly 'floaty', as if the force of gravity changes throughout your jump. Imagine jumping against a low ceiling. Instead of your character immediately falling upon contacting the roof, it just hangs in the air and lands at the same time it would have if jumping in open air. This can lead to imprecision and frustrating deaths.\nFor a game that requires a lot of shooting, the inability to jump, shoot, and aim easily on a controller is utterly unforgiveable. Here are the key binds: R trigger shoots, A jumps, and R-stick aims. Just try it right now, grab your controller and try jumping with A and aiming at something with the R stick. Your thumb effectively needs to use the R stick and push A at the same time. The easiest way around this is to simply allow the player to rebind jump to one of the shoulder buttons, but the game does not allow any rebinds of controller keys. I had to play the game half with a controller for platforming sections, and half the game with a keyboard for combat. No reason this should be the case.\nAs mentioned, you have to kill 100 unique monsters throughout the game. While these are a highlight, they all must be finished off Mortal Kombat style. After depleting its health bar the old fashioned way, a Wario-ware style minigame pops up that you must win. Fail, and the monster revives and you take damage. While the finishers add to the overall game, the need for what is a complicated and even punishing QTE is not. There are some mini-games that are far harder than the monsters themselves (looking at your Hide and Seek).\nI have other less important critcisms. New weapons aren't unique enough, difficulty progression isn't really there with regards to combat, and an entire side-game called Monster Island feels wholly unnecessary. But its the above 3 criticisms that truly hamper the game and it cannot be recommended as is.","March 5","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The jokes aren't clever, the platforming is weak, and the combat is boring. It's such a shame that such a good art style got attached to such a crap game.\n\nHere's how the game plays out: awkwardly platform your way through some beautful level, with gorgeous animation, collecting coins, and find an enemy. Wear down his healthbar with your generic platformer gun of choice (such thrilling choices as, rockets, or machinegun, or flamethrower) When his HP hits zero, play an unassociated warioware microgame (Click on the shark not the missiles lol im so random guys) and watch a tragically poorly designed XTREEEEME deathblow play out, that you cannot interact with. (in this case fire hundreds of missiles until your enemy explodes into copy pasted giblets). Then the game incredibly slowly scrolls to the door that killing that enemy opened, (which can be multiple screens away) shows it opening, then slowly scrolls back. Repeat until you find a boss. Watch the boss throw projectiles at you while you wait for your gun ammo to regenrate. Kill the boss. Microgame. Thats it.\n\nThere's a facebook like subgame of assigning enemies you kill to "Toil away in the HP mines", and a shop that you can spend currency on to upgrade your weapons in a linear "make shoot harder.. durrr" way. The entire game falls back on it's "extreeeeme and edgy" personality, even the damn "quest" dialog does it. (Which by the way, has such great quests as "Kill Kill Kill Kill": Kill an enemy to unlock a door)\n\nIf this kind of irreverance sounds fun to you, go for it; Besides the great art, that's all this game is.

It tries to tell a lot of jokes, and will often spend time relishing in it's own punch lines, but for something that wants to be edgy and over-the-top I mostly just found it really boring.  The humor is akin to a second-rate Saturday morning cartoon.  If that's your thing, more power to you.\n\nFor me it was just a mediocre platformer that never really got me excited. It's basically a Metroid-vania game where all the upgrades systems feel roughly identical and neither the platforming or the combat get fleshed out enough to allow for skillful play.  Most of the deaths I got felt very cheap due to the camera being too zoomed in on the character (environmental awareness is crucial for a good platformer).  It's very frustrating to lose a lot of your health to some cheap enemy placement and have to backtrack past your last checkpoint to an earlier health station.  Bleh!\n\nThey also include some Wario-ware style mini-games when finishing a boss and the game just doesn't have the comedic timing or punch to make those as spectacular as the developers probably intended.  Mostly it just adds to the frustration when you lose your last bit of health to their "LULZ, SO RANDOM" style finishers and have to restart the same friggin' checkpoint again.\n\nNot technically poor or especially bad, just doesn't stand out as a platformer you should be spending your money on.","May 27","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was amusing at first, rolling around and shooting at anything that moved. And the fatality-like kills that resulted from defeating each boss were amusing at first ...\n\n... and then repetition set in, more or less at the 30 minute mark. There's not much variety to the platforming. The colors are obnoxious. There's not a lot of variety to how to beat the bosses. And the fatalities are recycled later.\n\nAgain, it's not bad. It's just boring. The map is helpful to understand where you are and where enemies are. The gamepad layout is fairly intuitive. The controls are reasonably responsive. Technically, it's okay. But it's painful to play after a while because it's so dull.\n\nAlso, don't bother spending time with the Island, which is simple prison labor management system using the enemies you've defeated to generate more money. I barely touched this and still had plenty of money to buy EVERYTHING in the game.\n\nReally, I only finished the game so that I can delete it without regrets and never think to play it again.\n\nI also had one of the DLCs, Virtual Rabbit Missions, installed. Don't bother with it. They're lame timed missions, like race to the end within the time limit or kill all enemies within the time limit. I think each mission is about 30 seconds, so it's really not worth the money.\n\nI'd probably give it a 3/10. Seriously, this game was so dull that I had to play it in small doses because it gave me headaches from the sheer boredom.","December 22, 2013","false","17.4"," 23 of 48 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","23","48","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thejadefalcon/recommended/205230/","thejadefalcon","❄ Snow Queen Jade ❄","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thejadefalcon/","1822 products in account","Well, this game started off feeling very low-budget and not in the good way, but that was the high point of my experience with it. The platforming is mediocre at best. Half of the time, it can be difficult to see what exactly is dangerous and what isn't, something that's immediately obvious from the first level where you, the so-called Prince of Hell, walk through flames without harm, except for those ones, which look virtually identical, especially in Hell which is composed of fire. Those flames will damage you, except for the ones that don't, got that? The story seems to start halfway through, like I missed a few levels or something, but no, it's just bad writing, the one consistent thing throughout the entire game. The jokes barely raised more than a weak smile at their best, which is rare. Landing a jump can be about as pixel perfect at times as Super Meat Boy, which would be okay a) you didn't slide everywhere like the ground was made of ice and b) if the levels weren't cluttered with useless junk as, unlike SMB's clean visuals, the cartoonish graphics throw everything but the kitchen sink into the background, foreground, every ledge, every trap.\n\nSpeaking of SMB, let's talk about respawning. How fast could you respawn in SMB? Instantly. Do you know why? Because a game in which you die that amount would get infinitely frustrating if you had to wait even a second to keep playing. Now, Hell Yeah is a game in which you can be stunlocked and die in just a few seconds as punishment for missing one of those pixel perfect landings or making a small error with it's clunky feeling controls. How long does it take to respawn? Well, the boss that made me just quit the game killed me in a method that took about five seconds before I actually died (I can't move or do anything during this period of time), another second or two for the death screen, another three seconds to respawn and then made me rewatch the boss's unskippable introduction cutscene. This happens every time. And because of the previous platforming issues, I have died quite a number of times on this boss.\n\nA previous boss required me to kill it with its own trap. Except how you do that is such a screwup of game design, I actually went into the next area searching for a way to kill it, killed an entirely different boss which was so painfully simple (make it run into a wall) and then had to go back to kill the first one. The way back was guarded by spotlights which signalled another unavoidable, stupidly long death. They were easy to avoid on the way down, but the way back up was hampered by the awful controls and the fact that these spotlights haven't even got any form of pattern to them. One of them literally stopped and zigzagged across the tiny platform I needed to get to for over half a minute. When it got off, I immediately jumped up, only to find the spotlight suddenly rush back to see me and I die. Again. And respawn at the bottom. Again. When I finally got back to the boss, I found how you were meant to kill it and immediately found another checkpoint (the one thing this game mostly gets right) so I didn't have to climb up the tower of doom again. I jump up to the trap to set it off and have it track me to target the boss. I mess up, die, that's fine, my bad. I start again, jump up... and immediately die to the trap because, for no reason whatsoever, it's set up in a different way this time. It pointed in a random direction every time I respawned, half of which were instant death because of the stunlock meaning I get thrown immediately into another source of heavy damage.\n\nThe writing is boring, with no reason for anything other than your Facebook pictures got leaked or something, I feel like all of my motive was in a prequel game to this (if there is one, I'm not actually aware of it). The jokes lack any punchline half the time beyond "lol, the skeleton rabbit is naked, isn't this amusing? Why aren't you laughing? Maybe I'll tell it again three more times, that should get a laugh!" Everything wants to kill you for some reason, except the times they don't but you want to kill them for some reason. When (if) you do kill a boss, you get "rewarded" with a minigame, which are either stupidly simple, annoyingly finnicky, QTEs or simple "mash this button until you get RSI!". At first I was okay with it as it looked like each boss got its own unique game, but when they started repeating, my interest dropped further.\n\nDo not buy this game. It's not worth £9.99 ($14.99), it's not even worth picking up on a sale. Wait until it's in a bundle with some more interesting games.","February 6, 2014","false","2.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Checkpoints and healthstations can be painfully far apart, and the only real reward you get for murdering bosses is opening gates to go do more of it.  The quick time events you must complete in order to kill a boss after you widdle their health down can range from simple to mind numbingly aggravating.  Sometimes you'll fight a boss till you're near death only for the quicktime event to be a demanding one you've never seen before, usually ending in you failing and having to start the battle over again from the last level checkpoint.\n\nFor the most part the only reason to collect currency is to buy costumes, as most of the weapons are unlocked with story progression.\n\nHad this actually come down in price over the 2 1/2 years since it's release I'd recommend it, but to this day apart from the odd sale it sits on the store glaring at customers for not wanting to shell out $15 for some hit and miss gameplay.\n\nAt the end of the day the tedium of the latter half of the game prevents me from recommending it for anything other than a $5 sale.","February 25, 2015","false","10.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

At first glance: a metroidvania-esque platformer with cool minigames on boss battles. And all this in a funny but climactic enviroment. The first half or so of the game seems to do it perfectly. The game also seems to get a lot more depth after you are introduced to the concept of "The Island".\nHowever, the second half of the game really lets all that go to hell, no pun intended. The level themes completely escape the hellish feel and become very generic. All the finisher minigames get reused in a slightly harder version, it really feels like the creators really wanted to make the game longer, but were rushed while doing so.Oh, and the Island? Loses any meaning so fast, it's not even funny, since you don't need anything from it whatsoever (you get cash very fast, find or buy the items, death has no consequences whatsoever).\nThe only thing good about this game? You can get 100% achievements really fast.

I got it in a bundle of software in which I was only interested in a couple of titles, but thought, "What the hell?  Looks corny.  I'll try it out.  I'm in the mood for something different."  This game surprised me with its take on the platformer genre - almost as if it's making fun of other platformers.  It was refreshing after playing through an FPS like Far Cry.  Elements and influences from other platformers like Metroid and Castlevania are clearly evident, but there's some Mario and Rayman influence in there too.  The game looks like it might be something made for kids, yet is decidedly adult oriented in its use of language and blood/gore, so one has to keep this in mind if in doubt whether on not they should get it for their kids.  Also, it sways drunkenly in difficulty between super easy and fantastically frustrating.  Instructions are sometimes in lack of abundance for accomplishing a mission, but for the most part they're thorough enough.  Certain parts are easier to play with a controller (like a lot of platformers) rather than keyboard and mouse, but others are much easier the other way around, so I found myself switching back and forth on occasion, which is a new experience for me on a platformer.  I completely recommend it, however.  I've had a lot of fun with it, and the dark humor in it made me laugh.  The story is ridiculous, nonsensical, and frankly HILARIOUS - again, a refreshing break from other games that I play.  As for price, I dont know that I would pay $15, but I got it cheap through Humble Bundle and it was worth every penny that went to it there.  If you happen to find it on sale, it's worth a buy, and I hope you find it as refreshing and funny as I have.  Enjoy!","June 16, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a platformer it's pretty confident the controls are responsive, sometime to the point of being... Twitchy. Some of the areas or platform puzzles are near rage inducing in either difficulty or just because they don't explain what your doing.\nIf your a person who dislikes QTE's (quick time events) then I definitely don't recommend this to you. There are 102 boss monsters to kill and the final blow for all of them is a QTE or occasionally a minigame. Failure to perform it causes damage which of course will lead to death on quite a few of them.\nThere are weapons to unlock and upgrade, plenty of customisation options, some of which are actually requred to progress, thankfully when an item like that is used the nearest shop will stock it for free.\n\nThere really isn't much more I can say on the subject of the game really. The story is stupid, but it reveals in that. The combat is pretty solid and the final kills on the bosses generally are entertaining.\nIf I'm honest I'm not sure I would recommend this at its standard retail value, if it were sale then go for it.","June 10, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fantastic, platformers aren't usually my type of game, but the vibrant colours, witty humor and action packed content of this game is epic! The characters and monsters are hilarious and it's so rewarding because when you kill certain enemies, you get a really funny killcam or like KO thing where your attack just goes crazy and OTT!

As a platformer it's pretty confident the controls are responsive, sometime to the point of being... Twitchy. Some of the areas or platform puzzles are near rage inducing in either difficulty or just because they don't explain what your doing.\nIf your a person who dislikes QTE's (quick time events) then I definitely don't recommend this to you. There are 102 boss monsters to kill and the final blow for all of them is a QTE or occasionally a minigame. Failure to perform it causes damage which of course will lead to death on quite a few of them.\nThere are weapons to unlock and upgrade, plenty of customisation options, some of which are actually requred to progress, thankfully when an item like that is used the nearest shop will stock it for free.\n\nThere really isn't much more I can say on the subject of the game really. The story is stupid, but it reveals in that. The combat is pretty solid and the final kills on the bosses generally are entertaining.\nIf I'm honest I'm not sure I would recommend this at its standard retail value, if it were sale then go for it.","June 10, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By that point, you start to realize how it's trying way too hard at... just about everything. Just think of it as one person in your group of friend's who has no special qualities that make them stand out or make people wonder where he/she is and what they maybe doing when they aren't around. This bland individual constantly trying to force their way in through being loud and obnoxious, or by trying to inject themselves into a conversation they only have a quick google search's amount of knowledge about.\n\nConversation as follows:\n-You and another close friend-\n"Hey man.. did you see the latest episode of trying way too hard"\n-Wrath of the Dead Rabbit (a.k.a guy who wants to fit in)\n"HAHAH YEAH DUDE! With the pew pew pew and the *explosion noises with awkward laughter* So sick!"\n\nThis game has tons of potential, but it lacks any solid direction of what kind of game it wants to be. As a result, all the features lack the punch it needs to stand out. At the very least, the comedic aspect of the game should be something special, but it pretty much has the depth of reading social forums or comment threads from youtube, reddit, 9gag, or where ever you can find a flamewar. It remains funny for a short while, then you have to draw the line and say. "yeah.. we're not all 14 years old here. Can you stop?"\n\nMy review may sound pretty hateful here and there, but don't let that stop you from trying the game. It's still fun, but not worth the full price of $15 dollars.","February 17","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fatalities that are used more than once often come with a little twist; eg the T-Rex fatality first uses a regular t-rex, the second time he's wearing glasses and the third time there's another subtle difference.\nThe story is simple; you're Ash, a dead rabbit which is ruler over Hell. Somehow pictures of you, without wearing clothes, end up in the wrong hands and to stop the laughter you are going to get those pictures back...\n\nThe game is good, i'd give it a 7.5 out of 10. That's a decent grade but games like Dust: An Elysian Tail & Ori and the Blind Forest are games that i'd give a 9 out of 10 because those are still better games (way better). But Hell Yeah has it's charm; some of the fatalities really made me laugh (especially the truck/submarine/truck fatality is great; you never expect the submarine to do what it's doing)\n\nplayed with a x360 gamepad; as for all platformers I advice to use a gamepad for better experience!","February 22","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So let’s start off with the story, it’s silly and fantastical to the nth degree, I loved it. It’s so off the wall zany that I had a blast with it and the crazy characters both friend and foe. The many worlds of hell are super varied and imaginative from the neon night club to psychedelic dream world I loved every one of them.\n\nOne particularly favourite part of mine was the huge amount of fatalities there were when taking down the 100 individually created enemies. They are all unique and die in a huge variety of bloody messy cartoonish ways. The vast arsenal of pure destructive weaponry was also another highlight, not feeling the magnum switch out for the flame thrower or one of a half dozen missile launchers, my favourite is the shotgun a must buy when you play.\n\nNot everything is great though, the controls are very tricky to master and even when you get the hang of them they still mess you up from time to time. The DLC missions on a keyboard or almost impossible and took me a few frustrated hours to complete. The in game dialogue is also much more miss than hit with no laughs at all from me the whole play through. The ingame options are also pretty much non-existent with no audio options or graphic changes of any type present.\n\nThat being said this game is a lot of fun and I would recommend giving it a go for a few hours of entertainment. If this is on sale pick it up and try not to think too hard as you splatter demons on mass on your one bunny crusade through hell.\nOne final note, I know I said it before but play with a gamepad, the keyboard is not good and will lead to a lot of frustration with the precision platforming in some sections and virtual missions.\n\nHave fun ːMMForFunː\n","March 16","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you happen to be above an instakill spike pit when one triggers, good luck not falling in when you regain control.\nEnemies will continue to shoot you during the boss kill animations, meaning it's entirely possible to die while killing one of the monsters and have to repeat the battle.\nInstagib traps (spikes, acid-spraying monsters) have a habit of sitting juuuuust outside the camera, meaning many occasions of leaping to your doom with no warning.\nHeals are few and far between. Have a clutch situation against a hard-fought boss? Better backtrack through the whole level to heal up, or else you'll be stuck one hit from death every time the following checkpoints load.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because the game does have its charm (maybe an over-reliance on flat attempts at zany humour, but charming nonetheless). I wanted to like it, as some really nice work went into designing the 100 bosses (at least visually - gameplay-wise not so much). But in the end, I only got through it out of dogged determination. Just shy of six hours, completed the game with all achievemens, and no desire to return to it.","March 13","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is silly but not in a bad way at all. The protaganist is an unlikely "hero" set out to exact revenge on his enemies who have publicly embarrassed him due to his love for "Duckies". The levels are crisp and detailed. The controls are tight and easy and simple to learn. The objective is to detroy all the monsters in a single level to open up the last door to the boss before moving on to the next area. The game is not serious at all and it is obvious from the short introduction during a new game and it finds several ways to make you crack a smile along the way. The only downside is the length of the game which is purely based on your level of skill with platforming. Players who are familiar with the game will find themselves having a good laugh and breezing through under 10 hours or so and others may find it a bit harder to purchase every unlockable and find every secret.\n\nIt may not be the blockbuster title you're looking for but this is definitely a game you should grab if you see it on sale! The platforming is perfect and it shows SEGA has mastered this genre over the last couple of decades.","February 19","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is silly but not in a bad way at all. The protaganist is an unlikely "hero" set out to exact revenge on his enemies who have publicly embarrassed him due to his love for "Duckies". The levels are crisp and detailed. The controls are tight and easy and simple to learn. The objective is to detroy all the monsters in a single level to open up the last door to the boss before moving on to the next area. The game is not serious at all and it is obvious from the short introduction during a new game and it finds several ways to make you crack a smile along the way. The only downside is the length of the game which is purely based on your level of skill with platforming. Players who are familiar with the game will find themselves having a good laugh and breezing through under 10 hours or so and others may find it a bit harder to purchase every unlockable and find every secret.\n\nIt may not be the blockbuster title you're looking for but this is definitely a game you should grab if you see it on sale! The platforming is perfect and it shows SEGA has mastered this genre over the last couple of decades.","February 19","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By that point, you start to realize how it's trying way too hard at... just about everything. Just think of it as one person in your group of friend's who has no special qualities that make them stand out or make people wonder where he/she is and what they maybe doing when they aren't around. This bland individual constantly trying to force their way in through being loud and obnoxious, or by trying to inject themselves into a conversation they only have a quick google search's amount of knowledge about.\n\nConversation as follows:\n-You and another close friend-\n"Hey man.. did you see the latest episode of trying way too hard"\n-Wrath of the Dead Rabbit (a.k.a guy who wants to fit in)\n"HAHAH YEAH DUDE! With the pew pew pew and the *explosion noises with awkward laughter* So sick!"\n\nThis game has tons of potential, but it lacks any solid direction of what kind of game it wants to be. As a result, all the features lack the punch it needs to stand out. At the very least, the comedic aspect of the game should be something special, but it pretty much has the depth of reading social forums or comment threads from youtube, reddit, 9gag, or where ever you can find a flamewar. It remains funny for a short while, then you have to draw the line and say. "yeah.. we're not all 14 years old here. Can you stop?"\n\nMy review may sound pretty hateful here and there, but don't let that stop you from trying the game.

It's one of those games where the devs actually had a passion for it and you can see it in the jokes and little easter eggs scattered throughout the game. It's well paced and by the end of the game you should easily be able to buy all collectables so it never feels like you need to grind to buy things. Kill animations are hilarous although they do get somewhat repetitive and the difficulty admittedly could have scaled better towards the end game.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit. But if you are not then you should look for another platformer.\n\nI didn't had any troubles with this game. I love platform games so it was kind of must play for me. It's not short, have few great moments and funny monster finishers. Hell Yeah! is packed with beatiful colors and tons of blood. Sometimes you feel overwhelmed with designs of maps but quick look at map solve everything. Besides a game there is also island where beaten bosses work for your. I like this idea but to be honest, I went there once or twice... only because there is achievement for doing it. Too bad it's just a game for one time.  I don't think so after beating and unlocking everything I will ever back to it. There is also DLC for more missions but I'm not sure if it's worth getting. I wish that Steam had a something more than just a positive/negative review system, because I can't recommend it for everyone, and also I can't say it's a bad game... So like I said earlier: Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is for platformer games fans only. I doubt anyone else will enjoy it in 100%.","July 14, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/205230/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","I have played this game before on the PS3 when i got at as a free game via Playstation Plus. I enjoyed my time immensly back then and felt like diving in again in this colorfull Metroidvania adventure about the bunny Prince of Hell Ash and his quest to destroy 100 monsters who saw emberassing photos of him. The plot is so unbelieveably simple and doesn't take itself seriously at all, which adds to the visuals aswell.\n\nThis time i also enjoyed my time with Hell Yeah, but not quite as much as when i used to back then 4 years ago when the game first released. The gameplay is smooth as butter, the gunplay is great and it feels great to explore the lands and be on the hunt for the next monster. Also the soundtrack is still really great, fits the levels fantastically and that one song in the Cute World is still stuck in my head because how catchy (yes i know it's cheesy as hell) it is.\n\nHowever, there were two things that bugged me a little while playing the game and made me notice that the game feels a bit 'old' even if it just came out not to long ago. First of were the graphics, were it felt a bit...odd to me. Some of the animations are a bit too cheap, downright 2 frames animations and looked quite laughable at times (especially the Guitar killing thing where the hands stretch the Monster, that looked really awful). Otherwise you have some nicely drawn, whacky cartoony characters which are with a few exception all pretty well drawn. I generally like Ash's design alot.\n\nSpeaking off the finishers, these happen every time you kill one of the 100 Monsters you need to hunt down. Allthough there are many finishers with unique animations and how you perform them, they repeat themselfs  often and they get old rather quickly, with no option to skip. This can be pretty tiresome watching the same thing over and over again with no chance whatsoever. Most of these finishers are references to some pop culture media, which brings me to my next big point, the humor.\n\nThe humor is a mix of basic "lol gory and butts and cursing" and pop culture references. It really is nothing big, and even though it made me laugh alot back in the day, it didn't even really made me chuckle once on my new playthrough. It's just a shame because i thought the games humor would hold up a bit better after just 4 years of age. Luckily the gameplay and overworld art\n\nStill, i find Hell Yeah! a pleasurable experience and find it sad that the developers, Akedo Studio, disbanded in 2013, which also kills the hope for a sequel.\n\nAs for a recommendation, the game is pretty short and rather easy. After completion there is not much to do really, the unlockables are not worth it, the missions are lame and "The Island" is trash. So yeah, pick it up when it's on sale, for 5-7 bucks you will enjoy this little rabbit adventure.","May 18","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only reasonable reaction — of course — is to kill everyone who has seen those embarrassing pictures.\nDeveloper Arkedo sets Hell Yeah's morbid humourous tone from the very start of the game. What follows is a surprisingly good 2D platformer.\n\nOn his journey to kill every single one of the 100 monsters fallen in disgrace, our hero rabbit visits various areas of hell, ranging from a casino to space. The game is packed with comic like brutality; exploding enemies, blood fountains and grotesque finishing moves.\nOn first sight, Hell Yeah seems like one of those gag games, that aim to be taken with a pinch of salt and don't really try to be good games at core. I'm talking about the likes of Brütal Legend or Goat Simulator; games that wouldn't be enjoyable, if their mechanics were stripped off their context. But after finishing Hell Yeah, I feel like I should give up on that prejudice towards gag games.\n\nHell Yeah takes typical platformer mechanics, like wall jumps, moving platforms and Donkey Kong Countryesque cannons, and combines them with guns, which can aim in 360 degrees, and a buzz saw. That core mechanic itself is functional — precise jumps were a bit tricky though, because there's next to no acceleration and only one movement speed (the directional input is binary and there is no run button).\n\nSteady variety is what makes the game fun in the end. You can play on gambling machines in the casino. There's a part where you operate a submarine and you can shoot rainbows, that bounce off of walls, somewhere else.\nFinishing moves are a source of variety too. The monsters don't have individual moves, but more than 25 different finishers are included in the game. They are occasionally really creative and particularly show of the games polished visuals. All of them start with a short quick-time-event or mini game, making them clearly more interesting than most games finishing moves, but bottom line, they still get old after you see the same animation the third time.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I was positively surprised how much bang I got for the time invested. Every mechanic and idea is used for a short amount of time and then dropped for something entirely new. Take the rainbow gun I mentioned earlier. You get the gun play three or four different situations with it — which all require the gimmick, that shots bounce off walls — and then you never see it again.\nOn the other hand, the short innovation cycle leaves no room for any of the mechanics to grow complex, which again, fits the far from serious visual and narrative style of Hell Yeah.\nIt's a cool game. It cracks the jokes, shows off some crazy ideas and ends before it gets repetitiv. Play this with a friend and a few bottles of beer and I bet you have on or two great evenings.\n\nRead more of my reviews at:\ntheguygaming.com","April 30","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is definitely a game you should play. It's a game where you're the Bunny Prince of Darkness. Someone has stolen your naughty pictures and the only way you can get them back is by killing every single person who has potentially seen them. A most zany game, if I've ever seen one. It's crazy but I want to play more.\n\nPROS\n1. Zany Weapons\nA chainsaw bike ♥♥♥ jetpack, rocket launchers and machine guns.\n\n2. Hell Island (Needs 10 Monsters)\nA game within a game. How quaint.\n\n3. Monster Index\nA tiny little backstory for every monster you killed. Some are quite funny.\n\n4. Monster Executions\nVery imaginative. When you kill a unique monster, you play a simple mini-game to finish it off. It's either a dexterity test or a some crazy question. E.g. What's the average lifespan of a dead rabbit? WTF!\n\nCONS\n1. Poor Marketing\nThis game is really good and I find that the only reason it didn't get more support would be the poor marketing. I would heavily recommend that this game get more spotlight.\n\n2. Lame Scenes\nSome of the monster killings are pretty lame or dull. E.g. The cereal and spoon one.","May 2","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This could be the answer for you.\nI got Hell Yeah! from the MWNL bundle (Thanks, SEGA) and so far I enjoyed it.  Hell Yeah is your everyday platformer in general, but in Hell Yeah! perspective, it's an awesome and crazy action-adventure platformer that takes place in Hell where you take control of its good looking prince, Ash. With an addition of personality, you finally made this.\nConclusion :\n1. It's a good game ( hoho )\n2. You don't just need your hands and eyes, you need to use your brains ( and your,... balls ? )\n3. There's a slight percent of salt in some part of this game ( approved by myself )\n4. Spend money in Hell, lots of it for cool beans\n5.

The only reasonable reaction — of course — is to kill everyone who has seen those embarrassing pictures.\nDeveloper Arkedo sets Hell Yeah's morbid humourous tone from the very start of the game. What follows is a surprisingly good 2D platformer.\n\nOn his journey to kill every single one of the 100 monsters fallen in disgrace, our hero rabbit visits various areas of hell, ranging from a casino to space. The game is packed with comic like brutality; exploding enemies, blood fountains and grotesque finishing moves.\nOn first sight, Hell Yeah seems like one of those gag games, that aim to be taken with a pinch of salt and don't really try to be good games at core. I'm talking about the likes of Brütal Legend or Goat Simulator; games that wouldn't be enjoyable, if their mechanics were stripped off their context. But after finishing Hell Yeah, I feel like I should give up on that prejudice towards gag games.\n\nHell Yeah takes typical platformer mechanics, like wall jumps, moving platforms and Donkey Kong Countryesque cannons, and combines them with guns, which can aim in 360 degrees, and a buzz saw. That core mechanic itself is functional — precise jumps were a bit tricky though, because there's next to no acceleration and only one movement speed (the directional input is binary and there is no run button).\n\nSteady variety is what makes the game fun in the end. You can play on gambling machines in the casino. There's a part where you operate a submarine and you can shoot rainbows, that bounce off of walls, somewhere else.\nFinishing moves are a source of variety too. The monsters don't have individual moves, but more than 25 different finishers are included in the game. They are occasionally really creative and particularly show of the games polished visuals. All of them start with a short quick-time-event or mini game, making them clearly more interesting than most games finishing moves, but bottom line, they still get old after you see the same animation the third time.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I was positively surprised how much bang I got for the time invested. Every mechanic and idea is used for a short amount of time and then dropped for something entirely new. Take the rainbow gun I mentioned earlier. You get the gun play three or four different situations with it — which all require the gimmick, that shots bounce off walls — and then you never see it again.\nOn the other hand, the short innovation cycle leaves no room for any of the mechanics to grow complex, which again, fits the far from serious visual and narrative style of Hell Yeah.\nIt's a cool game. It cracks the jokes, shows off some crazy ideas and ends before it gets repetitiv. Play this with a friend and a few bottles of beer and I bet you have on or two great evenings.\n\nRead more of my reviews at:\ntheguygaming.com","April 30","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got for free back in February and haven't bothered playing it for a while, but I just started playing now and it's awesome!\n\nSo, the story is that Ash's nudes get leaked online. No, i'm being serious. The photos already have 100 views, so Ash decides to go to kill all 100 Monsters that may or may not have viewed them.\n\nThe controls are very simple, it's a Metroidvania style thing. At the start of the game, you get a cool saw-jetpack thingy and are able to jump higher and drill through walls and kill enemies. You'll eventually get cool stuff like guns and missiles! I prefer you use a controller, preferrably the Xbox One controller, because it's a bit better than using a keyboard and mouse.\n\nYou kill a monster by, yes, depleting it's energy. When you deplete the bar, you enter a Wario-Ware style minigame that's really fun to play. You can fail sometimes, y'now. Your health is in the form of energy. You can get it by replenishing it at ''blood stations'' or killing enemies. Then, the cool part comes. You can send them to ''the Island'', where the Monsters you defeated can work labour for you and give you extra blood, money and gear in the main game/\n\nI'm only on Zone 3 in the game so far, but it's shaping up to be a very fun platformer.\n\n\n","May 26","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After that they become tiresome, but there isn\'t much game left so it\'s not too much of a grind to make it through.\nThe story is kind of ridiculous, but anything more serious wouldn\'t have settled right with the aesthetic the game presents.\n\nThe game is very easy, and there is some island you can select from the main menu that gives you bonuses in the story as you defeat more enemies and assign them to work for you.  I didn\'t explore this until the end of the game, but it claims to offer greater accessory, weapon, and item options if you do it enough.\n\nI had fun, maybe you will too.","June 1","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
