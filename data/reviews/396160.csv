"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elpresidenteamt/recommended/396160/","elpresidenteamt","Amt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elpresidenteamt/","395 products in account","After being gifted this game, I really really want to recommend it, but I just can't. Here's why:\n\nPros (+) :\n\n1. Pleasant and fitting music though it feels... Not so original.\n2. Strong monsters (for those of you who like strong enemies in games) that scale with your level, including their loot.\n3. Six different classes to choose from.\n4. The character art is pretty, but everything else is what you would expect of a game of that genre, nothing special or unique here.\n5. It's possible to upgrade your weapon as well as craft your own potions.\n6. It's a fairly cheap game.\n\n\nCons (-) :\n\n1. Classes are way too similar to each other. In fact, it doesn't matter which one you pick as they hardly differ from each other at all as there are no special abilities or talents. All of the classes can use the two OP weapons I will mention further down in this review.\n\n2. Unfixed bugs are present in the game. Several of them. You can literally walk on the walls inside the church, an innkeeper won't allow you to enter the room you paid for and you can't walk behind a really tall building.\n\n3. Hardly any balancing in melee fights: Enemies have more hp and hit harder as you level, while you hardly become any stronger. In fact, it wasn't unusual for enemies to be able to kill me with 2-3 hits once I leveled up just a few times. And that was indeed as a melee class with a higher defense stat than mages and archers. Also, there are two swords that can be used by ALL classes, and those swords can kill just about every monster without them ever being able to hit you as you hit them diagonally, while they can only harm you when you are in their path.\n\n4. Spells are useless: only 2 spells and they don't really do any major damage. Also, enemies apparently have a 2 second or so invulnerability after being hit, which isn't much of an issue when using melee weapons (as a melee weapon takes about equally long to charge the attack), but it's a major issue when using spells as you have to time the spell right so you don't waste mana nor get hit while waiting for their invulnerability to wear off. Unnecesarily hard and really bothersome.\n\n5. Very few quests for a game of that genre: I could only find 4 in the game and I literally looked everywhere and talked to every single npc in the game. Oh and they don't really give any directions so you more or less have to guess where to go for x quest.\n\n6. Lacks content: Like I wrote above, enemies become stronger the higher level you are, and so it would be nice if you could buy or acquire better armor, but there isn't anything meant for mid-game fights and above. Also, why is there a random guy living in the middle of nowhere when he does nothing important? Why does everyone talk about the king and all when he actually proves to be completely irrelevant to the story and is, in fact, impossible to interact with?\n\n7. Incomplete (or feels so) things: why are there guard towers with instructions on how to use smoke signals if you don't ever get to use it yourself or see it happen? Why are there so many locked doors?\n\n8. Doesn't really have a lot of different weapons to offer: Again, no need to acquire any other weapon than one of the two swords mentioned above.\n\n9. The crafting / upgrading system is more or less useless. Once you acquire either one of the swords (again with the swords…), you can literally just kill monsters without them ever being able to hit you, and only standard weapons sold by npcs can be upgraded, and the upgraded weapons are FAR inferior to those two swords. As for making your own potions, well, using OP swords will give you so much money that you will easily be able to buy more potions than you could ever need. Oh and if you really want to make your own potions, farming the ressources is a major pain and nearly impossible to do, as nothing says where to acquire them (apart from those blue butterflies). Just farm gold kay?.\n\n10. No "fast travel" or "teleport to x city/town": It's really annoying to travel through several zones 10 times while trying to avoid monsters (in EVERY zone) that can almost kill you with one hit.\n\n11. It's a fairly short game (fortunately?). I beat it first time as a ninja (the slow and long play-through to explore everything the game has to offer, and ninja is a melee class) in four hours, second time was to test the mage class and I completed it in aprox. 2, and the third was a speed run as an archer, which I completed in about an hour. I tried to beat the game using only magic and arrows, but I eventually gave up on both and just went the OP swords "route", which made the game A LOT easier.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIs it worth buying? Not really. I would probably recommend it if it had fewer bugs and more content, but right now it just feels empty content-wise after 30 or so minutes.","October 9, 2015","false","9.5"," 128 of 139 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","128","139","0","2"

The HUD is nicely done and the quest system is rather original for a game like this.\nThe combat system is pretty good and the enemies are implemented in a smart way, the skeletons in the mines were one of them, as they genuinely surprised me and made me paranoid.\nAnother nice thing is that you can gather flowers and butterflies for the crafting system, sadly after an hour and a half I have not tried this system yet, but I gathered quite a lot of stuff.\n\nNow for the bad parts :\nI'm not sure if the developer has tested this game, but it's full of bugs, you can go inside walls, letters become plants when you read them, some blocks that should be solid are not, some that shouldn't be are, glitches here and there, couches have teleport blocks inside them, I was joking with a friend that in the first chuch you come across you can ascend to godhood by straight walking on the wall, most of the walls there are passable, even npcs climb them.\nThe combat while original for the first half hour, is kind of unbalanced, at least as a melee class, I was getting oneshotted the first levels which was pretty frustrating (slimes), I had to align myself diagonally so the monsters wouldn't have a chance to attack me but I could. I farmed a little, when I leveled up though, the monsters leveled with me and became a lot more tanky, giving more gold too. Now, the first real boss was not a big problem because by the time I had so many money I invested in health potions, he could never kill me, doesn't matter how much damage he did to me. After that you drop a legendary weapon which is a bow, a weapon my assassin shouldn't be using but he was using anyway (not sure if legendary weapons do not have class requirements). Some of the resources are inherent to RPG Maker and not original by the developer, you can judge if that affects quality or not.\nI do not feel compelled to complete or continue the game as I did not have much fun with it, but thank you anyway for this chance (since I received the key by a developer or someone in contact with him).\nAll in all it's a low quality rpg maker title with some smart ideas here and there, but with a weak story, characters and quite full of bugs at the moment of writing, so personally I would not recommend you this game.","August 22, 2015","false","3.1"," 138 of 182 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","138","182","4","11"

So I think that constitutes false advertisement. It looks more like an 8-bit color pallete in-game.\n\nSIDE-BY-SIDE SCREENSHOT: http://imgur.com/YmSFA8G\n\nI want to try this game but I don't think the game is playable in this state. The framerate in this game is locked at what seems to be 10 FPS. It's hard to tolerate. I've never seen anything this bad. Maybe this game was made in Basic.\n\nExtremely difficult to control your character:\nThere's a setting to toggle run/walk but that stopped working after about 5 minutes and no longer works so I'm stuck walking. Seriously. I reload an old game save and that one is stuck running.\n\n360 pad works, but only the analog stick, not the D-Pad. This is really dumb since movement is not analog.There is an option to 'hold down a button to run' (It's the shoulder button), but it should be the OPPOSITE! Hold the button to walk! And as mentioned, this might not work after a bit. The shoulder button is a bit too clumsy for this dextrous task as well. Very unfortunate.\n\nTest PC: i5-750, 760GTX, 8GB RAM\nGoing to let the developer keep my 49 cents. Controller updates would be greatly appreciated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Innskeeper/recommended/396160/","Innskeeper","Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Innskeeper/","170 products in account","I don't know why everyone is praising this game, just beat the game after 2.5 hours and from my experience it didn't look near as fun as the trailer looked, levels served hardly any purpose since every monster levels with you and they always deal massive damage no matter what armor you have equipped, all the "Legendary Swords" cost MP to use so if you're not a Paladin or Mage they're useless.  Speaking of Jobs, the Job you pick only affects your HP, MP, and which shop weapons/armor you can use, no job specific skills or anything as far as I saw (I was a lv. 15 Ninja by the time I beat the game).  My biggest problem is the game doesn't even tell you what to do or where to go after the first 10 minutes, it's just wander around the world killing stuff, doing a few quests that have little story themselves, and the "main story" is go find 4 elements in dungeons and take em to a bird and then kill said bird after it attacks you, then it takes you back to the title screen, the end.  I kept seeing talk of other party members in the game but I never got a single one while I wandered around talking to everyone and doing every quest I saw.\n\n\nTLDR: Game isn't as good as trailer made it out to be, only get it if it's on sale and you want to waste time.  5/10  Was expecting a little bit more out of the game and at least some direction on what to do and where to go.  Won't be playing it again since other Jobs are practically pointless to play other than to make the game pointlessly hard.","August 22, 2015","false","2.5"," 102 of 149 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","102","149","3","8"

There is a main attack, skill and a guard feature (if shield is equipped). However, you can only attack in 4 directions = not diagonal, which confused me a bit first; hence the clunky feeling.\nFrom the getgo you are free to explore the world and take up quests. Leveling feels fast and fluid as moving to and from areas will respawn the enemies. Thus grinding a bit is always an easy to do option (and never hurts, at least in my opinion).\nFrom what I have seen so far, Secret of Magia does not reinvent the Action RPG, but offers some nice and easy pick-up and play mechanics.","August 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 73 of 107 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","73","107","3","7"

Soundtrack is pretty good, though even with all the volume sliders at 50% some noices are still really loude.  Gameplay is pretty simple, but that's not a bad thing.

I've also walked though a wall or two so far, so hopefully a patch or two will come out later to help fix these issues.

It took me joyfully by surprise when it turned out to actually be a real time adventure game similar to that of the old top-down Zelda titles. Hookshot included!\n\nSadly, the magic didn’t last as I quickly found that nothing felt quite responsive or snappy enough. The sword swung in a pitifully small arc, the character feels very locked down to a square grid of movement, and actually trying to naturally navigate with a controller or D-pad is very uncomfortable. Even the hookshot moseys across the screen like a tranquilized snail. The story wasn’t dreadful from the little bit I saw of it. The creatures, while rather disjointed and inconsistent in theme, were decently drawn and animated. However, when it comes down to it, playing Secret of Magia makes you reminisce of Zelda and sulk over how inferior this game feels in comparison.","September 29, 2015","false","8.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/396160/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","A technically flawed but mostly charming and low priced action adventure/RPG title, Secret Of Magia harkens back to older action adventure RPG titles and the inspirations and love for the Zelda titles is clear, and things like the friendly dialogue, brief random encounters, art style and music all fit nicely. There's also a fair amount of content, areas and enemies for the cost, and overall, while it has problems and does nothing special, it's good value for money and a competent aaRPG.\n\nFull disclosure: I recieved a Steam key prior to this review.\n\nHighlights\nThe variety of environments and pretty good intro level were enough to get me engaged, and the casual and unlimited nature of exploration from an early stage are worth mentioning. It's easy to skip ahead if you're impatient, but equally easy to spend an extra hour or two just exploring and grinding. There's also a variety of competent and occasionally funny dialogue from many different denizens in many different towns.\nThe music is also very pleasant to listen to, and sets the tone really well without getting annoying at all.\n\nOverall, if the developer releases a patch or two and clears up some issues, this title will be worth picking up for what is essentially the price of a coffee.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nI feel like a patch or two would fix up most of my complaints, but for the sake of completion and honesty here they are.\n\nThere are tons of small technical bugs. I routinely found myself clipping through walls and into inaccessible areas, I was unable to equip or de-equip items after certain encounters, and had no way to continue but to slowly suicide, menu systems sometimes became disabled for unidentifiable reasons and plenty more small annoying technical mistakes that should've been play-tested and fixed.\nThe support for using a mouse is great, and makes playing a lot faster and smoother, but the out of the box key bindings are frankly awful, and the in-game configuration panel isn't listed in the controls, nor accessible by anything other than messing around (it's F1 in all RPG Maker titles), and even that isn't properly labelled or actionable, and F12 causes crashes due to a bugged RPG Maker script. Again, these are little things that can be fixed fairly simply, but that's all the more reason to highlight them.\n\nThere are design mistakes too, namely the save system relying on positional altar markers. This means that, like some of the older Zelda systems, you can only save before entering an area or after travelling to a specific place. For a game that encourages player grinding and a slow death screen, this makes little sense. An auto-save or simply just a save button would've been a far better choice.\nThe main issue for me, however, was the combat. There is arguably a small level of skill required in coordinating where to position the player in regards to each enemy and the environment but, at least as the soldier class, it's mostly just about finding the next diagonal tile and slashing ad infinitum and became repetitive and bland after a short time and even boss fights are mostly about predicting the next move and getting in position.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at just £1.99/2.99€/$2.99 at the time of review, this is actually priced fairly, and will probably be worth picking up on sale for someone looking for a casual aaRPG with a nod towards older Nintendo titles, just not until some of the technical problems are corrected.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/396160","August 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","38","58","0","3"

However, when you play the game, you realize that it's the opposite of all those things. The color scheme and tones of the graphics are nothing as they are presented on the store page, which is very misleading. You can easily go around and avoid all of the monster fights; the monsters will not follow you or go out of their way to hit you. The only real fast-paced action here is how fast the main character moves.\n\nThe BIGGEST downfall of this game are the controls, whether you're playing with KB or a controller. It's just horrendous either way. I'm not sure how the developer even thought that the control scheme was a good idea in the first place. It's barely feasible on a controller, but downright hand breaking on a KB.\n\nI should also mention here that any time you quit the game, the game crashes instead of closing properly. There is also no way to adjust your resolution or if you'd rather have full screen or windowed mode. Steam overlay also does not work in the game, but toast windows pop up and leave an annoying white rectangle on the corner of the screen.\n\nAt the paid price of a whopping $0.32 CAD, I can't say I'm upset. I got it at this price for the achievements, honestly. But anyone who is seriously considering this title for pleasure play should think twice. Don't support misleading store pages and broken games.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Pick a hero with a ball, a bird says go get the "Four elements", and that is it. You then have the games mechanics shoved down your throat in a frustrating tutorial.\nLow-end character portrait art.\nSome terrible game breaking bugs that the devs simply aren't acknowledging.\nIn the first few minutes of the game I was already frustrated and unhappy. There was not a single bit of dialogue between characters in the beginning which makes it very hard for me to want to stick around. It's ok to have a learning curve but ony if the game at least seems appealing enough to learn it.\n\nThe game itself is screaming copy cat. Hook shot is obtained in the first 5 minutes. What a surprise a RPGmaker element that I see in every RPGmaker game is in another RPGmaker game. "Secret Of Magia" sounds a whole lot like "Secrets of Grindea". The combat system although fun, has been used a number of times and doesn't bring anything new to the table. Even the inventory system has been used in at least 3 other RPGmaker games I've played. It's ok to use the engine but at least try to make it your own in the process.\n\nI can't recommend this game.\n\nAbove all else... if I haven't yet deterred you yet...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/396160/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Secret of Magia looked like it was going to be a retro RPG, taking me back to the days of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo.  Playing Dragon Warrior, Faria, Times of Lore, or even Ultima to some extent. Starting out, you are in a room with Two characters, while you control a black sphere.  I was given the option choosing which Hero I wanted to play as by going through One of Two doors on either side of each Hero. I selected a character and was taken to a black screen where dialogue appeared. It seemed there was some sort of overarching villain who wanted "the elements" and threatened to reap your soul if you didn't get them for him. You then wake up in the bed of an inn, where you find a memo telling you to go to the bottom of a well to prove your worth.\n\nThere was no tutorial playthrough where you learn how to open the menu, switch between various screens, equip items or gear, or to even orient you to your basic surroundings. I thought this was a little clumsy, because a lot of the good RPG games have these basic features. So it took a few moments to explore the keyboard to figure out how to open the menus and switching between things. Instead of my usual exploring I decided to follow the storyline and proceeded to a well where I descended and encountered rats. The game told me to equip a sword, but didn't explain how to do that: Luckily, I fooled around with the keyboard so I knew where to go and what to do. Rat-Kabob coming up. Then, I was told to equip a lantern, but for the life of me I couldn't find it in the inventory. Finally after 3 minutes of frustration I was able to locate a lantern, by going to my armor, selecting equip and there it was, hidden. Frustrated, I equipped it and proceeded through the cave slashing at rats.\n\nI think this game has some things going for it. Visually it is retro, but done in a good way. The story seems interesting, very Final Fantasyish; However, Ithink the dialogue is a little weak and the menu system is clunky. Perhaps playing further will alleviate my frustrations and I will be pleasantly surprised. For now though, based on my initial interaction with the game I think it is mediocre. Some things are done well, others not so well. It is playable and it is still an interesting RPG. I give it a thumbs up, but would urge caution for those who are easily frustrated or have unrealistic expectations.","August 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","30","46","2","0"

But I don't think he even bothered to check for bugs, level progression, or whatever.\n\nMapping is meh... Just the usual maps everyone could make. But with bugs, like you can pass through the walls, or teleporting to wrong locations...\n\nBattle system. Just ok. Fast, but that's it, not even fun to keep beating those monsters.\n\nAbout the music... Yeah, it's nice, I guess that's the good thing the game has.\n\nAnd that's it. There are better FREE games out there on RPG Maker community for you to play, the genre you choose. I hope the creator can get deep on game devolopment, it isn't just about "making a generic RPG, with cool scripts to make it nice, and put it there to people download."","November 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

For example: http://steamcommunity.com/app/396160/discussions/0/521643320363085829/\n\n-The enemies are leveling up according to your level! That alone actually destroys the point of leveling...\n\n-Your character's speed gives you the impression that everything goes in fast forward.\n-You are basically on your own. You do not get a lot of help from the game, in order to progress.\n\n-I found myself spending most of the time wandering around the areas in order to find out what's next. Although, there's an in game map in certain places, that doesn't help so much. I would rather have it accessible everywhere in the game after pressing the M key.\n\n-There's a quest where you get the following coordinates "X33 Y24", but there's not any coordinate indication in the game to get an idea where you have to go.\n\n-You cannot save the game anytime and anywhere you want.\n-I wasn't able to switch into windowed mode until I found out in the game's discussions that you have to press the F5 key to do so. Also, Alt + tab doesn't work.\n\n-Minor spelling issues.\n\n-Lazy ending...\n\nOverall it has a lot of potential to become a great game and I would love to see improvements and bug fixes as soon as possible!

I've played some popular jrpg titles like Golden Sun -series and first Zelda games and this game has elements form both of them.\n\nThe start of the game is fuzzy - Firstly player picks a character between male and female and then a short cutscene is shown where some gigantic bird looking creature tells protogonist to find and bring 4 elements or else to be eliminated. After this threat hero wakes from nightmare and that's pretty much it there is to be told of character's backgrounds in the game. What's even worse that I've already revealed the first half of the main plot. So avoid this game if you play games to enjoy story telling.\n\nThe fighting system works decently though. Battles are fought in real time and assaulting at enemy head over heels is not an option. There is various monster types and this difference isn't limited how they look, but also how they attack. During fights it's possible to move, block, attack, use spell. It's a shame though that there is not much to look for on these hostile areas. The loot which drops from monsters is money, sometimes materials, but never anything more special you can find in stores in villages. Now the roaming on large world seems pointless because there is not much in there when monsters are excluded.\n\nAnother annoying fact is that the character progression is actually a lie. This is about the correlation between the levels of your character and the enemies. So wheter your level was 1 or trillion, the difficulty stays unchanged that actually ruins the enjoyment there is left.\n\nI could complain forever, but still - with all its weaknesses The Secret of Magia is not a total bummer. It has priced itself modestly and some features work but it is the competition which makes it look bad. There is numerous respected JRPGs developed with RPG maker in steam. They might be more expensive but do have much much more content and quality than this game.","August 28, 2015","false","2.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You guys are really good at keeping suprises, because I asked 3 times.\n\nNow let's move on to what our friends at Epic Quest Games did to the game itself.\n\nFirst off, thank you for removing some scripts, the list was really full, it doesn't matter that all the enemies are broken and the game is way too easy now.\n\nAh, directions in the game aren't clear? Well they got you covered! Instead of asking me to make it more clear where to go, they just added some event triggers with "Go to x", so beautiful.\n\nDue to lack of playtesters the game has some bugs, partly because of some removed scripts, but hey, who doesn't love a bug here and there?\n\nWhy are the bugs not fixed you might ask? Well it's a "closed project". What does that mean? Well it means that they won't update the game!\n\nI just love how an update where I brought back some key scripts, bug fixes, better performance and even some new items is just sitting on my harddrive to never be released, amazing job!\n\nI find that renaming the game, again without letting me know, is something everyone can respect. It's like coming home to only find out that your cat is now called Charles and there is nothing you can do about it except deal with it! Majestic!\n\nThe way you told me to delete replies to negative reviews because I was telling them an update was in the works was really cool, especially because the update never got released, wow!\n\nSome people are speculating that I quicky made this game for some quick bucks, guess what? Aside from the money I got from selling the rights (which I almost didn't get if I didn't ask), I get nothing! So in buying you do not only support this great publisher, but also waste money!\n\nI had some cool ideas for achievements, but nooo, their own broken achievements are way better! If you look at my achievements for this game you can see that I have every achievement in the game except one, which is the one you get at the start of the game! Programming at its finest!\n\nWell that has gotten a bit lengthy! Well there isn't a big chance that the publisher is gonna read this because they don't respond to their email anymore and love keeping people in the dark.\n\n10/10 would perform blood sacrifice","February 9","false","0.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

The combat is really basic and tile based, and the dungeons are super simple (defeat midboss to get key, go to boss). Also never have i seen a game that punishes you for levelling. The game autolevels the monsters as you level up (like skyrim for example). But there hardly is any new equipment. So thanks to that the monsters just get stronger and stronger and you feel weaker with every levelup.\n\nThe game probably also has the stupidest, laziest ending i've ever seen.

It is not like other RPGmaker game, as it is not turn-based... It's more of an action game.\n\nThe pathing of monsters and their attacks are quite frustating to play against, some just dash to you in zigzag kinda patterns and are almost impossible to dodge. On the other hand, with anything but a dagger or a bow, you can sit next to monsters and kill them to your side. With a bow, you can just kill them from afar without them trying to kill you.\n\nIt could have been a great game, but there are too many flaws. Mana regen is slow, leveling-up actually makes the monsters harder to kill overall. Classes are a little meaningless and have no really specific skills. There's also no abilities to unlock as you gain levels.\n\nThere's no maps, so you have to keep the layout of the map in your head and the game is just pretty, bland... In the first 2 dungeons anyways, all you have to do is kill the unique monster inside the zone, get his key and then unlock the door that leads to the boss room, that's not very original!\n\nThe music is not too bad, but I heard it wasn't composed for this game, so I won't praise it too much. The graphics are fair enough for RPGmaker, but they could be way better. There are some game breaking bugs (just pressing f12 for example, it crashes your game). The game is also very short.\n\nThe game is really cheap, about $1, but even there, it's not a game I would really recommend playing. If you are a fan of RPGmaker games, then maybe this is for you, otherwise, I did not enjoy it very much, it is a bit too clunky and unfun to play.","January 16","false","12.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Needs more love from the devs before i can recommend this.\n\nPro:\n+ Player gets quite quickly into action.\n+ Action is realtime and the system works\n+ Lots of drops and not that much xp grinding in the beginning\n+ Linear combat. Once you learn to not go head first into enemies the combat side start to shine. It is surprisingly satisfying to clear a big area and make it out from there without taking a hit. Conversely one dumb mistake or sloppy  attitude when initiating combat means the first slime that you encounter machine gun spits you to death. Combat generally is such that both player and enemies attempt to pass around each other and get into position to strike. Player is outnumbered but generally has the advantage of wide arching strike that is mandatory to survive even the first monsters.\n\nCon:\n- Glitches. Player passes trough walls here and there. Combine this with the fact that player character moves really fast. It is sometimes hard to not run into things.\n- You attack button is also the action button for digging/picking items. So you walk around hitting things all the time. I dont want to see a 'Do you want to pick flowers?' prompt when i am attempting to outflank a enemy.\n- Lots of empty space in safe areas. Why is the starting village so HUGE ?\n- Spelling and wording here and there.\n\nGame feels rushed. Finishing touches are missing.\n\nI am happy to change this to positive should the game receive more polish.  Almost there but not quite. I sure hope this game gets to see some more love in form of updates as i really like the game idea and i can easily recommend this should the game experience be more fluid. Now i'd say wait before buying or buying on deep discount only.","August 28, 2015","false","3.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

RPG Maker notoriously handles anything but the turn-based actions it was made to handle quite poorly, so the game can be clunky at times, but it's not QUITE as bad as most action RPGs on RPG maker is.  Still, I would suggest looking to something made in another engine for any substansive action RPG fix, because this game is anemic in content, and has no interesting gimmicks to make it stand out compared to the hundred other Zelda-wannabes on Steam.\n\nPros:\n* Dirt cheap, so you won't regret it long even if you don't like it.\n* It's fairly fast-paced, and you level up quickly with relatively little grinding.\n* It's possible to just run past most of the enemies.\n* Six possible classes.\n* If you aren't going for cards, you can beat the game fast enough to return it for a refund!\n\nCons:\n* The enemies are rubber-banded to your level, while your stat-boosting equipment is based upon how far in the plot you have progressed, meaning you lose power relative to your enemies as you gain levels.\n* The enemies meander around until it's time for their attack, at which point they fly at you at mach 12, clip through your own attacks, and keep chasing you even if you do hit them in the middle of their attack.\n* You have a shield button, but except for the archer, you have to be a melee class to get it, and there's no wind-up animation to warn you to raise your shield before they start running at you, so you need to use psychic precognition to tell when to use your shield when you're standing only 1-2 tiles away.\n* The enemies deal about 1/5 your total health per hit.\n* The enemies have about second-long invulnerability after being hit, and can attack immediately after that.\n* The enemies can stun-lock you in place with spammed ranged attacks\n* The classes are not described in-game at all, and have unintuitive effects.\n* The classes are not balanced at all.\n* The archer class relies upon arrows, can only carry 99 at a time, I shot 50 getting from the first town to the second, and the second town doesn't have arrow vendors.\n* The spells deal 1/6th the damage a physical attack does no matter what your magic stat is, so mages are useless.\n* All other classes are melee classes, and any melee class besides Paladin is just plain weaker than the Paladin.\n* Bugs galore! Walk through walls! Don't walk through objects that look the same as ones you can walk through! Enter one house, leave out a different one!\n* The writing is as utterly barebones as possible.  "Go kill this thing for me." "Thank you for killing it.  Here's the ___ I promised."\n* The plot consists of your character having a dream where a bird tells you to go kill four bosses and bring it their souls or it'll eat your soul.  You find these bosses literally just sitting out in a field, and after you're done killing all four, you get a final boss, then, BAM, credits, game over.\n* You will finish in about an hour if you don't grind, and the game punishes you for grinding, anyway.","November 29, 2015","false","5.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can't switch around the keyboard to fit your playstyle which is extremly annoying. There are also several different keys for each action which can be helpful and confusing at the same time.\n- The combat is a joke. Get a melee weapon and stand diagonal to any enemy and you can kill it without ever getting injured.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrimZon_666/recommended/396160/","CrimZon_666","CrimZon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrimZon_666/","222 products in account","The Secret of Magia dares you to play it, comparing it to RPG greats such as the Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana.\nDo you have what it takes to delve into this story's mysteries?\nAre YOU ready for ADVENTURE?!? Are you looking for fun?\n\nThen look somewhere else.\n\nConcept & Story:\nSecret of Magia is standard Japanese Role-Playing-Game fare. There is nothing new brought to the table. Some may be fine with this approach, as was I. However, there is hardly any story at all. The game opens with a monstrous bird that threatens to kill you if you do not return with four crystals... at least it appears to threaten you. Significant grammatical errors are made immediately. While these can be sludged though and understood because of context, they persist throughout the game, sometimes making sentences nonsensical. This problem never alleviates. There are portions of text that lead completely off the screen, leaving the player to guess what was being said.\n\nAfter leaving the introduction, our hero is set on a set of sidequests. That's it: five sidequests that aren't really tied in any way to the plot. The plot, of course, does not exist. It is only revisited at the end of the game and very, very briefly at that. While it is typically considered in bad taste to spoil the ending of a game or film, I cannot do so, though I am sorely tempted to. You see, the ending... it doesn't exist. As the boss lays dying, you are returned to the title screen. No credits, no "Thank you for playing", not even "Game Over"; there is absolutely nothing following this. This isn't just unexpected in story-based games, it's just downright rude.\n\nConcept & Story - 2/10\n\nGameplay:\nThis sort of title has many expected mechanics in gameplay style. It is clear what the developer was aiming for, it just misses the mark in each and every way. Full controller support is claimed, but this is false. Movement, with a control pad, is only permitted with the analog stick, not the directional pad. This sort of game would have played much better with the latter. Giving players the option of either or best would work for everyone. Instead, the developer chose otherwise. The buttons used for play are odd in placement and incredibly awkward throughout the game. It is not unusual for them to be nonresponsive. Sometimes, there is a significant delay between pressing buttons and having a chosen action take place. This is inexcusable.\n\nNavigating menus is slow, tedious, and excessive. Early in the game, the player is asked to equip items that aren't even present. They come into existence only when suggested by the interface. Other portions of inventory are completely unused, specifcally charms and accessories. It is as if something were planned and then completely forgotten. Evidently, the forgetfullness persisted through alpha and beta testing, if there was any at all.\n\nThe game utilizes class systems, levels, and crafting. This would seem a good idea. Class choice makes little difference as they play nearly the same. When leveling, your character becomes stronger. Unfortunately, the enemies gain in strength, health, and resistances to your attacks... and very disproportionally so. In other words, "leveling up" not only does not help you, it is an extremely bad idea. Under no conditions should the player consider grinding for experience; they may find the game unfinishable. Crafting is introduced to upgrade weapons and to create potions. In fact, one entire town in the game is dedicated to the industry of alchemy and potions. This system is never flushed out and developed. It suggests itself to have great promise and then proceeds to be completely ignored. There is no reason to bother with crafting weapons of any sort.\n\nThere are more concerns about things that would never be discussed if it were not for the fact that these normal mechanics are broken. Sleeping in village inns poses the slight risk of waking up in another town. It would appear that the screens that the interiors of the Inns are not reliably linked to the screens of the towns. As such, about one out of three nights spent will leave you across the world. When fighting certain enemies, the player can be stunned. This, in it of itself, is normally not an issue, but menu access is also locked. Any attempts to access the Game Menu or otherwise Pause are also "stunned". The entire game locks until the Effect wears off. There is no reason for this. Frequently, the player will become stunned even if not hit with a stunning attack. There is no way to predict when this will happen. Furthermore, progress through the four key dungeons is dependend on acquiring unique keys held be mini-bosses. Sometimes they drop them upon death... sometimes they don't. If not, pray you did not save, as the required Key is now and forever inaccessible. The only solution is to reset or load from a previous save file and try again.\n\nFor what should be simple and casual play and control, The Secret of Magia fails even at this minimal task.\nGameplay - 3/10\n\nSound & Music:\nThe sounds are fine and what would be expected for this sort of game. While voice-acting is a nice feature, it is not neccessary. Music is acceptable. It isn't awful, but it isn't memorable either. It is the sort of thing one would expect if a developer snatched up a few royalty-free music tracks and tossed in the ones that sounded best. Actually, this is exactly what developer, Lunatiod, did. The exact same music can be heard in other games as well. Even if they chose to use synthesised MIDI tracks that someone composed with this title in mind, it could have added more substance.\nSound & Music - 5/10\n\nGraphics:\nJRPGs have a typical look to them and this title attempts to keep up with the look and style of these. It is light and whimsical, with a touch of cartoony adventure. This being said, it is expected that things are consistent. Windows appear out of the edges of the walls of a church. Players walk right over gates. The player can even walk into and through some walls. Frequently when moving, the player will appear to be using their "Hookshot" item, when no such device is in use. These realatively easy fixes persist.\n\nMost striking is the fact that the game does not appear as shown in the presented screenshots and advertisment video. It is extremely clear that the developer or publisher used photo and/or video editing software to make the game appear to have a very different asthetic than is actually present. In short, this is false advertising. This sort of practice is loathesome and completely disqualifies this aspect of the game.\nGraphics - 0/10\n\nEnjoyability and Replay Value:\nSecret of Magia showed a certain amount of promise. Each promise suggested was carelessly broken. Even if one sets their expectations low, this particular title fails to meet even that. This was an attempt to be a game without any intention to put in effort. It is hours of constant frustration dealing with glitches and broken game mechanics, a lack of story. and a complete absense of any fun. They entire game plays out as if "fun" is going to be right around the corner; it never comes.\n\nSince all characters are virtually the same, despite what their names suggest, there isn't a reason to try these variations out. There is not much in the way of secrets, so outside of a hidden dagger (with coordinates that mean nothing), there is nothing to go back for. It isn't even the sort of game that one can enjoy the story once more, because there is practically no story and what little is presented is certainly not enjoyable. It isn't fun or remotely interesting. It offers absolutely nothing.\nEnjoyability and Replay Value - 2/10\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIt is obvious that the publisher and developer were interested in creating something that could be called a game, on paper. At 49 cents for this and three other titles, I feel ripped off. A waste of two hours. Avoid.\n\nOverall - 2/10","February 5","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has potential, so it's sad that I really can't recommend it. Some of the issues:\n\nDev hasn't fixed simple bugs that force you to restart - in the mines (the first dungeon) there's an enemy that drops a "fire key". If you use the key and then leave, the door is locked when you come back. The enemy will still drop the key, but it won't show up in your inventory or allow you to unlock the door again. Until this gets fixed I have to assume that the dev has abandoned this game.\nThe leveling system is pointless - enemies get stronger when you level up. In fact, they get stronger faster than you do, so leveling is actually counterproductive.\nEnemies are overpowered - enemies right outside the first town can kill you with only a couple hits, and thanks to the backwardness of the leveling system there is no way to overcome that through gaining levels.\nFew enemies telegraph their attacks - not only do enemies hit hard, but there are only a few enemies for which you can actually tell that they are about to attack and dodge.\nStun + no temporary immunity = 1-hit KO - when you get hit, you are stunned for a little while. The moment you can move again, you are vulnerable. This means that enemies that attack multiple times in a row can (and usually will) hit you multiple times. This leads to you being stuck, watching your character get hit over and over until they die without you being able to do anything about it (other than burning through healing items until the enemy stops attacking).\nThe combat system really could be fun, but there's no room for skill. You can't see when an enemy is going to attack you, so you can't dodge except by attacking from a location that the enemy can't hit (and not all enemies have such a location). As you gain levels it takes longer and longer to kill even the starting enemies, which gets tedious very quickly. In short, combat seems very unbalanced and the game suffers significantly because of it.","September 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I got a copy in a pack of 4 RPGs i wanted to try for ~60p, thankfully.\n\nObvious problems:\nYou get direction for what to do for the first 5 minutes ('Go to the well'), after that, you're free to wander the entire map (and good luck finding a map so you can squint and get an idea of where the hell you are or what you're supposed to be doing.) Quests have no markers - if it says 'go and kill blah', and you don't know where blah is, then so begins a wild goose chase.\nAfter you save the miner...you can go back to the mine with the dungeon key and have a go at the fire boss...but not if you can't equip a shield.\n\nIt might just be because i picked the mage class, but i couldn't equip a shield despite buying everything possible (currency is nowhere near balanced, items cost ~30 gold and you can earn 1000s in minutes). No shield? No hope in hell of beating the elemental bosses. Was i supposed to buy 99 health potions and spam those instead??? (for shame)\n\nWhile normal attack damage is ok and different weapons do different AoE areas (the combat system is quite interesting actually), magic is realllllly weak :/ like not even worth having. It's good for long distance but not when it does 10 damage against an enemy with 1000s of HP - who doesn't always stay STILL - who has time for that?\n\nEnemies are all overpowered - i got to ~lvl 16 and even the wasps were taking off ~1/5 of my health per attack. Only the rats in the well at the very start of the game seem like they're at the right level for your character, and if you go back down there, they can divebomb you to hell and back in seconds.\nThe screen is littered with annoyance after annoyance and they don't scale with you nor drop anything significant. You're thrown in at the deep-end and get nothing for not drowning.\n\nYou can only save at the green flames and not the barely-existent menu, which i thought was a bit annoying because you have to backtrack to the last village and hope you can remember where it is in that village/town - some sign posts really wouldn't go amiss.\n\nNPCs are pretty lifeless - if you ever even find one, chances are they'll just talk about their house (i found books in ONE house, all the other houses are window dressing :/) Ok, Sir/Madam, your house is nice and all....(not if there's nothing to loot lol) but how about some lore or something? Why go on???\n\nI don't hate the game, but it really needs a lot of work. Tone down the difficulty (there doesn't have to be an enemy everywhere), scale enemies to class and level - battles are supposed to be FUN. Put in more 'where to go if you're stuck' (signposts!) . Know your characters - do we get a party at some point?? Why are we being forced by some flying bird to collect all the elements? Because it will 'reap our soul' otherwise? Well that's very nice of it???? haha","February 1","false","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly, these issues are just simply the mechanical limitations of RPG Maker, not developer errors, therefore I cannot fault the game on these issues.\n\nPutting the issues of RPG Maker aside, I really wanted to like this game, however it does have its problems. The first problem I had was a very noticable drop in FPS while in larger open areas. This FPS drop really slows down movement and becomes a quick nuisance. This issue is fixed when entering a building or cave, etc however presents itself again when re-entering the large area.\n\nSecond problem I have are the controls. The controls are really bad in my opinion and have somewhat of a learning curve as you cannot change them. Granted you can remap controls using Xpadder or another re-mapping program if you have a controller, I feel I shouldnt have to use another program to get the controls you want.\n\nAs I said previously, I am not going into a great amount of detail with this one. The two problems are my main issues, as of right now, therefore you want to know about other game issues or gameplay mechanics, check out some of the other reviews. They are chalk full of plenty of information.\n\nI gave this a prositive rating becuase I believe this game had potential and with some issues aside it really isn't all that bad for the price, especially if you pick it up in a bundle on sale.","December 22, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The problem with this is that the RPG Maker engine wasn't meant for this type of combat. Developers, I congratulate you for making the game do it... but it's a shame you didn't do it well.\n\nI learned that this game uses a system where enemiew level up with the player. A novel concept, but it utterly fails in practice. Developers, I'm sorry. But you picked the wrong genre to include such a feature, because doing this punishes the player for grinding. When you have a game that rewards players for killing enemies with exp, money, and crafting items, chances are we're going to be encouraged to fight as many things as we can see. And the combat system you developed makes it really easy to kill a ton of things early on. But as you level up, enemies will start to take more and more hits to kill. And then you'll reach level 5 during the first notable quest, only to get gored by a bee on the way back.\nKilling 20 slimes doesn't turn the rest of them into liquid iron. Not in a logical world, anyways.\n\nWriting is extremely poor early on. Who am I? Why do I down a rat infested well to train? What "training" do I get done by beating up on an archery target with a knife? How did guy from the guild see me training on the cliff side? I never say any other spot in town where someone could get that kind of view. The moment I'm done with that training, he comes to me and says he'll give me a weapons license and a guild membership. Is it really that easy to join this guild? I wouldn't mind if the writing wasn't handled so clumsily. If you have a guild with criteria to join, it's typically best to have the player go to the guild, and be given some sort of minor adventuring quest to join it. Not saying you have to fit the generic mold; but either make joining the adventurers guild some sort of major feat for the character, or have them already in it. Otherwise, joining feels meaningless. Another protip would be to think of catchier names for towns and people. I know that seems like nitpicking. But it helps your world to make it memorable.\n\nAnd here's a protip for using the RPG VX ACE maker. I noticed this when I stepped on a patch of tall grass, and it looked like I was floating on top of it. If you go into your tilesets, where most tiles have like an X or O on it, there should be an option that looks like 2 wavy lines. I don't have it pulled up right now, so I can't give the actual name for it. But it'll make it to where characters get their lower half shaded when walking over a section. This creates the illusion that your character has the grass coming up to his waist. Just apply it to the tall grass sections and you're good.\n\nOverall, it's a game I fell if I do complete, it'll be by force. Sorry guys. This just wasn't your game.","November 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has good music, no voice actors or words in the music. It is a short game with 2 playable characters. Boy or Girl, depending on what you pick in the start.\nThis game has a good reason to give you your starting gear, the npcs look nice with faces drawn in a none moving fasion, but the naming of some of them could be better. To fight someone run up to them and press (Z) to attack with weapon, (A) with spell and (S) for shield. You can see all the enemys as you walk along so if you want to you can skip alot of the creeps. The mobs will level up with you but the bosses wont. There is a job you pick in the start that will let you equipt some weapons but not all types of weapons or armor. There is a forge to upgrade your weapon but it seems like it can not upgrade my scythe, but you can even put an element to your wand. The spells for the players are few.\nThere is about 2 quests that you have to do to progress, the rest are optional, even one can be found in a book. You have a quest log, an inventory, fixed saving spots, a donation system, fixed gambling and no character costumesation only picking the gender. The weapons attack differently compaired to each other atleast most of them. There is also 5 achievements that will be easy to get, card drops and some sweet looking badges.\nIf this sounds like something for you then you could get it as it is a really cheap game, but wait for a sale.

Introduction was quick enough.  However, my interest wasn't piqued much.  A strange bird tells you to get all four elements or he'd reap your soul.  You get to choose your gender and class (assassin, archer or mage).  That's it.\n\n2. You wake up in a city and you're being told what to do next exactly.  The game pushes you in the direction you have to go.  Not much thought process involved at all.\n\n3. The combat system is Zelda-like; Secret of Magia is an action RPG where you press Z to swing your weapon, S to block with a shield, A to cast a spell.  Easy enough at first, but you can be one-shot by some enemies as melee rather easily if you don't act quickly enough.  The shield that I bought from the weaponmaker after receiving the license in town didn't seem to be working either (and I made sure to equip it, too).  And the monsters really do move too fast for you to avoid them sometimes.\n\n4. There are background bugs everywhere.  Cliffs and walls are passable when they shouldn't be, etc.\n\n5. No proofreading has been done for this game, apparently.  Dialogue is full of typos and misspellings - you'll be talking to plenty of 'Gaurds,' for example - and even with that fixed, it's not particularly memorable.  Many of the NPC's lines are nothing special.  "I love my nice house!"  One guard said that they couldn't drink in the watchtower and giggled as he said it - which seemed weirdly out of place.\n\n6. Quests are discovered by talking to NPCs with an exclamation point or by examining books or so on - they seem to be straightforward but there was one quest that pointed out a location of a dagger while giving you coordinates.  I'm not sure how that would have been accomplished without an add-on telling you X and Y coordinates of the map you were on.  Granted, I didn't play long enough to try to figure it out.\n\n7. Did I mention you could be one-shot rather easily?  Now there aren't enough save points to really help you avoid a lot of experience and gold loss if that happens.  I decided not to risk entering the mines and try to find a save point because of it in the next town up.  This isn't really a criticism.  I like the challenge, but it can probably be discouraging to some.\n\n8. The Dash function is default (and essential in avoiding monsters); however the game's frame rate doesn't seem to be very smooth when you're dashing.  I've seen this done better in other RPGMaker games like Labyronia.  It's a bit distracting in this game.\n\n9. There are two different ways you can use items: through equipping them, and by using the Q-W quick item equipper.  I think the item equipper could have probably been removed to simplify up the UI a bit in that respect.\n\n10. There was a map inside the training hall in the first city that showed you the first few areas as if they were zoomed out.  I play RPGs to explore areas myself, so that map kind of took away most of the mystery of the first few areas for me.\n\nAll in all, unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nEDIT: I bought it on sale ($1) and still feel ripped off - and now I find out from reading other reviews, if I had kept playing, I would have completed it in 2.5 to 3 hours anyway... I feel like there are a lot of better games for your money's worth.  Labyronia for one, which I mentioned.","August 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Third, it appears you will be able to have and it talks about you having a party to use during the game, but you play the whole game with one of the two characters you chose at the start of the game. Fourth, the level system seems pointless as all the monsters seem to take the same number of hits regardless of what your level is or what you have equiped, and likewise so do you. Fifth, there are only four quests in addition to the four dungeons in the entire game.

What it fails to do is execute these well and the game just turns into a giant mess. In Secret of Magia, you'll experience game breaking glitches, awful hitboxes, poor English, and a game that just isn't very long at all. The game has a grand total of five dungeons available, though only four of them are actually required to beat the game.\n\nOne of the things in Secret of Magia that made absolutely no sense to me was why the enemies scaled with your level. I very quickly decided to not even bother with killing anything but what was required to even proceed. When it comes to the bosses, it doesn't even really matter if you're underleveled. All you have to do is stand to the side of where they can hit, and so long as they don't have some sort of area of effect skill they just can't hit you. One NPC remarked that you needed a shield to beat a particular boss. This boss was actually one of the only ones I couldn't abuse this hitbox effect on and I still never even used the shield (playing as a Paladin).\n\nSecret of Magia holds some good promises but completely fails to deliver on them. Many glitches are being left unchecked, such as being locked out of dungeons forcing you to restart the entire game and the Scythe just not being upgradeable. There are much better games in this style out there, so my suggested is to just play those instead and pass on Secret of Magia. Unless, of course, you don't mind smashing your head into awful English and poor hitboxes.","October 4, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So now all the pros are covered, let's get to the cons.\n\nThis is by far one of the worst 'games' I have ever played.\n\nTo say this 'game' is bug ridden is an understatement.  Randomly walk thru walls?  Check.  Exits not linked properly?  Check.  Random graphic glitches?  Check.  Items that don't do what they say they are suppose to?  Check.  Typos all over?  Check.  Items that you can repeatably loot over and over?  Check.  Good luck getting the five laughable easy to get achievements.  It randomly can take dozens of tries to trigger it, despite doing the same thing literally every single time before.\n\nThe 'game' itself is horribly linear with no story and no direction given.  You are punished for leveling up, as the foes grow in power much faster than you do from gaining levels.  Classes make little to no difference in play style or abilities.  Archers are even more punished by having a limit of 99 arrows.  It can take 10 to kill a single foe, forcing them to use the basic knife most of the time.  Gold flows so much so you can easily afford to get full stacks of every usable item in the 'game'.  Not that his helps much, as foes do so much damage by mid game that getting hit once or twice can kill you and getting stun locked happens too much.\n\nTo top it all off, it's maybe only a few hours long.  This is not an early release game or alpha, yet it clearly plays as if it was.  For 2.99 you can do much better.  Even free, in this current state of release, don't bother.","September 15, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is basically no storyline and there is no plot--just beat a few bosses, get the last guy, the end!\n\n***Spoilers To Follow***\n\nThis is the most basic of game designs. Defeat around 4 or 5 bosses and unlock the gates to the final boss. There is dialogue in this game but it might as well have none since 90% is non-informational and irrelevant to the plot. Wait--there is no plot--nevermind. There were some cool aspects to this game, but it needed more people working on it or something.\n\nAlso, there are bugs. But for around $1.00, who cares? Nothing too bad.\n\nLastly, I beat the game (thinking I was only in the beginning) and the final boss says "So you did it..." or something to that effect. Then I was put to the title screen. I believe anyone could design a game better for $1.00, but I didn't feel I wasted my money. Just my time.\n\nHope the developers do not take this in a wrong way, but if you are going to charge (even for a tiny amount), have something worth it there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altrewin/recommended/396160/","altrewin","altrewin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altrewin/","1409 products in account","Full Disclosure\nI was given this a copy game by the developer(s) (or someone in contact with them) to review.\n\nReview\nSecret of Magia is a bit of an interesting title for me, at first I was rather enjoying it. It had an OK story, some character progression and even some nice things like a HookShot! Unfortunately it went downhill from there (and before that even).\n\nI personally played this game with an Xbox 360 controller, as that's what I generally enjoy playing this style of game with. Sadly there appears to be no documentation of the controls for it.\nSo here's roughly what they seem to be for me:\nA - Run/Walk + Hookshot\nB - Menu (Really odd binding IMO)\nX - Attack/Interact\nY - Magic\nLB - Shield\nSelect - Quick Menu (also used for cycling between quick menus)\nStart - Also used for cycling quick menus, but cannot be used to access it in the first place)\nRB/LT/RT - Appear to be unused.\n\nNow while the game was fun for the first hour or so, unforunately it simply became a grindfest of bugs and dull combat. It is worth noting that I played as a Paladin class, so other classes *may* be more interesting, but for me it simply consisted of standing diagonally from an enemy and spamming the attack button (the cooldown on combos seems very short IMO).\n\nThis tactic ends up changing slightly for enemies that have a ranged attack as I will simply attack them head on because they have no melee secondary attack, leaving them essentially paralyzed while I attack them. Magic attacks are OK, but they have no cooldown meaning they can easily be spammed. (I only seemed to have access to a fire spell and ice spell as a Paladin, with the ice being a sort of ball shot straight ahead, and the fire being multiple revolving fireballs).\n\nNow you might seem to think that combat isn't so bad from this, but enemies get tougher the higher level you are, the problem is that while their health gets ever higher my attack doesn't seem to level at the same rate (or at all), with most monsters now taking up to 70 (yes seventy) hits to defeat at level 16 with the best weapons I currently have.\n\nI also have ended up with virtually endless money as well from every monster I come across up to the first boss, meaning I can basically never die by drinking as many life potions as needed due to them having no cooldown.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the game has no hint system or in-game map (short of the maps you can find on tables in some houses). I have played through as much of the game as I can, but I cannot find a key item, despite knowing roughly where it is, this is also despite having the key item that should come after it (as far as I know).\nSPOILERS:I cannot find the Wind Element, I assume it is in the catacombs but I do not know how to get in there as it appears to have a never ending staircase (as seen in Super Mario 64). I also already have the Fire, Ice and Earth Elements.\n\nNow I suppose we must move onto the bugs I discussed earlier. Some of these have already been mentioned in other reviews, but I will mention them again nonetheless.\n- The lighting engine appears to be broken entirely, I didn't realise this until looking at the screenshots now with their lovely lighting, yet my game appears to be running at max brightness with no shadows or dynamic lighting of any kind, the game looks almost completely different without it.\n- Many objects are solid for no apparent reason (such as foliage, there are some flowers that are seemingly identical, yet one is solid, the other isn't)\n- Many walls aren't solid (e.g. Multiple walls in the Church aren't solid meaning you (and NPCs) can walk on them.\n- There's a key that you can pick up In the Ancient Forest in an area with a Waterfall and Cave that I can pick up as many times as I want for no apparent reason, I now have 7 of said key in my inventory.\n- This is not necessarily a bug per se, but I noticed that after a couple of hours of playing my ears were beginning to hurt, the sound effects for melee attacks appears to be rather harsh, thankfully I was able to disable this via the RPGMaker menu (F1).\n\nReally I just don't think I can recommend this game, it has too many bugs, combat has become tedious (I avoid as many enemies as I can now), and it just wasn't a particularly fun experience (apart from the first 30min-1hr). Maybe once Secret of Magia gets updated a bit I'll revisit it and update my review, but for now I cannot recommend it.","August 23, 2015","false","4.5"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","9","30","0","0"

While I don’t like when developers bring in other games as a selling point (which also sets the bar really high), you can see that the developers had a clear idea of what they wanted to do. Unfortunately they were held back by the limits of RPG Maker, which made the game worse than it should have been. An original battle system, but extremely easy to abuse. And while the game wasn’t designed for story purposes, I can’t forget about how uninteresting the characters were, how clichéd the story was and how extremely disappointing the ending was.

For the price, it's not too bad - but it has some serious flaws. If you're looking for something to kill a bit of time, it's fine, but I feel like it could have been so much more.\n\nPros:\nIt's a cute little game overall, it has an interesting battle system, which I definitely like, however, that's about all it has going for it. The different attacks of the monsters gives an interesting challenge.\n\nCons:\nAlthough there are occasionally some nice graphics, the overall mapping is rather dull. Every house has the same layout and almost the same interior, the outside is rather lifeless.\nThe story and characters seem one-dimensional and without any purpose.\nPossibly most glaring, there's a huge balancing problem. The monsters' combat abilities scale with your level, and it doesn't do it very well.\n\nOther than that there are a lot of obvious glitches that should have been fixed by now. It's really a shame, because the game does have some potential.","December 30, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main reason for my negative review though is the fact that it has numerous game breaking glitches.  Pretty much, if you aren't prepared to fight a boss and are stupid enough to save right outside the Boss room, you get locked out permanantly if you leave.  Don't buy this game, for any price, Game developers don't deserve a single penny if they can't be bothered to release a game that breaks and punishes players for trusting save points.","April 12","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"sob" "sob" and made me feel stupid. "sob" "sob"\nBecause equiping and having gear in a rpg to me is the main focal point of any rpg experience.\nBut in this game the gear it's litterally a condom.\nA condom that was put on incorrectly to be exact.\nBecause you think your well protected with this Supposably OP gear but in the end you find out it was made out of cheap plastic thats breaks open when any sort of pressure is put on it.\n"cough" "cough" My butt "cough" "cough"\nah srry had something stuck in my keyboard that made it cough battery acid but what I was trying to say was.\nA condom in my butt, but enough weirdo comments aside now.\n\nDo I reccomend this game?\nYes "because I want you to waste your money like I did"\nBut just to warn you it gets boring really fast because of the lack of a good storyline and the little change gear and leveling does to your character.","April 2","false","6.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

IE: Bad ending! (Spoiler: This is the ending - "..." [Flash to Title Screen])\n\n* The game breaking bug is that essentially after you get the key while you're IN the dungeon, if you go forward, unlock that door, (save or not), and then backtrack - you have to get that key again.  Unfortunately when you try to unlock that door AGAIN, it doesn't work.  The game is broken completely in that sense.\n\n\nWhat I don't really get about the company that made this game is why?  You can clearly make a solid game and develop it thoroughly.  Why wouldn't you put in the extra effort to develop the game more?\n\nFill out the story line, add more game mechanics, items, and worthwhile quests.  Add more sections to the game and give it more direction so people can enjoy it more.  There's so many things you COULD do to a game like this, and yet it seems so rushed out that it's disappointing.\n\nThis game has and had so much potential but unfortunately it's squandered by the developers decision to cheap out on the important aspects and release what feels like a barebones game or even an alpha game.\n\nI'm glad that this game has steam trading cards so that I can sell them and recoup my purchase of this game (along with the entire JRPG bundle).  At least I can use the money I get from the cards to buy another bad title to forget about this bad title.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're truly bored and want something to entertain you for a couple hours - then get this game.  Otherwise, invest your money elsewhere.","May 11","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
