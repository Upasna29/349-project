Thankfully, this never came to fruition. After a few changes, and a few publishers later, Sleeping Dogs came to be. Some will say it is the spiritual successor to the True Crime series. I'd like to think the connection never happened. Mainly because this game is just that good. Too good to be tied to a deservedly so dead series.\n\nSleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong, and has you playing the role of an undercover cop with ties to a small group of triads, as you work your way up through the ranks, and work from both sides, as a straight up police officer, and an undercover officer playing a triad member who gets in too deep. It's a risky business, but for our main protagonist Wei Shen, it's all part of his life now.\n\nSleeping Dogs is an open world action game modeled after games like Grand Theft Auto. You can run around freely, drive cars and ride motorcycles, and either take on main and side missions, or do other things as you progress through the game. Sadly, there is not much to do in terms of sandbox play. The world is very nicely detailed, and seems to be alive with the amount of people you will see moving about, but there just is not enough freedom to make this a real sandbox open world game. Most of the things you'll find yourself doing will be set up as part of the game instead. And anything you make up along the way will be few and far in between. Unlike open world games like San Andreas or Just Cause 2, where you can spend countless hours outside of any scripted events, making the game seem like your own little playground. This may be partially due to how constrained the world is. You can wander around streets, and inbetween buildings, and even inside of some, but the world is not as open as I would have liked it to be. Just don't be fooled by how big the map is, as lots of areas can not be accessed outside, due to barriers. Regardless, it is still a pretty big world. Just not ripe for exploration. Hopefully this gets remedied in the sequel.\n\nAs for action gameplay, its nice. You won't find yourself using guns often, but when you do, the cover system is decent, and aiming is not too bad. You even get a few max payne style moves, like slo-mo diving thrown in the mix. The star of the combat however would be the hand to hand stuff, which is reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games. You will not be one on one most of the time, but rather one on many. Weaving in and out, doing parries, and a number of nicely animated kicks, punches, and grapples with ease. It's almost like poetry to see it in motion. When you are running from cops, or chasing down the enemy, you'll also find that Wei Shen is a good master of parkour. You don't have a jump button sadly to just jump whenever, but instead the parkour is tied to platforms and obstacles. So you run up to a wall, and Wei Shen will run up and grab a ledge when hit the proper button. He can jump over gaps, slide over obstacles like cars and tables, and more. Again, this is quite nice to see in action.\n\nAs for the audio, it's fantastic. You have a nice selection of radio stations, featuring both HK Eastern and Western themed stations, full of commercials, and great music. You also have some amazingly done voice acting, helping to bring the story to life, with a cast of seasoned voice actors and tv and movie stars. The voice acting is also a mix of english and cantonese. Mostly english spoken, but a bit of cantonese here and there for authenticity. Some characters will also only speak in cantonese. While pedestrians will almost always speak in english. But the accents are just right even when spoken in english.\n\nSleeping Dogs may not be the ticket for anyone wanting a true sandbox open world game, but for those starving for a good action game with an open world set piece, and a great story. Sleeping Dogs is the perfect fix.\n","November 25, 2013","true","36.4"," 550 of 597 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","550","597","0","9"

The game has been compared to other games in the genre, most notably, GTA. While similar in gameplay, Sleeping Dogs is no clone. It has an interesting story that should keep you enthralled, coming up in the underworld of a criminal organization, racing across the streets of Hong Kong, shooting it out with rival gang members all while undercover for the HKPD.

I came back to it and recently bought it again because it was on steam sale. My only complaint is the DLC. PLEASE, be careful and read what the DLCs are and what they give you. Buying the complete DLC package is totally game-breaking. It really hurts my enjoyability of the game because it's way too easy to play now. Here's some things you should avoid the DLC because:\nRight out of the tutorial/first few starter missions, you become level 8/10 on triad and cop. Face is I believe 7.\nYou gain more XP from everything.\nYou are level 10 (max) in everything by the time you get to the mission that gives you the impounded car (Race Scene mission). Not to mention that the DLC gives you about a dozen cars already before then.\nYou begin the game with $200,000 in your pocket. One of my best memories of this game is how hard it was to hustle to get money, and how rewarding it was to afford the things you want. Now, before I even get the first starter car, I can afford every car in the game practically.\nYou receive a lot more money from everything. You will start receiving at least $5,000 from every short mission. $5,000 used to be a lot, now it's chump change with the DLC.\nYou receive outfits with overpowered stat bonuses. One outfit gives you 60% reduction from all melee damage taken. That makes sense, right? Another outfit (Super Swat) reduces ALL incoming damage by  50%. That is rediculous, even for late game. Some outfits (like the deus ex outfit) even give you guns. Equip the deus ex, agent 47 or any of those outfits and it gives you the fitting weapons (flechette rifle for sarif armor, silenced pistol for agent 47 suit).\nYou will already own all player homes. I didn't figure this one out until it was too late. I was freeroaming looking for drug busts when I came up on one of the best player homes you can get, the mansion. It was unlocked. I could use it. It was my home already, it even marked it on the map.\nThere will be absolutely nothing to work for. You get all the free guns, clothes, houses, cars and even money you will need. I currently have about $600,000 and I haven't even gotten to the part where wei is kidnapped.\nThere are more reasons to avoid some of the DLCs than this. Now, I'm not saying that ALL the dlc are bad. A lot are fun, actually. I enjoy a lot of the ones that add content to the game. However, a lot of them are WAY too game breaking.\nDLC YOU SHOULD AVOID:\nHigh Roller Pack (near infinite money, best car. It gives you a nice suit but that's not very important)\nThe Red Envelope Pack (It adds 20 packages for $50,000 at each Parking Garage in the freeroam world, totalling one million dollars you can get in 10 minutes of driving)\nTop Dog Gold/Silver Pack (INSTANTLY gives you a ton of XP in all fields, makes you near max level at beginning of the game)\nSquare Enix Characters Pack (I do enjoy this pack, but it is something I must warn you about. Gives you deus ex and agent 47 outfits, which come with overpowered outfit bonuses and free guns)\nRetro Triad Bundle (The outfit this pack gives you makes you do more damage, gain more triad and face XP, and gives you more melee damage resistence. Overpowered)\nMovie Masters Pack (Added this purely because of the Bronze Warrior outfit it gives you. It looks cool, but it's unlore friendly and gives you 60% resistence to melee damage which is overpowered)\n\nI hope this review helped you a bit. Now, I'd like to mention again, these DLCs are fun. They add more opportunities for replay and freeroaming. However, you should avoid getting these if it is your first time playing the game, it honestly ruined most of the fun for me since I was way overpowered at the beginning of the game. The fact that this (mostly) singleplayer game is basically Pay-to-Win makes it deserve my downvote. I hate that I can't love this game, it's one of my favorites, but I must warn you how game breaking the DLC is.","June 25, 2014","false","53.0"," 481 of 638 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","481","638","0","53"

Sleeping Dogs is more grounded in reality and focuses more on having a believable narrative and atmosphere.  That said, the gameplay is still very enjoyable and there is plenty of extra stuff to do besides playing through the main story.

This is Hong Kong, where strength and skill is valued and measured in epic, pleasant hand-to-hand combats. But even despite that, the use of firearms will depend on your type of game play, and the game will satisfy that lack of weaponry, in amazing breath-taking missions as you progress in the game.\n\nIsn't Hong Kong a bad choice for a game like this?\n\nDefinitely not, Hong Kong is currently one of the most wealthiest places in the world; It has everything from a deep underground gang network, a gym to practice or learn new moves after completing each task, a club for you to interact with other people and to complete other side objectives, to random optional objectives and events that will appear in-game.\n\nHow are the graphics and the environment design?\n\nTo begin with, the game's designers performed extensive research in Hong Kong to create an accurate portrayal of the city. Art designers spent seven days in Hong Kong, where they studied the city's environment, and took more than 20,000 photos as references for the physical environment in the game. And the result was that many reviewers praised the authenticity and charm of the city in the game.\n\nYou mentioned the importance of the story line at the beginning, will this mean that after the game story line is completed, there wont be anything else to do?\n\nNo, almost all side quests and task will continue to be there, and the game wont change at all in order to preserve it's longevity.\n\nShould I buy this game? and why?\nThis game is the perfect for anyone who either likes a good detective main story line, an open world sandbox like the GTA game series, and a similar fighting system seem in many fighting genre games.\n\nI would rate this game 81 out of 100, or 4,5 out of 5,0.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/202170/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFoaG9950sM\n\nFans of film directors like Johnnie To, Ringo Lam and John Woo will feel right at home in Sleeping Dogs. You take control of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong native who has just returned home after spending some time in the United States. He is working as an undercover cop under superintendent Thomas Pendrew and his handler Raymond Mak in an effort to take down a powerful Triad gang known as the Sun On Yee. Wei's assignment positions him as a lowly thug under the wing of a 'roided out hothead named Winston Chu and follows his ascension to a prominent figure within the Sun On Yee. Things become complicated however, as the line between undercover cop and criminal blurs. Wei becomes deeply entrenched in the criminal underworld, building friendships with his gang-mates while witnessing signs of corruption within the police force. The yarn spun by Sleeping Dogs is solid enough but it's telling stumbles. Pacing is all over the place, and many important elements seem undercooked. Sleeping dogs has issues integrating plot points into missions and providing build up. For example, Winston has a fiancee that is revealed when you have to run a few errands for her as part of a mission. She softens Winston's image and makes him a little more human but, unfortunately she exits the plot just as abruptly as she shows up making her little more than a tool to develop Winston. Thankfully the finale builds in a satisfying way and there are some sections that are really effective and engaging in the middle portion of the tale. Its just a shame that it couldn't be more consistent and better developed.\n\nBeing an undercover cop Wei must straddle the line between right and wrong and missions reflect this. Good guy Wei finds time between running errands for the triad to assist a police inspector with some of her cases. Triad missions are strait forward affairs that usually involve collecting protection money, stealing stuff, beating the hell out of other gang members and maybe shooting a few people. Cop cases play out more like multi-stage quest chains commonly associated with RPGs. Wei also earns experience for both a cop skill tree and a triad skill tree. You earn both types of experience in both mission types but being a public menace and destroying public property or killing civilians will take away from the cop experience you can earn in a mission. Throughout the course of Sleeping Dogs Wei hacks cameras, races, sings karaoke, cracks combination locks, plants bugs, triangulates cellphone calls, bets on ♥♥♥♥ fights, plays mahjong poker and picks locks. The game does a great job of mixing these elements up and missions are generally interesting with only a few lame ducks.\n\nAll of the aforementioned elements are secondary to the driving, fighting and shooting you will be doing to make your way through the game. The fighting system in this game really shines. Wei relies on strikes, grapples and counters to dispatch his foes. Enemies come in varieties as well, some specialize in strikes and block many of your attacks, grapplers are burly chaps that you want to keep at bay with power strikes, some enemies wield knives and tire irons and later in the game you will find enemies that are really only susceptible to counters. If you want to live in Sleeping Dogs, you will have to prioritize your foes and time your attacks carefully. Your wushu can be supplemented by finding Jade statues that can be returned to the Kung Fu master in the game. These moves are valuable tools and you will find yourself utilizing most of them. They allow you to snap your opponents limbs, deliver powerful blows and disarm your foes. It's a great system and is evolves enough during the course of the game to remain engaging. Driving is similar to other open world games with cars that handle differently based on weight and size. The one unique addition to the driving mechanics is a button that allows you to throw the car sideways by pushing the appropriate button or key and moving in the direction you wish to go. This allows you to ram vehicles that are in hot pursuit of Wei. Motorcycles, scooters and boats are also among the vehicles you will pilot. Shooting is of the cover-based variety and Wei can vault from cover and enter slow motion as well as blind fire. It's solid but the mechanics are not as unique and engaging as the hand to hand combat. In light of this most of the game focuses on hand to hand confrontations.\n\nSleeping Dogs' interpretation of Hong Kong is an efficiently constructed playground. There is an unusual amount of verticality in this game despite the lack of air vehicles. Wei can climb the ledges and scaffolding around a number of the building and access rooftops. Pedestrian overpasses on the streets also provide access to high places in which numerous collectables are tucked away. Free running is also a part of Sleeping Dogs' bag of tricks. At certain points Wei will have to pursue targets on foot through a gauntlet of barriers and other impediments. These sections involve the player running after them and timing button presses to clear obstacles gracefully, poor timing results in fumbling over an obstacle and loosing ground. The animations for these sections don't flow together as smoothly as those in Assassin's Creed but the extra input required to complete them is a welcome addition that adds a small layer of interactivity in what is usually a passive experience in other games. It's just a shame that the camera is not exactly stellar. It seems to have a knack for being in the wrong place most of the time. Strangely absent is the ability to center the camera with a button press that's so common in third person action games.\n\nOn the PC, Sleeping Dogs is a really pleasing game to look at. Square Enix has also made a high resolution texture pack available for those with decent rigs and includes some DX11 features. Hong Kong is wonderfully detailed with neon signs glowing, power lines forming webs overhead, air conditioning fans spinning on the sides of buildings, and plenty of pedestrians and traffic to make the city feel alive. Also, the game wisely uses rain to give everything a nice sheen--as it rains the wet pavement reveals reflections of neon signs and characters appear wet. The handful of interiors are also detailed and pleasing to look at. NPCs are not too detailed and are a little more robotic as a result of a low poly count and the cars are not tremendously detailed but these are technical limitations that are to be expected. The main characters however are richly detailed, making the cutscenes a treat. Skin textures are very detailed and the tattoos that adorn the bodies of the gangsters add quite a bit of character to each of them. You can also customize the clothing that Wei wears and wearing certain combinations of clothing can provide stat benefits. Cloting options are rather varied accounting for both ridiculous looks and strictly business attire.\n\nFor a game that was almost canned, Sleeping Dogs is quite impressive. The story fumbles around before ending on a strong note and the camera can be irritating but these faults are offset by great mechanics and strong visuals on the PC. Sleeping Dogs isn't ready to dethrone Grand Theft Auto as the best open world crime game but it's robust mechanics and numerous diversions make it a strong addition to the genre. It appears that Square Enix stuck gold by reviving this dead dog.","January 31, 2014","true","30.2"," 120 of 140 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","120","140","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/recommended/202170/","senshado","Homework Chavez - 70% finished","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/","187 products in account","Sleeping Dogs was a game I bought in Steam's 2013 Autumn Sales, after being curious about this game for a long time and being aware that looking up YouTube footage might have spoiled the story for me, this sale was a good opportunity for me to just gamble on this one.\n\nAnd it was jackpot for me. Having played Just Cause 2, GTA 1 to 4, Saints Row 3, L.A. Noire and countless other free roaming games, I was completely overwhelmed by how convincing Hong Kong was portrayed in Sleeping Dogs. Hong Kong, which in this review refers to the map in Sleeping Dogs, is a graphically pleasing platform that carries the player through a gritty storyline revolving around Chinese gangsters. Even though the city is small compared to most of the aforementioned free roaming city games, there is a healthy amount of detail put in every square foot of Hong Kong, making the city feel as big as it would have felt in real life. The city dynamics are downright convincing, you will encounter a large amount of variation among the residents, each with their own reason for being on the street. This, and the amounts of interaction provided for the player, is something that at the time of writing is not appreciated enough in the industry.\n\nSleeping Dogs features oriental themed music to reinforce that atmosphere. The genre of the background music as well as the radio stations vary from hip-hop to classic, all with Chinese roots. Luckily, a great majority of the used vocabulary is English, although you may encounter a Chinese swearword here and there. This is translated in the subtitles and may seem a bit forced, if not out of place. Personally I find it understandable considering a full English or Chinese transcript would've alienated the player from the casting in this context, or otherwise not being able to follow the story at all.\n\nIt's important that this appeals to the player as the emphasis of the game heavily lies on the implied Chinese gangster culture. This means that gunplay and car-craze is reduced to a minimum when compared to other games in this genre. Rather than mowing down your enemies it's more common to have to fight people barehanded, the use of several martial arts and enemies with different specialities makes this less linear than it may sound. I wouldn't go as far as calling this game less violent either, if anything, this game deserves its 18+ rating more than the others in its genre.\n\nHaving that said, the mechanics of the game definitely require getting used to, luckily this is achieved through a clever tutorial that gradually increases the freedom you have while playing.\n\nTo progress through the game there are countless of missions and events to participate in, and not all of these are fun to do. In fact, there's some dreadful shooter-on-rails included. Luckily this wasn't so common that it started to bother me more than I could take but these are things that make Sleeping Dogs far from perfect. It's a missed opportunity to go down in history as a classic, though looking back on what Sleeping Dogs did manage to achieve, it would be greedy to ask for much more.

In pure escapist terms, the game lets me renounce my mild, introverted mannerisms and embrace the violent, yet honour-bound way of life as a member of a Chinese Triad organisation. In other words, I get to assume the unfamiliar role of a bad-a$$, and guess what? I love it.\n\nAs a pensive nerd, I would quietly apologise and then flee from any threatening bullies. As a righteous member of the Sun-On-Yee however, I could--and frequently would--Dim Mak  anyone, and I mean anyone, that so much as coughed near me. The combat is a lot of fun, reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham series, although not quite as fluid.\n\nThe reckless abandon is invigorating when you've spent your life adhering to laws and rules. It helps that the characters and story, whilst clichéd, are likeable and intriguing. Hong Kong as a setting is also quite refreshing.\n\nBe warned, though. The game has issues starting half the time, and I was constantly verifying the game cache to play it.","May 8, 2014","true","41.0"," 78 of 91 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","78","91","0","4"

The game has you infiltrating the ranks of the Triads as undercover cop Wei Shen on an island off the mainland of Hong Kong.\n\nSleeping Dogs places a strong emphasis on hand to hand combat giving you the opportunity to unlock a wide range of different combos to be used while fighting. The combat very closely resembles that of Batman: Arkham City however doesn't feel as smooth, regardless anyone who enjoyed that series will probably enjoy this.\n\nEvery now and then you will be required to use a gun, personally I think they should have just focused on Melee combat either way the guns add some extra "action" to the game. A cover system is also included to allow you to avoid being shot and an interesting bullet-time mechanic allows you to vault over cover and take out enemies in slow-mo.\n\nFor those who like collecting stuff there is a large amount of collectable items in game to find while playing, you can also obtain several houses and dozens of clothing items, vehicles and furniture to customize your character.\n\nSleeping Dogs also features achievements which cover all aspects of the game including DLC content so I suggest, if you care for the achievements, you also pick up the DLC so you can 100% the game. I took roughly 35-40 hours to 100% the game and should a Steam sale come up I think you should play it too!\n\nPros\n\n+ Fantastic graphics\n+ Interesting story\n+ Plenty of content\n+ Enjoyable fighting\n\nCons\n\n- Controls could be better\n- Map could be bigger\n- Achievements require DLC\n\nVerdict: 8/10","December 24, 2013","true","35.1"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","53","63","0","5"

While guns are a big part of Grand Theft Auto in Sleeping Dogs hand-to-hand combat is the most used weapon, with Knifes/bars coming in second. you can get guns, but not by buying them. you have to take them from the police or the elite thugs. this is the first thing about Sleeping Dogs i dislike. i would have liked to been able to buy guns at a store or something, but i understand that the games core focus is the hand-to-hand fighting.\n\nGameplay in Sleeping Dogs is like i said very hand-to-hand combat focused but there are elements of hacking, and just like Grand Theft auto, following missions. but just because the game is focused on the hand-to-hand combat does't mean its not fun. in fact its a lot like playing Batman Arkham Asylum, but with added mechanics. you can smash people into environmental objects and watch a little animation of you beating the heck out of the poor guy. you can throw them into giant speakers, drown them in a public toilet, beat them with a public phone, and more.  Sleeping Dogs also has a strange mechanic called "face". Face is a lot like reputation or renown in other games. you get face for completing missions and doing other activities. the Face mechanic is at most a hamper in your quest for freedom and at least an annoyance. without the proprer level of "Face" you can't do certain things like buy the really cool cars. so even if you have the money you have to have the Face to get it.\nCars in Sleeping Dogs are great looking and fun to drive. they are a lot better than the cars in Grand Theft Auto. and they look better than Grand Theft Auto cars. once you buy a car you can get it from any parking area in the city. the amount of cars you can have are unlimited. if you have the money and face you can have the car. unfortunately Sleeping Dogs has no car editing or customization whatsoever, other than changing the car color. the cars are everywhere on the streets and you can grab any car you want, but you can not save that car to use like in Grand Theft Auto. Sleeping Dogs is also riddled with annoying quick time events. if you get hand-cuffed QTE! if you get grabbed QTE! if you get knocked over QTE! they are everywhere in this game, and they are really a quick time event, fail to do it on time and you will pay for it. even with the QTEs sleeping dogs is fun. i just wish there weren't so many of the dang things. Sleeping dogs also has skill trees and perks. you can get upgrade yourself to get more health, easy access to weapons, or new fighting moves.\n\nThe story in Sleeping Dogs is that your character Ricky Wong a would be drug dealer, is forced to become a undercover cop when he is threaten with lock up time in prison. he then must dive into a dangerous world of drug lords and turf wars. all the while working for the police to catch them. it is of course not easy. the story of Sleeping Dogs is great, while its not the best story ever it is a good story, it feels nice to be on the good side, and yet still be a kinda of "bad guy". and that is another great thing about the game, you can be a rouge/ends justice the means kind of guy or a good/nice cop. playing by the rules will give you more perks in the Police skill tree while being a rule breaker will give you more perks in the Criminal skill tree.\n\none more thing that Sleeping Dogs does better is that the game runs good. remember how Grand Theft Auto crashes and lags up so often? Sleeping Dogs rarely has any of that. granted Grand Theft Auto's world is bigger that Sleeping Dog's, but at least Sleeping Dogs runs like it was made for PC. in the end i would recommend Sleeping Dogs for anyone who likes games like Grand Theft Auto,Saints Row, or Just Cause 2.\n","April 28, 2014","true","38.8"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

This was my "Game of the Year" for 2012. I genuinely believe that if this were just a tiny bit better, it could have been considered a masterpiece.\n\nSleeping Dogs is a genuinely fun game. Controls are solid, responsive, and the game has plenty to do. Whether it's chasing down dudes from another triad with your sports car - SMG's and pistols spitting hot lead in all directions, or it's smashing a thug's head into a car door, or even slapping a hobo with a fish, this game does not stop being entertaining. There are tons of challenges for one to do - including ones such as races, illegal fighting rings, and even chicken fights.\n\nSleeping Dogs is beautiful. The city of Hong Kong has never looked so good. At night, the neon lights glow bright, and are complimented by the game's graphical abilities. I'm not very "tech-savvy" (sorry to use that term), but Sleeping Dogs looks stunning, and runs well even on my somewhat old and under-powered setup.\n\nSleeping Dogs's story is compelling. There are very few games that have made me both laugh, and become visibly upset. This is one of them. I don't usually care this much for somebody who doesn't exist. This may sound stupid, but Sleeping Dogs hits true to heart when it needs to, and it will hit hard.\n\nGo buy this game (technically, go buy the Definitive Edition, since the original version isn't available on Steam anymore).\n\n97 out of 100. Some people may think that's pretty high, but this game was a saving grace for videogames, in my opinion.

I inquired about it but got not response from support.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nWei Shen a police officer trained in the USA, now working with the Hong Kong Police Department has been sent on a dangerous mission. To infiltrate and gather information on one of the largest and most dangerous Triad Organization in Hong Kong. Will he break under pressure or will he do his duty as one of Hong Kong's finest?\n\nPROS:\n+ Nice Graphics: -I like the visuals but you can clearly tell it was developed with consoles in mind. The only redeeming factor on this area is that a free high-texture DLC pack is available for download. The world is adequately populated by NPCs though at times some parts of the City does look empty. It has a day and night system as well as a weather system which adds to the game's atmosphere.\n\n+ Expansive Map: -Though not geographically accurate to the real Hong Kong, the game still provides a massive Island to explore, populated by a number of NPC citizens as well as a number of drivable vehicles. Driving and exploration on this fictional representation of Hong Kong is very fun and oddly calming.\n\n+ Interesting Combat: -The combat focuses primarily on punching people using street style Kung Fu martial arts, taking inspiration on the Batman Arkham games. Extremely violent and extremely satisfying in my opinion. This is further amplified by the fact that wearing different combination of clothing has benefits to your over all performance in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nCONS:\n- Very POOR Optimization: -As I said, this game was developed clearly with consoles in mind. Unexplained crashes, errors and FPS drops occur more than I would like. Not game breaking but It can be annoying and disruptive of the otherwise fluid gameplay.\n\n- Story: -Though I found it interesting and fun, it's still rather predictable and rather cliche. Even going so far as to have one (or several), "The Godfather" moments. My primary complaint is that there is only one ending to this game and your choices never really affects the ending which makes both "Triad & Police points" a bit useless outside of the combat skill tree.\n\n- Side Quest: -The game has a very good concept of side quest, offering both Police and Triad missions but they clearly weren't either finished or polished. I personally would have liked the "Drug Bust" missions to include proper detective work rather than have the game spoon feed who I should arrest.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPRETTY GOOD. Notwithstanding the fact it's "like GTA", Sleeping Dogs is unique in it's own sense. The story has just the right feel to keep you interested and the gameplay offers enough action to keep you satisfied. Though it's current full price is good, I'd wait for a sale.\n\nIf you want a break from the fun and mindless violence of GTA, Sleeping Dogs can provide a fresh story based alternative.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It's essentially an Asian GTA, although feels a lot more arcade-y, in that it's somewhat less realistic (cars in particular control very well compared to GTA) but is arguably more straight-up fun. I don't remember too many segments where you'll have to travel long distances without anything to do, or many particularly tedious tasks.\nI think one criticism that some people had was that it got a bit too repetitive. I can see where they're coming from, as many of the missions are more or less "kill this bunch of guys".

Gunplay does pop up occasionally and while it's not anything special, it works and feels decent enough.\n\nIf you want to be immersed in a game's world, and want to experience more than just a run of the mill story that's an excuse to shoot people, give Sleeping Dogs a try.","June 27, 2014","true","35.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

(Twice on my console.)\n\nAnyway, Sleeping Dogs is what people nowadays call a "GTA clone" when in fact it's more than what GTA can normally give in terms of a: Amazing and tense lore, the morale of a cop in Gangster's job, the act of having two separate story lines from either the Triad missions between the Police Case solving missions.\n\nSleeping Dogs as a game was amazingly enjoyable for me. The open world was fantastic, the humor was really satisfying here and there, Wei Shen as a main character is really likeable and the game really does make you feel emotion when a character dies at certein events.\n\nThe combat in Sleeping Dogs really does set itself to be the main glory point of it. Simillar to the Batman Arkham franchise, the combat consists of Melee attacks and counters between attacks, the controls are only somewhat unusual from the standart open world experience but it takes not too long to get used to it. The enviroment kills like shoving someone's face into a lobster rock or a ceeling fan or destroying their face with a car door or just for simplicity shove them into a public toilet till they suffocate. The combat is not very challenging however in Sleeping Dogs, though for new players it will take time to get used to the timing of the counters and of such but with little training they can take on rival Triads with no sweat.\n\nGun combat in Sleeping Dogs appears a bit later on in the game and eventually turns into something you often get used to. Wether it's a firefigth against rival Triads or a armed high speed chase around Hong Kong, the feel of the gun mechanics feel really satisfying, even when ammo tends to be something you'd scavange for since you can't buy weapons though you can stuff a pistol in your back pocket.. Again not really challenging but really satisfying.\n\n\nThe story of Sleeping Dogs really sets itself as an Undercover Cop which tries to cripple a gang from the inside while also having the gang be his childhood friends...and enemies. Destined to revenge his sister's death he accepts this mission to cripple and weaken the Sun On Ye Triads while also being one himself as part of one of the gangs. The story has dramatic moments and amazing plot twists that are always rememberable.\n\nGraphichs are simply gorgeous on the PC. Having said that I can really only tell that I almost never had enough of looking at the amazing road textures and the neon signs on the streets at nigth!\n\nGame has alot of side activities like Poker Majong, street races, ♥♥♥♥ figths to bet on (Yes ♥♥♥♥ figths..) and also a battle fight club and much more!\n\nAll due these amazing stuff said about this game, it does suffer from some glitches that can be frustrating at times, some of which just look really odd that to be honest I never experienced on a console. They're not horrible but they can bug you at times.\n\nAll in all, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game! By far one of my faveorites of all time! I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the standart Open World genre and also to those that are looking for a change from your typical GTA/Saints Row.\n\nI give this game a 9.7/10","August 24, 2014","true","23.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","7"

Not only does it have Steam Cards, it's also one of the surprisingly good games I've played recently. Yes, you could almost say this was a... sleeper hit.\n\nOK, so that's hopefully got the terrible puns out of the way, now we can get to the crux of the matter. Sleeping Dogs is a game that deserves your attention; while it might be a new IP name wise, it has a storied history as 'True Crime'. However, due to rising costs Activision sold the rights to Square Enix who rebranded the game as 'Sleeping Dogs'. So yes it's 'new', but it comes with the benefits and years of experience built up from the previous True Crime games - perfect!\nThe game is an Open-World Sandbox game - think Grand Theft Auto x Saints Row.\n\nSleeping Dogs takes what I liked about GTA and what I liked about Saints Row and manages to meld them together into a game that has it's own unique qualities too. This perfect blend comes together to form a really unique and fun sandbox experience. The story is dark, based around an undercover police officer who is trying to destablise and expose the Triad groups in Hong Kong (think Infernal Affairs); the action is fast and frantic, like a John Woo movie; while there is a very refreshing melee element thrown in. It's the melee/Martial Arts element of the game that really allows Sleeping Dogs to stand tall on it's own merits, and not avoids being labeled as 'just another GTA clone'.\n\nIn fact the combat not allows this game to stand on it's own feet, but manages to propel it above GTA and Saints Row. The gunplay has refreshing, as it's not thrown down your throat at every turn and mission. Your mean weapons are fists and your fury, and melee weapons - yes melee weapons! Meat Cleavers, Swords, Batons, etc are all at your disposal, but it's the environment that will be your biggest weapon. Sure you can kick and punch through the Triad Forces like a young Bruce Lee, but it's when you turn your attentions to the walls, the fuse boxes and other nasty everyday objects that are in the world that you become a bad ♥♥♥ Jackie Chan. Grab the enemy and run towards the wall? Ram the guy's head into the wall. Run towards a dumpster? Throw that guy into the dumbster!! Run towards meat hooks... well I'll let you find out...\n\nI was honestly surprised at how fun the combat was, it wasn't as mindless as some GTA games where you seemingly have an arsenal of weapons to use at any given time. It wasn't as endless as Saints Row where mobs just keep coming. It had the ideal balance between mobs and user abilities. Sometimes frustratingly you notice that it's always 1v1 in melee combat, despite several other bad guys standing around waiting for you to stop being attacked by their fellow goon - yet this seemed strangely fitting for the Kung Fu/Martial Arts tribute Sleeping Dogs manages to deliver on so many levels. However, if there is a sequal it would be nice to see Square Enix throw in multi-mob counters and combat ala The Batman: Arkham series.\nYet, you shouldn't dismiss the gun battles entirely either, as they're intense and just as fun. There's a nice nod to 'John Woo' with the addition of 'Slow Motion' gunplay when you vault out of cover, which can create some fantastic 'holy ♥♥♥♥' moments within the game as you clear a room with headshots and 'reactions'.\n\nThere are a few minor complaints I had about Sleeping Dogs, but none of them are gamebreaking and once you adapt to the game mechanics seem almost trivial. The driving can take some getting used to, and is perhaps the one area of the game that could do with a lot of TLC in any possible sequel. It's not terrible, just at times it feels as if your cars can't turn correctly, and it doesn't distract from some exciting highway chases and car chase/gun fights.\nBesides the Radio Stations are immense and contain some fantastic tracks to listen to and select for your driving madness.\n\nVisually the game is immense (if you download the free HD Textures map) and makes you wonder (at time of writing) why Watchdogs can't hit the same heights on PC (hopefully it will). When the rain falls and the city lights reflect on the wet film spread across the road, as you drive through the streets of Hong Kong you realise you're inside a wonderful looking gameworld. This game looks better than any GTA has managed to achieve to date on retail release. There are times when the shadows look a little goofy, and the blood splatters can almost become Splatterhouse-esque, but it doesn't distract too much from what is a wonderful looking game and world.\n\nOverall Sleeping Dogs manages to put together a great Sandbox game that pulls together infleunces from a range of sources - GTA, Saints Row, Asian Cinema. Yet, it seems to have went largely unnoticed, even 2 years after it's release I'm talking to people who haven't played the game or even heard of it. Those who have played seem to love it, and I can't blame them now that I've joined them.\nSleeping Dogs will provide you with ~15 hours of gameplay, with a rich story driven experience that has a very strong combat base to carry the action along. If you're a fan of Asian Cinema then you'll be in fanboy heaven as the nods and tributes appear throughout the game. If you're not a fan of Asian Cinema then I'd like to suggest you watch the following movies either before or after playing the game: Infernal Affairs, Police Story, The Raid.\n\nSleeping Dogs - A surprisingly good game.","March 18, 2014","true","17.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Especially in case of graphics, open world etc… but Sleeping Dogs confidents in his very own and special way.\n\nYou play an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, who tried to infiltrate the local triad. There you expect to collect tasks such as collect money, to fight other gangs, kidnap some important people, to steal cars etc. Soon you will experience that the Triad seek internal changes in the balance of their leadership.\n\nAt the same time you are giving important information to your boss police). You take out some enemies before you can hack some surveillance cameras. With these cams you can watch drugs handovers, viewing the dealer and call the police to arrest him. You can also do some special missions, following some member of the triade, make hidden photos and listen to some discussions about money transfers.\n\nIn my opinion, the story is very captivating and exciting. The voice acting is good and look very authentic. Dont forget, ist not america, ist hong kong, different driving sides, freakier cars and everything is like really densely built.\n\nAll quest are categorized in three different areas :\n\n- Police Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up)\n\n- Triade Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up)\n\n- Social Area (after completing a quest you earn xp and can level up)\n\nMany contents are comparable to Grand Theft Auto . There is a huge open world , lots of traffic , own cars (stealing, buying) , special clothing for your hero, weapons , several apartments and ancillary tasks. You can find hidden chests with money or clothing. To increase your energy, there are several shrines. To learn new fighting techniques, there are also hidden statues. These statues you can bring to your former teacher of martial arts. Afterwards he teaches you a new technique. You can train it in his fighting school. Focus of the game is the martial arts melee. Several kinds of enemies waiting for you :\n\n- Light opponents\n\n- Serious opponents\n\n- Wrestler\n\n- Enemies with weapons\n\n- Covered Opponents\n\netc.\n\n\nIn addition to the main tasks that you can solve, there will be also little Quests to raise your Social Status. For example helping a woman to sink her car in the river. With those points you can buy better clothes. The clothes also allow you to earn some extra attributes (for example 5 % more damage on enemies in fights). After some time you will have enough money to buy anything, it just matters how is your current level in each area (police, triade, social). Some things you can only buy if you have a minimum level in one of the areas.\n\n\nGraphics\nI dont want to talk much about the graphics. Check out some screenshots, even if you dont play this game on ultra settings, it looks great. It can not exceed GTA, but it still looks good enough in my opinion.\n\n\nControls\nYou can play it with both controller or keyboard. I prefer Keyboard, somehow I play most of those kind of games with mouse and keyboard. At least its much easier for me to hit targets with weapons instead of using the controller.\n\n\nMy conclusion\nIf you like GTA, then you will like this for sure. You can feel the intensity of the main character. I really like his way he speaks, the way he acts. He fits totally for this job.\n\nIf you love martial arts fightings with a mix of grand theft auto flavour, an open world, undercover action, a great story, then go and get it. I can only recommend the game.\n\nEnjoy it\n\nGreetz\nMajorKing\n\n\nPS: this was my first review of a game, who finds spelling errors in the text, can keep them xD","April 30, 2015","true","21.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

You play as Wei-shen, an undercover cop whom has the role of bringing down the infamous and well know Sun On Yee Triad affiliates. Through glorious and violent car-chases to all out blazing gunfights, and even lockpicking, hacking and the more suttle of detective work you experience the breadth and height of Hong Kong's underworld. You even approach romantic interest with an underlying premise of information that'll help you bring down the infamous Triads of HK. From martial arts moves reminescent of movie scenes to chasing down petty theives taking advantage of your goodnatured friendliness to help the denizens of HK this is a great game with hours of fun, missions, side quests, exploring and just being an in game cop or criminal. Outfits are varied and great, such as the ong bak themed preset, to the natural born genius Bruce Lee outfit from  "Enter the Dragon" this game has it all.\n\nCharacters are well presented, plot is fairly limited but linear, development of the protaganist is good, with solid foundations of his motive and even his background affecting his candidacy to be an informer within the Triads. Overall 10/10 game, visuals are stunning, soundtrack is just plain breathtaking, my favourite station is "softly" has amongst the coolest eastern hits like "from Xikou with love" and "love is heavy". Thumbs up, and hope to see a sequel to this True Crime renamed franchise :)\n\nRob, pleased player.","July 2, 2014","true","134.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It's a little on the short side, but the characters were likeable, the world is immersive, and the gameplay and combat were smooth as silk. Special props to the unarmed fight scenes where you could bust out the kung-fu combos, and the gunplay that rings of a cross between John Woo-esque cover vaulting and Max Payne Bullet-time. The vehicles seemed a little tacked on, but there are racing mini-games to satisfy your inner speed freak. Speaking of mini-games, there's also a "karaoke" type game a la Rock Band, which while silly, was still very enjoyable.\n\nI was very much reminded of Mafia II, delving into the gritty criminal underworlds; instead of the Italian Mafia Stateside, you're working your way up the Triads ladder in Hong Kong. The story was engrossing and you're stuck in the middle of being an undercover officer while trying your damnedest to not get attached to these lovable gangsters. If you're looking for an immersive crime drama with lots of action in an open-world that hasn't really been visited, go ahead and pick up this game.

I love to be in it, like it's Matrix of sort. It has a beat, that goes on and on. It's full of life, really! For some points, it's bested Euphoria engine, if you know where to look. It's fighting mechanics feels even better than in Batman games! So I really can beat thugs for eternity there, it's always fresh and nice feeling.\n\nBut, looking at some other points, this game tastes messed up. Story based on Hong Kong movies... just not give a hook for the most part of game progress. Some attached achievements feels very weird, like killing 50 cops for some "rogue cop gold". If you remember Karma from original True Crime, it's even weirder. Shooting mechanics and freerunning stuff almost always appear quite clumsy and far from natural. Driving mechs and some other game aspects just ripped from the "Wheelman".\n\nThen, you realise, that all in the game plot was made not quite right, probably because of some stupid focus group, playing every game like it's Carmageddon or Postal.\n\nNonetheless, it's quite a good game. It's GTA-clon, alright, and maybe not the best of them, but smooth, good-looking (with up-to-date-graphics), and have some personal charisma. For once, you play for a good guy, and not for a blood-thirsty deadbeat.

The game does a fantastic job of showing you the side of what it means to be part of a Triad family and that the police isn't necessarily the enemy here, nor are the Triads. Doing missions and assignments for both sides will test your moral standings and alignment. The story is good enough and has enough twists and turns to make you stay interested in finding out what happens at the end.\n\nGameplay wise, you will primarily be falcon punching your enemies or killing them with your horrible karaoke singing skills. The game does include guns but is primarily fighting focused. As per open world style, you can drive around the city looking for stuff to do. Options include but not limited to: driving for fun, ♥♥♥♥ fighting, dating, looking for shrines of health, delivering vehicles, participating in street races, learning fighting moves, hacking street cameras, karaoke, beating down groups of gangs, eating pork meat, drinking herbal tea, getting an erotic massage, buying clothes, yachting and I've probably missed half of the others.\n\nSo if you're in it for fighting, the drama of becoming a Triad gang member, the colorful Hong Kong city lights or just want to listen to some fantastic Chinese radio stations - be sure to pick up Sleeping Dogs, you will not be sorry.","November 27, 2013","true","24.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It feels a bit like combat in Assassin's Creed but somehow, better. You can use objects in your surrounding to perform 'environmental kills', throw a girl in your trunk and drive them around and even take a human shield! You can also learn combo attacks that are easy to master. Oh there's also the parkouring, jumping over objects, free running, climbing short walls, definetely on of the best delight. There's also the food and drinks that give you temporary boost in different stats. And also lots of collectibles which isn't easy nor hard to find. On vehicles, you can ram enemy vehicles, go into slow motion while shooting enemies, perform action hi-jack. The story is really great but i honestly think that it ended a little too quickly.

United Front did not pull any stops in creating a fantastic open world sandbox that incorporates all of the best features from similar games.\n\nThe game's portrayal of Hong Kong is very vibrant and believable and the NPCs are fun to interact with.  The game world looks amazing on the PC at full resolution (make sure to install the FREE HD texture pack DLC).\n\nThe combat system focuses primarily on melee with some gunplay mixed in at times.  The combat system plays similar in nature to the Arkham series of games and allows for cool environmental finishers in addition to some time-slowing "bullet-time" when leaping from cover.  Vehicle combat is also fun with action hijacking and time-slowing effects when firing your sidearm from your vehicle.\n\nThe main campaign story is very good and gripping, but also very predictable at some points.  As an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the Triad organization the game keeps making you think about your duties as a cop versus your loyalty to your "family".  The skill system reflects this conflict in rewarding experience as both a cop and a Triad gang member with experience being portioned based on your actions.  A very nice design feature in linking the advancement of the character to the moral implications of the story and how the player decides to play it out.\n\nAnd any game that uses voice acting from the legendary James Hong is great in my book!\n\nOverall if you enjoy similar games like Saints Row or the GTA series then you should love this game.  It is a very big open city with lots of activities to keep the player busy.  A very well thought out and designed game that made me feel that I was actually playing in a classic Hong Kong action film!  Sleeping Dogs is definitely among the top games I have ever played and I highly recommend.","September 26, 2013","true","40.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","5"

Then I discovered the game isn't just for laughs, although it has that in spades - the story is excellent too. I also had the pleasure of experiencing the awesome Batman: Arkham Asylum style combat in the game, including putting a guy through aquarium glass in a night club, breaking legs and arms, and just generally being a wrecking machine of a fighter. Good times, really good times. But there is more.\n\nBecause there are times in the game that are not only good, they're almost transcendental.\n\nOne evening, I woke up after a hard day/night before. I had some texts waiting on my phone, from both police investigators and thugs, and said to myself it was going to be alright, even though I was playing both sides. I got out of my apartment, picked up a car and started driving to my next mission. And then...\n\nI found myself just keeping on driving around the city.\n\nTime had stopped.\n\nI no longer sensed the room where my sorry gamer butt was actually sitting because I was no longer there.\n\nI'm in Hong Kong - for real. I can't stop driving. It's raining and the reflection from the neon lights in my car, the fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic music from the radio, the streets and back alleys, the people, the crowds - I'm completely immersed.\n\nAnd like throwing game money on pimped up outfits (that actually gives you bonuses sometimes, so they're more worth than just for "show"), and awesome, fun, expensive cars, I'm looking forward to throw a little bit of real money on United Front again - this time to buy the whole DLC pack to continue my stay in Hong Kong. It's been a journey like nothing else and it has been the best digital vacation ever.\n\nRecommended with all my heart - it rivals some of the best games I have ever played in my life.","April 7, 2014","true","34.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/202170/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","388 products in account","Sleeping Dogs is pretty cool I guess.\n\nSo back in the distant past of 2003, a little game came out called True Crimes: Streets of LA. It came out during a time when Grand Theft Auto was the biggest kid on the block and everyone wanted to be like him. But what TC did differently is let you play as a copper, a copper who knew martial arts mind you. How cool is that?\n\nThe game was alright and it had a sequel I never played, but my friends tell me it's horrible. So I'm going to take their opinion and claim it as my own. True Crimes: Streets of New York is horrible. So now fast forward to 2009 when the game "True Crimes: Streets of Hong Kong" was announced. But then a bunch of bad things happened and I'm pretty sure there was a sword fight (No, really), and True Crimes: Streets of Hong Kong was cancelled. Nothing was heard from it until Square Enix found the game concept at the bottom of a trash bin that I happened to be eating from, thank you very much for interrupting my dinner, Mr. Yasuhiro Fukushima. They rebranded the game as Sleeping Dogs, and here we are today.\nSleeping Dogs, not Sleeping Dougs, shut up Doug.\n\nYou play as undercover police officer: Wei Shen, an Asian-American who returns to his home city of Hong Kong to find answers and bring down a Triad organization called the Sun On Yee. Using his wits, his toughness, and his determination, Wei breaks into the Sun On Yee undercover and begins a life of crime. Also, he knows Martial Arts, how cool is that? He's like a Chinese Jackie Chan.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nUnlike GTA, Kung-Fu Konrad rarely ever finds fire-arms in the streets of Hong Kong, so the game has a more personal and crunchy feel to it's combat system, considering its mostly punching chumps in the mouth. It takes a lot of hints from the Arkham Series but then again what doesn't these days? You use a mixture of punches and heavy punches as well as grabs and counters to beat up people who are smaller than you. It takes a little while to get use to, but once you understand what enemy does what, it feels a lot more natural and high impact than most open-world combat systems. It's akin to crushing enemies underneath your feet like fortune cookies.\n\nFortune cookies aren't actually from China, I apologize.\n\nBut virtual Hong Kong that doesn't actually look like Hong Kong is sort of a big place, so you need to get around fast. Good thing Chop Stick Charlie can break into vehicles or buy them if you're a square, and drive with about with pretty slick and percise controls. Mind you this is Hong Kong, so traffic and other drivers are what you would expect.\nFor some reason, the traffic emperor deciced that it was opposite day and the roads are all ♥♥♥♥y. They should just be like America and keep the roads the way they should be. Right is right and left is wrong. Jeez.\n\nThe story is rather competant and managed to catch me off guard from time to time. It prizes itself as an adult story and actually has some themes and actions that I've never actually seen outside of movies. The voice actors are all competant and well spoken, but sometimes Wei Shen sounds like he's speaking his lines like he's reading from a cereal box. Though this isn't common. And sometimes the voice actors start mumbling and it sounds like they're speaking another language or something. How silly would that be?\n\n"But Dirk Dickbutt, you insanely handsome and sexually energized man" You say. "Why are you reviewing this one and not the Definitive version?"\n\nWhat am I? Made out of money? Get out of here with that you vulture!\n\nShould you play Comatose Canines?\n\nMind you, I played with a controller and I hear that playing with a keyboard and mouse works just about as well as two old people having sex. It has vintage appeal but it is by far the least effective method. This being said, I had fun playing Napping Lupines, although it felt like the ending was rushed and they could have done more with some supporting characters, It was a fun and well made experience. Muay Thai Terry is a pretty likable character once you get past the fact that he doesn't mind dating people while on undercover duty.\n\nResting Kittens gets 6 Bruce lee movies out of a possible 3.\n\nI discovered the Machine and it speaks in riddles.\n\n\nThe Curator, a place for adults who see ghosts.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\n","February 22, 2015","true","22.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","13","17","10","1"

They still sell an unpatched German only version without any dlc support (not even the high res texture pack). The low violence version is the almost unpatched game with severe technical issues that were patched in the uncut version. If you release a game censored then at least support it. This is just pathetic and did not get nearly get any media coverage or even an apology by Square Enix.\n\n(In case you're thinking the German government and laws are to blame: you are wrong, the actual "required" self-censorship for a rating (to openly sell it and advertise it) was incredibly minimal and justifies by no means the only German text and the lack of any support. This is just another example of publishers doing terrible, customer-unfriendly business.

The amount of effort that United Front Games put into development is shown from start to finish and the overall charm outshines that of any other sandbox game currently on the market. To help explain, the team spent weeks in Hong Kong taking pictures (20,000+) and recording audio to help their efforts in recreating the city. The world feels realistic and everything you encounter has personality. There was also extra work put into making it fully optimized for PC, fluid keyboard and mouse controls, specialized hardware support, and a day one high resolution texture pack to accommodate players with better machines are some of the few.\n\nThe game offers a nice mix of cop and Triad missions that help the pace of the overarching story, but there are plenty of things to keep you busy for the collector and completionist mind. Featuring a surprisingly well-driven narrative (... for a video game) centered around melee combat and parkour, there are also racing events, random jobs, fighting rings, hidden lockboxes, car deliveries, cockfights, gambling dens, dates (lol), and enough cars and clothes to collect to feel satisfied. Every character is fleshed out and feels real, the city is beautiful, and the soundtrack complements the themes and overall immersion very well.\n\nAfter having owned the game since launch, it remains of one of the few that I still like to revisit every now and again. It's fun, it's cheap, and it deserves a spot in everyone's Steam library. Give it a shot if it's still sitting there with zero hours played and get hyped for Triad Wars.\n\nWord of caution: You might be better off without the DLC for the first playthrough, as it gives you in-game experience that will unlock upgrades early on. It takes away most progression and is something to be wary of.","July 10, 2014","true","73.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's actually for me more gripping than any of GTA series for example. It's like good movie - full of great moments, action, and few emotion scenes. In few words great Yakuza story. It took me to finish all game in like 18 hours which's really long time, and additional 20 hours for completing it to 100% (And still ain't got all achievements :( In few moments I thought it's just end of the story, but good for me, it wasn't, and long way forward awaited.\n\nAnd here comes the question what's better - Fists or weapons.. Of course fists and by this, I gotta mind that fighting system is really awesome. Camera in fights never flew away or something like that. Doing enviromental kills is great fun, I'd say also very important part of the game. Covering is not so good at all, but as I said, primary players should use fists more than weapons (Gold Deagle :3)... You can buy furniture to your houses if you find seller in secret streets. You can buy cars to your garage. You can even bet money on cockfights.\n......................\n\nDLC's -\n\nBesides the game rating, it's important to mind DLC's.\nThere's 25 DLC's and excluding those which give you some in-game bonuses such as money, clothes, cars and stuff like that I won't mention. I'll mention only 3 - Nightmare in North Point, Year of the Snake and Wheels of Fury.\n\nFirst two are story filled but without previous story connection. They provides 10 achievements (5/5).\nStory of it NiNP is so stupid, that it ain't even worth to talk about. 3 types of some "magic" enemies, empty town and one magic sword. My godness what kind of bshit is that.\n\nYear of the Snake is pretty much better than NiNP. My personal feeling is, that it was prequel of police career of Wei Shen. More packed action than in main story, but defeat of cultist ? Oh come on.\n\nWheels of Fury contains less than 10 missions which point was to build hyper-car. I mentioned this because of fast look of it, enjoyment of the car, and additional rampage with it. Connected with main story means another rampage against Triads.\n...............\n\nSleeping Dogs - 8/10 (Awesome)\nNightmare in North Point - 1/10 (Really ?)\nYear of the Snake - 6/10 (Still recommending)\nWheels of Fury - 5/10 (Could be)\nOther DLC's - N/A (Not rated)","February 20, 2014","true","53.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You're one of them.......\n\nSleeping Dogs was supposed to be part of the "True Crime" franchise but instead went solo after Square Enix bought the publishing rights. In my opinion, this game deserves way more recognition.\n\nYou play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop whose mission is to take down the Triads residing in Hong Kong. You'll uncover the power, corruption, secrets behind the gangs and know what it means to be Sun On Yee.\n\nStory is a bit cliched in my opinion but is still very well executed. The character development is a bit weak, since I didn't actually feel any real, deep connections with the characters but the voice acting is honestly one of the best I've ever heard.\n\nThe visuals of this game is just wow, plus with the Hi-res texture pack, everything looks much clearer. Hong Kong is a bright vibrant place full of things to explore and people to kill. I live in a place where the environment is pretty much similar to Hong Kong so that's a plus xD I didn't really enjoy the music that much as you'll be focusing more on the action/driving/shooting.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics is the strongest point in Sleeping Dogs. It's like the Arkham series..... in an open-world-sandbox-type of game. Enemies are tough in the beginning, but you'll earn upgrades and moves that'll eventually make you untouchable ^_^ Guns are a rarity, since melee combat is its focus. Driving will take some time getting used to, it's very weird when you're driving slow and the camera angles don't really help, but when you're going fast, it's smooth and responsive.\n\nOverall Experience: I love this game, but it could've been better. I've experienced lots of flaws in the game such as cutscenes  not loading, game crashing on startup, GPS keeps on redirecting me, cars launching to space etc. Despite all of these errors, the game is very well-made and is pretty solid for most of the time. Plus there are cameras to hack, hidden loots to find, altars to upgrade health, gangs to eliminate, statues to recover, songs to sing, toilets to ♥♥♥♥ in, people to kidnap and loads of other stuff to do in this game.... It'll keep you busy for hours xD I very much recommend this game especially if you love the open-world genre.","January 13, 2014","true","30.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/recommended/202170/","kosmozuikis","Kosmozuikis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/","1177 products in account","Wonderful game. Looks like GTA and Yakuza had a child and it’s turned out to be awesome.\nSleeping dogs owns GTA4 in every way. I was forcing myself to finish GTA4 and enjoyed Sleeping dogs twice (on PS3 and after couple of years on Steam) and even collected all the achievements.\nFirstly the graphics are much better, GTA4 looks like crap and sleeping dogs looks great and when it’s start to rain it looks amazing. Sleeping dogs runs much MUCH better too while GTA4 is barely playable and bad looking even on high end machines.\nThe gameplay is much more fun than broken GTA4, where controls are pathetic, shooting is frustrating, cars are bouncing, etc. This is not existent in Sleeping dogs. Controls are really good except for some rare camera issues. Driving is fun, especially shooting while driving and hijacking. And shooting mechanics is great, it’s easy to target the enemy, shoot him in the head, hide behind cover or disarm the enemy.\nThe fighting system, is something like Yakuza. There are some combos which you learn by levelling up, you can use environment and knives, cleavers or even umbrellas, purses and my favourite – a fish to kill people.\nSide missions are not boring unlike in some other games, most of them are different every time. Catching the thieves, throwing out the drunks from the shop, collecting debts, stealing cars or find the lady in a car’s trunk and free her only to find out that it’s some sexual game and she was waiting for her husband to find her, not you.\nThe story is good too. As undercover cop you must infiltrate the triad and bring them down. So you play as a cop and as a gangster depending on the mission. Sometimes it’s just driving, sometimes fighting or some bloody shootout.\nOh and the game have radio with a different genre of music. My favourite is roadrunner records station. It has such bands like Machine head, Dream theatre, Soulfly and Trivium. It’s really fun to kick some teeth while Fear factory’s edgecrusher is playing :)\nThe only downside of this game for me is that it lacks activities. After playing Yakuza games which has a bunch of activities I want more of them in other games too. The only activities are ♥♥♥♥ fights, races and mah-jong. Because of this I’m giving this game 9/10 :)\n","April 9, 2014","true","33.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

With Wei Shen as protagonist, offers an interesting storyline.

Gunfights also offers slow-motion features but not so many firearms type provided. Driving is easy :) too bad I can't do crazy driving like in GTA III/IV\n\nOverall it's great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkap/recommended/202170/","linkap","Kelso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkap/","561 products in account","Gameplay:\n\nSimilar to the styles of Grand Theft Auto and the Saints Row series, this game is a visual impact of what gang life would be like on the streets if there was an exaggeration on the realism. Allegedly being trained in a kung-fu training school at your home town of Old Prosperity in Hong Kong, you’re equipped with martial arts and the ability to smoothly defeat any enemy you come across with ease. As much as this fighting style is fun and easily playable, it does leave little challenge and it would be better if enemies were faster or even if more bunched on you at the same time – similar to that of the Batman: Arkham series. The whole customization scheme is great for your player, buying clothes and the DLC packs that allow more custom outfits. However, I would love it if Square Enix put emphasis on the customization on the character himself (Wei Shen) and allow you to maybe change his looks a little bit e.g. his hairstyle. In addition, a positive feature would to allow vehicle customization, not to the extent of Saints Row where it almost seems tacky, but maybe the addition of NOS or bulletproof windows etc (seeing as you are an undercover cop). The map is easily explorable but can feel a bit repetitive or leave you with the feeling that more could be added.\n\nGraphics:\n\nI actually love the graphics on this game, even though some improvement could be made. The graphics do seem quite decent in my opinion; although the problem I seem to find with them is that everything seems to be a little too reflective or edgy. Although this seems really picky, these factors are highly noticeable and can become a little bit of a nuisance – especially to those struck with OCD! I think for a sequel the graphics should definitely be improved to the quality of more recent games to make it seem like a more scrutinised game: if that’s even the correct term for it.\n\nControls & Movement:\n\nAs previously mentioned, the combat style is really playable with this game with the only problem being that the techniques – although look rather good  - are really simple to complete; this leaves the game drought of challenge at times. Staying positive however, this game’s combat is definitely more advanced than games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row and the most similar game style is the Batman: Arkham series however that has a little more complexity: with combos at a more developed stage. If the next Sleeping Dogs (or True Crime) took a shining to this then they could make the game a percentage better than it already is. The main fixture they should improve though is the gun system, as much as I love the slow-motion action scheme sometimes, I would like it if you could store guns and/or aim with a bit more ease.\n\nStoryline:\n\nThe storyline to this game is actually very, very good. I find that it’s more intellectual than most games these days and has had a lot of thought built into it. The game makes your character experience a series of feelings and emotions and different thoughts such as revenge or anger. Although you’re an undercover cop cooped into the life of a gang called the Sun-on-Yee, you actually become sucked into their life more than your police life; you’d consider yourself as one of them before calling yourself a cop. You rise through the ranks and earn your place through hard work and unthinkable tasks to have your mind played and traumatic experiences – for the character, not us. With side stories and missions you are able to take a break from all the action and lay low as a racer or simply as a civilian hanging out with some girls *cough* the girlfriend experience needs improving *cough*.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo conclude, this game is brilliant in most aspects, not too much thought put into anything but not too little. Even if more thought could be put into some factors of the game such as combat and miscellaneous additions for example vehicle and character customization, it still seems to be intuitive with its ideas. Although being similar to other games of its genre, it manages to remain original for a sandbox game because of its great storyline and renewed gameplay style. Moreover, the game is really playable – especially with a controller – which makes it quick to learn, leaving the rest of your time to enjoy the aesthetics and unique style of play.\n\nRating:\n\nGameplay: [9/10]\nGraphics: [9/10]\nControls & Movement: [9/10]\nStoryline: [10/10]\nOverall: [9/10]","March 27, 2014","true","50.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

It rot in mine for over two years until I launched it and now it's probably in my Top 5 games of all time.\n\nI had a problem of the game crashing every 10 to 20 minutes along with the graphics driver whenever the GPU got to around 70 degrees or something, so I lowered few graphical settings that did not make it uglier in any way really, and haven't had it crash for the next 23+ hours.\n\nBoth driving and fighting is really fun and easy even with mouse and keyboard after you get used to its control scheme, which took me about 30 minutes after which it was smooth sailing till the end. Only thing I did rebind is action hijack from Q to mouse wheel press. I heard the Definitive edition's default control scheme is closer to standard.\n\nThe environmental finishers are some of the most brutal things I've seen in games.\n\nWei Shen is cooler than all the GTA protagonist muppets combined. (Haven't played GTA V yet)\n\nNight time in Hong Kong during the rain is one of the most beautiful environments I've seen, with the neon lights reflecting on wet streets and stuff.\n\nHot dog vendors in GTAs pale in comparison to the superior pork bun dealer.\n\n\nDamn, this game is SO GOOD.\n\n\nMy professional rating: 5 golden sloths\n\n\n","March 19, 2015","true","27.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Saints Row 4 and GTA 5 were some of 2013s most anticipated games which shows how popular the genre is. Another classic genre is the old school fighting game. As in, fighting with fists not guns. Sleeping Dogs combines these two to form an absolutely amazing game. The story is fantastic, the combat is far more interesting than in games such as GTA or Saints Row, the city (Hong Kong) is really nicely detailed, and the driving is at least as good as that of those two games.\nIn my opinion this is the best game of the 'open world crime' genre and is among my favourite games of all time.","April 26, 2014","true","24.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Of course he has a number of personal connections and vendettas that he is secretly trying to solve however the lack of choice often means you won't really get to care about his developing identity crisis.\n\nUnlike most games in this genre guns are fairly rare and you will only really use them in the missions that require it, the rest of the time you will be depending on your martial arts skills.\n\nAlthough the developers did quite a lot of talking up the fighting system in this game, even going as far as comparing it to the Arkham games, it doesn't quite meet that standard, you got your heavy attack and your light attack as well as a grapple and can use those in a variety of combos. Unfortunately Sleeping Dogs also takes a page from the first Assassins Creed game and gives you an end all counter button. You can win almost any fight by just standing still and countering the enemy attacks without much effort.\n\nThe driving feels pretty good, not quite the cartoon style of Saints Row but not the annoying wannabe realistic style of later GTAIV either it manages to strike a nice balance where cars are still fun but it doesn't get too silly. For some bizarre reason though motorcycles have much greater road grip than even the best of cars.\n\nInstead of multi-player Sleeping Dogs have a social hub feature wherein you can compete with your friends for high scores on missions and races as well as a number of challenges but it is a feature easily forgotten or ignored.\n\nWhat separates Sleeping Dogs from the pack is the location. Instead of being situation in yet another differently named version of New York City the game takes place in Hong Kong and everything about the game, from the mini games to the radio stations and the street vendors create a different feel than we're used to in this sort of game. When was the last time you bet on cockfighting in a video game?\n\nAlthough the Hong Kong vibe manages to make Sleeping Dogs rise somewhat above the pack it is still a fairly unimpressive game underneath, not much new and not much improved over the many other games in the same genre out there now. Also it is much lighter on content than is normal for a game in this genre and 100% the game, achievements and DLC shouldn't take much more than 25-30 hours of game time.\n\nStill, it's a game I had quite a bit of fun with and the Hong Kong vibe was interesting to play around with, it's a pretty game despite originating on the consoles and although I would probably feel a little cheated if I had gotten it at it's original 50$ price tag with the current sales and discounts it's an enjoyable experience.","January 15, 2013","true","130.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I love asian culture, so thats what got me interested.  This is an open-world game with racing, clothing stores, kareoke bars, fight clubs, apartments, and much more.  The music choice in the game is interesting.  There is a selection of cantonese and mandarin songs, but there are also songs from Killswitch Engage, Queen, Pat Benatar, Blood Red Shoes, Machine Head, Mozart, and plenty more.  Hand to hand combat just feels right.  Shooting an enemy may make you feel good about yourself, but there is nothing like a flying dragon kick to the face!  As you progress through the game you will learn more moves to use.  Fight clubs are a great place to try out all the moves you know, while taking on 1, 5, or even 10 enemies at once.  If that isn't enough, the story just makes it that much sweeter.  It is very easy to feel connected to characters in the game.  This is just a portion of what this game has to offer.","November 27, 2013","true","32.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After all, its progressive skill system is based on 'Face points’ that are awarded accordingly by how creative you are on your quest: to reduce the bodies of your enemies to the least identifiable shape possible (the important thing to know about evidence is that it’s best if there is none). You get the option to use the vibrant urban environment to your advantage, being given difficult choices like whether to crush all the bones in your opponents’ bodies with easily accessible car engines, or the equally effective maneuver of putting them gently down in a trash container.\n\nThe story is set in the metropolitan jungle of Hong Kong, and you have the privilege of following Wei Shen: the spiritual successor to every character Jackie Chan has ever played in films. He is an undercover cop and a master of martial arts before he even enrolls in the in-game martial arts class, and an unrelenting champion of doing the right thing. Like spending blood money on fancy clothes.\n\nThroughout Wei Shen’s journey, you will face difficult moral choices, encountering moments where you’ll have to decide whether a character or scene is merely stereotypical, inappropriately prejudice or straight up racist (for example: why it seems like every fighting individual seem to possess knowledge of, and skillfully demonstrates, advanced martial arts just because it’s set in Hong Kong).\n\nYou will be taken on an adventure where, as a servant of the law, you will rise in the ranks of organized crime through vicious acts, lie to near everyone you come across, and enthusiastically murder almost every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person that stands in your way, be it suspects, gang members or policemen, and still getting to keep your job as a cop. Oh, and you also get the option of using ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s posing as masseurs for in-game bonuses, tasteful! An excellent social commentary on how the modern execution of justice is flawed and better handled by a single, unstoppable psychopath, who also enjoys karaoke.\n\nYour toughest enemy throughout the game will be the agony of a typical, nightmarish PC port. You will be combating mortal enemies like painfully stiff controls and a swarm of bugs, along with strategically consistent game crashes to ultimately break your resolve. In addition, Square Enix’ support center seems to have lost all the passwords to all of their e-mails. A suitable challenge for only the most hardcore gamers, those who don’t really want to play at all. Final verdict: “it’s alright” out of 10.\n","December 7, 2013","true","48.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

Spectacular graphics, professional voice acting and fighting system that is somewhat simplistic yet makes you feel like Bruce Lee without having to memorize a multitude of button combinations.\n\nThe story can be summed up by the quotation; "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it you will land among the stars.".   It's not perfect but the entertainment value is high.  The setting is Hong Kong and the city is gloriously realized.  The story is solid with plenty of "moments" whose characters and writing couldn't of been done much better by Hollywood.   Play Sleeping Dogs.

You must choose between the honor of your gang and your duty to the badge. A great plot with many shocks indeed. It is a very gruesome story that has some cringing moments.\n\nThis is not like a GTA game you focus less on shoot everyone and drive away fast. You mainly use your martial arts skills to defeat foes while attempting to not put innocents in harms way. Driving recklessly will negatively affect your police skills and take away points. The game utilizes parkour in many ways such as combat, running missions, and exploration.\n\nThe only real downside is that if you fail a check point your buffs just vanish and you must go through the city and get them again later. Also there were several instances of NPC clipping errors. In which during a cutscene an enemy would get stuck behind a door or circle their vechile endlessly meaning the cutscene would not end and I would have to restart from the checkpoint. Another instance is when you enter a shop and the keeper will randomly not be active for interaction, though when you walk away they are ready until you approach them again. The only way to cure that is to go around the block then try again.\n\nOverall it is a great game an open world that is not a shoot up everyone game.\n\nAlso if you want to have some fun try leaving your car 1/2 in the garage then talk to the attendie your car will be damaged.","October 19, 2014","true","74.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The Hong Kong world is fantastic, very atmospheric and way too vast to explore!  There are many optional side missions and two story strands to play (a gangland member and an under-cover cop) that are played side by side.  Some of the minor NPCs are a bit cliched and stereo-typed (to the point I cringe) but stronger characters are developed well.\n\nA very enjoyable game for anyone who enjoys mission-based antics in a highly detailed and atmospheric world, with a good story to go with it.  The only negative is that all the accompanying DLC levels you up almost to max so there's nothing to work up towards (I learnt this too late), but otherwise it's a fantastic experience.","July 2, 2014","true","66.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

There's no multiplayer and to be honest you'd be better off playing it with an xbox 360 controller or similar controller with the emulator mod (ask if you need the link). I've met and have heard from others in the forums that using keyboard and mouse, you eventually get used to it and the only difficulty is in the driving. I actually used both, shooting with keyboard/mouse and fighting and driving the xbox controller.\nRegardless of price (I did buy it discounted through some key re-seller friends, but it wasn't at this price nor were the dlc I got with it) I totally enjoyed this great game. It's like every John Woo film and a lot of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan films put into story mode. There's even a dlc called Zodiac Tornament that is pretty much the movie Enter the Dragon where you go to an island tournament with all the different stlyed fighters and of course have to beat the evil organiser of the tournament, classic Hong Kong movie stuff to be had all round.\nStory wise, you are an ex Triad gang member gone to the States and returns to Hong Kong assigned the task of getting into a gang that you have ties to from your youth and a score to settle with one of the leaders of another faction of the Triad gang Sun On Yee. You have to deal with all the politics and oblivious Police dept. issues as well as the gut wrenching ethical dilemas of being a cop posing as gangster to people you eventually end up respecting and caring for as almost family.\nIf you are time poor and just want to experience the story and action unabated you can get this game complete with all the upgrades and rip through the game almost too quickly but have all the bling and weapons at the game start. Remember though a lot of the unlocks are earnt through the game progress, not all but a lot are and it's usually stated on the dlc page itself if that's the case so have a look before you buy and save some cash if you need to.","November 27, 2013","true","75.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was extremely pleased with this game.  I had expected a good time but what I ended up getting was far more bang for my buck than I had initially expected.\n\nSleeping Dogs has gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto in that it takes place in an open world city where you acquire missions from contacts to progress the story but you can generally do whatever your heart desires.  However, whereas Grand Theft Auto is very gunplay oriented, the majority of Sleeping Dogs' combat is melee in a way that reminds me of a kung fu action movie.  The combat is much deeper and more complex than I had anticipated (similar in a sense to the Arkham games) and the parkour movement was a nice surprise as well.\n\nThe story, I must say, is absolutely incredible.  It has its twists and turns as you play the role of an undercover police officer navigating both the criminal underworld and the police hierarchy of Hong Kong.  If I had to choose one of the aspects of that game that was the absolute best and most standout, I would go with the story.  I highly recommend this game to all fans of modern open world games, action games, and especially to anyone who's looking to scratch that Bruce Lee itch.","January 9, 2015","true","22.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The controls feel great (I played using a gamepad), and are easy to pick up. There are weapons available, but they appear later in the game.\n\nDriving is more arcade-oriented than GTA IV. I prefer when vehicles behave more realistically, and especially when it comes to taking damage, the vehicles that you control in Sleeping Dogs are far, far from realistic. For some people, this is probably an advantage, since a few crashes doesn't slow you down/force you to get in another car to continue.\n\nThe story gets a thumbs up from me. It revolves around a small amount of recognizable characters, so for someone playing the games a few hours a week, it's easy to know who everyone is, which I couldn't say for GTA IV. It's a bit cliché, but good enough to keep the main story interesting.\n\nOne of the best things with the game is the setting. The version of Hong Kong in the game is a great place for the story, and after 26 hours, when I was done with the main game and all side missions, I felt a bit sad that it was over.\n\nThere is not a lot to do besides the main and side missions, and just going around causing chaos doesn't have the same feel as in the GTA series, so most of the time you spend with the game will probably be the main and side missions.\n\nStill a great game, and well worth picking up at a sale.","June 22, 2014","true","32.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You play as Detective Wei Shen, an officer sent deep undercover to work for one side of the conflicted Triad Sun On Yee, controlled by the Red Pole Winston Chu. As you get the know the main cast, information about your past will be unveiled, revealing important information about Wei Shen's previous Triad encounters, as he grew up in Hong Kong alongside Jackie Ma, another one of Winston's soldiers. As an undercover cop you will spend most of your time working for different members of the Sun On Yee, constantly meeting new characters and increasing your reputation in the eyes of the Triad leaders. Apart from infiltrating the Triad gangs and doing missions for them, you can also spend your time in Hong Kong as a cop solving different cases that require a man on the inside to gather the information. There are only a few cases to solve and most of them are easily forgettable, but they're fun to do, plus they offer a whole new perspective of the game, allowing you to easily shift between the bad guy and the good guy. The story takes around 18 hours to complete, a journey filled with memorable characters and a plot worth following with a payoff that might be unexpected, yet surprising and satisfying, concluding with an ending that is open to interpretation, giving you the final verdict and decide what to do next in Hong Kong after completing the story. There is no doubt that the story is amazing in its own way, but believe it or not that isn't even half of the greatness this game brings, as you'll probably spend even more hours wandering around Hong Kong, completing favors, taking part in street races or looking for lockboxes and health shrines. Sleeping Dogs isn't the ultimate open world experience, but it certainly amazes in its own way, offering multiple ways to spend your time between missions, from playing games like Mahjong Poker to betting on cockfights or participating in fighting tournaments.\nRating: 9.5\n\nGameplay\nTo whoever said there can be no further innovation on the current hardware, Sleeping Dogs is set to prove them wrong, big time; the amount of new and innovating mechanisms packed into Sleeping Dogs is quite surprising, introducing new ways to do things apparently simple, like picking a door or hacking a camera, creating a world in which almost every action in game requires a certain action on your side. There is so much to mention here, so only a few of the examples would be the bug calibration system that requires both analog sticks to be perfectly aligned with the environmental sound before plating the bug, or the camera hacking system that requires you to match the four digit code in order to access that camera. What is even more fantastic however, is the combat system, limiting shooting sequences to a few missions only, allowing you to concentrate on pure Kung-Fu melee combat; there are so many moves and combinations that make each encounter feel different, encouraging you to use every manoeuvre in your arsenal in order to defeat your enemies efficiently. The combat system allows you to interact with the environment too, as you can push your enemies towards a wall, smash their heads on the hood of a car or doing all sorts of things using the environment around you. In addition to your Kung-Fu moves, you can also use melee weapons like knives or hammers in combat, and disabling enemies using those to later use them yourself to your advantage. The shooting sequences are limited to only a few, yet they're satisfying and perfectly balanced with more Kung-Fu combats, creating an amazing and unique experience that no game could deliver before. There is also an experience system, which rewards you after each and every mission with experience points that will add up to a certain category, in which when you level up you can choose a new ability; completing missions for the Triads will award you Triad experience, while completing missions as a cop will award you cop experience, unlocking upgrades in a different category. In addition to Triad and Cop upgrades, you also earn Face experience for completing certain favours for random people you meet on the street, unlocking face upgrades that are this time more social oriented, offering things like reduced prices for cars or clothing.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGraphics\nSleeping Dogs isn't the most advanced game out there graphically speaking, but it's decent and it does a visual impression in its own way. The city of Hong Kong might not be as detailed as it could have been, but it's full of life and action, and that is what really matters. There is always something new to do in Hong Kong, and exploring the map is certainly one of them, as you'll sometimes be amazed of what you can find on the top of an unexplored building. The characters are beautiful and detailed, delivering that drop of personality they need in order to create an amazing and emerging story; the animations are amazingly done on the main cast, but even the secondary characters take advantage of some decent facial animations. There are some visual bugs however, like pedestrians walking inside the concrete, but it's easy to ignore those if you look a moment at how large and detailed the city of Hong Kong really is.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nSurprising enough, the mixture of Chinese and English in the dialogue works better than expected, delivering great and memorable lines that never cease to amaze. The cast of Sleeping Dogs includes some major names from Hollywood like Emma Stone in the role of Amanda Cartwright, James Hong as Uncle Po or Lucy Liu as Vivienne Lu. Will Yun Lee has been cast as Wei Shen, and needless to say, he delivered the lines with that special touch that made Wei Shen an instant classic character in video games. There are some lip sync issues that are hard not to observe, since they'll appear in the most important cutscenes in the game, but not in all of them. The soundtrack is simply amazing, always in the mood with the action, while keeping the atmosphere of Hong Kong with some classic songs that will make you shuffle through the radio channels just to listen to your favorite track one more time.\nRating: 9\n\nExtras\nYou're looking at more than 25 hours of content, considering that the game doesn't end with the story, since there is an enormous world to explore and hundreds of items to collect. In addition to that, you can spend your time doing races, fighting in tournaments or replaying missions; it's like the game never gets boring as you always find something else to do, especially if you enjoy completing achievements/trophies, as some of them present quite a challenge.\nRating: 10\n\nVerdict\nSleeping Dogs is without doubt one of the best releases of 2012 and a must have for any open world adventures fans, delivering a great story, innovating gameplay and an astonishing number of additional collectibles and extras. The game offers a superb experience worth playing, but most of all it proves that there are a lot of things that haven't been done with the current hardware before, finding its way into the top of the most innovating gameplay mechanics on the current generation.\nRating Overall: 9\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Sleeping Dogs at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=385","May 13","true","43.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

From the interesting story, to the refreshing Kung Fu combat, every single bit of it is really enjoyable, but as every other games, it has it shortcomings.\n\nStory & Setting\nSleeping Dogs is a third-person, open world, action game set in modern Hong Kong. The story revolves around Wei Shen, an undercover cop from San Francisco that left Hong Kong with his family when he was young, and his journey to infiltrate in Sun On Yee , a criminal organization who is both feared and respected. The main plot line is focused on Wei`s struggle between the two worlds, between what is right and what is wrong, between law or emotions. The second plot line is focused solely on his    work in Sun On Yee, where family and respect are the most important thigs, leading to some really intense moments.\n\nGameplay\nThe Gameplay is the best part of the game, and what you are gonna by doing most of the time. Inspired from Batman Arkham Asylum ,but with a twist of Kung Fu, the combat is one of the most enjoyable when it comes to Open World Action Games.\nThe mechanics are simple : You have an attack button, a counter button, a run button and a grapple button.\nThe basic combo consist in pressing the attack button a certain amount of times, and sometimes you have to hold it to increase the power of the attack. Also, you can combine the attack with either run or grapple in order to performa even more combos. But beware, most of those will have to be bought with statues that you find in missions from the dojo.\nYou main defence will be the counter button. Just as in Batman, when an enemy is about to attack he will flash red. If you hit the button at the right time, you will stop the attack and initiate a counterattack. Of course this does not work on all enemies, some will have to be disarmed in order to be able to counterattack\nOf course, as in every action game, there are gonna be guns but they are very rare, and only certain missions will have it. The gunplay is cover-based, from which you can also blind fire or jump over in slow-motion. Some of the cover is destructible, but most of it is not. Be careful though, because the enemy will come after you if you don't kill them. When in a car chase, the gunplay consists either in shooting the bad guys or in shooting their tires, resulting in an awesome slowmo scene.\nThe biggest flaw that the combat has is that it can become a little repetitive after a while.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nSleeping Dogs has THE best rainy scenes and the most detailed city I have ever seen in a game. The models are very nicely detailed and textured, the city is full of things hanging or flying. The detail put in this game is absolutely amazing. Even if you can't run it maxed out, you will be able to experience the beauty that this game has.\nAs for the sound I have to say that it is very immersive. From Traditional Chinese music, to modern club music, to some metal the game provides something for everybody. The voice acting for every single character is top notch and very authentic.\n\nConclusion\nSleeping Dogs is not a perfect game, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it IS a really good game which offers a great story and characters, but also a really good combat system that is very enjoyable to watch. It is an underrated game that deserve much more than it got.","January 20, 2014","true","22.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I believe this is the easiest way to sum up Sleeping Dogs. But it would also be incorrect as it gives you the impression that the game you are going to play will be exactly a GTA game but its setting will be a different city. That is why you should try Sleeping Dogs as it is so much more!\n\nGameplay-wise it is exactly what the newer GTA games are: you have an open world game where you go wherever you want and you can do whatever you want. Of course, doing some hit-and-runs will only anger local police so they'll be after you pretty quickly. You can approach icons scattered throughout the game that launch missions - those that are essential to the main story progress are indicated by a different icon than those who serve to be side missions only.\n\nThere are TONS of things to do in Hong Kong: you can participate in racing games, sing at karaoke parties, date girls, bet on cockfights, join a fight club. You also have hundreds of collectable items. It's worth participating in all these activities as the game rewards you with experience points that let you level up only to learn new abilities.\n\nIn GTA you you had an assortment of firearms available for you to use. Here, emphasis is on hand-to-hand combat. Learning new abilities makes martials arts even better. Carjacking is also available but can happen much faster than in GTA - you can jump into vehicles and there are also car chase sequences in the game.\n\nStory-wise you play Wei Shen, an undercover cop, who climbs the criminal corporate ladder only to get closer to the bad guys he needs to expose. There are some nice surprises here and there and just like GTA this game can also steal around 40 to 50 hours from your life.\n\nA highly recommended game if you liked GTA IV or any of its third-person shooter predecessors.\n\n","March 9, 2014","true","32.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The combat is alright, you'll ecpect combat in a game like this and it's exactly what you think, kicks, punches, submissions, the whole lot and you can also use your environment to defeat your ememies which is awesome. It's a full action packed game but (MAY BE A SPOILER) I wish you could have chosen the path of a cop, fighting for good or a Triad, earning yourself loyalty and respect. The gameplay is  a good long game, 24 hours and over, but when you finish the game you get to play some minigames, cockfighting, races and many more. Sleeping Dogs does not disapoint, besides the bad stuff I said about this game, the gameplay is great with an exctiting good storyline that'll make you stay sitting on your seat, you don't get confused about what this game is about, Sleeping Dogs will still be fun even if you finish the game, you'll be playing this game for a while and the voice acting is absolutly fantastic, I suggest this game to all users it's a solid 7/10 from me, not too high, not too low, it's a good, decent game.","November 28, 2013","true","34.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is a nice blend of the later GTA's grittiness and realism, showing the deep dark underbelly of corruption and crime, while maintaining a slight sense of humor about it, a la Saint's Row.\nThe gameplay isn't exactly that different from any other games of this genere, save for the combat. The melee combat (which you use a lot) is very fluid, making stringing together combos a very rewarding challenge. The somewhat limited gunplay (lampshaded in-game by saying that guns are rare in Hong Kong) is nothing to write home about, yet I still found myself enjoying the occasional gun battle.\nThere are two things which got to me in this game: The story and the graphics. For a game two years old, the graphics blow me away, even on a medium-high setting. The story is the thing that had me hooked on the game the most. As a sufferer of gaming ADD, I found myself unable to pull away from the game!\nI highly recommend Sleeping Dogs, regardless of the price.","April 1, 2014","true","15.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/recommended/202170/","cyberghost","Cyberghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/","1188 products in account","Whoever came up with the title “Sleeping Dogs” must’ve had the biggest grin on their face when the name was approved. The game was originally pitched as a completely new IP, then rebranded as a reboot of the True Crime series, then pulled back into the series as True Crime: Hong Kong, and then canceled, only to be picked up by a different publisher for another rebranding and an actual release – the sleeping dog that nobody would let lie. Given that its initial announcement was in 2009, not to mention its ties to a less-than-revered franchise (does the True Crime name really move units?), it’s easy to understand why Sleeping Dogs simply isn’t showing up on many radars – we’re practically at a micro-Duke-Nukem-Forever at this stage. However, Sleeping Dogs shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, taking its rocky road to release into account, it’s an awesome surprise.\n\nOpen-world crime games aping movies are nothing new, but Sleeping Dogs nails it better than practically any other. As undercover cop Wei Shen, players will dive deep into Hong Kong’s criminal underworld, assuming the role of a Sun On Yee soldier with the intent of climbing the gang’s hierarchy and crippling it from the inside. Wei Shen has a personal vendetta against the gang, but it’s not long until his hands are as dirty as the rest of them. His loyalties to both the police and the Sun On Yee will be tried and tried again over the course of the increasingly violent story.\n\nDoes it sound corny? It is, and it’s frankly the game’s most interesting aspect. Plenty of video games attempt to place a conflicted main character at their core, criminals with hearts of gold who are just doing what they have to, waxing poetic about life and death in a maudlin cutscene before the actual gameplay starts, in which the player is far more likely to see how long they can drive on the sidewalk before getting shot than they are to sit and ponder deep questions about killing, honor and redemption. Sleeping Dogs does all of that, but it’s dressed up in the wonderful melodramatic styling of a classic Hong Kong crime film. Wei Shen is angry and unhinged, the Sun On Yee are violent and feudalistic, and the police are cold-hearted and shifty. The game’s script embraces cheese and contradiction, lampshading the disconnect between story and gameplay far better than most crime games with a serious tone. Sleeping Dogs isn’t a comedy or a satire, but it knows that it’s pulpy.\n\nThe action movie influence seeps into the gameplay itself, too. Sleeping Dogs focuses mainly on hand-to-hand brawling, employing a combat system that feels like a less refined version of Arkham Asylum or The Warriors. There isn’t a prominent combo counter, but there are counter moves that can be triggered as soon as an enemy flashes red – a slightly jarring visual – and some truly brutal punch-kick strings activated by tapping or holding the attack button in certain orders. It’s slightly jerky and robotic feeling, mostly due to a lack of transition animations, but it can be very satisfying. More interesting are the throws and grabs that make use of environmental hazards, which usually involve Wei Shen shoving a goon’s head into something sharp or spinning (or both). All of these attacks are straight out of Hong Kong crime films, and they are all awesome. Heck, even when there aren’t any interesting objects around to push people into, Wei Shen can still sprint full-tilt towards the nearest wall and smash the person he’s holding into the hard surface head-first.\n\nThen there’s the driving, which feels very tight and arcade-y. Cars and bikes go incredibly fast and are almost all very nimble, save for a few trucks and mopeds. The streets of Hong Kong are lots of fun to speed through when you can turn on a dime, and car chases are pretty thrilling because of it. There are a few control issues once action-hijacking and shooting are introduced, though – even though the pace slows down time a tad to help you keep track of everything, it’s often very easy to jump onto the wrong car, or pile straight into a wall while trying to shoot something behind you. However, the fact that these are all things you can do is undeniably cool, and actually jumping onto the right car, clambering across the roof, and kicking the driver out of their seat is immensely satisfying.\n\nThe third major section of the action is shooting, which mostly plays out like you’d expect. There are guns, there are chest-high-walls, dudes pop out and you shoot them. It’s definitely the least remarkable pillar of the game, although there are a couple of interesting mechanics that save it from being too dull – namely, the way the game encourages you to vault over cover at enemies, rather than sticking around in one spot shooting people as they peek over their hiding spot. Sleeping Dogs employs a heavy dose of slow-mo when you complete certain actions – leaping over cover, disarming a foe – which makes clearing large groups of enemies really easy. Thankfully, on-foot shooting missions are in the minority, although there are some straightforward run-and-gun sections towards the end of the game that can get pretty dull.\n\nIf only the PC version let you assign separate keys for some actions, rather than using the obviously console-oriented “press-then-release-then-press-again-really-fast” setup – I imagine a lot of the control issues would be nonexistent. With a mouse and keyboard, some of Sleeping Dogs can be a bit of a headache. Sprinting and jumping over objects requires timed presses of the same sprint key – likewise, getting ready to jump out of your car and actually jumping out of your car are two actions tied to the same key, which just feels odd with all of the options available on a keyboard. Moving Wei around can feel a little stiff, as well – thankfully, the game supports controllers without a hitch. I’d strongly recommend a gamepad.\n\nThe overall package of Sleeping Dogs is helped immensely by its presentation and atmosphere. While the character models and animation aren’t great, the Hong Kong they inhabit is gorgeous. There are moments where the game practically bleeds cool – rain-soaked streets, gaudy neon lights and the bright metropolitan skyline. The voice acting is appropriately over-the-top, and the character designs get more and more sleazy-looking as Wei makes his way up the Sun On Yee. There are some great missions, too, one-offs that feel like they belong in cult crime films. One sees you sneaking into a superstitious man’s house and messing with his furniture to screw up his feng shui. There are some truly horrifying revenge killings. You can also date Emma Stone.\n\nI wonder how Sleeping Dogs would have been if it had been released in 2010 as True Crime, or 2011 as True Crime: Hong Kong. The game is a tad unpolished as it is in 2012, so clearly there were reasons to push it back. However, if the game was as charming and interesting as it is now, I have no idea why anyone would cancel the project. Sleeping Dogs is a great action game with a compellingly melodramatic story and an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife. Control issues aside, it’s a great PC port, too – on a beefy gaming PC, Sleeping Dogs looks far better than its console counterparts. For fans of Hong Kong cinema and/or open-world games, it’s a must.\n\nMy Rating: 8.7/10","January 30","true","27.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The story plays out exactly like those movies and the focus on hand to hand combat and martial arts and not gunplay also elevates this game to another level and separates it from games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. Although there are gun sequences in the game they are only last resort time scenarios where the protagnist has no other choice but to use weapons as a means to get out of trouble. I also have to say that certain car sequences in the game feel and play out exactly like those in action films and it is a treat to engage in them.

The story follows Wei Shen, an undercover cop, as he attempts to infiltrate and undermine the local Triads.  I found the story engaging and the various characters memorable, and while the plot doesn’t offer too much in the way of surprises for those familiar with organized crime and undercover police stories, it does tell its tale with panache and style.\n\nThe undercover angle to the story also makes its way into the gameplay, encouraging you to balance violence and brutality to please the Triads with an adherence to law and order and minimized collateral damage to appease Wei’s police handlers.  It’s a great idea, but it really only comes into play during story missions.  Personally, I would have liked to see it expanded into other aspects of gameplay, especially the game’s side missions.\n\nFurther differentiating Sleeping Dogs from its neighbors is a focus on brawling over gunplay, which given the setting and story seems quite appropriate.  The fighting mechanics are accessible and I enjoyed opportunities to thrash hordes of thugs with little more than fists and whatever was around at the time.\n\nSleeping Dogs gets my thumbs up.  According to my Steam clock, I put about 25 hours into the game.  Time well spent, in my opinion.  My only caveat is that I found the game to play much better with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard, though that may be a matter of taste more than anything else.","May 30, 2014","true","28.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

You are the biggest corgi the world has ever seen, and you must eat all the sausages in the kitchen, until you can fight no longer, and you become the Sleeping Dog. Really now, you play as a Jackie Chan double who is actually a sleeper agent (hence the name, hurr durr) and you want no trabble. You fight your way through several ladder factories while holding several different babies, in your fight against slightly bigger asian people that look like they're straight out of Fast and Furious. You go through several losses, in this trainless society, and sleep with many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, although it is wisely disguised as if you are getting a massage from a massage parlour. You go through several girlfriends, and lose none of the perks that came with them after you pump and dump through all of them, essentially leaving the world with several Jackie Chan babies. You also learn many secret hidden techniques by picking up some sort of Chinese takeout food, or something along those lines, I don't really recall because it was unmemorable, but that's besides the point. The game has you fighting in a very enticing combat system that allows you to have fun while you steamroll everybody as if you were a train. What this game lacks in trains, it makes up for in witty dialog, enticing story, and fun gameplay. The main character is likeable, and most of the game is played through his eyes where he's constantly at odds of being caught by the criminals he associates with. Overall, if you want a fun, and mindless beat 'em up game, with a karaoke minigame in it that frankly deserves its own review, you should get Sleeping Dogs, because who doesn't want to be an oversized corgi, fighting sausages in the kitchen?","November 27, 2013","true","22.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

United Front did not pull any stops in creating a fantastic open world sandbox that incorporates all of the best features from similar games.\n\nThe game's portrayal of Hong Kong is very vibrant and believable and the NPCs are fun to interact with. The game world looks amazing on the PC at full resolution (make sure to install the FREE HD texture pack DLC).\n\nThe combat system focuses primarily on melee with some gunplay mixed in at times. The combat system plays similar in nature to the Arkham series of games and allows for cool environmental finishers in addition to some time-slowing "bullet-time" when leaping from cover. Vehicle combat is also fun with action hijacking and time-slowing effects when firing your sidearm from your vehicle.\n\nThe main campaign story is very good and gripping, but also very predictable at some points. As an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the Triad organization the game keeps making you think about your duties as a cop versus your loyalty to your "family". The skill system reflects this conflict in rewarding experience as both a cop and a Triad gang member with experience being portioned based on your actions. A very nice design feature in linking the advancement of the character to the moral implications of the story and how the player decides to play it out.\n\nAnd any game that uses voice acting from the legendary James Hong is great in my book!\n\nOverall if you enjoy similar games like Saints Row or the GTA series then you should love this game. It is a very big open city with lots of activities to keep the player busy. A very well thought out and designed game that made me feel that I was actually playing in a classic Hong Kong action film! Sleeping Dogs is definitely among the top games I have ever played and I highly recommend.","February 15","true","58.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","1"

It feels like a PS2 game in execution done by a novice studio.\n\nThis game was really just frustratingly boring, not at ANY TIME were I having fun, and all I'm left with is bitter buyers remorse.

Some people would say that it's a copy of GTA Series but i disagree. Yea, I will admit that it looks similar because you complete missions, fight, steal cars, got your own house etc but Sleeping Dogs is totally different from any GTA Game.\n\nSleeping Dogs is a superb and amusing game FULL of action. At every mission you must fight with thugs, punch their faces, drive with a car and probably escape from the cops. I know it sounds like the gameplay of any other Action game, but to be honest I was impressed from this one.\nThe game takes place in China, Hong Kong and the atmosphere is really realistic.\nThe story of the game is an interesting one and if you play the game I'd suggest you not to skip the parts of the dialogues.\nThe part I like most from Sleeping Dogs, is the fighting system. There is a variety of techniques and combination of buttons in order to perform special moves and punches. There is also the ability to grab an enemy and throw him somewhere in order to make him die with a brutal way.\n\nI actually couldn't notice any remarkable con but I didn't like the driving system and the storyline quests are quite easy I can say. Except these, there are some small glitches in the game but they are not remarkable tho.\n\n+ Interesting Story\n+ FULL of Action Game\n+ Realistic Atmosphere\n+ Fighting/Combat System\n+ Brutal Gameplay/Kills\n+ Free-running mode\n\n- Driving System\n- Easy Storyline Quests\n- Small Glitches\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10","November 1, 2014","true","17.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Yes, it is a GTA clone indeed, but it only takes the best aspects from Rockstar's games and then tries to add something new to it, like a good hand to hand combat system, a big selling point for this title.\n\nYou play as an undercover cop with a dark past who infiltrates the dangerous Honk Kong triads, trying in the meantime to solve some intricate cases for the local police department.\nThis dualism between the good and the bad sides of the main character is well used by the developers, missions are always interesting and fun to play, you want to go ahead and discover what happens next.\nSecondary missions are not bad either, even buying vechicles and clothes in order to obtain different bonuses is well implemented and not a mere filler.\n\nSleeping Dogs is also very easy to play, a bit arcadey if you want, and with some small control glitches, but immediate to master. Technically I really liked the graphics (download the highres textures!) and the voices of the characters, very well interpreted. Honk Kong is a big city with its different districts, not so diversified as any other GTA, but interesting to explore nonetheless. The story is well narrated, nothing breathtaking but good enough to keep you playing for at least 20-30 hours.\n\nIn the end I think I can suggest this game to any other GTA fan who wants something a bit different and fresh, while maintaining a well know gameplay infrastructure. If you don't already have Sleeping Dogs maybe this is the right moment to buy it, the Definitive Edition just went live with better graphics and all DLCs included!","October 13, 2014","true","37.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Sleeping Dogs takes the best of the openworld undercover genre and shakes it up with its own style. Instead of run and gunning like GTA or DEM SAINTS you'll be focusing on hand to hand combat throughout much of the game. Alot more guns do eventually come into play when things get a bit crazier and serious and I'm glad that they worked it out that way as it really adds to the feel that triad war is heating up. The story is actually really well done, cutscenes are pretty and the voiceacting is fantastic. Most importantly though they build up characters just right so that you can empathize with them (with the exception of one VERY forced character that you spend the day driving around). You never feel overwhelmed with stuff like in GTA and the story tension keeps you going for completion of main missions. There are a ton of clothes to collect, so you can look stylin' while you do your thing.

Though in this case its by actually managing to pull off a (mostly) serious crime game with an actual likeable cast of characters and an interesting plot that actually gels with the sandbox gameplay well. (Wei Shen is not a very good cop or nice man.)\n\nThe gameplay is a beat-em-up style akin to the Batman Arkham games and while it may take some getting used to once you do it becomes real fun and it can be really brutal, with the ability to break legs, chucking thugs into open furnaces, and sending a guy careening into a table saw.\n\nThe game is also not afraid to have some fun and be a bit silly,  you can dress up as a luchador in a tux or play a mission where you have to perform karaoke badly for example. There's also DLC where you fight Jiang-Shi.\n\nAlongside Red Dead Redemption Sleeping Dogs is one of my favorite sandbox games and I heartily recommend it.","December 18, 2013","true","37.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I threw a guy through a giant fish tank and laughed as it exploded all around him. The racing is solid and there's tons of mini games like karaoke.

An extensive array of additional missions and activities ensure there are always opportunities for further adventure and action to discover while roaming the streets. Along with an impressive presentation for both the visuals and music, Sleeping Dogs is without doubt the sleeper hit of 2012 for open world action games.Square Enix and United Front Games pulled Sleeping Dogs from the brink of death, and what surprised me is just how good it turned out to be.Unlike the previous ‘True Crime’ games, where there was a strict depiction of the city maps, Sleeping Dogs does not portray Hong Kong, inch by inch. United Front Games has implemented GTA’s novelties in way that winks slyly at Rockstar. In essence, what the GTA series has accomplished, Sleeping Dogs has carried out better and more elegantly.This game is a very pleasant surprise that's throwing down the gauntlet to GTA V with its Cantonese oral insult. The game's story along with plenty of gaming mechanics' innovation make Sleeping Dogs a truly remarkable and never-ending joyride with no intention to imitate the original at all costs.Sleeping Dogs is now the example developers should strive to beat when they want to create a game in this genre, because Square Enix's title is now the new leader of the pack.","February 27, 2014","true","417.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989454146/recommended/202170/","76561197989454146","Major Moolah","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989454146/","295 products in account","Each and every game made is a different answer to the question "Why play this?" A good answer is an unexpected one and relies not on what is said but how is said. So when Sleeping Dogs tells me that I get to do consequence-free Triad enforcing, then buy and buy stuff with the fruit of my labors or succeed in Karaoke it is abundantly clear that sometimes not thinking can be just as fun as thinking.\n\nThe player stars as Wei, an undercover police officer infiltrating the Sun On Yee criminal organization using all the well-established fictional ways of doing so. Sleeping Dogs' level of realism can only be described as "this makes no damn sense whatsoever." In an early mission Wei and his goofball friend take a shipment from their rivals with force. After Wei beats down two waves of thugs the survivors flee in a car and the friends give pursuit, ramming enemy reinforcements off the road along the way. Finally they claim their prize of.... worthless knock-offs of luxury watches. Why on Earth would anyone use so much muscle to guard something with no value? And why are there no repercussions afterwards, let alone any mention of the event? The answer to A is because the plot demanded comedy and the answer to B is that the game must go on. B also applies to the Hong Kong police who make the Skyrim guards look like unrelenting angels of justice. Should the police pursue Wei he just rams them off the road and the police department immediately forgives and forgets.\n\nSadly the writing does not work on it's own either, even if separated from the game mechanics. Wei has enough skill to make Jason Bourne look like a mall cop and people are always telling Wei how awesome he is. The reason the Triads suspect him is that he is too good to be true, as they say to each other behind Wei's back! The women Wei dates are there to literally say "Oh, Wei, you are so resourceful!" and little else. Wei carves a bloody swathe through Hong Kong and when his handler quite reasonably tells him that he is too dangerous Wei uses the "mavericks get results" defence that of course works and Wei gets to continue. In another instance a short questline is ended with Wei being told he just got more done than the entire Drug Division accomplished in the last six months. Even more insufferable are the scenes where Wei is torn between the police and the underworld. In all the scenes Wei gets to be right and ultimately I was relieved when some thug punched his face in a non-scripted event.\n\nBut while the story is best ignored there still are reasons to play. Wei is unsymphatetic due to his inhuman perfection but the city of Hong Kong is symphatetic for the opposite reasons. The vendors are nothing short of hilarious, with a man selling cheap tea reminding that the gods are watching, a clothes booth owner immediately reassuring a new customer that all his merchandise is completely genuine and legal and a junk food seller telling that no man is a man without a pork bun in his hand. It takes no small effort to get a grown man excited about shopping and this is the games biggest triumph. Running around buying everything from awareness bands to canarie cages and luxury sports cars described as being "For the man who has everything and wants everyone to know it" never got old even on my replay. The same smorgasbord philosophy extends to the activities that let you succeed in Karaoke, be the street racer king or beat down a fight club's worth of contenders for money to live out any lingering consumerist fantasy.\n\nBy now the fundaments of criminal sandboxes are so familiar and well-established that they require no descriptive detail apart from saying that they are there and they work as do the meat-and-potatoes sights and sounds. I was happy, however, with placing the emphasis on melee instead of gunplay as well as the close combat system itself. It requires a bit of a learning process as well as stacking bonuses for full effect. You should also know that it is extremely violent, particularly the environmental finishers where you toss thugs into furnaces or impale them on meat hooks, so it is best to consider this before purchase. Wei accumulates XP in three different trees and expands his array of moves and attacks at a steady pace. All in all the game is dangling a juicy carrot worth pursuing quite succesfully. There are many minigames and collectibles along the way, mostly harmless. The DLCs can be split into two categories. All the smaller ones, every single one, are the Square Enix assembly line junk we all know and should be skipped. Some of them even force considerable bonuses on a new game that makes it best to disable them manually with some jury rigging -- or not buy them at all in the first place. There are three larger ones, Nightmare in North Point, Zodiac Tournament and Year of the Snake. I have yet to play but would recommend Googling first and waiting for a sale. The base game is self-sufficient and expanding it can wait.\n\nSleeping Dogs is ultimately best described in song. The kitschy sleaze-pop of the soundtrack original Yellow Fever sounds like a cheap knock-off that somehow winds up being value for dollar even though it should not. As I played the guilty part of guilty pleasure wore off and I can recommend Sleeping Dogs for anyone in the mood for the digital equivelant of the Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet available anywhere.","December 26, 2013","true","39.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

The storyline is incredibly gripping and causes the player to really feel some feelz. I also want to make a comment on the quality of the AIs: I could predict who was going to do what in the fights because they behaved like actual humans. This is one of the few games I've ever played where this is the case. The graphics are amazing, even on medium. Not to mention that I can actually run it on my laptop. Although it's no longer the newest game in the franchise, I feel I must make a comparison to Grand Theft Auto 4. The graphics in this are better than GTA 4's graphics, and it freezes and crashes on the first load screen for me. The only complaint I have is the occasional small bug, i.e. in the very first part of the game (the part where you're running from the cops), the guy I was supposed to be following decided that the middle of us being chased by the cops was just the absolute perfect time to stop running, confusing the hell out of me in the process.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WombatWithWings/recommended/202170/","WombatWithWings","WombatIstKrieg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WombatWithWings/","584 products in account","Coming into this game, I expected a mediocre GTA clone set in Hong Kong. Now, having played about 12 hours or 30% of the whole game, I feel that I like this more than I liked Dishonored.\n\nThe story is the best I've seen for any open-world action/crime game. Wei Shen is an undercover cop who is tasked with taking down the Triads of Hong Kong from within, attempting to balance loyalty to the law and playing the part of a gang member. As the story progresses, you get to know more about certain characters that would be considered the "bad guys" and morality in this game is no longer black and white. Having not finished it yet, it will be interesting to see whether Wei forsakes his duty as a cop or brings down the house on the criminals.\n\nThe game has an immense focus on melee combat and it plays almost identical to Arkham Asylum, but it doesn't straight out copy it. You level up your combos and abilities which was soemthing Arkham didn't really focus on. You can also grapple enemies and unleash "environmental kills" and use an air conditioner as a blender for some guy's head. You can use butcher knives, tire irons, and a few other melee weapons to kill, but after 10 strikes the weapons "break", so when you actually find one, you know that you'll need to still rely on your fists. As for guns, they are rare and powerful. VERY rare. I had to wait maybe 3 hours to get my hands on a pistol. However, though they are few and far between, the gunfights are most enjoyable. Cars play a big role in the game, and the driving is superb, though not perfect. The ramming mechanic is unrealistic but fun and certain vehicles (any truck) feels clunky. Also, there is no inventory system. You can not sheathe weapons or carry multiple guns. Typically, you can never take a weapon into free-roam from a mission, which reminds me: The game never gets tedious. The missions are plentiful and enjoyable, though some (like the Drug Busts) have the exact same structure (though a different environment) and tend to get a little repetetive, but not boring.\n\nThe graphics are amazing and I never thought I'd say it, but China is beautiful. The high-resolution texture pack is not that better than the base game, but it's better nonetheless. One thing I don't like, is that on Extreme Anti-Aliasing, the game hovers at about 30 frames per second, but on Ultra AA, the game hovers at 90. LOL WUT?\n\nAll in all, this game is fabulous. I don't understand why it wasn't hyped up or ranked up with games like Dishonored, Borderlands, and Far Cry 3. This truly was the most underrated title of 2012, and it closely ties with Dishonored for my game of the year.\n\n9.5 out of 10","February 5, 2013","true","48.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

It was go here beat this person, go here catch this person, go chase this person, repeat, repeat, repeat and I was bored after only 11hours in this game.  I am sure the story contains some amazing moments but it did not grab me quick enough to keep me entertained.\n\nI did pay £29.99 for this game as a preorder and now the game is £14.99 (Now on sale as we speak for £2.99 which is a STEAL) and the £14.99 is really cheap as it is because of what the game offers.\n\nIf you like open world, stealing cars, beating people, kung fu fighting, just cause leaping from cars, then this game will keep you going for way longer than myself.\n\nYou really nice feature in the game was the car control.  The sounds on the cars, and the way it dips and dives when turning, specially the bikes was sooooo nice.\n\nAnyway, this game is worth the time and money you want to put into it.\n\nShame there was no multiplayer and only singleplayer but still.

The game is very nice to look at especially after you install the high resolution texture pack.  The setting is also very interesting.  The only thing that keeps it from being a definite "must buy" are its numerous inexplainable glitches.  Sometimes things have just "stopped working right".  For instance, at one point I was using my cell phone in-game and was unable to dismiss it from my hand.  I had to exit to the main menu and reload the game.  When I did this the phone was still in my hand, but I was able to put it away.  Just oddball stuff like this happens from time to time.  The driving in the game is not very interesting and makes the races more of a pain than actual fun.  Other than that it is very entertaining.  The fighting in the game is a blast.  It is nice to see a game going more for martial arts than blasting everything around you with a gun or tank.  It is a good game but, as I said, the glitches and driving mechanics keep it from being a classic.","November 28, 2013","true","58.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Much better than other titles that Square Enix has made that are not Final Fantasy such as Just Cause which has serious audio syncing problems.\nCombat system closely related to that of Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkam City. graphics are quite impressive.\n\nBut besides the great fighting mechanics, the endless amount of things that you can do in Hong Kong, the customisation with clothes and the many many cars there are to purchase and show off. What is most impressive about this has to definitely be the storyline. Unlike typical games of this genre such as Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, the main protagnanist of the game,  Wei Shen, is not just a character that comes off as just the average, out to get money and destroy stuff for the sake of it.\n\nWei Shen is the heart of the game. He is a well respected polie offica with the San Fransico police department that heads back to his home city, Hong Kong, to try and assist the local PD with taking down the Traids in the citty. It is immediatly obvious that your character has history with a fair amount of the people in the Traids, seeing as they use one of your oldest friends, Jackie to get Wei into the Triads to begin his undercover operation. Though as Shen gets pulled further in to the seedy underground workings of Hong Kong. It becomes more apparent that his motives of ether helping the police take down the Traids, or working with the Triads become extremely blurred.\n\nIn conclusion, as I have seen with other reviews of this game, we are all confused as to why people are not paying enough attention to this brilliant title. Yes there are a few bugs in the game, but what game doesn't. Even if you do not like the look of the game, I absolutely recommend this game just for it;s in depth and "keep you on the edge of your seat" storyline.","December 8, 2013","true","59.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want to find all the collectibles and upgrade Wei Shen's martial arts skills, you will have a great time playing this game for a long time. There are some problems with character animations looking unnatural and poor A.I. such as enemies running into walls and other objects, but the game is still worth playing.","January 10, 2014","true","106.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like GTA but set in Hong Kong with a heavy focus on hand-to-hand combat. Great port as opposed to another open world crime game (cough GTA IV), with a cool fighting system and great handling cars/bikes (unlike GTA IV). Story is good but nothing really all that memorable. Physics are unrealistic but absolutely hilarious.\n\nCombat is quite similar to the Batman Arkham games ableit doesnt flow as well, but you have the ablity to use the environment against opponents as well as pistols, shotguns and smg's later.

It instantly got me. The story is so captivating that I didn't even collect all shrines and statues just because I wanted to continue the storyline, which doesn't happen that often when I play games like this. It is this new situation, not being a gangster like in GTA and all those titles but rather being an undercover cop, always fearing that your cover might be blown up. I will just make a list here to point out what points are outstanding and which are not that great.\n\nPros:\n\n-Action Hijack. Holy. Really cool thing, it allows you to hijack someones car just by jumping off your vehicle onto theirs, like in action movies.\n-Pretty big city.\n-"Minigames" like picking locks, hacking codes, tracking handys and so on. Not really challenging but it is a nice gimmick to have in an action game.\n-The combat system. It's really easy but it still looks pretty cool when you're doing your combos to defeat those 20 triad members.\n-Not too much shooting. Weapons are pretty rare, you mainly use martial arts to fight foes.\n-Different culture. The setting is authentic, the voice acting well done, just the traffic sucks.\n-Very cool characters. Reminds me of Mafia & Mafia II.\n-The captivating story. Wei Shen (you) gets a bit attached during the story and you can understand him due to what you and the characters go through.\n-Nice graphics. Nothing outstanding but they fit well. Not comparable to Mafia II though.\n\nCons:\n\n-The driving. Meh. Not really dynamic, but it doesn't affect the gameplay too much.\n-THE TRAFFIC. Who the heck drives on the left side. 10/10 would crash.\n-The physics. Some things just look really weird especially when you're driving through everything but you suddenly crash because you hit a sidewalk.\n-Not enough to do besides the story. You don't have that much sidequests but that's totally fine since the story is so good.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you like games like Mafia, Mafia II and GTA Vice City then you're gonna love this game (at least its story). It just feels like a good thriller.","June 20, 2014","true","39.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story feels weak, mediocre at most. It had nice moments, but mostly was really straightforward, without any plot twists whatsoever. The side missions were insanely repetitive and the races were just easy. Fights are button mashings mostly (yes, it's a brawler in open world with missions rather than sneaking or going full loud with bazookas), only collecting jade statues (12 in total, but around half of them obtainable during main missions) can upgrade your moves. You had a weapon during mission? Too bad, it won't be any more after you finish it. You have a knife to butcher through your enemies? Too bad, it will last only a couple if hits. I wonder if it was made of wood or glass it would last longer... When you get accustomed to the notion of brawling with LMB-LMB-hold LMB-LMB and catching enemy from time to time there are guns introduced, but only for a couple of missions (remember above where I said about weapon lasting only until the end of the mission?) and it feels like a really forced addon. Most of the times you would crouch behind something and then vault in from of it, the game would put a huge slo-mo and you'd headshot everyone in the room. Booooring.\nWhat's great is the port of the game itself. The game looks beautifully, uses DX10/11, has a free HD textures pack (additional 4GB to download), the steering/controlling is responsible and I haven't find any problems with camera as well.\nLike I said, I would still buy it again, I just wanted to point out the most of the things that were downgrading my experience while playing the game. Of course, there would be achievement-♥♥♥♥♥s, who would play the game until 100% (which includes lots of golden in-game awards), but I play only for the story, and everything else which isn't good enough for me is just distracting me.\n\nGTA4 is still the best :S","August 7, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess you can compare it to the Grand Theft Auto games or Saints Row games in terms of actual gameplay.\n\nIn Sleeping Dogs you’ll find yourself driving in cars for large portions of the game since the game world is actually very large. There’s a fast travel option that I didn’t even know existed until I replayed the game a couple of months ago. The combat in the game is very similar to the Batman Arkham games (strike & counter), but with no gadgets. There are also sections where you’ll use guns, but it’s about 90% hand to hand fighting.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in story. You’re an undercover cop trying to worm your way into the Triad and slowly get pulled in more and more into the life. It’s how I imagine real undercover cops experience their jobs.\n\nOverall I give the game a thumbs up. It seems like every game I review gets a thumbs up, but that’s because if I don’t like a game, I stop playing. Steam offers a free HD textures DLC so everything looks good with the graphics turned way up.\n","August 18, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gunplay is standard cover-to-cover with hand-to-hand combat the primary means of combat.\n\nAlthough the storyline is amazing, the combat is actually extremely easy. In reality, all you have to do is parry every time an enemy attacks you, and you will not take damage. You can even get a little aggresive by punching a few times, and instantly parry an attack while you are mid-swing. Driving combat is the same way because time slows when you are aiming at an enemy, and all you have to do is shoot the wheels of the enemy vehicle to instantly destroy it.\n\nSome cons about the game include the driving camera and drifting. If you find yourself backing up in a vehicle you will find your camera moving in front of you so that you can see behind you. Although it may be useful in some games, the way United Front implemented the driving camera makes the camera jerk all over your screen. The camera will only move when you press W or S, so if you let go of the S key to drive backwards to let the camera settle, it will actually settle facing forward as if you were driving forwards.\n\nDrifting is another problem area that United Front did not implement correctly. At times you will find yourself at high speeds, trying to drift around a corner or burnout 180 to turn around. For some reason, I find myself stopped sideways instead of continuing my drift. At that point, I have to let go of all controls and then drift or turn another 90 degrees to do a full 180. At high speeds, they just stop your drift half-way, almost like you're actually turning the opposite direction than you're pressing.\n\nOn the DLC front, both DLCs were simple and can be completed in under an hour. Both follow a very similar path, having to chase someone down, go to three locations before moving on, go to another location to uncover the leader's location, and then defeat the leader. The only difference is that Year of the Snake is mostly gun play while Nightmare in North Point is mostly hand-to-hand.\n\nRegardless of the few cons of the game and the easy combat, the game was very fun to play and I really enjoyed seeing Hong Kong in video game form as that is where I was born. I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys an open world environment such as Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row and who wants a quick single-player game.","August 5, 2013","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I can safely say that this game is definitely for me.\n\nSleeping Dogs is the story of Wei Shen a cop deep within Hong Kong's crime syndicate, so deep he doesn't know who's side he is on any more. All he knows is honour and respect are the most important things and he will keep to those values.\n\nSleeping Dogs is a fantastic open world sandbox game, its gameplay mechanics and mesmerizing world combined make an experience that is overall rewarding and entertaining from the beginning to when you are finished with it, Whether it be a 20 hour playthrough of only the story or if you're like me and enjoyed the game enough and had the time to collect and unlock everything in the game in a 60+ hour playthrough. No matter what you are going to enjoy Sleeping Dogs if you are a fan of the open world genre.\n\nThe game looks and sounds fantastic the best looking the game will get is at night with rain, its one of the most visually appealing sandbox games out there.\n\nA lot of people will probably have problems with the amount of limitations the game has... you can't fly planes or helicopters the driving is almost arcade (which I kind of respect in a world where every open world game is trying to be realistic with its driving ) and there isn't a jump button.. but when you play Sleeping Dogs you will see how those problems don't even matter instead of jumping the game will give you moments while running to jump to another rooftop or vault over and parkour the environment. I didn't really feel like flying a plane or helicopter would benefit the game at all.\n\nThe combat is a nice remix of the Batman: Arkham Franchise's free flow combat and its a nice new take on that style of combat. You feel like you are in a Hong Kong action movie, with various environmental and up close takedown moves.\nA small but decent range of melee weapons and firearms the combat in Sleeping Dogs is very well done. That being said you will be doing more punching and kicking then shooting.. but that's in the games favour as I feel the melee combat towers of the shooting mechanics which are still pretty fun.\n\nThe collectables in this game never really feel like chores because each one gets you closer and closer to unlocking more items or maxing out your health bar so even players who don't normally enjoy collecting will find themselves doing it anyway.. So I thought that was a pretty nice way to do the collecting side of things.\n\nI'm not a fan of DLC I hate the idea of it but I can find my self enjoying DLC whenever I somehow find my self playing it.\nSleeping Dogs has three DLC missions and all three are great, one has Wei Shen return to being a beat cop and in full uniform to take down a cult that has made its way to Hong Kong and bomb certain areas. Another has Wei make his way to a fighting tournament on an island off the coast of Hong Kong.. and if you didn't think it could get anymore ridiculous there is a full on Halloween themed mission involving Wei rescuing his girlfriend from demon's and ghosts in the Northpoint of Kong Kong.\n\nThe game looks, plays and sounds fantastically. If you are a fan of the sandbox genre then you would be a fool to miss this gem.","July 10, 2014","true","59.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess you can compare it to the Grand Theft Auto games or Saints Row games in terms of actual gameplay.\n\nIn Sleeping Dogs you’ll find yourself driving in cars for large portions of the game since the game world is actually very large. There’s a fast travel option that I didn’t even know existed until I replayed the game a couple of months ago. The combat in the game is very similar to the Batman Arkham games (strike & counter), but with no gadgets. There are also sections where you’ll use guns, but it’s about 90% hand to hand fighting.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in story. You’re an undercover cop trying to worm your way into the Triad and slowly get pulled in more and more into the life. It’s how I imagine real undercover cops experience their jobs.\n\nOverall I give the game a thumbs up. It seems like every game I review gets a thumbs up, but that’s because if I don’t like a game, I stop playing. Steam offers a free HD textures DLC so everything looks good with the graphics turned way up.\n","August 18, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can safely say that this game is definitely for me.\n\nSleeping Dogs is the story of Wei Shen a cop deep within Hong Kong's crime syndicate, so deep he doesn't know who's side he is on any more. All he knows is honour and respect are the most important things and he will keep to those values.\n\nSleeping Dogs is a fantastic open world sandbox game, its gameplay mechanics and mesmerizing world combined make an experience that is overall rewarding and entertaining from the beginning to when you are finished with it, Whether it be a 20 hour playthrough of only the story or if you're like me and enjoyed the game enough and had the time to collect and unlock everything in the game in a 60+ hour playthrough. No matter what you are going to enjoy Sleeping Dogs if you are a fan of the open world genre.\n\nThe game looks and sounds fantastic the best looking the game will get is at night with rain, its one of the most visually appealing sandbox games out there.\n\nA lot of people will probably have problems with the amount of limitations the game has... you can't fly planes or helicopters the driving is almost arcade (which I kind of respect in a world where every open world game is trying to be realistic with its driving ) and there isn't a jump button.. but when you play Sleeping Dogs you will see how those problems don't even matter instead of jumping the game will give you moments while running to jump to another rooftop or vault over and parkour the environment. I didn't really feel like flying a plane or helicopter would benefit the game at all.\n\nThe combat is a nice remix of the Batman: Arkham Franchise's free flow combat and its a nice new take on that style of combat. You feel like you are in a Hong Kong action movie, with various environmental and up close takedown moves.\nA small but decent range of melee weapons and firearms the combat in Sleeping Dogs is very well done. That being said you will be doing more punching and kicking then shooting.. but that's in the games favour as I feel the melee combat towers of the shooting mechanics which are still pretty fun.\n\nThe collectables in this game never really feel like chores because each one gets you closer and closer to unlocking more items or maxing out your health bar so even players who don't normally enjoy collecting will find themselves doing it anyway.. So I thought that was a pretty nice way to do the collecting side of things.\n\nI'm not a fan of DLC I hate the idea of it but I can find my self enjoying DLC whenever I somehow find my self playing it.\nSleeping Dogs has three DLC missions and all three are great, one has Wei Shen return to being a beat cop and in full uniform to take down a cult that has made its way to Hong Kong and bomb certain areas. Another has Wei make his way to a fighting tournament on an island off the coast of Hong Kong.. and if you didn't think it could get anymore ridiculous there is a full on Halloween themed mission involving Wei rescuing his girlfriend from demon's and ghosts in the Northpoint of Kong Kong.\n\nThe game looks, plays and sounds fantastically. If you are a fan of the sandbox genre then you would be a fool to miss this gem.","July 10, 2014","true","59.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sometimes you'll be going full speed with a motorcycle and hit the sidewalk that you can normally walk over will sometimes clip your bike so that you fly into the air. Doesn't happen that much but has a tendency to happen when you least want it to, like when you're doing race events.","July 21, 2013","true","141.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/recommended/202170/","LionInk","Barrett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/","156 products in account","I felt compelled to write a review for Sleeping Dogs, as it is a game that gave me more bang for my buck than most ever have.  I'm a huge fan of open-world games with driving (GTA, Saints Row, Far Cry).  With that said, I 100%'d Sleeping Dogs at about 30 hours in, and my current playtime is now nearing the 118 mark.  I can count the number of games I've 100%'d on less than two hands.  So, I think the important question is, why do I still keep playing?  What caused me to learn this game inside and out, to the point where I know all the mechanics, glitches, and how to mess with every piece of AI?\n\nThe answer lies in that to me, Sleeping Dogs is just pure fun.  The melee combat is something that almost no other game has done as well, and really the only one that comes to mind is the Arkham series.  Even with Arkham, I find the combat takes too long, whereas in Sleeping Dogs it gets things just right.  It's visceral while remaining simple.  Enemies react in momentary fear to bone-crushing martial arts moves, and the protagonist Wei Shen can masterfully counter and take out hordes of gangsters.  Wei also moves around Hong Kong with basic parkour moves, as he can survive falls of impressive heights and slide over all manner of objects smoothly, if timed right.\n\nThe other aspect is driving.  Let me preface this section with two things: one, that I vastly prefer arcade style driving (if I want real driving, I'll go take my real car out), and two, the weapon-based DLC car singlehandedly has given me hours upon hours of extra time with the game.  I'll put this bluntly; if you want realistic driving, go play another game.  Ramming cars at high speeds, tearing through the Financial District with a nearly indestructible bus, and blowing out the tires that sends cars flying like a Hollywood movie... all of its is insanely fun.  Add in the DLC car that pretty much breaks the game, and it just gets hilarious how awesomely you can dominate Hong Kong.\n\nSleeping Dogs is far from perfect, however.  Some of the things the game does are laughably bad, like how the police are handled.  I'm not going to mince words here, the police are just terrible.  They're so bad that they're funny, like with how awful horror movies work.  The biggest issue I have is that they literally pop into an area.  You could be in a desolate alley and shoot someone, or beat up a bunch of people in a quiet street with no police anywhere nearby.. and they will literally pop in like they used a portal gun or stepped through a dimensional rift.  If they weren't so easy to shake off and mess with, this would have ruined any sense of immersion the game had.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the story with a satisfying ending, which took me about 15-20 hours with exploration and side missions, you could tell that in some sections, the developers did not have the time to implement other features they wanted.  It's pretty obvious that they wanted to include deeper connections to Hong Kong with Wei with how much exploration and collection there were, along with Wei's serial hit-it-and-quit-it attitude with women.  Wei's struggle with his identity and corruption, both in the Triads and the police force, was a compelling reason for me to finish the story, however.\n\nFinally, don't let the DLC scare you.  The DLC mostly adds things in to make the game a little more fun, and none of it is necessary whatsoever.  I know some people who wouldn't sneeze at Sleeping Dogs for the amount of DLC it has, but I doubt they ever actually took a look at what it does.\n\nI really believe that Sleeping Dogs is a game that every fan of this genre should play.  Hong Kong's a relatively fresh setting from similar games, and Sleeping Dogs finds its identity in mechanics that are just fun.  Not crazy whacked up purple ♥♥♥♥♥ bat fun like Saints Row, and not maniacal, realistic Trevor fun as in GTA, but just super tight, simple, attractive combat with good pacing and a pretty beautiful world.","December 5, 2013","true","135.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is incredible in my opinion and it's way too long ago that a story attracted me that much, usually I often stop playing games because I'm getting bored of them very fast... The story is about Wei Shen an undercover cop with the order to infiltrate the triad in Hong Kong. The game is set up in "GTA Style" that means it got an open world, cars, guns, drugs and explosions. The map isn't that big as in games these days like Arma 3, GTA 5 but still it's enough. The handling of cars is very washy but as I said the best part of this game is the story. I don't really care about the graphic but I guess it's ok if you make sure to install the free HD Textures DLC which is silly because you have to download lots of files that probably just overwrite the old files. Why not just including them to the original game then? Either way it's a game I recommend everyone who likes to play games with a very good and emotional story. It could be better but it's good enough.\n\nPS. If you are from Germany it could be possible that the DLC's are blocked so you have to activate them using VPN!\n\nIs it worth to buy? - Yes, it is.\nRating - 7/10\n\n- This review only refelects my opinion.

Será que consegue?\n\nNo jogo, Wei Shen, policial infiltrado, trabalha para as tríades de Hong Kong. A dualidade tríade e polícia que o personagem vive é tratada muito pouco na trama.\n\nHá mecânicas de aprimoramento da habilidade do personagem relacionado a isso; upgrades que vão sendo desbloqueados na medida que vai jogando. Dois medidores, nas quest principais, que possiblitam essa evolução das habilidades.\n\nO medidor de pontos de tríade e outro de policial. Se você é sanguinário, violento e até ás vezes criativo com a forma de lidar com os inimigos você recebe pontos nesse medidor. Por outro lado,  caso você seja imprudente, destruidor, assassino de inocentes, ladrão e até atrapalhado você perde pontos de policial. Essa dualidade é interessantíssima. Pena que é só aplicada nas missões principais. Deveria ser aplicada em todas as missões.\n\nA questão da dualidade de ser policial e gangster, ao mesmo tempo,  nem é desenvolvida plenamente na trama. O jogo seria muito mais interessante caso a história principal fosse guiada por suas escolhas, para que lado o jogador fosse. E um final da mesma forma. Infelizmente a trama não é das melhores. Ainda bem que o jogo tem outros elementos positivos.\n\nOs colecionáveis do jogo são todos relacionados ao jogo e não são gratuitos. Pegá-los pode ajudar mais tarde. E eles ficam visíveis conforme você vai progredindo no jogo. Dessa forma toda aquele parte de ficar vagando a esmo perdido e sem saber o que fazer não acontece quase nunca. A sinalizaçao do jogo é outro ponto forte, dificilmente você vai errar o caminho.\n\nOutro ponto positivo são as batalhas. O jogo é todo baseado em lutas. Seja com armas de fogo ou sem, a ação é bem feita e bem executada, resultando numa mecânica de batalha simplificada e intuitiva. O único porém fica pela câmera que atrapalha ás vezes.\n\nSleeping Dogs não é o sandbox do ano. Não é o melhor sandbox de todos os tempos. Talvez nem seja o melhor jogo do mês do seu lançamento. Mas há um caminho de evolução que o jogo pode criar. Lembre-se, ninguém admira GTA I, mas sim o GTA III.

It's a game with AAA production values but a lower level of marketing and sales, which is unfortunate. To me this is pretty clearly a better open world game than GTA4, though the sandbox seems smaller and therefore the game shorter. It's been quite a while since I've played GTA4, so that may not be correct. With that exception, Sleeping Dogs does everything better than GTA4. The graphics are better, the driving is better, the combat is better (though my personal preference would be to have more gunfights and less fist fights), the hidden objects are handled better, etc. I enjoyed the story as well, though it was somewhat predictable. However, had it not been, it wouldn't have been as satisfying as there weren't a lot of ways the loose ends could have been wrapped up. Hopefully Rockstar "borrows" some of the gameplay elements for GTAV, though that would have had to be in development before this game was released. Square-Enix should do all PC ports, because they get them right, down to the high resolution texture pack, Steamworks, video options, etc. Thank goodness they saved this game from cancellation.\n","April 23, 2014","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He really liked this game, and I was curious to find out why.\n\nThis game is really good and I thouroughly enjoyed my time playing it. The open world is great, and the atmosphere that the game provides, even from the first mission, is fantastic. Hong Kong is a great place to have a game like this. The combat may be ripped straight our of Batman: Arkham Asylum, but that doesn't mean it's bad. You can get upgrades by collecting various statues around the city, and they only serve to make the already-brutal comabt way more brutal.\n\nThe story is great, and there are plenty of side missions to run around to do. There are also a ton of collectibles (such as the health shrines, or lockboxes), races, and various other things you can do to waste time in Hong Kong.\n\nI do have two complaints, however. This game was apparently a long time in the making, so there are some noticeable things that feel incomplete or missing. The dating sim in the game is weird: Wei takes a girl out, they have a sexual encounter, and her number disappears from your phone. At one point, one of the side missions involves you finding out your then girlfriend (whom I didn't even KNOW she was my girlfriend!) is cheating on you. Totally weird.\n\nThere's also a weird karaoke simulator in the game that they make you play twice. I didn't really enjoy that (though I did get the Karaoke Superstar achievement because ♥♥♥♥ you), but it is funny to hear Wei sing "Girls Wanna Have Fun".\n\nOverall, I got the game for a steal of five bucks. If you're here looking at reviews during the Steam sale, I'd highly, highly recommend this title for the money. If not, I'd still probably pay twenty bucks for it (that's the price at the time of writing). I sunk a good twenty-six hours in, and I do not regret any of it. A great game.","April 23, 2014","true","26.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the first 5 hours I didn't get to handle a gun which is not what I expected. Instead I was Kung Fu Fighting. This game had a really nice mixed gameplay of fist to fist combat and gunplay. The graphics were quite horrible in console, but this game on PC highest settings with the high res pack makes this game look a lot more beautiful. In other hands the story was breathtaking, it immersed me from feeling Wei Shen's side of being a cop and a triad. The huge dilemma he faced with his duty or belonging. He had a family and a sense of home with his gang, but he also had a job to bring them down.\nOverall the story was amazing, the graphics were good but the edges of the models are evident but their textures are realistic and the gameplay is quite thrilling especially with the brutal melee kills.","December 26, 2013","true","22.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well for starters, this overlooked title is frequently compared to the GTA franchise. So what does this game have to offer?\n\nWhat I like about this game:\n- The setting of Hong Kong, loosely based off of the real Hong Kong that is...\n- The hand-to-hand combat with interactivity of the environment to even the odds a bit (and because it looks fancy).\n- The story following an undercover police officer.\n- The protagonist Wei Shen and the characters he interacts with.\n- The colorful environment making Hong Kong feel active (especially the night market)\n\nStuff that gave me mixed feelings or have no opinion on:\n- The AI: sometimes their behavior get pretty wonky at times, but nothing majorly broken with them\n- The side activities: they're okay if not a little underwhelming since there isn't a lot of stuff to do aside from side quests. For me, the two gambling activities are kind of a waste of your time unless you want a method to toss your money away more quickly.\n- Environmental glitches: I encountered about one or two bugs, with one of them involving a wire attached to a security camera floating in the middle of a parking lot, but nothing major.\n- The protagonist Wei Shen never speaking a single word in Cantonese (he said one word in Cantonese in the wheels of fury dlc, much to my suprise). Honestly it confuses me a little bit, but that's just a minor complaint. I'm just going to assume he just has a preference to strictly speaking english anyway.\n- Guns: yes, yes, nothing's fun without gunplay, but obtaining guns is a little different than what you would expect from GTA. While gunplay is pretty fun, there is no way of purchasing firearms or ammunition so the only way you can get them outside of story missions (and occasionally DLC) is to do it the hard way: steal them from the HKPD. Completing the story will get you a golden Desert Eagle for you to use.\n- The map size: a bit small for an open world game, but it's tolerable.\n- The mini map: most of the time, directions for way points work, but there was one area that partially breaks the GPS and tells you to go around in circles until you disobey it.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The ending: It didn't bother me too much, but I kinda wish you could become a member of the Triads full-time or stay loyal to the Hong Kong Police Department.\n- The DLC: personally I think most of them don't really offer much, but I think a few of them are probably worth purchasing, especially if they're on sale.\n- The second to last story mission: specifically it is the quick-time event on the scaffolding where button mashing is required. The reason why I hate that sequence is because there is a programing error that if you rapidly button mash, you will fail regardless of how fast you press the spacebar. How to get past it is to find a steady rhythm and keep the rhythm for about 20 - 30 seconds. (Note that it took me 10 minutes to figure out what was going on and go to the forums to look for help. I know, it's really sad to admit that it took me that long for me to figure it out)\n- Animation quality: they didn't put a lot of effort into animation outside of the official cutscenes. They put effort into lip-syncing and movement in the cutscenes, but didn't even try to put any effort outside of that, althought when it comes to movement like walking and running, they are just fine. (I should note that they "semi-locked" the camera to make sure you don't see Wei's face, and when you do see it, it's very obvious they didn't even bother)\n- Camera angles: my main pet peev comes from driving when you want to go reverse, the camera automatically rotates around the car and I'd rather do it manually because it feels really disorienting to have the game do it for me.\n\nWhat will kick most people in the teeth:\n- The lack of a multiplayer: the game has a social hub for you to compare scores with your friends, but some people like me will not care about numbers and might be upset that there is no physical multiplayer to play with your friends.\n\nDespite my complaints, this game has plenty to offer and is definitely worth the current price tag and deserves more attention that it currently has.","July 7, 2014","true","38.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll get thrown right into action from the first scene, and the nostalgic storyline will keep begging you for a repeat of the story once you're done.\n\nVisuals and system requirements: The visuals are stellar, and you will not need to break a bank to build a rig that can play this game. Simply put, if you can play Tomb Raider on Medium settings with DirectX11 features turned on, you'll blaze through this game without breaking a sweat.\n\nStereoscopic 3D via AMD HD3D works out of the box if you have an AMD HD 5000+ GPU connected to a 3D capable monitor via HDMI 1.4a.

Of course it is like GTA in china in a way, but it doesn't fail in a storytelling like GTA 4 did. The game takes major influence from movies The Departed and Infernal Affairs where the line between friend and foe gets blurred and character loyalties and movies are questioned. The protagonist, Wei Shen is an undercover cop in Hong Kong who sworn uphold the law and bring criminals to justice but by virtue of being undercover which is also a gangster comiting very real acts of of crime. He has a personal vendetta against drug pushing triads for what they did to his sister and he sworn to take them down. It's a game about dealing with conflicting aspects of self. And what is interesting you don't have to chose between those aspects. It's a game about living with and reconsiling the fact that you have theese identities. The best straightforward example of this is you get 2 different EXP bars after each mission, the triad and cop.

It's a game with AAA production values but a lower level of marketing and sales, which is unfortunate. To me this is pretty clearly a better open world game than GTA4, though the sandbox seems smaller and therefore the game shorter. It's been quite a while since I've played GTA4, so that may not be correct. With that exception, Sleeping Dogs does everything better than GTA4. The graphics are better, the driving is better, the combat is better (though my personal preference would be to have more gunfights and less fist fights), the hidden objects are handled better, etc. I enjoyed the story as well, though it was somewhat predictable. However, had it not been, it wouldn't have been as satisfying as there weren't a lot of ways the loose ends could have been wrapped up. Hopefully Rockstar "borrows" some of the gameplay elements for GTAV, though that would have had to be in development before this game was released. Square-Enix should do all PC ports, because they get them right, down to the high resolution texture pack, Steamworks, video options, etc. Thank goodness they saved this game from cancellation.\n","April 23, 2014","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much better than other titles that Square Enix has made that are not Final Fantasy such as Just Cause which has serious audio syncing problems.\nCombat system closely related to that of Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkam City. graphics are quite impressive.\n\nBut besides the great fighting mechanics, the endless amount of things that you can do in Hong Kong, the customisation with clothes and the many many cars there are to purchase and show off. What is most impressive about this has to definitely be the storyline. Unlike typical games of this genre such as Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, the main protagnanist of the game,  Wei Shen, is not just a character that comes off as just the average, out to get money and destroy stuff for the sake of it.\n\nWei Shen is the heart of the game. He is a well respected polie offica with the San Fransico police department that heads back to his home city, Hong Kong, to try and assist the local PD with taking down the Traids in the citty. It is immediatly obvious that your character has history with a fair amount of the people in the Traids, seeing as they use one of your oldest friends, Jackie to get Wei into the Triads to begin his undercover operation. Though as Shen gets pulled further in to the seedy underground workings of Hong Kong. It becomes more apparent that his motives of ether helping the police take down the Traids, or working with the Triads become extremely blurred.\n\nIn conclusion, as I have seen with other reviews of this game, we are all confused as to why people are not paying enough attention to this brilliant title. Yes there are a few bugs in the game, but what game doesn't. Even if you do not like the look of the game, I absolutely recommend this game just for it;s in depth and "keep you on the edge of your seat" storyline.","December 8, 2013","true","59.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess you can compare it to the Grand Theft Auto games or Saints Row games in terms of actual gameplay.\n\nIn Sleeping Dogs you’ll find yourself driving in cars for large portions of the game since the game world is actually very large. There’s a fast travel option that I didn’t even know existed until I replayed the game a couple of months ago. The combat in the game is very similar to the Batman Arkham games (strike & counter), but with no gadgets. There are also sections where you’ll use guns, but it’s about 90% hand to hand fighting.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in story. You’re an undercover cop trying to worm your way into the Triad and slowly get pulled in more and more into the life. It’s how I imagine real undercover cops experience their jobs.\n\nOverall I give the game a thumbs up. It seems like every game I review gets a thumbs up, but that’s because if I don’t like a game, I stop playing. Steam offers a free HD textures DLC so everything looks good with the graphics turned way up.\n","August 18, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It instantly got me. The story is so captivating that I didn't even collect all shrines and statues just because I wanted to continue the storyline, which doesn't happen that often when I play games like this. It is this new situation, not being a gangster like in GTA and all those titles but rather being an undercover cop, always fearing that your cover might be blown up. I will just make a list here to point out what points are outstanding and which are not that great.\n\nPros:\n\n-Action Hijack. Holy. Really cool thing, it allows you to hijack someones car just by jumping off your vehicle onto theirs, like in action movies.\n-Pretty big city.\n-"Minigames" like picking locks, hacking codes, tracking handys and so on. Not really challenging but it is a nice gimmick to have in an action game.\n-The combat system. It's really easy but it still looks pretty cool when you're doing your combos to defeat those 20 triad members.\n-Not too much shooting. Weapons are pretty rare, you mainly use martial arts to fight foes.\n-Different culture. The setting is authentic, the voice acting well done, just the traffic sucks.\n-Very cool characters. Reminds me of Mafia & Mafia II.\n-The captivating story. Wei Shen (you) gets a bit attached during the story and you can understand him due to what you and the characters go through.\n-Nice graphics. Nothing outstanding but they fit well. Not comparable to Mafia II though.\n\nCons:\n\n-The driving. Meh. Not really dynamic, but it doesn't affect the gameplay too much.\n-THE TRAFFIC. Who the heck drives on the left side. 10/10 would crash.\n-The physics. Some things just look really weird especially when you're driving through everything but you suddenly crash because you hit a sidewalk.\n-Not enough to do besides the story. You don't have that much sidequests but that's totally fine since the story is so good.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you like games like Mafia, Mafia II and GTA Vice City then you're gonna love this game (at least its story). It just feels like a good thriller.","June 20, 2014","true","39.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are wonderful, the atmosphere wonderful with some humor thrown in.  The music that plays when you're driving around, for the most part, is great.  Beyond stealing cars and completing missions, the combat elements are excellently done--that goes for firearms and ESPECIALLY for melee combat.  Great DLC as well.  Different outfits aren't just for vanity, but add either a challenging element (like added heat from the police) or additional combat options based off of real martial arts schools.... from drunken master, to wing chun, tai chi chuan, mui tai, mma, etc....  There are some classy and fun automobiles and the races range from easy to very challenging difficulty.  The side activities can be as fun as the main story.  You can learn how to swear in Chinese as well.\n\nThe only thing that could make this game better is actual nudity for all the hot chix you can date--and even Wei Chen... he's got a hot bod too.

The story is incredible in my opinion and it's way too long ago that a story attracted me that much, usually I often stop playing games because I'm getting bored of them very fast... The story is about Wei Shen an undercover cop with the order to infiltrate the triad in Hong Kong. The game is set up in "GTA Style" that means it got an open world, cars, guns, drugs and explosions. The map isn't that big as in games these days like Arma 3, GTA 5 but still it's enough. The handling of cars is very washy but as I said the best part of this game is the story. I don't really care about the graphic but I guess it's ok if you make sure to install the free HD Textures DLC which is silly because you have to download lots of files that probably just overwrite the old files. Why not just including them to the original game then? Either way it's a game I recommend everyone who likes to play games with a very good and emotional story. It could be better but it's good enough.\n\nPS. If you are from Germany it could be possible that the DLC's are blocked so you have to activate them using VPN!\n\nIs it worth to buy? - Yes, it is.\nRating - 7/10\n\n- This review only refelects my opinion.

Although most will disagree that there are no stripper bars in this game, there are clubs and such. In comparison and contrast, GTA has "whacked out ♥♥♥♥". Not as much as Saints Row. But still whacked out mini games. Sleeping Dogs invites you to a story of Wei Shen, an American-Chinese undercover cop who goes under the disguise of his childhood friend Jackie. His mission is to exploit the traids and ruin their operations (Drugs, etc.). During this story, the player will feel conflicted emotions from the events that happen to Wei. The combat system is a second recommendation from me after Batman Arkham City. There are multiple ways to take down enemies and there are tournaments for those who are thirsty for a beatdown. This game is brutal and is recommended for those who enjoyed GTA and Batman Arkham City. I have enjoyed the game incredibly and played through multiple times. (More on X-box).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/recommended/202170/","LionInk","Barrett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionInk/","156 products in account","I felt compelled to write a review for Sleeping Dogs, as it is a game that gave me more bang for my buck than most ever have.  I'm a huge fan of open-world games with driving (GTA, Saints Row, Far Cry).  With that said, I 100%'d Sleeping Dogs at about 30 hours in, and my current playtime is now nearing the 118 mark.  I can count the number of games I've 100%'d on less than two hands.  So, I think the important question is, why do I still keep playing?  What caused me to learn this game inside and out, to the point where I know all the mechanics, glitches, and how to mess with every piece of AI?\n\nThe answer lies in that to me, Sleeping Dogs is just pure fun.  The melee combat is something that almost no other game has done as well, and really the only one that comes to mind is the Arkham series.  Even with Arkham, I find the combat takes too long, whereas in Sleeping Dogs it gets things just right.  It's visceral while remaining simple.  Enemies react in momentary fear to bone-crushing martial arts moves, and the protagonist Wei Shen can masterfully counter and take out hordes of gangsters.  Wei also moves around Hong Kong with basic parkour moves, as he can survive falls of impressive heights and slide over all manner of objects smoothly, if timed right.\n\nThe other aspect is driving.  Let me preface this section with two things: one, that I vastly prefer arcade style driving (if I want real driving, I'll go take my real car out), and two, the weapon-based DLC car singlehandedly has given me hours upon hours of extra time with the game.  I'll put this bluntly; if you want realistic driving, go play another game.  Ramming cars at high speeds, tearing through the Financial District with a nearly indestructible bus, and blowing out the tires that sends cars flying like a Hollywood movie... all of its is insanely fun.  Add in the DLC car that pretty much breaks the game, and it just gets hilarious how awesomely you can dominate Hong Kong.\n\nSleeping Dogs is far from perfect, however.  Some of the things the game does are laughably bad, like how the police are handled.  I'm not going to mince words here, the police are just terrible.  They're so bad that they're funny, like with how awful horror movies work.  The biggest issue I have is that they literally pop into an area.  You could be in a desolate alley and shoot someone, or beat up a bunch of people in a quiet street with no police anywhere nearby.. and they will literally pop in like they used a portal gun or stepped through a dimensional rift.  If they weren't so easy to shake off and mess with, this would have ruined any sense of immersion the game had.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the story with a satisfying ending, which took me about 15-20 hours with exploration and side missions, you could tell that in some sections, the developers did not have the time to implement other features they wanted.  It's pretty obvious that they wanted to include deeper connections to Hong Kong with Wei with how much exploration and collection there were, along with Wei's serial hit-it-and-quit-it attitude with women.  Wei's struggle with his identity and corruption, both in the Triads and the police force, was a compelling reason for me to finish the story, however.\n\nFinally, don't let the DLC scare you.  The DLC mostly adds things in to make the game a little more fun, and none of it is necessary whatsoever.  I know some people who wouldn't sneeze at Sleeping Dogs for the amount of DLC it has, but I doubt they ever actually took a look at what it does.\n\nI really believe that Sleeping Dogs is a game that every fan of this genre should play.  Hong Kong's a relatively fresh setting from similar games, and Sleeping Dogs finds its identity in mechanics that are just fun.  Not crazy whacked up purple ♥♥♥♥♥ bat fun like Saints Row, and not maniacal, realistic Trevor fun as in GTA, but just super tight, simple, attractive combat with good pacing and a pretty beautiful world.","December 5, 2013","true","135.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The "definitive version" has problems that this one doesn't, for instance screen tearing in cutscenes that I couldn't fix. It also does not quite run as good as this original version. I ended up just refunding the definitive version and sticking with this one. There were really no differences anyway. The graphics "upgrades" were not noticable to me and didn't need messed with anyway since the game looks good enough already. If you can, get the this regular version from another retailer then get the dlc when they go on sale. www.isthereanydeal.com is your friend.\n\nThis is a pretty good game with outstanding graphics. It is one of the most beautiful looking games I have ever seen, especially when it's nighttime. It is GTA style and has great graphics and gameplay, its best qualities. The gameplay is smooth and controls are good. Fighting is what the game is based around and is well done and feels great. You can really feel the hits landing when you fight. Cars handle great. Mission structure and upgrade system are done well. It is fun to be a straight up badass and ♥♥♥♥ people up in a game and in that regard this game delivers. The only drawback is that your guy is a undercover cop. Cops suck, but oh well whatever. It reminds me of Mafia 2 in how the gameplay works which is sort of linear compared to GTA4, however in this game you have different things around the world you can collect and side police missions you can do. This game is just as good as GTA4 if not better because of its flawless 60fps performance on extreme settings with FXAA and its smoother overall gameplay and outstanding graphics. This game has much better car handling than GTA4 as well on most cars. The character movement controls can be wonky sometimes when holding down spacebar to run, like my guy will try to parkour over ♥♥♥♥ I don't want him to or do weird glitchy type ♥♥♥♥ so you have to be careful when using spacebar to run. The soundtrack stands out too. Unlike GTA4 which has about 99% awful songs, this game has some really dope tracks. Some songs suck but many sound really good, especially tracks on the ninja tune radio station. Some things aren't shown in the control layout menu when they should be, namely how to switch radio stations and how to holster your gun. With a quick google search though, you will find that it is left and right arrow keys to tune the radio and down arrow to holster. Overall though the default controls work well and make both melee and gun combat both easy to perform. I have also tried playing with a xbox 360 controller and it works very well, but I switched to mouse and keyboard so I can have better aiming when it is time for gun combat.\n\nAwesome game one of my all-time favs. 9/10","May 13, 2015","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably not, but still if you want to imagine being a Triad whilst working for the law then this is the game for you\n\nThis is a pretty awesome open world GTA style game. It is beautiful to look at and just great fun to walk around and explore. The missions are diverse and plentiful. The story is compelling and very well written. I really felt connected to the characters and invested in what happened to them. And the entire immense story was topped off by a pretty awesome finale.\n\nPretty much every aspect of the gameplay is solid. The driving and combat are robust and feel great. Some of my favourite memories of this game were just driving around the city at full tilt with the cops chasing me shooting out tires and running people off the road. There are a lot of vehicles and each one drives very differently.\n\nThe combat is great, so much variety and with many ways to beat the hell out of people you won’t get bored. Plus with the ability to learn more skills you will find the fighting even better the further you go. The game also feature contextual take downs, want to slam some guys face into a fan or a window? You can do that and it feels immensely satisfying\n\nThere are also tons of side missions to do such as street racing, gambling and a fight club that you will be busy for hours before even delving into the story itself. Plus with all the available DLC and now the definitive edition you will be able to delve even deeper into what Hong Kong has to offer\n\nThis version is no longer available but if I would recommend the definitive edition as it contains even more stuff. If you play this game you will have a great time, it is far superior to its spiritual predecessors and a great intro to a new series.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 6, 2014","true","33.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ok they are fun for a while but the story does not engage (IMO). Sleeping Dogs has an interesting hand to hand style combat system that at first I did not like, but you learn and improve your skill as you go (which grew on me) and became fun. The story and feel of the game is what keeps me engaged, I want to see how it plays out being an undercover cop in the capacity of infiltrating the Triads. So I recommend this game, especially if you found the GTA/SR storylines not to your liking, perhaps you will be surprised as much as I was by Sleeping Dogs.\n\nYes I do Recommend this game.\n\n"Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand"","March 5, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nice story mode (watch Hong-Kong movie Infernal Affairs for more in-depth look on Triad) which was pretty intense, interesting side missions (still didn't finish them all), amazing graphics (especially on rainy nights), excellent sound and soundtrack. United Front Games and Square Enix didn't dissapoint.\n\nCombat system is interesting and takes some time to used to, but when you master all kung-fu moves you'll be unstoppable (gather Jade statues as soon as you can cause it will greatly boost your performance in combat). Well, throughout the game, no matter how good you are, patience will be your biggest friend when fighting a group of mobs. :)\n\nDon't forget to download High Resolution Texture Pack (free DLC) which will really bring the game to higher level.\nAlso, if you're lazy, you can purchase Top Dog Silver Pack (1,49€) and Top Dog Gold Pack (2,49€) for a quick XP boost, which will instantly give you many skillpoints to enhance your abilities and access to many wardrobe options.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, I do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vehrmt/recommended/202170/","vehrmt","Crestfall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vehrmt/","934 products in account","Sleeping Dogs is a great game that is not without its flaws but has won a place in my heart nonetheless. Once you get past the stunning visuals, you are met with an immersive underworld set in Hong Kong where an undercover officer climbs the ranks of the triads while being forced to consider his own loyalties.\n\nUnlike other games in the genre, the combat is primarily focused on the melee aspect. Officer Shen is a very competent martial artist, and learns more moves and improves the ones he knows as the game progresses. The system feels fresh at the game's onset, but by the game's finish, it loses some of its charm. It is very visually pleasing, but from a gameplay point of view, it is very easy to master the moveset and dominate enemies under all circumstances. This does, however, propagate the sensation of being the invincible hero of the traditional asian fighting movies from which Sleeping Dogs no doubt has drawn significant amounts of inspiration.\n\nStory-wise, the atmoshpere is great. Being in Hong Kong, people speak both English and Chinese, and you often hear the two intertwined. One of the most unusal parts was, in fact, getting used to driving primarily on the left side of the road.\n\nYou are met with a good deal of characters, some memorable even after one encounter, but many of them are unfortunately flat. This is due mostly to having too little exposure to each of them, the average being two missions for each character - one where you meet them, and one where you do them a favor of some sort. Most benefitted from interesting missions, but there were a few cases in which I felt I'd wasted my time. This deficit applies primarily to the side missions. It is worth noting that some of the side missions fall into extremes; some were very humorous and/or interesting, and some were excruciatingly boring.\n\nRacing constitutes a major side activity, and it is decently implemented for a game that focuses on other aspects. You can purchase cars and use them in races, many of which take you through challenging routes. I often felt myself remembering the feeling I had playing Need For Speed Underground while playing through the races in the game. (It's a good feeling)\n\nFor the primary missions, the cast is built out of stereotypes, but they play their parts well and the story itself, while having some cliche elements, is pleasurable to go through and does have a few unexpected twists. Since you are a police officer in parallel to being a triad member, this opens up a series of circumstances that were especially pleasing to see playing out. The main character is also very likeable, being a smooth talker when the need arises. There are a few moments that are absolutely impossible, such as surviving a shotgun blast in close range or taking down dozens of triad cars on the street like it's nothing, but those can be forgiven since Sleeping Dogs is an action game.\n\nThe most irksome parts were getting around and going after collectibles. Getting around was immersive at first - you got to see the nooks and crannies of Hong Kong, and there were plenty of very well-detailed areas to enjoy. However, as you progress later into the game, you find yourself constantly wanting to be on the other side of the map, and with often no taxis in sight, the drive that can take several minutes gets tiring. An especially brutal offender was the naval part: getting on or off boats was extremely tiresome, primarily because of invisible walls that made it very hard to transition between sea and land.\n\nThe collectibles became annoying to deal with because many of them were placed in impossibly hard to reach positions that took ages to scout out for possible entry points. Also, you are heavily coerced into going after two of the three types of collectibles, as you need them to improve your fighting skills and health pool, both of which can pose a serious problem in the later parts of the game if ignored.\n\nFinally, I'd like to mention the game's soundtrack. As is usual with such games, there are a number of radio stations, each catering to a different taste. I found myself enjoying several stations personally, and the commentary and advertisements between tracks were well-done and immersive.\n\nThis sums up how I feel about the game, having just finished it less than an hour ago. I mention the game's shortcomings a lot because those made the experience less enjoyable, but it was definitely a game I enjoyed overall and would recommend to others. It compensates well for what it lacks through solid mechanics, a virtual Hong Kong teeming with detail and a plot that manages to keep the player engaged from start to finish.\n\n\n","January 27, 2014","true","23.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Nice story mode (watch Hong-Kong movie Infernal Affairs for more in-depth look on Triad) which was pretty intense, interesting side missions (still didn't finish them all), amazing graphics (especially on rainy nights), excellent sound and soundtrack. United Front Games and Square Enix didn't dissapoint.\n\nCombat system is interesting and takes some time to used to, but when you master all kung-fu moves you'll be unstoppable (gather Jade statues as soon as you can cause it will greatly boost your performance in combat). Well, throughout the game, no matter how good you are, patience will be your biggest friend when fighting a group of mobs. :)\n\nDon't forget to download High Resolution Texture Pack (free DLC) which will really bring the game to higher level.\nAlso, if you're lazy, you can purchase Top Dog Silver Pack (1,49€) and Top Dog Gold Pack (2,49€) for a quick XP boost, which will instantly give you many skillpoints to enhance your abilities and access to many wardrobe options.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, I do. It's a fun open world third person action game in the asian setting which does have some weaknesses (missions are sometimes repetative; chase enemy - kill enemy) but, all in all, it a fun game and I don't think you'll regret it.\n\nIt should be available on Steam sales for a nice price (I got it for cca 6€ a few months ago) so keep it on radar.","December 12, 2013","true","43.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The open-world criminality of GTA.  Batman's 1-vs-many melee combat.  Mirror's Edge style free-running.  Acrobatic hijackings straight out of Just Cause 2.  Cover shooting, a la Gears of War.  Innumerable cop movies and Bruce Lee movies get huge nods.

The melee combat focus threw me off at first, but after switching to a gaming controller, the gameplay felt significantly more intuitive over a mouse & keyboard. The intertwined story of undercover cop and bad ♥♥♥ Triad Sun On Yee Red Pole is impressively put together. Sleeping Dogs comes off every bit as an AAA title with superb graphics, voice acting, and gameplay. Plus the amazing assortment of radio stations and musical flavors is extraordinary.\n\nEven though most of the side missions felt underwhelming, repetitive, and in many cases downright boring, I found myself continuously getting distracted trying to complete them, or stopping to seek out that next health upgrade or lockbox. I realize now it was the reward element that made them so addicting--always granting some new unlock or item reward. The taxi service is a nice feature if you want to get somewhere fast, although the car handling feels very similar to GTA San Andreas which makes driving good fun. Also the DLC adds a good variety of worthwhile content as well.\n\nTwo thumbs up.","August 26, 2014","true","28.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

You start as a street-level enforcer and work your way into the confidences of the upper reaches of the Triads, while doing other undercover police work along the way, along with the normal extraneous missions which the game provides.\n\nWhat Sleeping Dogs does, it does VERY well. It's got one of the best core stories of any open-world game that I've ever played. Its combat is top-notch (although I found it initially a little difficult to get into), at least for the hand-to-hand portion - shooting is more middle of the road. Unfortunately, the extras outside of the main storyline and the main cop assignments felt more like additions after the fact to make it an open-world game when it otherwise wouldn't really have needed to be. Car controls never felt quite /right/, but was good enough to be workable - it's only annoying in races.\n\nAll in all, the game is excellent. When the story really got going, I couldn't put it down, and it was HIGHLY satisfying. There were even one or two moments where I expected the plotline to be mildly hypocritical in favor of the protagonist and it ended up flipping my expectations on their head, which is ALWAYS appreciated.\n\nHighly recommended.","November 23, 2014","true","47.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What elevates this story from the rest is the excellent voice acting and compelling characters that are both believeable and relateable.\n\nThe game is an open-world third-person action shooter. The combat is an improved version of the Batman: Arkham games formula, with the introduction of combos, melee weapons (like cleavers, batons and even fish!!), environmental executions and guns that, at first, feel kind of awkward, but I got used to them.\nThere is a lot of side activities in the world to complete: doing favors to increase fame, take part in illegal races, wipe out hidden triad gangs and sing karaoke.\n\nThe graphics are impressive, and the game really shines at night time. The city does feel alive, even though most of the pedestrians are walking or talking on a phone. The soundtrack is full of both chinese and english songs, with plenty of radio stations to choose from.\n\nHowever, this game is far from perfect: the biggest complaint I have is that, when you have beaten all the story missions and favours and races, there is nothing to do. Trying to get involved in car chases with the police doesn't help since you will have upgrades that reduce heat faster than ever.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game to spend time to, with a compelling story and many side activities, even though at the end there is nothing else to do.\n\nSCORE: 89/100","June 28, 2014","true","35.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I really liked the setting of the game, as it's something different than the ususal, small things like, driving on the left side of the road made the game a bit more interesting than it would've been, should they have left details like this out. The story revolves around Wei, an undercover cop sent to take down the mafia that operates in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Gameplay\nSleeping Dogs has amazing fighting mechanics, it mostly revolves around melee combat, and guns are only used when absolutely neccesary. Because of this, Sleeping Dogs stands out from it's rivals, the melee combat is fluent, fun and never gets old. The gun mechanics are good, but nothing special or exceptional, just plain old shooting. The Melle however has a LOT of combos, and that makes for good variation, you can also execute enemies using the enviroment, giving you bonus points while finishing off an enemy in style. Driving mechanics is the only thing I dislike about this game and while you get used to them after an hour or so, they still bug me. The cars handle extremely unrealistic and I would consider that this games major flaw.\n\nI do really like how well-optimised the game is for PC, it's an exceptional port with settings like 'world densitiy', which will determine how many pedestrians, cars etc there will be in the world.\n\nThe Graphics\nSleeping Dogs looks good, and the world feels alive and immersive, especially at night. The game's true beauty comes out when you're driving through the city at night, with all the neon lighting and advertising creating a beautiful lit up picture. So yes, this game looks good and I'm sure it'll age well.\n\nTo Summarize\n+Great fighting mechanics, very refreshing melee combat.\n+Good gunplay, though nothing exceptional.\n+Amazing setting.\n+Attention to detail.\n+Graphics are really nice looking.\n+Great PC-port.\n-Driving mechanics leave something to be desired.","March 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047266382/recommended/202170/","76561198047266382","[GC]SpiritWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047266382/","646 products in account","The main storyline follows an emerging gang war that threatens to overrun the city of Hong Kong. You then follow a series of fairly redundant missions before beginning to shake down local vendors for money and beating up enemy gangs to bolster Winston's ego. Occasionally meeting up with your police handler, to hear the same lecture about not getting too emotionally involved to the monsters you’re working for.\n\nI have to be blunt, aside from the really pretty graphics, the game takes a face dive into the floor for it's combat system being nearly non-existent. You can pretty much just sit there deflecting attacks till your enemy just spontaneously dies, since the actual combat is a bit meh by having it just be a combo of clicks. This wasn't suppose to be a point-and-click game, yet the combat system makes it feel like one. So with 80% of the game revolving around combat, it's a real let down there.\n\nAnother complaint I have to make is basically how terrible the handling of any vehicle was. There is virtually no chance of speeding and driving properly what-so-ever, as someone who has grown up playing various race games, this is another disappointing factor of the game.\nThe game’s second biggest issue is with its camera. It can often positions itself towards center even when you’re trying to maneuver whilst driving. This can significantly complicate navigating tight quarters or getting a look around your vehicle in open spaces. The camera can also be frustrating in some combat situations, though it doesn't happen quite as often or severely.\n\nI also have to point out that in a gang game, it is virtually impossible to actually acquire a weapon. For memory you get a gun once during the entire game for approximately 5 minutes and nothing more. Knives are also irritatingly rare with maybe only one person in a random gang you attack to have one which you can sometimes have the option of picking up.\n\nIt redeems itself within it's story-line, but, character development, bar the ones in cut scenes seem so cut short and abnormal. You go from just meeting a person to seeming like you have been in a relationship for years. It just doesn't quite flow in my opinion.\n\nAll that aside, I did enjoy the random health shrines, deterring from the usual 'Pick up a health pot to gain more max health', within combat you can't just go to the side and chew on regenerative dirt, it takes a bit more time to actually gain it back. Another really redeeming quality is the animations to fight scenes, they are quite realistic. Also, the sounds of punching and slashing (when you finally acquire a knife) are brilliant.\n\nMoving on.. People chattering away in the background, or random vendors trying to sell certain things to which you can also interact with a few odd ones here and there make it feel a lot more in-depth and was something I did enjoy. Also actually just having pedestrians is such a tiny detail that make a game feel so much more real. It pulls it off with flying colors. I also have to make a comment on the voice acting. It simply adds to this emphasis on realism. The game employs a unique mixture of Chinese and English that doesn't sound corny or ill-executed which can be pretty difficult to pull off.\n\nIn all, pretty good game, just a few frustrating little downfalls.","September 30, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems that it is relatively underated, but it is definitely a must-play in my opinion.\n\nPros\n-Gorgeous visuals\n-Fully realized world\n-Very fun combat\n-Great voice acting\n-Compelling story\n\nCons\n-Vehicle handling could use some work\n-Vehicle models are not as visually attractive, though they are still decent\n-Some inconsistencies exist: our protagonist is a "good" cop, but there are plenty of oppurtunities that make him a bad cop. Also, The story leads you to feel like you are turning in to a gangster, and leaving behind your cop mindset, yet this is not correct, you are a cop through-and-through.\n-The girlfriend part of the game is stupid and pointless. They aren't necessary, and they feel out of place. The protagonist is supposedly good and perhaps even a practioner of chivalry, yet you have the option to be a "player" and date multiple girls. I did not participate in this portion of the game, as it's out-of-place and out-of-character.\n\nThis game is totally worth playing. It's not perfect by any means, and I wouldn't even compare it to GTA; it is a different playstyle, whereas GTA is a free-for-all satirical look at society, Sleeping Dogs is a cinematic take on Chinese gang-cop mentality, and it will really make you feel like you're in the mix of it.","November 30, 2014","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems that it is relatively underated, but it is definitely a must-play in my opinion.\n\nPros\n-Gorgeous visuals\n-Fully realized world\n-Very fun combat\n-Great voice acting\n-Compelling story\n\nCons\n-Vehicle handling could use some work\n-Vehicle models are not as visually attractive, though they are still decent\n-Some inconsistencies exist: our protagonist is a "good" cop, but there are plenty of oppurtunities that make him a bad cop. Also, The story leads you to feel like you are turning in to a gangster, and leaving behind your cop mindset, yet this is not correct, you are a cop through-and-through.\n-The girlfriend part of the game is stupid and pointless. They aren't necessary, and they feel out of place. The protagonist is supposedly good and perhaps even a practioner of chivalry, yet you have the option to be a "player" and date multiple girls. I did not participate in this portion of the game, as it's out-of-place and out-of-character.\n\nThis game is totally worth playing. It's not perfect by any means, and I wouldn't even compare it to GTA; it is a different playstyle, whereas GTA is a free-for-all satirical look at society, Sleeping Dogs is a cinematic take on Chinese gang-cop mentality, and it will really make you feel like you're in the mix of it.","November 30, 2014","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sleeping Dogs adds in this new fighting system that is great in every single way. The fighting is so fluid and natural that you have adrenaline pumping through your body, even though you aren't doing anything but playing a video game. Sleeping Dogs also has a great storyline (for the most part). The story is, you're an undercover cop in Hong Kong. You're mission was to infiltrate the local gangs in the Hong Kong area.

I can really tell playing it that the developers had fun making the game and clearly enjoy their jobs. The Hong Kong portrayed in the game is vibrant, diverse, and chock full of detail, wherever you look. I love the assortment of vehicles, and how each one feels a little different. Being a car guy in real life, I love being able to assemble a "dream garage" of every car in the game by purchasing from the different vendors around the city.\n\nThe hand-to-hand combat is solid, not quite as solid as say Arkham Asylum, but certainly satisfying enough. The gunplay is decent, the only thing that lets this part of the game down is absolutely any lack of an inventory system, so any guns you use must be found in the environment. Which is frustrating, given that the DLC packs add some pretty interesting weapons (the Deus Ex rifle, for one), but you rarely get to use them in missions.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent free-roaming adventure game that has a fair amount of replay value, and is strengthened by the fact the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Between the cars, combat, and the assortment of colorful characters, this is a game that has earned itself a place near and dear to my heart. Well done.","December 19, 2013","true","51.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was particularly impressed with the melee system; I'm not a fan of fighting games (can't remember all the combos) but found this to be both approachable and enjoyable.  Hong Kong has a fantastic vibe that gives it presence all it's own.  Driving has a wonderful feel of speed while still being controllable.  If you enjoy the GTA or Saints' Row series be sure to give this a shot.\n\nNote: The bulk of my SD play was on the X360 version; I enjoyed it so much I purchased the PC version.  PC features a hi-res texture pack and is (in my opinion) the definitive version best of the original versions.  See below.\n\nNote: The original version of SD is no longer available. The replacement is the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition. It includes all the DLC, upgraded graphics, upgraded crowds and roads, etc. The game now takes advantage of current hardware to add more people to crowds, more cars to the roads, etc. 50% off for owners of the current version.","October 1, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lots of hidden things and objectives like street racing, both cop and triad missions, as well as decent dlc. 86% approval.\n\nPros:\n-Voice Acting\nSolid Combat\nCons:\n-Driving controls/Mechanics could use tightening.

I just finished the story, and it was fantastic. I would compare the feeling I'm having right now to a roller coaster. The game was non-stop fun througout the whole game, and now I have this sudden calmness. The story was THAT great, but there was one thing I loved about it. It never bored me. I could go one mission to the next without wanting to do something else. In fact, I found the story so interesting that I have almost every secondary mission to do now that the game is over. The combat in this game is spectacular is almost exactly like Batman. The combos and way you learn them are almost identical to the game Bully however, which I noticed immediately. The driving is good for an open-world game, and smashing through everything that gets in your way is a blast. This game has been on my backlog for a while now and I highly regret it. This is the most fun I've had in a game in months.

Apparently everyone expected something that sucked, due to the game's storied past - it was originally a True Crime game? So when it went on sale I decided to pick it up for myself. You've probably played this game in one form or another, it's a GTA-alike sandbox game, only this time, it's heavily Chinese-influenced, set in Hong Kong. The setting is probably the best part of this game, it's both well-fleshed out and novel, and the game seems to sport more of a "living" environment than the sometimes sterile underpopulated cities of other GTAlikes. That said there are only a few mission types, and they tend to repeat themselves over and over. The game starts with a parkour chase-scene, and you do chase-scene after chase-scene, after chase-scene. You'll hate them by the end of the game. What is interesting is the game's combat- there are few guns, at least initially, and you dispatch most enemies with a well fleshed out kung-fu system. The story missions carry the plot, though without much pacing. It's a rags-to-riches criminal tale with a twist, you're an uncover cop, trying to move up in the mob. Things kind of meander along until it just suddenly ends- they could have easily cut the story in half. There's a ton of padding in the form of side missions, but those are nearly always more repetitive than refreshing. I'd place the game higher than the GTA-series, but it's not nearly as good as Saints Row. Pleased I picked it up on sale, if you're interested, you should too.","March 21, 2013","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although you play a cop and not just some vigilante going home or starting out a crime bid. Other than that it's pretty much Grand Theft Auto.\n\nYou run can around the City scape looking for Cars, Money Boxes, Red Envolopes, Statues, and occationally Call up some chicks so you can have dates with them.\n\nThe Main Weapon of this game is your Fists, there is no weapon cycling, you either have a weapon or you don't and chances are you will not have a weapon on you when an enemy pulls one out so you have to rely on your own disarming abilities to get the upper hand and thankfully the game gives you power ups to improve your abilities in hand to hand combat making fighting much easier and fun.\n\nAlso the Fighting mechanics are pretty much ripped straight off of The Arkham Games, so if you're pretty keen on that you're pretty much set with this game.\n\nOverall Sleeping Dogs is a great experience. I really like the atmosphere of this game and it gets really easy to get lost in this game just by driving around or walking around and just taking in the whole Chiniese experience.\n\nThis is worth a buy.","July 1, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/202170/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","A very good game.\n\nThe star of the game is obviously Hong-Kong itself. I have no idea if it bears any ressemblance to the real city, but Hong-Kong in Sleeping Dogs is a town bustling with life, with shops everywhere and citizens going about their business. It feels like an actual place where people live, rather than a succession of hotspots for a player to experience like you find in other sandbox games. For someone not native to an Asian culture, it's also a very attractive jump into a different culture.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's solid. The car handling is great, and it's a real pleasure to drive around the city, just for fun. The melee fight, though somewhat limited, is still satisfying, especially after you get a few upgrades that allow you to fight like you want. As for the gunfight, it's extremely fun, especially the action scenes when you're gunning down enemies while in a car. It feels like an HK-action film.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. The story is servicable, but not much more. It's somewhat disjointed here and there, and not believable at all. There are also a few things that lack polish, like the Car Valet system which fail you regularly for unknown reasons, or the taxi system, which use the same button as the car thief, making for some awkward mistakes. Theses are small things, but they do add up, and that's something you wouldn't find in Saint Rows III or GTA IV (even though i dislike that game). Finally, the game is too easy, with no way to customize the difficulty, which is somewhat sad for people looking for a challenge.\n\nOn the whole, the game provides a very nice experience, especially if you enjoy the Asian setting. But in the heavy weight category of open-city sandboxes, its few misteps make it falls down a notch compared to games like Arkham City (which has a much better melee combat), or Saint Rows III (which has more variety and polish). Still if you like the open-world genre, you will not regret buying Sleeping Dogs.","December 27, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You play as a undercover cop Wei Shen, who is tasked with infiltrating a ruthless Hong Kong crime syndicate. You will meet a wide range of memorable characters as you try to balance your loyalties between the triads and the police.\n\nGameplay is quite good. Similar to GTA, you have an open world to explore with a vast range of activities. The city of Hong Kong is split into three areas, which are basically smaller cities. There are main quests that are available and accessable at your free will, as well as side quests scattered around the city. Besides combat, there are other activities to partcipate in such as ♥♥♥♥ fight betting, street racing, brawling, buying food, clothing etc. Unlike GTA and Saints Row, weapons can't be purchased and need to be obtained from certain areas or fallen enemies. Although you are an undercover cop, you are free to shoot/ram civilians to your pleasure, but be prepared to face the Hong Kong law enforcement (which gets stronger and more persistsant as your crime spree increases, like GTA). There is also an upgrade system in place which allows you to gain new moves, more health etc through gaining experience from playing the game. You also have a health bar (that regenerates when in cover), which when depleted, will make you spawn at a hospital. Beside the usual guns such as pistols, shotguns etc melee combat plays a major role in the game. You can grab and throw enemies, smash enemies against walls, counter melee attacks and use elements of the environment (e.g. saw) to dispose of foes.  Gun play does play a role in this game with cover, slow time mechanics, although they aren't that spectacular. The main enemies you will be facing are gun guys, while others will be going at you melee style with fists, knives, bats etc. There are also a variety of vehicles available including cars, bikes, vans and boats (no flying vehicles though).\n\nAudio is great. Voice actors sound excellent and believeable. Background music does a great job at setting the asian atmosphere.\n\nGrapahics are quite decent as well. Thanks to the free 'High Resolution Texture' DLC, buildings and the overall environment looks beautiful. Although the main characters  also look good, regular NPC's don't look that great.\n\nIf you're tired of playing open world games set in America (ie. GTA and Saints Row), Sleeping Dogs is a breath of fresh air.","February 27, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dicenaries-tech/recommended/202170/","dicenaries-tech","-DINNYFORST-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dicenaries-tech/","302 products in account","Sleeping Dogs provides the player to be a part of undercover cop with strong and engrossing narrative set in open-world. Once again, it is always compared to GTA-like games, but Sleeping Dogs has proved itself to be high potential sandbox. The production is easily noticeable; plot, voice acting, and environment are simply amazing. The cities are highly detailed and full of NPCs walking around and perform their activities based on situation. If Kane and Lynch: Dog Days takes player to the darkest side of China, then Sleeping Dogs will bring player to richly-detailed and diverse environment in Hong Kong from the old slums and night market to the business districts.\n\nThe gameplay is another strong point. The main missions are pretty diverse and well connect to the storyline. The game offers you many types of mini-game like plant a bug, picklock, cracking safe which give you feeling of being undercover cop. Martial arts is easy to learn and achieve as you proceed through the game, you will unlock more fighting style to beat different types of enemy; knock, stun, combo, and environment kills give a very satisfied outcome and well entertained. The gunplay has simple mechanics; fire behind cover or slide on object to activate slow-motion (like a John Woo’s films). Both running chase scenes and driving are well-made for badass feeling like shooting tires to take down enemy vehicles or hijack vehicle and continue your road carnage. Moreover, the ramming mechanics during driving is simply useful as you can use it to lose the cops or even boost your speed in race. Sleeping Dogs also rewards player in every mission and collectables which keep on player engagement and provide meaningful collectable. However, the side mission is quite less creative and combat is quite sluggish. Still, there is a lot of detail and things to do even you complete the game.\n\nLastly, the radio music is memorable with old Chinese song and some are from famous singer. The mixture of voice between pure Cantonese and English dub create the feel of player’s presence and preserve what Hong Kong should be.\nSleeping Dogs is unique and diverse as I said. The developers care in most details and know what keep on player engagement. It gives me very great experience to be part of Hong Kong and triad life. I never regret for every buck I spend on this game. Like it or not, you have to taste once.","April 25, 2014","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For AMD users like myself, this game is a pleasue, runs so well it's unbelieveable. I run this game 100fps+ maxed and it does look very nice. Graphics are good enough, not much pop-in which is fantastic and people faces look quite nice.\n\nStory:\nStory is alright, it's not the best or the worst. Looking past some of it's major flaws and loop wholes, it serves it's purpose. I wouldn't buy this game for it's story alone though, you need to enjoy the mechanics aswell. Being a double agent puts a nice spin on things, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Lots of twists are predictable sadly, and slow turn of cop into bad guy is very generic.\n\nMechanics:\nHand to Hand combat is beautiful, it's so rare to find a game like this that focuses on close combat instead of guns. Really enjoyed it,  very smooth and the counter system is nice. Only problem is it's a little to easy, especially when you can kill everybody except bosses and grapplers by throwing them into a phonebooth.\n\nOverall:\nGood game, probably one of the best open world titles left that people haven't played. It's no GTA, but it's great to fill that gap while waiting for something else. Game is quite shoot, however, keep in mind I didn't do any sidemissions. I went straight through all the main missions.\n\nNice game, would definitely recommend on sale.\nRating: 7/10","August 28, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your task is going to be to infiltrate one of the Triad's factions and work with your HKPD colleagues. That's the main storyline\nIn itself this may not sound any new... BUT:\n- the game environment is simply stunning, you literally feel yourself in Hong Kong\n- the free running part of the game is also a great idea\n- beside the main storyline the game offers you tenth if not hundreds of hours of gameplay, not even counting the DLCs\n- the characters sometimes speak Cantonese (the local Hong Kong language) which adds a totally new layer to the in game feeling\n\nI am usually do not back to a title after I finished it but with Sleeping Dogs I literally ran through the main storyline just so that  I can now how it ends and can start a new game in which I can focus on everything else not the main storyline.\n\nThe only negative thing may be the stupig behavior of some vehicles (cars, motorbikes, boats) in the game...

Combos work with permutations of tap and hold.  A bit of lag and lack of knowledge about the frames can lead to frustrating defeat.  By the end, it was moot due to both my experience and the fact that my upgrades filled in erroneous button presses with new moves.  I went from dreading combat to enjoying it a lot.\n\nI even found the racing tolerable.  It's perhaps even enjoyable.  I avoid racing games and loathe racing segments in open world games so this was a pleasant surprise.  Granted, quick sessions and the ability to slam cars away helps. ;)\n\nDespite the quantity of DLC, the game could still use some polish and at times seems unfinished.  What can and can't be jumped over often feels arbitrary. The wayward GPS may add realism, but it's inconvenient.   Towards the end, there was an important conversation which got cut off near a waypoint and sent me into a rage as I witnessed umpteen YouTubers do the same. Earlier, there was even an optional mission with a conversation hinting at a prior, nonexistent event.\n\nHowever, I can look past all of that.\n\nThe main problem is built into the game design.  Missions are graded, and unlocked abilities are based on those scores.  While the missions can be replayed, their prior reward is subtracted from their new one so there's no way to grind.  For the Triad, you have to either do extremely well or buy some special DLC.  Adding RPG elements just to replace them with a feedback loop for arcade perfectionists doesn't sit well with me.\n\nI'm the kind of guy who likes to earn everything BEFORE finishing the story and then walk away with good memories of the credits rolling. Having already beaten the game and replayed missions to being just a fraction away from my final upgrade, I finally decided to just move on.\n\nFortunately, it was fun while it lasted.  I might pick up some DLC sometime when it goes on sale again.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the giveaway, GameHounds! =)  http://www.gamehounds.net/","August 25, 2013","true","78.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

God knows I was. This game literally has no dogs in it at all. It's got like wrinkly Chinese guys and stuff in it and they're all really violent. For the first 10 hours I was like "when the ♥♥♥♥ am I gonna meet the dog" and I was beating people up with the competent combat system and stuff but nothing came of it. It's a good game though, dogs or not. I think if Peter Molyneux made it, it would be better but that's true of all games really. Pick this game up for very cheap because it's pretty forgettable.

That's it really. It's GTA 4 mashed up with Hong Kong cinema. It's pretty glorious.\n\nThe combat in this game is really just a simplified Arkham Asylum, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good for a GTA clone, considering how wrong they always get it. You've got pretty simple X, X, X, hold X combos, with different amount of X's pre-hold giving you different sweet combos. You've got a grapple that you can follow up with arm-breaking, tossing them off a ledge, or just, you know, bashin' their face in. You have all sorts of sweet kicks. It's pretty martial-artsy of course but it's less trying to look cool (although it does) and more about no nonsense killing dudes with your body. Also you can grab people and throw them in dumpsters or impale them on meat hooks or smash them into a box full of broken glass (yeah I don't know why there are boxes full of broken glass everywhere.)\n\nThe driving feels good, but I can't remember how driving felt in GTA 4. It probably apes that as well so if you're one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who couldn't deal with that you'll probably hate it. But you can hang out of your car window and shoot out tires and ♥♥♥♥ and when you start shooting the game goes into slow motion so you can actually do it without crashing into a wall, which is cool. This is a pretty spergy thing, but I really like the freeway system in this game. It loops around the whole city with lots of nice on-ramps and exchanges everywhere and apparently I love that ♥♥♥♥ because I like just getting on the freeway and going fast.\n\nThis game has ♥♥♥♥loads of bullet-time. You punch a guy with your gun out? Aim your gun after and you get some bullet-time. Vault over your cover? Aim your gun and guess what? ♥♥♥♥in' bullet-time. Headshot 3 guys before you land, it's awesome.Oh yeah, and you can jump out of your car and onto another car and steal it in motion. That ♥♥♥♥ owns, so do that a bunch.\n\nThe story is ok, I guess. It's serviceable at least. You're an undercover cop in with the triads, and guess what, spoiler alert, you get too close to your gangster buddies and loyalties get conflicted. You're way too good at what you do and kill a billion people so you end up promoted to the top of the organization way too fast. You know, standard stuff. I am pretty curious how you end up getting off scot-free after how many people you've killed. The Hong Kong PD are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing corrupt, I guess. Well they are cops. ACAB\n\nOh, and if you're a sperglord like me, it puts all the collectibles on the minimap. Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god. For some reason they unlock after you bone down on the various women you encounter throughout the story. I think Wei ♥♥♥♥s just about every woman he encounters. So I guess that's cool, or troubling, maybe. I can't decide. I guess his karaoke powers and street fighting skillz are just enough to overlook the ridiculous clothing he's (probably) wearing.\n\nTime to wait for the DLC to go on sale.","June 23, 2013","true","41.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can really tell playing it that the developers had fun making the game and clearly enjoy their jobs. The Hong Kong portrayed in the game is vibrant, diverse, and chock full of detail, wherever you look. I love the assortment of vehicles, and how each one feels a little different. Being a car guy in real life, I love being able to assemble a "dream garage" of every car in the game by purchasing from the different vendors around the city.\n\nThe hand-to-hand combat is solid, not quite as solid as say Arkham Asylum, but certainly satisfying enough. The gunplay is decent, the only thing that lets this part of the game down is absolutely any lack of an inventory system, so any guns you use must be found in the environment. Which is frustrating, given that the DLC packs add some pretty interesting weapons (the Deus Ex rifle, for one), but you rarely get to use them in missions.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent free-roaming adventure game that has a fair amount of replay value, and is strengthened by the fact the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Between the cars, combat, and the assortment of colorful characters, this is a game that has earned itself a place near and dear to my heart. Well done.","December 19, 2013","true","51.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bet that doesn't happen every day.\n\nThis game is so much better than most of the Metacritic reviews would lead you to believe. Way better than GTA 4 overall. There are a lot of GTA elements in here, like the car jumps, but it is way different. I fianally got this game and have played non-stop for two days. The ablity to be a bad ♥♥♥ martial arts character and beat the fish balls off of bad guys is what puts it over the top. Nothing like this in GTA even comes close.\n\nAt first the controls and driving are a bit hard to figure out and get used too. Once you get a few hours into the game it will start to flow and become like an action movie. Reminds me so much of the 80's Hong Kong action movies . Almost perfect in that respect, where you feel like Chow Yun Fat in Triads: The Inside Story.\n\nIf you love open-world games like GTA and especially Saints Row 3, then you will love this game. My advice is to get the high-rez pack and the play through once without any of the extra DLC. You get a nice little starter boost with the Digital Edition so you should experience the game without anything else the first time.\n\nI just finished one play-through (all cops and triad missions and favors) so now I am going back and doing it all over with the DLCs included. This game is that good that I am completely addicted to it like I was when GTA San Andreas first hit.\n\nYou can easily rack up over 100 hours if you explore the whole city and do all the extra missions and find the collectables. I have seen a lot of people complain that there is only about 20 hours of play, but that is only if you rush through and just do the main story line.\n\nI would have to give this game 9.5 pork buns for my overall score. The only reason I don't give it a ten is the slight difficulty with the controls and interface.","June 15, 2014","true","94.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For AMD users like myself, this game is a pleasue, runs so well it's unbelieveable. I run this game 100fps+ maxed and it does look very nice. Graphics are good enough, not much pop-in which is fantastic and people faces look quite nice.\n\nStory:\nStory is alright, it's not the best or the worst. Looking past some of it's major flaws and loop wholes, it serves it's purpose. I wouldn't buy this game for it's story alone though, you need to enjoy the mechanics aswell. Being a double agent puts a nice spin on things, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Lots of twists are predictable sadly, and slow turn of cop into bad guy is very generic.\n\nMechanics:\nHand to Hand combat is beautiful, it's so rare to find a game like this that focuses on close combat instead of guns. Really enjoyed it,  very smooth and the counter system is nice. Only problem is it's a little to easy, especially when you can kill everybody except bosses and grapplers by throwing them into a phonebooth.\n\nOverall:\nGood game, probably one of the best open world titles left that people haven't played. It's no GTA, but it's great to fill that gap while waiting for something else. Game is quite shoot, however, keep in mind I didn't do any sidemissions. I went straight through all the main missions.\n\nNice game, would definitely recommend on sale.\nRating: 7/10","August 28, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honk Kong is great place for sandbox game, and map is quite damn large. Game is mostly based on melee combat, but you'll also have weapons later in game.

You can steal any car from street as you should, or you can pay taxidriver to take you where you want if you're too lazy to drive yourself, and then rob his car. Most cars are fast, and pretty easy to control. You can buy yourself cars, which will be added to garage.\n\nStoryline is about undercover cop, if someone did not know that, it is interesting, but nothing spectacular. Sound acting is in  English, and some Chinese phrases are part of it.\n\nGame has about 20 hours of gameplay, which also includes some of collectibles.\n\nI was interested in this game, and decided to buy it when it was on sale.\n\nI do not regret buying it, it is great game, one of my favorites in 2012.\n","May 2, 2013","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your goal is to take out the Hong Kong triad family called "The Sun On Yee". In the beginning of the game, Wei gets caught during a drug deal that back fired. Wei gets sent to jail, in jail he finds a childhood friend named Jackie, who works for the Son On Yee. Thanks to Jackie you're now part of Winston's group. Winston is a Son On Yee "red pole" (local leader) and a leader of the Water Street Gang. From that point on you must make your way up to the top of the triad family to take it down.\n\nGameplay: The game has an interesting focus on melee combat instead of the usual focus on gunplay. You will find yourself using your fist's more so than guns, because guns are relatively hard to get by in the streets of Hong Kong.\nThe combat of this game is not hard only because your combos consist of spamming one button and then the occasional hold of sed button to perform a special effect like: stun, knock down or just a heavy hit.\nThe gunplay (when you find a gun) is fun.The game has a well implemented cover mechanic. When youre behind cover you can blind fire or vault over your cover to slow down time and enter bullet time for a short period of time.\nBullet time in this game is nothing like the bullet time in Max Payne, every time you get a kill it extends the time you spend in bullet time. You can literally clean up a area in Hong Kong by just shoting the living hell out of every one while in bullet time!!!(WARNING: You still need to reload, bullet time or no bullet time clips still exist.)\nThere are two tipes of guns in this game: pistols and two handed guns. The difrence is that you can carry around a pistol, but you cant carry around any thing thats not a pistol, (Smg's, shotguns, rifles etc.) you will be forced to drop those guns when entering vehicles.\n\nThe game also has some RPG elements: every time you finish a mission you get "Cop points" and "Triad points", you can use sed points to upgrade Wei's damage and resistibility to bullets, and melee damage using the triad and cop skill trees. You get cop points for doing the mission as flawless as you can. You lose cop points for doing illegal stuff like property damage, murdering innocent people etc. You get triad points for killing triads, using combos, environmental kills, or just shanking them with a knife. :p(NOTE: Only after finishing a mission you will get sed points, killing innocent civilians is still ok as long as you kill them not during a mission.)\nThe driving is fun, it has that arcade feel of driving. While driving you can use the ram button (Yes a ram button. Problem?) to fight off enemies while driving, you can also enter bullet time if you have a pistol in your holster.\n\nThe game has parkour. Though it's used for some chaise scenes and sometimes its needed to get a collectible, and that's it, you don't really use it all that much....\n\nProblems: The game ads a lot of mechanics but it doesn't try to experiment or give those mechanics a better use. The parkour is used sometimes, stealth is there when the story needs stealth and the game has boats that are only used to get to the poker mini-game!!!!\n\nFinal thoughts: If you like GTA style games, but you want less gunplay, this game is right up your alley. The game is fun and filled with collectibles that reward you for collecting them, like giving you money or health upgrades. You will enjoy every minute spent in Hong Kong.","August 5, 2014","true","30.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd been on the fence regarding buying it since I'd heard a few detractors saying it wasn't as good as GTA.\nI love the GTA series, but this tops them. Why? Because not only the story is good, but also the fighting mechanic - GTA was never good at fighting, it was all about driving and shooting. Sleeping Dogs brings in the Arkham series' style of freeflow fighting (though not as good as the Arkham games, it's not far off) as well as cool things like being able to jump from one car to another to hijack vehicles, take hostages, have bullet time vault shootings and much more.\n\nThe game is 2 years old but still looks as good, if not better (at times), than Watch Dogs. It runs really well, too. I was able to run it at ultra settings the day it came out, even with the hi-res PC-only texture pack that was released. Nowadays, I can run it at 2880x1620 (and would expect to run it at 4k, if my monitor supported it).\n\nIf you've been disappointed by Watch Dogs, then give this a try - I personally find it's more fun than Watch Dogs, allows you to interact with the other people in the environment more and has a great fighting system. It doesn't have all the hacking stuff, and is more action-orientated than stealth based, but that's not always a bad thing in the open world genre.","May 28, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The first game was an underrated open-world game featuring a somewhat unlikeable protagonist. True Crime: Streets of L.A. boasted a realistically-mapped Los Angeles, a variety of side activities, a decent melee and shooting system, and a memorable soundtrack. The sequel, set in New York, fared even worse with critics and was known mostly for the presence of the artist then known as Snoop Dogg as a playable character. Because I was a fan of the first game, I’d been keeping tabs on the development of this title and was somewhat dismayed by the name change. Fortunately, Square Enix, having picked up the property from Activision, improved on almost every aspect of the original, making a terrific action game that plays like a John Woo film.\n\nThe player takes the role of Wei Shen, a young man who was raised in Hong Kong but whose family moved to America after the tragic death of a sister resulting from a drug overdose. Shen has returned to his birthplace and is recruited by the police superintendent for a deep cover assignment with the triads. Shen’s initial assignment is to collect evidence against the Sun On Yee lieutenant Winston Chu, but he soon finds himself embroiled in a nascent gang war that threatens the stability of the city. The story is interesting even if many of the beats are telegraphed well in advance (like a certain tragic occurrence that takes place near the end of the game) or are simply so obvious as to border on the cliche (it wouldn’t really be Hong Kong police story if Wei didn’t end up getting in over his head and defying his superiors in the police force).\n\nSleeping Dogs is primarily a martial arts combat game. The melee mechanics were heavily influenced by the Arkham games. You will usually face multiple opponents, enemy combatants signal impending attacks by flashing so that you have an opportunity to counter, and you can make use of combos to quickly take down large numbers of foes. By returning stolen statues to your former martial arts instructor, you will unlock new moves for Shen to use.\n\nThe game also incorporates two other upgrade systems: cop/triad experience and “face” experience. As you complete police missions, such as busting street racers that have turned to murder, and triad missions, such as intimidating shopkeepers into paying protection money, you gain cop and triad experience respectively. On most story missions, there is a chance to acquire both, depending on how you play (running over or shooting civilians hurts your cop rating and performing poorly in combat hurts your triad rating).  Completing “favor” missions gains you face experience, which unlocks performance boosts for Shen; these include things like increased duration of food and drink effects and increased durability when the face meter is filled in combat. Shen can purchase items like pork buns to give increased health regeneration and energy drinks to enhance his melee damage. Further bonuses accrue to Shen by the use of various articles of clothing that are either purchased as DLC or at in-game stores.\n\nIn addition to the story missions, Shen has access to a variety of side activities, including street races in cars and motorcycles, cockfights, mahjong poker, karaoke, and fight clubs. While the story races are deliberately not too challenging, the other in-game races can be very tricky. The cockfights and poker games seem to have somewhat random outcomes. Karaoke is amusing because it’s controlled by a Rock Band-like interface using the controller or keyboard and the vocal tracks are actually the Shen voice actor singing the songs in question. The fight clubs are pretty much what they sound like and are a great way to earn face experience.\n\nThere are a number of interesting mission DLCs available for Sleeping Dogs. “Wheels of Fury” has Shen safeguarding Dr. Tang’s new prototype DZS-90 supercar. After Shen has secured it across the DLC’s five missions–over the course of which it gains incredible abilities such as twin machine guns and a vehicle-stunning EMP device–he unlocks it for use in the main game. “The Zodiac Tournament” has Shen entering a suspicious martial arts tournament on an offshore island controlled by a madman. The setup and atmosphere deliberately invoke Bruce Lee’s Enter the Dragon, although the story ventures somewhat far afield from that film. The cutscenes alone are practically worth the price of admission for this one. Both of these packs integrate seamlessly into the main game.\n\nOn the cheapassgamer.com site, I’ve read that others feel that having mission DLCs outside of the main game and accessible directly from the main menu is a superior approach. I’m not convinced, especially after having played “Nightmare in North Point” and “Year of the Snake.” In the former, Shen must save one of his romantic conquests from an undead gangster known as Smiley Cat (for amusing reasons I won’t reveal here) and his army of restless souls. Most of Shen’s opponents in this DLC are jiang shi, a kind of hopping Chinese vampire, and yaoguai demons. The extended fights with jiang shi, especially the final encounter, have a certain artificial level of difficulty because the need to bodily toss the vampires into a gateway in order to seal it leaves Shen vulnerable to being grabbed and drained of his lifeforce (the vampires’ grip is preternaturally difficult to loosen, probably due to wonky controls more than anything else). In “Year of the Snake,” which is set after the main story, Shen has been busted down to a beat cop, and you have access to none of the unlocks and equipment that you gained during your playthrough of the main game. While the story is interesting enough on its own, the fact that you go from being a supercop to Joe Uniform in the blink of an eye tends to drain the experience of much of its color.\n\nThe latter two DLCs and the main story each have a number of collectibles to find and minigames to play. In addition to the statues previously mentioned, there are Buddhist shrines which give Shen a health boost, CCTV cameras (some of which are used in cop missions and some of which are just there) that must be hacked, and lockboxes containing clothing or money (some of which must be hacked and some of which can just be opened) that are usually guarded by hostile enemies. The hacking minigame involves guessing a four-digit sequence in six tries. The game provides you with clues by telling you when you have a digit that is correct and whether it is in the right location or not.\n\nThis is first and foremost, like the second game in the series, a console game. However the developer has created a fantastic PC port that controls very well by-and-large. However, the melee combat and most other aspects of the game control much more smoothly with some kind of gamepad and the shooting is (as one might expect) much easier with the precision of a mouse-and-keyboard setup. Fortunately, the game supports essentially on-the-fly switching between the two, making it easy to choose your control scheme of choice even for specific parts of individual missions.\n\nPretty much every aspect of the game is great, which is why the weak soundtrack is all the more disappointing. I’ve played a lot of these open-world action games and most of them have at least a few catchy tunes on the radio stations you listen to in vehicles while you’re driving around. Shen’s choice of stations is woefully limited and most of the music is neither memorable nor even very interesting. I actually found myself playing my own MP3s instead of listening to the game’s music during several play sessions. Nevertheless, if this is the worst aspect of your game, then you’re doing a hell of a lot of things right, and you should definitely wake this dog","April 30, 2014","true","57.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The short answer is yes.  The story is predictable but satisfying -- several characters that I expected to die, did -- with the exception of one.  The fact that the bugs result in ridiculous behaviour only makes the fact that the game plays itself straight all the more hilarious and adding to the entertainmnet value.\n\nCover-combat is nicely broken up with movie-style stunts, favouring bold, aggressive play that is movie-like, entertaining and rewarding both visually and tactically but is otherwise pretty standard.  The Free-Running is perhaps too down-to-earth considering the rest of the game isn't and while a nice attempt is probably one of the weaker game elements.  The fighting has some serious design flaws that really keep it from being as good as it could be; enemy classes weaken what could have been entertaining free-flow combat by giving them uninterruptable attacks or grapple immunity which bogs down the combat flow in a forced way.  The driving seems fine, but the catch-up logic is irritating as it only applies to the computer-controlled cars making racing rely more on luck than it should.  Said driving is not keyboard friendly.\n\nFinally, the bugs.  Oh the bugs.  Bugs were the first things I encountered because during the initial chase, the person I was supposed to follow quit running halfway through and in order to continue I had to dash ahead while the game nagged me that I was leaving him behind before he promptly teleported ahead.  Sometimes key events won't fire if you are genre-savvy and plan ahead.  NPC's will get stuck frequently and occasionally have amusing pathfinding difficulties.  One time the security camera wouldn't let me exit.  And the fact that many critical actions are crippled after completing a mission will mean occasionally thugs will steal your car trying to escape you because you couldn't do anything useful until the summary finished summarizing and you dismissed it.\n\nOverall  the mechanics work with the general feel, and while fans of GTA or Saints Row will probably prefer those games to this one, it's still fun and its own unique quirks made me feel it was a enjoyable romp.","January 24, 2014","true","63.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was pleasantly suprised. Sleeping Dogs offers an interesting storyline that explores the moral gaps between the archetypical 'good' and 'bad'. The inevitable climax was satisfying in its execution (pun intended) but left me with a terrible aftertaste from what happened. Ultimately, the pacing was good and the delivery often excellent, although characters didn't always get the chance to fully develop beyond what was required in order to act as a development 'tool' for the protagonist.\nIn regards to gameplay, i was very satisfied. Sleeping Dogs borrows many elements from other franchises. Free-running through the city had an AC-touch to it. Shootouts were heavily inspired by Max Payne and driving reminded me of NFS. Most of the gameplay revolving action (shooting, driving) felt fluent and leaned heavily towards an arcade style. Meaning fast and destructive action had precedence over 'realism'. This can sway some people away from the game, but in my opinion it is a proper design choice - it stands in nice contrast with the ever-looming shadow that is the GTA franchise.\n\nOverall, this game is quite good. The world is fleshed out with a lot of content; missions, jobs, favors, events, minigames; a lot of things are present to ensure that there is enough to do besides playing out the storyline which, because it's an open world crime game, felt relatively short clocking in at ~15 hours.","June 22, 2014","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With high resolution graphics the game just looks stunning.\n\nYou should get around 20 hours of gameplay if focus on main missions only, way more if you include side missions, challenges and collectibles (all optional content can be played even after you finish the game).\n\nClose combat is really fun, you can use punches, kicks, grapples, counters or even your surroundings to get rid of your enemies.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","December 8, 2013","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything about this game looks great by itself, and they also have an HD texture pack. Not to mention the game isn't to hard to run either. No complaints here!\n----------------------------------------\nSound: 9.75\nAll the music is in another language which is kind of lame, unless you are singing Karaoke. Sound effects and voice acting is spot on.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayability: 10\nSupports Controller and keyboard and does it well. Amazingly optimized for pc, looks good and runs great. no complaints here.\n----------------------------------------\nEntertainment: 10\nI found the game to be very entertaining and fun, and offers alot of fun missions to do (main and side).","March 30, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
