(English and Japanese)\n- Unique blend of real time and strategic gameplay.\n- Challenging.\n- Tons of management/upgrade options.\n\nCons- Matches can take a long time. (not necessarily a con)\n- Frustrating menu system.\n- Enemy turns are not skippable, or able to be sped up.\n- Some 'strategic' choices have to be made without the necessary information.\n- No mouse support in menus.\n\nReview :Valkyria Chronicles is a largely story based, turn based strategy game. The story itself is extremely enjoyable, with well written characters and a compelling world.\n\nThe story is set in the 1930s, in the continent of "Europa," with two super powers (The Imperial Alliance & The Atlantic Federation) who are at war with one another over a mineral called ''Ragnite'' which is used to power all technology in this world.\n\nThe Imperial Alliance makes the decision to invade the small neutral country of Gallia during this conflict, because Gallia has a lot of the Ragnite under its soil.\n\nDuring the story you will follow Welkins (protagonist), Isara (Welkins's sister) and Alicia.  All 3 were just normal people living in Gallia, but were conscripted to defend Gallia upon the Imperial's invasion.\n\nThe game features rich character development, or background information for both the main characters and for side characters. Every character has entries to read indicating their  backstory, strengths, weaknesses, people that they work well with, and more. This information helps to make each character feel more 'real,' and can give you a sense of connection to them, making things such as their deaths far more significant.\n\nThe army is made up of both soldiers by profession, and by militia. As a result, there are people of all ages, races, genders, social standing, etc which causes some interesting interactions.\nIn terms of gameplay, you control a relatively small squad in turn based strategy missions, somewhat comparable to XCOM Enemy Unknown. Each turn you get a limited number of 'command points' which you can use to move your units, make them attack, and a range of other things. When you use a command point on a unit, you take control of the unit and control them in real time. Enemies with a line of sight to your character will open fire if you are in range, you will need to aim and take your shots yourself, and so on. This makes the game feel like small segments of real-time action, limited by ammunition and by the number of command points you use. For a good rank at the end of a mission, you need to minimize the amount of commands that you use.\n\nThis game features permadeath, so any character of yours which dies remains dead forever. There are limited story central characters who you will be required to keep alive, but the rest are expendable.\n\nThe game starts off feeling rather easy, with limited options, but it opens up and increases in difficulty as you go.  This involves larger battles, more variety in your squad, leveling up unit types, researching upgrades for your army, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, and so on. This allows for you to learn new mechanics slowly as they're introduced, rather than being overwhelmed at the start of the game. Along with the interesting story and the character development, this results in you becoming quite addictive, with you constantly wanting to try out new things.\n\nAdditional information :\nThis game was originally released in 2008 on the Playstation 3, but on the PS3 it was locked at 30FPS  and 720P Resolution.\nThe PC version is a port, but was upgraded to 60FPS with HD resolution, remappable keybindings, adequate mouse and keyboard support, and anything else that you could need. An excellent port, which stands out amongst many sub-par ports in recent years.\nFor the price of €19.99 it is quite worthwhile, especially since SEGA bundled all the DLC in to the PC Version for free (2 extra stories to play, and a hardmode for the main story).\n\nDeveloper : SEGA\nPublisher : SEGA\nGenre : Singleplayer, Strategy, RPG\nWebsite : ''Look @ Sega Blog''\nReleased on Playstation in 2008\nReleased on Steam in 2014\n\nFollow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ This review is written for : The Panda's Corner\nAlways do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.\nThanks for reading!","January 2, 2015","true","171.0"," 1,210 of 1,304 people (93%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","93","210","1","39","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/294860/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, the best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n\nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention?\n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry look like the MP40 and the STG44, and plenty others), vehicles, and geopolitical conflicts. The character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”.\n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). With the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper) rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did).\n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (basically the weapon looks like an anti-tank rifle, sort of like the Soviet PTRS-41, that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks (if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts is the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them).\n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.","October 22, 2015","true","64.3"," 649 of 687 people (94%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","94","649","687","26","14"

This game is a must own.\n\nThey have included full 16:9 resolution support (up to at least 4k I believe), japanese voices and monitor refresh rate matching FPS. Unfortunately the videos are PS3 quality but that is a small complaint for an amazing game.\n\nThe story is based in an alternate history 1930's Europe where a mineral called ragnite is used to power vehicles and other items. You are members of the militia of the small, neutral country Gallia which is rich with ragnite and sandwiched between 2 superpowers. You are forced to defend and try to reclaim your country after one of these superpowers invades Gallia for its ragnite. The story is told through cell shaded cut scenes and missions and advances beyond this basic plot as time goes on.\n\nAt the start of each mission you pick and place your team on the map and then are provided with command points at the start of each turn which allow you to take direct control of your units. You then move them throughout the map to achive your mission.

Sega’s brilliant take on turn-based tactics is one of my favorite games of the genre, but beyond that I think it’s a very important game. It’s important because the story touches on some of the darkest moments in human history – moments no other game has dared to touch – and does so in an intelligent and sensitive manner. It’s important because of the innovative ways in which it manages to systemize its characterization and themes. It’s important because it marks the last time that Sega put in the care and effort needed to make something unequivocally excellent.\nFans of Japanese games have been let down time and again by PC releases, and when Sega announced that Valkyria Chronicles would be coming to steam we had every reason to expect a buggy, slapdash port. And that would have been a real shame, because with its sketchy watercolor aesthetic the PS3 version is one of the most enduringly beautiful games of the last generation. Fortunately, not only does the PC version of run at 60 frames per second in high definition with nary a hiccup, it also makes several significant enhancements to the original game’s effects. Even better, it condenses the PS3 version’s excruciating loading times to a fraction of a second.\nValkyria Chronicles has a very dense narrative, but to sum it up it’s a steampunk fantasy take on World War II set on the fictional continent of Europa. Europa is embroiled in a conflict between two superpowers – the Atlantic Federation and the Imperial Alliance – over a miraculous mineral fuel called Ragnite. The small, neutral principality of Gallia is invaded by the Empire for their rich deposits of this precious resource.  The Empire is also running a campaign of extermination against the Darcsens, a race of pale-skinned, dark-haired people who have become scapegoats for the bulk of Europa’s ills. They kill them indiscriminately and even – here we get to the part of the war that no other game talks about – toss them into concentration camps and work them to death. It’s a little ridiculous that an anime fantasy game is the only AAA title in history with something to say about the Holocaust, but to this game’s immense credit it speaks with the care and respect such a sensitive topic deserves. Furthermore, it covers all of its subject matter with that same care.\nIf Valkyria Chronicles can be said to have a single overarching theme, it’s that we are all human. The characters under your command, who together comprise Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia’s Third Regiment, are among the best-realized and most likeable characters in gaming history. Squad leader Welkin Gunther is a little socially awkward and obsessed with nature – a trait that sometimes gives him ingenious philosophical and strategic insights. Alicia Melchiott, his second-in-command, is steadfast, caring, and strong-willed. The way that her relationship with Welkin blossoms into romance over the course of the story is positively heartwarming.\nBut the game doesn’t let us forget that there are people on every side of the conflict. Early scenes in the game which depict the Empire rolling through Welkin’s idyllic home town are framed almost as propaganda, but as the story unfurls we see more and more humanity in the enemy forces, and more evil outside the Empire. When the Federation gets involved in the conflict it causes no end of trouble, and some of the more officious ranking officers in Gallia’s own military pose as much of a threat as the enemy generals.\nInstead of seeing this conflict as it happens, we view it through the eyes of historian Irene Koller in her book “On the Gallian Front,” which covers the war from Squad 7’s perspective. Interestingly, Irene’s writing is a little biased, and the game leaves you to wonder how reliable a narrator she really is. Not only is this book a solid framing device for the game’s narrative, it also serves as its interface.\nA good interface and good story wouldn’t matter if the game itself was not good, and Valkyria Chronicles is great. On a surface level the game has a lot in common with XCOM. You take command of a military unit comprised of different classes – scouts, engineers, shocktroopers, snipers, lancers, and one tank – and take responsibility for their training as well as their mission performance. On the battlefield success is all about making strategic use of cover and positioning soldiers for the best shot or an effective ambush.\nIn Valkyria Chronicles soldiers are always on “overwatch,” so they’ll automatically fire on any enemy that enters their range outside their own turn. If you’re smart you can set up ambushes on the enemy’s turn, taking soldiers down before they have a chance to attack and costing the computer an action in the process. Of course if you’re careless the same thing can happen to you. This dynamic makes each of your turns feel almost like an action game.\nAnyone who’s played XCOM knows how aggravating it can be to open fire on an alien with a 95% hit chance only to miss entirely. Valkyria Chronicles handles accuracy by putting a circle around your crosshairs representing margin of error, and on top of being more intuitive this creates a wider potential range for success and failure. Instead of assigning a binary hit/miss condition to an entire burst of gunfire, Valkyria calculates each shot individually, so even if you don’t hit enough times to take an enemy down you’ll probably take a chunk out of their health.\nPainstaking effort has gone into crafting every aspect of Valkyria Chronicles’ world. This comes across in obvious ways, like the pages upon pages of lore in the glossary that flesh out the setting’s ecology, cultures, and economy, but it also deeply informs the mission design. Every single level is full of little details that help to sell the reality of the world. This isn’t all that surprising considering that the same team created Skies of Arcadia but it’s appreciated nonetheless.\nActing and sound design are just as great as the music. More strict fans of JRPGs will be happy to know that the game includes both English and Japanese voices, but this is one of the few games where the option doesn’t feel needed.  The performances for every member of the cast – including all 49 unique, non plot-essential members of Squad 7 – are of the same caliber as you’d expect from the core cast of an Atlus game.  Sound effects always make it clear what’s going on and where it’s happening, even if you can’t see it.\nThe art style in Valkyria Chronicles isn’t just beautiful, it’s enduring. Valkyria Chronicles has aged remarkably well, and in a world where computer graphics advance every other month that’s quite an accomplishment. Another big contributing factor is the game’s animations, which are smooth and very well-crafted, conveying personality through subtle body-language and facial expressions while giving every object and character a correct sense of weight and presence in the world.\nIn its music, writing, art and acting ,Valkyria Chronicles is brimming with the emotional potency to bring a man to tears. It would make an excellent movie if that were all it had going for it, but the story is told in a way that could only work in a video game, and built on a rock-solid framework of deep and challenging tactical gameplay. Valkyria Chronicles is a timeless classic, and this exceptional PC port only manages to improve upon it.\n","July 29, 2015","true","255.9"," 394 of 423 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","394","423","11","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpsweg/recommended/294860/","purpsweg","rabbid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpsweg/","203 products in account","A port much deserved and actually kind of late which offers the player the ability to lead a squad into battle. If you've enjoyed squad based tactical games such as XCOM, The Fire Emblem Series, FF:Tactics and etc. you will no doubt enjoy this. It brings to the table a very interesting gimmick which allows the player to move their pawns in something called Action Mode. Action Mode puts the player in a third-person perspective control of the pawn allowing the to move them freely as if controlling a character in a third-person game. Despite this it still sticks to turn-based tactical game laws such as a limited amount of movement points and actions within a usage of a 'command Point'. You're offered these 'command points every turn and they can be saved up (there are also ways to get more from the beggining).\n\nThere are a large range of characters to add to your squad and it's a pretty large variety, not only in terms of classes but also specific personal traits that affects them on the battlefield(e.g. Pollen Allergy slowly decreases the HP of a character when standing on an are filled with plants; country born gives them more confidence when fighting in the country side; hatred of men discourages them when near male characters in your squad; and so many more). They may also all be equipped with various uniforms and their weapons can be upgraded (but all weapons of that type are upgraded at the same time). Armours adn uniforms too can be upgraded and your squad's tank may also be outfitted with new gear and upgrades. To take out needless hassle the game's level up system is class based. What I mean is that it levels up the entire class and all the characters of that class rather than you having to upgrade each and every one of them. This also means that you won't have to deal with new recruits being underleveled once you've progressed far into the story. To get extra money and experience points when you feel underleveled in the plot missions the game also offers you the option to do skirmishes. Skirmishes are missions that are not attached to the plot and can be done and repeated any time at a difficulty set by the player (soldiers that die in skirmishes will also be out forever just like in story missions so you might want to be careful).\n\nThe plot is definitely quite interesting and takes a lot of inspiration from our world's second world war, covering topics such as life during war time, desire for resources and even racism. I won't talk too much about the plot since I'm still going through it and it's usually more interesting to head in knowing as little as possible.\n\nI might return to this review and edit it later on once I've completed the game but from waht I've experienced so far I do not regret buying this at all and wish to see more titles like this be brought to the PC platform in the future.","November 12, 2014","true","26.7"," 203 of 211 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","203","211","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jay_cee/recommended/294860/","jay_cee","JC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jay_cee/","502 products in account","Valkyria Chronicles is a pseudo Turn Based Strategy game with real-time action while you move and attack with your units in third-person view. These units can be moved multiple times a turn by spending extra Command Points, but the efficacy of the movement a unit can do decreases each time until the following turn. Units are free to move after they fire, but will be receiving counter fire whilst their turn is active.\n\nAlthough similar to XCOM, it doesn't share the true "dice roll" for hits/misses; it does random bullet distribution range on the cross-hair reticule. This range gets smaller as your units are better trained or procure better equipment. Units can take advantage of flanking by attacking units' flanks or the environment. An example of this is destroying sandbags to prevent cover bonuses, leaving enemy units exposed.\n\nYou will carefully decide what units to recruit to suit your battles since all of your units are unique to their class type. There are five class types: Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Sniper. This is further refined by each unit having their own characteristics that define them from other units within the same class. Some units may not like being near the opposite sex or even prefer being the lone wolf; these nuances provide detriments or bonuses depending on these varying traits. Each class type gains experience through distribution of experience after battles and the entire class type levels up. Therefore, newly recruited units in the game will be of the same strength regardless of when you recruit them. Individual units are further enhanced by "Potentials" which are unique to each character. They may suddenly gain valor and take less damage from interception fire or even become a dead shot at critical moments. These quirks add to the individual characters and make you either love them or hate them.\n\nAfter your initial unit deployment, you can even bring in reinforcements should you need a specific class type you may not have deployed or retreat excess units if they aren't doing anything. Certain class types perform better against certain enemies. Another tool in your array is the use of "Orders" that can turn the tide in some battles or rescue a wounded unit. Orders are very useful, but aren't necessary to win any battles. Your squad units can be permanently killed should you not rescue them when they fall in battle. This game doesn't have auto-save but you are free to save in the middle of a battle and you can have multiple save files.\n\nThe game is moderately challenging and has extra bonuses to shoot for, like better grades or even procuring bonus weaponry. There are elite enemy units with unique names that when beaten can drop superior weaponry for you to loot and distribute to your favorite units. The story is very enjoyable and has light-hearted moments besides the usual despair and realities of war. For extra value, there are skirmishes and side-story missions for many characters you can take on at your leisure, not to mention the included DLC which adds more of these bonus story bits.","November 11, 2014","true","45.2"," 211 of 227 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","211","227","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/setlin/recommended/294860/","setlin","Setto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/setlin/","128 products in account","Summary\n\nIt maintains by having a lasting appeal with a diverse set of memorable and unique characters, a satisfyingly emotional and well thought out story with simple, yet strategic gameplay that offers freedom through various tactics. Despite all of this, there are certainly questionable flaws, yet they're completely smothered with the games overarching enjoyment and charm which ultimately pushes the game in a familiar but fresh direction.\n\nStory\n\nValkyria Chronicles takes place in a fantasy setting similar to Earth which introduces the story with two waging superpowers, the autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance and the loosely-united democracies of the Atlantic federation. This engagement is known as the EW2 or the Second Europan War. Both powers are reliant on a resource called Ragnite which fuels and controls both factions economies. Overtime, the Ragnite lessened and became more scarce causing the Empire to declare war against the Federation, sparking the EW2.\n\nIn the midst of all this, the neutral state of Gallia was invaded due to its unfortunate but overflowing of rich Ragnite deposits as the Empire came crashing down with its invigorated momentum. In the initial invasion of Bruhl, where we meet our notable and well-meaning hero, Welkin Gunther as he's forced to take up arms and put aside his interests as a teacher in order to survive alongside the towns captain, Alicia Melchiott. The two end up joining the militia and Welkin unwittingly becomes the leader of his now profound group, Squad 7.\n\nThe squads involvement through the story is told through cut scenes in episodes and chapters as you progress throughout a book. While it's effective and different, it has a disjointed narrative that emphasizes visuals throughout the book. Here, for someone who loves backstory and reading, you can learn about each distinct character you meet and their personal history through various tabs, a weapons and machinery tab as well as some background if you're curious about past and present missions. It's sophisticated and quite delicate but you will start to understand how the plot slowly unfolds and progresses through various chapters and cutscenes. There are also emotional and genuinely heartfelt moments within the game (no spoilers, of course) that made me realize I've come to adore and appreciate these particular characters.\n\nVisuals\n\nThe art has a watercolour painting style that suits with some crosshatching textures and smooth edges, it without a doubt ensures to look like no game you've seen before with outstanding quality as if it fits right with the theme and driven storyline. I believe you'll actually recognize and enjoy the beauty as you delve further into the game. The game so far runs very fluidly and can maintain a high frame rate no matter the occurance on screen. The pastel color palette is light and lucid, much of it looks gorgeous and in particular charming due to it's onomatopoeias that splatter your screen during combat and events such as lobbing a grenade, you'll probably see something like "Blam!" to go up acknowledging that your grenade has detonated. Little things like this makes the game much more action-packed, similar to comics.\n\nAudio\n\nGreat sound design with various sound effects, the brilliantly composed music and a well established soundtrack that impacts emotion and bringing an understanding, all fits into the theme of the game from storming the enemies fortifications, to enduring the loss of someone close or even having special moments and interactions with characters. It makes the world not only more lively but built upon by setting the tone, a place that you care about based on what's playing in the background.\n\nGameplay\n\nLike with other tactical role-playing games, Valkyria Chronicles has a similar but different formula and separates itself among many others that pigeon hold you with a much more demanding and limited playstyle of map grids and restrictive movement. As such, you start by deploying five of the different classes into the field, dependent on what the current objective is. For example, taking out a tank would be the Lancers job due to their resilient armor and slow but heavy firepower while the fragile Scouts tend to be your bread and butter as offense or defense since they have lot of versatility, both individually and in groups. Once you're deployed, an overhead map displays with all your troops (Command Mode), but the camera zooms into third-person control (Action Mode) for each individual unit you decide to move on. From here on out, once you're in third-person, you now have a gauge bar that determines how far you can move as well as one form of action, whether it be healing another ally, shooting an enemy or repairing your Edelweiss (your only tank).\n\nIt certainly retains much of the challenge of tradition of the genre while at the same time, expelling limitations we've come to know such as forced grinding and overpowered fights that you must complete otherwise there'll be a lack of progression. You're able to reuse character as many times as you'd like though movement will be hindered each time and ammo may also come in slowly if you're using Snipers and Lancers (prevent obvious exploiting). Some maps also bring fresh ideas hurled at you like sandstorms (reduced viewing distance) and searchlights (mortars land in the area once spotted), which leads to considerations, such as unit weaknesses and cover (you can hide behind sandbags). There's a variety of special character specific missions that require you to use the environment with various obstacles in your way such as trenches or scattered landmines.\n\nThe most forgiving part is it isn't difficult to get into because of how uncommon the user-friendly features are. You can save throughout battles as it helps immensely if you made a mistake like misplacing a shot or if someone unexpectedly gets killed, you still have within three turns to either reload a save or simply calling a medic. It's possible to lose anyone considering but it's best not to as each member of your squad has their own background and individuality that separates each one with different potentials, status bonuses depending on certain situations and abilities based on their character or personality which makes for a very diverse and interesting team of Squad 7. This is due mainly to spark some interest and drawing narrative into elevating and unique individuals.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIt's praised individuality and sense of similarity but different and fresh direction, the smart care and passion of the developers, make this as one of the most delightful and unique experiences. Despite its few flaws such as having questionable AI or crashing on an earlier mission (was forced to turn off steam overlay), it's more than enough to make it forgiving and looking past them. It's a fantastic game that has a lot of heart and shouldn't be passed up.","November 28, 2014","true","104.1"," 250 of 280 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","250","280","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/294860/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","I shall now proceed to write unbridled and unambiguous praise for this game.\n\nValkyria Chronicles is a triumph. It is a triumph in gameplay, style, presentation, sound design, narrative, character development, exposition and content. The game combines the illustrious production values of AAA titles with innovative gameplay quirks usually found in more obscure indie titles. Yet, it doesn’t compromise for even an inch. It delivers a style that uniquely its own and that might not appeal to everyone, but it sure has hell makes an exceptionally appealing case for itself.\n\nIf you’re a fan of turn based rpg tactics like Heroes of Might and Magic or Fire Emblem you will often find yourself in a minority crowd. It is a rather specific genre that many mainstream publishers don’t even want to look at it. Sega however took a bold stance and had Valkyria Chronicles developed and published. Not only is it a turn based rpg tactics game, it also breaks the mold on that genre to become a hybrid of turn based and real time. Part shooter, and part chess. The blend is so unique there is nothing quite like it outside of the series itself.\nYou control a small squad of soldiers. Each turn you’re given a number of action points. By selecting a soldier you expend the point and are given real time control of the unit. You can then move around the map. You only see enemy units on the map if any of your own units currently have a clear line of sight in that area, so you might run into unforeseen threats while exploring. When you’ve found your mark, you can hit the aim button and line up a shot. Your unit will empty a clip and then the enemy might retaliate, granted that you didn’t murder him in the first place. When moving, you deplete a movement gauge. When the gauge is empty your unit will be rooted to the ground and cannot move and you’ll be forced to expend an extra command point to move your unit. You’ll have to take range into account when moving. If you run out in enemy crossfire you’ll most likely lose your unit in the next turn. Additionally, units come in different shapes and sizes. Scouts are fast and nimble, but generally miss the firepower and endurance to break enemy entrenchments. Shocktroopers are the opposite of scouts. They tire much faster, but pack a serious wallop and can take one too. Lancers specialise in destroying enemy armour units, and the engineers provide support to your own tanks and troops. The sniper unit does what it says on the tin; it takes out single units with pinpoint accuracy.\nHowever, your units are all unique, each soldier is a character with its own traits and abilities. You develop their talents by letting them perform in the line of duty, and by training them by expending experience points. You also have to equip them with new and better gear. You’re always busy with maintaining your army, be it out in the field or back at base; a commander’s duty never ends.\nThe missions are also very well executed. Most maps feature a unique obstacle that needs to be overcome. This keeps the gameplay fresh as you make your way through the enemy ranks. You’ll fight in the desert, the streets, beaches, forests, canyons and in fortresses. The variety is excellent and you’ll quickly learn to adapt you tactics and squad accordingly.\n\nSpeaking of the commander, the game’s story focusses on Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and his squad of militia men and women. The small nation of Gallia is caught amidst a continent wide conflict as the eastern Europan Empire invades and begins to violently subjugate the nation. Welkin and his fellow countrymen are drafted into service to repel the invaders. At the same time they discover important clues about the country’s history and its former rulers: The Valkyria; near mythical people with incredible powers.\nThe setting draws parallels with our own Second World War. Complete with ethnic scourges and totalitarian ideologies. Furthermore, the game takes its time to give you exposition. Many of the secondary characters get room to develop alongside the main man and lady. Most stages are bookended, with intro cut scenes beforehand, and an outro afterward. All cut scenes are fully voiced by an anime competent cast, so they’re familiar with the style of material and do an excellent job at conveying the moments the best they can. Even when the natively Japanese expositional style doesn’t exactly suit the moment. I’ve never found a need to switch the voices to Japanese. This is one of the key points where Valkyria Chronicles scores. Its approach to its narrative is not like a Hollywood movie like Saving Private Ryan, but more like a TV series, like The Pacific. It takes its time and lets you experience it at your own pace.\n\nThe entire game is presented in the form of a journal. Ever chapter takes place on a set of pages, where every ‘photo’ represents a cut scene, and every map equals a stage. You can flip through the journal’s tabs to find the entries on each separate character and other glossary entries. It’s a great way of presenting the story and its lore and mythos. You’re free to explore, or never even look at it.\nThe book is a neat way of presenting the game, but the real captivator are the graphics. The characters and environments are fashioned in an extremely stylish and gorgeous watercolour and pencil sketch manner. Not only does it suit its anime tone, it also stands the test of time. Even now, seven after its PS3 release, the graphics hold up and will probably hold up for a long time coming.\nAccompanied with the visual package comes a very smart and elegant sound design. Every sort of bullet impact has a distinct noise, so you know when your unit is in direct danger, even if you can’t see the origin of the gunfire. The music is a romantic, tense and sweeping score that really underscores the game’s every moment. From the tense high stakes cover shootouts, to the emotional and heart wrenching moments, that despite of all your tactical prowess, will inevitably befall you.\nThese moments are where game is at its strongest; and where the art, gameplay and sound work together in a perfectly orchestrated and coordinated union that not just elevates the game at hand, but the medium as a whole. Valkyria Chronicles seizes the player for a unique experience that will change the way RPG tactics, narratives and presentation are perceived in video games\n","November 19, 2015","true","33.9"," 195 of 217 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","195","217","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/admiraldan/recommended/294860/","admiraldan","DarthDan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/admiraldan/","495 products in account","To start off, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game! It's good to see Sega starting to take an interest in putting some of their former console exclusives on Steam.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThe game takes place in a fantasy version of World War 2 Europe. This is a pretty interesting setting, and one I think is vastly underused in RPGs in general. A brief synopsis is that a small neutral country called Gallia is invaded by The Empire (read: fantasy Germany) during the Empire's war with the Federation, and the game follows the experiences of a junior Gallian officer and his squad as they fight to ensure their country's freedom. Overall, the various characters are written in a way that is relatable and engaging, and the game avoids relying too much on stereotypical Anime character tropes. I particularly like the way the game handles the villains. The game takes the time to portray characters from the Empire- both leaders and common soldiers- as humans, with their own motiviations, flaws, and even some redeeming qualities, and it manages to do so without whitewashing the villainous acts they do.\n\nThis nuance in character portrayal is very important, as the game does not shy away from some of the awful stuff that happened in the real war. The game portrays both the pervasive racism and bigotry that characterized the countries involved in WW2, and it even touches on concentration camps and racial cleansing. The game mostly handles these topics with the amount of gravity and seriousness they deserve, and only rarely seems melodramatic or clumsy. However, the decision to cast the Japanese-looking 'Darcsen' as the game's stand-ins for the oppressed minorities of World War 2 Europe does have a few unfortunate implications vis-a-vis the victim complex that a certain real-world segment of Japanese society has about WW2. Overall, though, I'm still glad the game had the courage to address some of the more uncomfortable aspects of war, and I think its successes in this regard outweigh its failings.\n\nNow, this IS still a JRPG, and some elements of the story and setting will seem hilariously out of place to you if you're not intimate with the genre. For starters, the magic rocks that power all Europan technology should clue you in that the game doesn't stick particularly close to history. The first half of the game mostly presents combat in a believable manner, but later story missions can't help but start to throw in some over-the-top Anime style bosses, and the introduction of a certain techno-magic later in the game's story might stretch suspension of disbelief for some.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe game is basically broken up into two different types of play: 'book mode' and battles. In book mode, the player basically just watches cutscenes that advance the story; each scene is fairly short, about 2-4 minutes, and there are about 10-12 scenes per chapter in the game. Each scene is self contained, and there is a mostly linear progression through the scenes, where you have to watch each scene to unlock the next one.\n\nAt least once per chapter, you will unlock a battle that must be completed sucessfully to advance the story. Each battle is basically a set-piece engagement where you deploy your units at a starting point on a map, and then take turns with the enemy until you meet your objectives (or lose, I guess, but the game isn't that hard in most cases). Each story mission can only be played once, but you will periodically unlock skirmish battles that can be played any number of times to farm experience and cash. Combat is basically like a turn-based strategy RPG, but there are a few major differences from other tactical JRPGs you may have played.\n\nFirst off, unlike most other RPGs where each unit you control gets to take one action per player turn, instead you get a set amount of "command points" every player turn, which you can then distribute to your units at will, to take actions, give buffs (called 'orders'), or call reinforcements. One 'action' consists of both a move and a shoot- the shoot can be taken at any time during movement. This is all fairly straightforward except for one major caveat: you can give more than one action to a given unit per turn! In fact, if you want, you can give ALL your action points to a single unit to move/shoot a whole bunch of times. Getting A-ranks on missions often requires pooling most of your actions on just a few units, to quickly penetrate deep behind enemy lines and achieve objectives.\n\nThis approach to combat is more realistic than average for JRPGs, but still, don't expect it to feel at all like a gritty war simulator like the Company of Heroes games. Cover matters- enemies will take potshots at you if you run around within their range, and enemies can't shoot you if you're behind a wall or a friendly tank (or even an enemy tank). Controlling your own tank feels suitably tanky- big, powerful, and slow as hell.  Actually shooting feels a little simplistic though. Basically, you take aim, then your unit empties their clip at your aimpoint, and then the guy you shot (if you hit him, and if he's still alive) gets a chance to return fire. Headshots are important, at least.\n\nSecondly, while it's definitely an RPG and not a straight turn-based tactical game, the RPG elements take a backseat to the tactical ones. Levelling up your characters gives you some nice bonuses- it unlocks some secondary weapons and orders, character bonuses called 'potentials', and gives small increases to HP- but you can easily complete the game without any of the optional stuff, and the exp you earn in story missions will be sufficient to beat the game without grinding skirmish battles.\n\nTECHNICAL:\n\nThis is a very good port. Keyboard controls can be remapped, the game can scale the in-battle/menu graphics to any resolution, and framerate is NOT locked. Unfortunately though, some of the cutscenes are prerendered at the 720p resolution of the PS3, and these cutscenes take up a lot of disk space- the game is a 20 GB install. The game is mostly alt+tab friendly, except when in combat- I sometimes have to start Task Manager to take focus away from the game then. The game is stable, but it sometimes doesn't shut down cleanly. I've never lost any save data that way, but it's a little annoying.\n\nThe artstyle is obviously very anime-eqsue, it's presented in a sort of washed-out cellshaded style. Maybe not everyone's favorite style, but at least it's unique and visually distinctive. I personally like it a lot! Also, the voiceacting is generally good. The Japanese voice actors are great, as are the English voiceactors for all the main characters. Some of the secondary characters can sound like they just phoned it in, though.\n\nOVERALL: 8/10\n\nPROS:\n-Compelling and under-used setting for a JRPG\n-Interesting story\n-Good voiceacting\n-Fun combat\n-No grind necessary!\n-Just as much challenge as you want- completing the game isn't hard, getting all A-ranks is!\n-Great port- runs smoothly\n\nCONS:\n-Large install\n-Some cutscenes are only 720p\n-Some anime/jrpg cliches are present","November 15, 2014","true","52.2"," 138 of 144 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","138","144","0","0"

Silky smooth sixty frames per second, good keyboard and mouse control, and you can even run it at 4k resolution, it even has Japanese audio included if you don't want to subject yourself to the phoned in English voice cast. Very encouraging. With all the DLC included for only twenty dollars it's a good deal for anyone who was interested in the title but didn't want to invest in the PS3 edition of the game.\n\nThat said, the small problems from the console version are present here. Cutscenes are imported directly and stick at 720p and cannot be altered, so expect jaggies for that. Also cutscenes must be manually selected for some reason, instead of playing one longer scene you will watch three smaller scenes divided equally, bit confusing and unnecessary. Upgrading is mostly a linear path, but does let you enjoy a few small, effective combinations (such as some weapons causing status effects, aiming/handling better and enjoying more firepower). Your giant tank enjoys standard upgrades as well as a seperate 9x9 grid system (small upgrades are 1x1, medium are 2x1, etc). The emphasis on turn systems means you will be rushing every mission to nab XP bonuses, making most missions a simple cut and run affair. Also a minor irritation but there is no auto-save feature, meaning if you forget to save and then lose a battle you'd better hoped you're not in for a few hours of redos.\n\nGameplay is still very engaging and strategic with dozens of playable characters (each with their own likes/dislikes and advantages/quirks) to allow you a large range of freedom about who you want in your team and with how you want to enjoy the game. That said, enemies will never, ever stop shooting you when a character is selected. They are relentless. Meaning as soon as you pick a character in the heat of combat you will probably shatter your keyboard/controller to get to that aim key. (Which makes them all stop shooting you amusingly enough). If a character is downed and then touched by an enemy, that's it, they're gone forever. So plan accordingly! The Tank you command also does not mesh well with keyboard+mouse controls on inclines, causing your tank to spin or fidget in place and waste it's movement.\n\nPlot is typical anime-fare but you shouldn't really let that prevent you from enjoying the slick combat and tactical emphasis. It does lead to some hokey and typical 'trope' moments but it's not groan-inducing or irritating. Our protagonist is relateable and most of his team (even the smaller members) have personalities thanks to the personnel tab. Some cutscenes can go on a little much, and expect to hear about how war is a bad thing (Well it is) while a bizarre little 'flying pig' irritates you with it's strangely human oinking.\n\nGreat game, very well done port. Thumbs up. See you on the battlefield.","November 11, 2014","true","49.5"," 172 of 189 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","172","189","0","8"

That said it is a very nice story about a squad during a war and how they helped to stop it.\nThe battles play out with unit selection and picking where to start them from predesignated spots.  There are several different unit types each with different stats,weapons, and skills.  The game can be very difficult when you are just starting out and trying to figure out what each class can do and when to use them but after a few hours and lots of trial and error this becomes less of an issue.  During my first few hours I found a lot of the combat very frustrating, although after that I began to really enjoy it.  After a battle you earn money and xp which you can spend on training your troops and upgrading weapons and your tank.  I ended up having to grind a bit on the skrimishes but I think that was mostly my issue of just being bad.\nWhile the gameplay is solid the story is what really sells the game.  As it progresses the characters are fleshed out really well, especially if you watch the optional stuff.  If you want to learn even more about any individual character other than what the cutscenes show every usable character has a page long back story.\nThe graphics are unique, cell shading with anime characters, and its pretty pleasant on the eyes.  This game is a solid pc port akin to a story focused xcom.  If you can handle the frustration of some of the more difficult missions and not mind the seemingly large gaps of dialogue and cutscene between action I would recommend you take a look at this.\n\nEdit: This is super embarrassing, I recieved a review copy of this game, I disclosed it on my curator page but forgot to here.

It was a console exclusive game on the PS3 for ages despite having critical acclaim at the time it releases until Sega in their faint moment of genius decided to port this game finally to the PC. And it is glorious.\n\nValkyria Chronicles is a deceptive anime-style  game that boast cute and cherry characters despite the underlying tone being that of the horrors of war and it shows heavily in its many cutscenes.\n\nAs a game it is a turn based action game where you command your squad each turn using limited number of command point to sally forth and destroy the enemy.

Port Report	Verdict: Good.\n60 FPS On All Situation.\n\nControls are a bit awkward if you happen to use the keyboard as your primary controller since this is an ex console exclusive game with many of the command scattered throughout the keyboard and having limited mouse support. But it does run and look well enough so I can't complain about that.\n\nGood news for japanese voice fans, you can toggle between english voice and japanese voice in the menu. Have fun with that.	 Graphics	The Graphics in Valkyria Chronicles is a watercolour artstyle utilizing the game unique CANVAS technology that transform everything from scenery to people into paint work of art. Bloody hell even the edge of your screen is white and it might look  off putting and weird to some people but for what it is worth it is incredible art that is unique.\n\nOh I sound also mention any SFX sound gets visualized in comic style which is a good point for me	 Sound 	For sound well consider that this is a game set in a fictionalize WW2 therefor expect a lot of patriotic music. That said the SFX is pretty good. Character dialog is clear and presented cleanly. No complains here other than the bloody radio chatter while in mission can be awfully annoying to the point you tune yourself out of it. 	 Gameplay 	Here is where Valkyria Chronicles has it's greatest strength and weakness.\n\nTo start off you have limited command points that you can supplement by putting command unit on the field but for most part it usually isn't enough to move your whole squad in 1 turn.\n\nYou can use those command points to command a single troop who have an ap meter indicating how far they can go and once it is finish you either have to wait for the next turn or use another command point to use the unit again but with reduced AP. It's best to get your unit in cover and switch out to other.\n\nWhile you could theoratically use all the command point in the turn for 1 unit it's usually best to just switch since some units have limited ammo per turn and item like grenades won't replenish till the end of the turn.\n\nNext aiming stops enemies action like giving interception fire to you which is usually deadly if 3-4 of his mates decides to tag along and fire with him but good news is you can do the same! And your units have these things called potential which may be good or bad thing which can trigger if the conditions are met on the field. They are limited by line of side however so putting that stormtrooper right beside an alleyway exit can usually result in dead 3-4 goons if they are stupid. [It happens sometimes]\n\nFor missions you have a wide variety if objective across missions and they often come with something new in the map. Skirmish mode on the other hand is plain old simple kill all enemies or capture their flag to win the battle.\n\nAs for unit type you have the standard RPG trope of scout, sniper, tank-buster, and assault classes which you can upgrade their potential with EXP and new gear with money earn from finishing battle. You can also use EXP point to get orders which are basically in-mission buff that at the cost of command point allows you to withdraw unit, heal and other stuff like increasing their damage and so on.\n\nAs for the broken part. Well.  Basically you can use scout to win in every single skirmish or mission mode, by utilizing their huge reserve of AP and orders that increases their defensive ability you can literally sprint through the enemy and lob a single grenade to push any enemies out of the capture zone of the enemy base and capturing it. That's it, simple and broken since the missions often rely on how fast you are for S rank.\nConclusion\nA pretty badass of a japanese anime style game with unique artstyle that sadly got sidelined because it was released on the PS3 and thus became a cult favourite but not an instant classic but now that it is on steam you have no reason to not get this Gem anymore. I implore you to buy it.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","June 21, 2015","true","19.0"," 186 of 217 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","186","217","13","3"

I've fully completed the game and its DLC on console, and can't wait to do so again on PC.\n\nIn terms of genre, Valkyria Chronicles offers a unique combination of turn-based strategy, RPG-like character progression and equipment upgrades, and third person movement in battles. Since apparently that - quite impressive in its own right - wasn't enough for Sega, it also comes with a unique stroke-based art style and rendering engine, and an interesting alternative universe WW1-like setting. Topping it all off is a great and memorable soundtrack and selectable dual audio voice acting.\n\nThe PC port is solid, with the only major issue being the pre-rendered cutscene videos, which are stuck at PS3 quality. The game performs really well even on modest systems, and scales up beautifully to high resolutions on more powerful ones.\n\nAnyone at all interested in turn-based strategy games would do well to check out this title, particularly its very fair price on Steam considering the size of the game and the inclusion of all DLC.","November 11, 2014","true","62.2"," 105 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","105","110","0","2"

It has a few flaws, but they're not that bad.\n\nAs stated on the store page, it already includes all the DLC of the PlayStation 3-Version for free, uses the Steam Cloud for your saves, has Achievements and includes Trading Cards. You can play the game in 16:9 Full HD and 60fps, using either a controller or Keyboard/Mouse. Although you can only navigate the menus using the Keyboard, you can use the Mouse on the Battlefield when controlling a character, which makes it quite comfortable to aim or look around.\n\nSure, the game has its flaws, but the story is wonderful and full of emotions, there are so many characters with their own personality, there's tons of interesting background information, it has nice graphics, a cinematic soundtrack and the gameplay is just a lot of fun. If you're a fan of Strategy-RPGs or wanted the game when it was out on PS3 and did not have the possiblity to play it, you shouldn't miss this game now.\n\nBy the way, you should really play this game with japanese dub. You can change the voice from english to japanese in the Settings on the Title Screen. The japanese dub just has so much more emotion and improves your experience of the story A LOT.\n\n(In-depth review in german is available on my website.)","November 11, 2014","true","81.2"," 100 of 112 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","100","112","0","7"

It felt like a mix of XCOM EU and The Bureau: XCOM Declassified but this game was made 4 years before them, I’m very impressed (with anime storyline and artsyle). I will make this review simple and just put up the pros and cons of it\nPros:\nIt scrapped the grid by grid system from most similar turn based strategy game and it actually felt great, you have the freedom to move the character anywhere you want\nA really good port, no doubt. It runs great and the controls for mouse and keyboard is good\nBattles are always challenging and you need to change your tactic to every battle and adapt with the enemies\nThe orders system can help you a lot in a battle\nInteresting characters (If you’re bothered to read the character glossary but the main characters are interesting enough without reading them imo)\nCons:\nSometimes the menu felt clunky, for example you can’t change your character equipment in the middle of briefing before battle and you have to exit the briefing and go to headquarters, only then you can change your characters equipment. It’s gets a little bit annoying sometimes\nSometimes there’s like an invisible wall on someplace even though your sniper clearly have a line of sight on the enemy but thankfully it’s compensated with the crosshair which turns red only when you have nothing blocking you\nNew game+ for the main storyline lacks challenge since they don’t change the enemy difficulty so that you can just plough through the mission in like a single turn until somewhere above chapter 10 but it’s compensated with hard and expert skirmishes so I guess it’s alright\nCrashes randomly at some point (it’s rare but it does happens)\nCover systems feels lacking, you can only get into cover on sandbags and trenches\nIt’s amazing that this game was made 6 years ago, the gameplay doesn’t feel dated at all. This game is probably one of the hidden gems of the PS3 era. I weren't a fan of the series but definitely I am now, hope to see the sequels get a proper port on PC as well","January 5, 2015","true","54.5"," 87 of 94 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","87","94","3","3"

I actually love it more than XCOM: EU or EW and I really love those games. The game is pretty straight forward from a turn based perspective game.   However, unlike XCOM for example, you level up classes rather than particular characters. Meaning the recruits you get will all be the same strength in terms of firepower and action points and the like. However, different recruits have differen't characteristics. This ranges from being racist and not wanting to be near certain members, or allergies, pretty much every possible pro or con you think would actually influence people's actions.  They all have their friends, and will commonly fight harder to protect those friends. Some of them are panicky, and not everyone has the same amount of health despite being the same class and having the same upgrades. Unlike XCOM where you have to individually give equipment to each squad member, in this it becomes the general issue equipment for each class. So you'll only have to focus on the personalities and characteristics of the characters, and not what their equipment is. The story is extremely good and episodic based, LOTS of cutscenes if you like that, but the combat is rewarding and enjoyable.\n\nThe true endearing factor of Valkyria Chronicles is the diversity of characters. Having a character who hates the enemy and is sadistic and gets excited to end their lives for example. Ditzy valley guys or girls who get distracted because they're so chatty in combat. Each character feels unique, you're not leading professional soldiers, you're leading civilians who have to begin to face the horrors of war. These are militiamen, and they begin to evolve into true soldiers as time goes on. Once a pacifist, now a hardened veteran and able soldier.  It feels like you're honestly leading characters with personalities, rather than some copy and pasted hard-♥♥♥ grunt who's vast lexicon of responses is "Roger, Engaging, and Moving" Whilst I feel those hard soldier types seen in XCOM and other military games are fine. I do have to say I prefer to see human aspects to an otherwise cold hearted soldier type.\n\nThe game is undeniably human, much like the Metal Gear series, it has a very anti-war sentiment to it. Trying to drive home the geo-political intricacies of racism, history, and human emotions. It's a war story with an anime aesthetic, there's quite a few times where I get hit by the feel train.\n\nHowever, they still managed to fit a pig with wings in here.

Incredibly fun, and absolutely charming.\n\nI'd heard XCom's Julian Gollop had sung this game's praises back in 2010, saying that Valkyria's system was almost exactly what he had in mind for his never-released Dreamland Chronicles. Valkyria's combat definitely feels like a big step forward from the XCom back-and-forth, adding an element of intensity and immediacy to the short burts of action that take place during each movement you choose. The moment you make your move, you take command of that unit and execute the move in real time. Enemy units cannot move or attack until it is their turn, but they can REact, laying down bursts of fire if you draw within range. It goes a long way toward bridging the gap between action and strategy you tend to get in turn-based titles.\n\nThe plot is better than I expected, but it's nothing particularly interesting. I was a little interested in the Darcsen storyline, as it was implied they actually caused an ancient disaster which spurred generations of racism, so that was a pretty good element. I also found myself more interested in the political landscape of WORLD WAR ANIME than I thought I'd be.\n\nThe characters are the real endearing element here - everyone has wildly different personalities, touched with weird and charming quirks that manifest into battle. The close-range shocktrooper Jane gets an anti-personnel "sadism" buff if she kills enough nazis, but runs into a defense-lowering debuff if she walks on a paved road (since she USED to be a nature-loving pacifist). Others have wildly bizarre powers, like an unmotivated engineer whose gun randomly jams because she's too lazy to clean it, or a ditzy valley girl who loses accuracy due to gabbing with nearby soldiers. You find yourself choosing soldiers that have glaring tactical problems, just because you like their personalities so much. For the most part, however, buffs and debuffs are pretty well balanced.\n\nIt adds a ton of much-needed flavor to a section of turn-based strategy that is usually very calculated and bland. Very fun.\n\nI haven't been this taken with a title for a very long time. Very much recommended, and hopefully we'll see Sega release another proper sequel.","December 6, 2014","true","56.6"," 86 of 96 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","86","96","0","0"

Not only it's a weird genre mix making it very hard to describe, but also there are many strong and weak points worth discussing in both gameplay and story.\n\nStory excels at world building. Japan-style, Not-Europa at not-World War II is a interesting, compelling setting on it's own. There is also ton of flavor text, both written and voice acted, going miles to give, for example, a characterization of every soldier you can command in the game, with quirky personalities included. World is very inviting. That said the core plot has some very noticeable problems. One: it tries to tell a war-themed story in probably most non-violent way possible, implementing massive amount of well-known anime clichés, where Spec Ops: The Line simply eviscerated and deconstructed this genre to the bare-bones. It leaves the game without cohesive message and consequence, making it hard to take serious. Add pretty long cutscenes to the mix and you will receive something that not everyone can stomach. I ultimately liked it, but everybody wanting a serious story or having an anime allergy, take caution.\n\nGameplay is a weird mix of strategy game, RPG and third-person shooter. I would compare it to Worms, Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system and Supergiant Games’ Transistor. Many others  also use X-Com as a reference. The gameplay may have some "first-installment-oddities" like: unbalanced classes, clueless buff/debuff system, slow leveling requiring additional skirmish battles (just to keep on par with the enemies), annoying randomness and unexplained mechanics... BUT at the end it's real, genuine fun and battles feel like chess matches. Tanks are awesome, sniping enemies from distance is awesome and owning the AI in pretty hard battles is awesome too. It's a solid gameplay worth your interest if the description feels compelling for you.\n\nMusic? Top notch! Japanese people certainly know how to make symphonic music. I also cannot say a bad thing about graphics that have their own charming style. This cell-shading will not age quickly. I also commend a good PC port, free DLC, New Game+ mode and good content/price ratio (even with long cutscenes, 32 hours for one playthough is pretty neat result).\n\nValkyria Chronicles is a weird mix, but for those who want to take risk, it may be a bullseye. Not for everyone, especially those with low anime tolerance, but definitely worth a look for the uniqueness sake alone.","July 6, 2015","true","34.7"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","60","64","5","0"

Then quickly after that, Sega produced two more sequels on the PSP and then other spinoffs on mobile platforms. Not to mention, the game was originally developed for the Xbox 360 but Sega decided to make it for the PS3 instead, considering they weren't seeing much support for the project from Microsoft and they wanted to cater to the Japanese audience. So needless to say, it has had quite a history until its PC release.\n\nRegarding the port itself, it's quite fantastic. Other than a few audio issues where gunfire and character voices in-game may not be as loud as they were on the PS3 version and how the cutscenes are still in their original 720p video format, everything about this port is an improvement. The relatively flat, water-color aesthetic of the game means that upscaling them to modern PC resolutions results in a very crisp look. The conversion from 30 frames per second to 60 is quite stunning to behold as well. Especially for a VC fanatic like me. So I'm glad that new fans of this franchise will get quite an amazing visual experience.\n\nFor the game itself, it is a really fantastic mix of seriousness of war to the colorful characterizations of anime. It strikes a great balance between cartoony fantasy (moments of character comedy, light moments with off-days of the soldiers, fantastical mythology and lore)  and World War 2 style seriousness (replete with themes of racism, genocide, Jewish persecution and corruption and evils of war).  What I absolutely adore about this series is they don't mingle too much into one mindset and you are going to get a lot of funny moments and serious moments in very balanced doses throughout. So if you want a certain variety of emotions and scenarios in a game, the Valkyria Chronicles series is for you. Aside from the theme itself, the combat system BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones) is an elegant mix of real time 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy you have to play to believe in how well they come together. The combat system may sound like a weird coupling, but only a few minutes of getting used to the system, you will fall in love with this elegant combat system even if you are a jaded strategy game fan.\n\nHonestly, the game still stands the test of time regarding its unique gameplay engine, likable characters (This game has lineage with the likes of Sakura Wars, so character interaction is their bread and butter)  and a lovely story and lore complemented by the incredible music by the legendary  Hitoshi Sakimoto of other legendary strategy titles like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.\n\nSo if you want to support an underdog franchise and be a part of potentially making a full fledged, major Valkyria Chronicles 4 happen, this game is a very easy game to recommend. It's not to say negative things about Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 though, as they're lovely games in their own right. Though they are scaled down side games in comparison considering they came out on the PSP, which is quite a bit more under powered compared to the PS3 and PCs of the modern era. Hopefully, those games come out on the PC as well. But until then, I can't recommend Valkyria Chronicles 1 more. It's definitively one of the most lovely games on the PS3 era and I can't be happier it's on the PC for more people to experience it.","November 11, 2014","true","20.5"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","53","54","0","0"

Fully remappable with proper button prompts for keyboard/360 controller.\n\nThe gameplay, characters, and story are still just as great as they were when this game was released back in 2008, but they're not perfect and won't be everyone's cup of tea. The characters and plot are very anime. VERY anime. The fusion of turn-based strategy gameplay with real-time shooter elements is novel and pretty darn fun, but it can be a bit finicky in spots. The real-time controls at times don't feel precise enough and there can be a trial-and-error feel to some missions. The issues can lead to the game occasionally not feeling fair or balanced, but I don't find it severe or frequent enough to be detrimental to the overall experience.\n\nMusic and dialogue are great (English and Japanese audio tracks both included). There are some minor audio issues - odd mixing, some slight popping on cutscene dialogue. The first patch has mostly corrected this issue, but hopefully it will get a little more attention because it's still not quite perfect.","November 12, 2014","true","41.2"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","59","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/294860/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","One of my most favourite PS3 games that really never got the attention it deserved, and to be fair, I initially brushed it off when I played a demo of it with no real context or idea of the story at all. I initally bought on an impulse (I was really looking for a heavy binge of cell shaded games at the time, thanks, Tales of series!) and grew to love over the course of my playthrough. It brought everything that I loved about Fire Emblem, and more with its beautifully designed watercolour-esque presentation...all with free DLC included! Get ready for a long love letter review...\n\nValkyria Chronicles is set in a fictional version of Europe, known as Europa (yeah, I know, original) in the year 1935. The neutral nation, Gallia holds an abundant of an important resource known as Ragnite ore, which pretty much is this world's bread and butter for fueling just about everything. In an attempt to capture its resources, the East Europan Imperial Alliance launches a campaign on Gallia to fuel their ongoing war with the Atlantic Federation. Caught in between the crossfire, the player is left with the job to repel the foreign invaders and find peace in a wartorn continent.\n\nLets go by some of the differences Valkyria Chronicles compared to a normal S-RPG:\n\nValkyria Chronicles gameplay works off by giving each team a select amount of command points at the start of their turn, allowing each team to use it accordingly. You use one command point to command one unit for their remainder of either their stamina gauge, life, or when you are comfortable at where they've stopped. This unit is free to attack, take objectives, or escort and save allies from the battle. You later on get the ability to use these command points to perform "orders", allowing the commander to inspire army to fight in a specific manner, which can vary from hunkering down from enemy fire or increase the chances of proccing their potentials (we'll cover this later). This goes on until one team either one team uses all of their command points or ends their turn, allowing them to pool a certain number of remaining command points for the next turn.\n\nNow, its important to know that the actual gameplay relies on a stamina gauge movement system rather than grid based, similar to comparing a checkers where one piece can only move one square each to chess where the bishop, queen, and rook can move as far as they'd like on the board unless its obstructed. A unit can move forward, backward, sideways, etc as much as they like as long as they have enough stamina to complete that action. However you should keep in mind how MUCH stamina you have left, as you don't really want to leave a unit in enemy fire.\n\nEach solider you recruit as you continue in the game is unique, they are all different people who have their own backstories, and as individuals, have their own personalities. This is known as "potential", which can sometimes be a good thing, sometimes be a bad thing. Lets say for example the scout Alicia has the potential "maternal", which, when any of her close friends are nearby she will increase her desire to protect them, giving her increased stats all around. Another one would be the sniper Marina, who is a lone wolf with the potential "my way" , giving her increased evasive skills.  But its important to note that not all are positive buffs, for example, Ramona has "chatty cathy", which procs whenever a close friend is nearby, she just can't stop but chitchat with them, which distracts her and lowers her accuracy.  Its important to know who works well with who, and what kind of quirks they have. Like having pollen allergy. Wow, that really sucks to have as a potential.\n\nNow its important to note that just like Fire Emblem, there is PERMANENT DEATH. If one of your soldier falls in battle (barring the important story characters, of course) and are not rescued in time by an allied solider they WILL DIE FOR GOOD. There is no way to revive them if you don't reach them in time. They are gone. For realsies. In fact. there is even an in-game graveyard to remind you who has died so far in the war and how badly you failed. Talk about a punch in the gut. So its a good idea to keep in mind to train your scouts as they will most often act as your objective takers and evacuation units, just because they don't pack as much damage as shocktroopers doesn't make them useless!\n\nI loved this game dearly as I never got so involved in a bunch of fictional soldiers than in any other game. X-COM allowed me to make silly units, but I never got attached to them, not even to Sir Buttingtonfarts the sniper. I'd recommend this game to just about anyone that has never given it a fair shot, or just love S-RPGs like Fire Emblem, Disgaea, etc, but want it in a different taste. And hey, maybe give the 2nd and 3rd game a shot! They both improve the gameplay even further by adding multiple branching classes and adding more background stories for each soldier, just...uh...they're on the PSP. Which is a bit of a dead system. And not as pretty. Oh well.\n\nPlease note that the game cinematics runs on 720p for some reason, the gameplay is working fine for any other resolution, so pick whichever you'd like. But for anyone who's playing 1080p or higher it might bother you that some of the scenes might appear a little "edgey" or a little jagged. Yeah, its bothering me, too. But hey, 60fps! Glorious watercoloured battlefield action! In sixty framerates per second! Take that, my old launch PS3.","November 11, 2014","true","3.2"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","0"

Game does suffer from some minor bugs, but it's mostly engine related when playing at higher FPS than the game was EVER designed to perform at.  Aside from that, most everything works beautifully.   Graphically and even Control/Handling.  Game runs absolutely beautifully for a PS3 Port over to PC.   Graphically it looks beautiful as well.\n\nControls, In Depth:  Being a PC game people expect good Mouse/Keyboard Controls.  Despite being a Port this game doesn't disappoint.  I played the game from start to finish using Mouse/Keyboard and save for 4 Story Missions I ended up getting A/B ranks on everything else, mostly A Ranks.  Being I'm a Veteran of the game I know how to beat most missions well, and I prefer PC games vs console.  I openly give SEGA a Thumbs up on their efforts on adapting the controls for PC.  Even going through Menu's seems to work well, as long as users remember the menus were never designed for a mouse, so the mouse does not function for menus.\n\nGame Itself:  It is a no brainer that Valkyria Chronicles is a Masterpiece of a video game, and despite being a Port to PC it does not disappoint anywhere.  Everything works well, the story and characters are colorful and memorable.   The game has never been more beautiful to play because of the higher resolution options.  Anyone who has any doubts about buying this game, have those doubts out of their own miss givings.  There is no gamer who should not find something to enjoy in the splended world of Gallia.","November 16, 2014","true","48.0"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","0"

Playing this at high resolutions and framerates is super nice. It is easy to downsample it to 4k on my 1080p monitor and I can STILL get 120FPS.

The intent wasn't on having awesome graphics (even in 2008 the graphics were ok) but something beautiful, and even now, six years later, the game still looks beautiful, not at all old.\n\nThe plot is engaging, maybe a bit reliant on cliches, but still well done and interesting. Any story about a war not glorifying it, but showing it with fairness (Cruelty, heroism, sacrifice, duty, loyalty...) is always a welcome sight. The main characters are well developed, and the side characters get their own missions to shine.\n\nThe music is beautiful, with some tracks being fairly normal, while others are memorable. Voice acting in English is kinda Fairly Bad, while the original Japanese work is polished and flawless.\n\nThe controls are well ported, mouse control is smooth and correct, I miss having a cursor in the menus, but the important part (The combat) goes flawless. It also allows controller use, for those who prefer the original experience.\n\nCombat can be as challenging as you allow it to be. Certainly victory won't be an issue most of the time, but getting A rank is another, different, matter. Still, the learning curve is user friendly, as long as the player accepts B ranks for a while.\n\nThe Strategic part varies, sometimes being smart allows the player to have really fun combats, while considering possibilities. Other times using strong scouts allows to skip the entire combat by simply rushing an objective fast. It's not cheating, but still, I'd discourage players from exploiting the mechanics for fast victories.\n\nLong story short. This game is cheap, good, it has aged well, the control is good and it's fun. Simply one of the best Tactical Strategy game i've ever played","January 25, 2015","true","63.9"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","1"

Transition to the PC from the PS3 has been fairly smooth, some slight hiccups with the mouse and keyboard controls but nothing too major (and if you have a controller set up you won't even notice). Includes all the DLC and will give you roughly 35+ hours of gameplay (not including A+ ranking all missions and replays).\n\nIt's a fantastic game for a low price, I highly recommended you pick it up now rather than waiting for a sale, so hopefully SEGA gets the message and ports VC2 and 3...and maybe even works on a 4th.

During the early level your equipment will be rather pathetic, especially in the accuracy department. However the missions are less punishing. Later in the game your characters abilities are amazing but the game definitely punishes you at every wrong move. Unfortunately like Fire Emblem and X-COM RNG tends to make things chaotic every now and then. However every stage has an easy/short path but it usually takes a few failures every now and then to figure it out. Have fun if that's the sort of game you're into.\n\nThe story and what to expect is pretty much a standard war story.

When the first english release came out I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I knew I wanted it...\n\nValkyria Chronicles can be best summed up in the opening lines of the game itself, "what follows is a chronicle of those fought, lived and died." Valkyria Chronicles is a character driven strategy game combining turn based elements with third person action.\n\nEvery soldier under your command is different, they each have their own capabilities whether that be accuracy or health and all have "Potentials". Potentials can range from something as simple as preferring to run over concrete or urban paths leading to a rise in defence to screaming "VEG-TA-BLES!" when they run over dirt...\n\nThen their are your inter-unit relations. Most soldiers have three other soldiers with whom they like and if within close proximity during an attack, will lend their fire to the attack for extra damage. Then some soldiers just don't like certain individuals to one sniper hating EVERYONE.\n\nThe story is great and you'll find yourself saying "just one more battle!" just to see the next cinematic and seeing how the story evolves and what happens to your favourite characters.\n\nOverall give Valkyria Chronicles a go, you may be pleasantly surprised.","November 30, 2014","true","33.5"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","44","55","0","0"

After 30+ hours of playing and finally beating the game I can say that this game has soared above and beyond what I wanted to get out of this experience. The story is told amazingly and the passion put into it made me laugh and cry along with the characters. As I said having not played the original game I can't say how good of a port it is from the PS3 but I would definitly recommend this for someone new to the series. Solid controls and the limited mobility by the use of CP (command points) allow you to take full advantage of many actions. The ability to have a "reaction fire" is also a new mechanic that I have never seen before but is implemented amazingly into the game, finally being able to fire upon enemies who come into the line of sight prevents many moves that could flat out ruin the game experience for me. Many different unit types and enemies also make this game interesting as each new level brings new enemies and challenges. One of the few games I could give a solid 10/10 to.

The difficulty is all over the place, some missions are rather difficulty then suddenly you get an easy one, theres one mission that is absurdly difficult about 1/3rd of the way through the game but the next 4 or 5 are a cake walk, theres no real curve which makes the experiance a litting jaring\n\n2. the AI sometimes goes into full derp mode, I've had snipers run point blank range into my shocktroopers to try and snipe one, I've even had AIs just end their turn standing in the middle of the battlefield because they got shot once\n\n3. the ports animated cutscenes are at 30fps 720p but the game can be played at 4k and 60fps, small gripe but a little jaring, the game looks beutiful anyway\n\nok still not at the character limit? good I'll continue\n\none thing that strikes me about the game (outside of its graphics which look beutiful especially in the animated cutscenes) is the music, which was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto who you may know from his work in FF12 and the Tactics series, the music uses alot of violins and piano work to help express the emotion being felt at the time including tension, joy and sadness, of course this runs into the problem though that alot of tracks are repeated but thankfully it doesn't get too annoying to listen to after multiple playthroughs and it tends to save the best tracks for when its needed\n\nnow to finish off is graphics, and i'm just going to say this now, SEGA needs to use this game engine more, while it does defently have rather low texture quality its only noticeable at really close range, the Canvis engine has that really great combination of vibrant colours, strong lighting (when it's used which unfortunatly is not often) and makes the characters have very distinquishable sillouetes which prevent you from being killed cheaply, there ARE a few issues with the physics but the game doesn't use then in say how a Call of duty game uses it, typically its saved for the ragdolls which disappear after a short while\n\nOverall Valkyria chronicles is as good now as it is then, it is well made and is one of the best games of its generation and mayhaps even be with in a few "best games of all time" list. I would defently recommend buying this game.","December 1, 2014","true","31.0"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","0"

The mouse only works when selecting units in game and for controlling units after you select them (i.e. not during the menu interface), and settings can only be adjusted outside of the game, but that's a lot more port effort than some console ports I've seen. Haven't tried to see if it has gamepad support, but I'll probably play it keyboard and mouse just for the mouse aiming.\n\nAs for the game, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical RPGs but is willing to try something a little different. The art is beautiful, the characters charming, the story is great and the gameplay is fun. Your mileage may vary on the between mission stuff.

Without spoiling anything, the game's story takes place in a fictional land based WWII-era Europe with elements of fantasy and Japanese anime. Prejudices, war, death, revenge, family, and romance are themes that VC explores well.\n\nThe art style of the game is one of its strongest features. VC looks like a water color painting in motion and makes for a great style without seeming too bland. The gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real time strategy combat which can be challenging, but quite rewarding.\n\nVC does have its flaws. Since it is a PS3 port, the controls feel much more comfortable on a gamepad rather than a mouse and keyboard. The difficulty of the game is moderate, but it can fluctuate at times and there is a learning curve.\n\nOverall, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing title that is worth playing over and over again.","December 28, 2014","true","54.3"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Its a ps3 classic that slipped under the radar for most people for its simple visual style and animeish look. While it does contain its fair share of anime tropes it still manages to be an extremely engageing experience.\n\nThe story manages to both be compelling, dramatic and silly with the game possibly being the first to really take a look at consentraition camps and blatant racism. Though its messege just seems to be that its bad. Nonetheless the narrative does keep on being compelling during the entire experience.\n\nThe gameplay can best be described as x-com meets 3rd person shooters. It manages a almost perfect difficulty curve by giving new exiting challenges on almost all the levels. It really manages to make you think about what strategies you want to use in order to win in the fastes amount possible.\n\nVisually the game is stunning, using the best cellshade and shadow effects ive ever seen. That being said texture quality is something that looks like an early ps3 game, since it is. However i feel like they should have taken advantage of the pc horsepower giving a few more effect and higher visual fidelity.\nAt least the game runs smoothly without taxing my system above 10% (both cpu and gpu).\n\nIn conclusion valkyria chronicles is a must buy for anyone who likes their x-com or similar strategy games or if you are a fan of anime. The mix of the two whilst weird works suprisingly well. A lack of visiual upgrade and cringeworthy english voiceacting being the biggest downfalls of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dozo/recommended/294860/","dozo","DOZO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dozo/","375 products in account","I attempted to play this game on the PS3 not long after it first came out in English, but became annoyed with the game system after about five missions and stopped. Since a friend bought me the new PC port as a gift, I felt obliged to play it, but regrettably all of the original complaints I had about the game were vindicated and the port introduced a host of new ones as well.\n\nPresentation:\nValkyria Chronicles' greatest strengths are its beautiful watercolor-style graphics, which still look great six years later, and its powerful orchestral score. I have nothing to complain about in regards to those.\n\nThe PC port, while it can run at a higher resolution than the original PS3 version, has some major issues related to the graphics framerate. The game is unplayable above a certain FPS due to severe bugs with the speed of interception fire and with tank physics, and the FPS limiter only allows running the game at 30FPS or 'refresh rate' (too high on many monitors to avoid bugs.) 60FPS fans will have to prepare themselves for a 'cinematic' experience.\n\nMany of the cutscenes are prerendered as 720p video and look very ugly at higher resolutions. They also make the size of the game's download, at 20 gigabytes, far larger than any 6-year-old game ought to be.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst of all, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a strategy game; it's a puzzle game. The puzzle is figuring out what the game thinks is an A-rank strategy, a feat of military genius on par with the legendary conquests of Napoleon and Caesar. The answer ranges from "run one scout past enemy lines to kill the two soldiers sitting in their main base and 'capture' it, inexplicably forcing an enemy retreat" to "have the same shocktrooper shoot everything" to "move your tank to an empty corner of the map so it can attack the enemy reinforcements from behind when they magically appear." It is never "have your entire squad work together" or "secure the area before advancing forward." Foolishly attempting to use 'intelligent' tactics learned in inferior strategy games such as StarCraft or XCOM will result in punishment. You will earn less XP and money and receive no royal accolades (with their accompanying special weapons) unless you replay the missions again and again to find out what insane act of bravado can clear them as fast as humanly possible. Or you could use a walkthrough.\n\nThis isn't just because the rank & reward system favors sheer speed over all else; it's because the game design itself encourages and rewards a "lone commando" style of play. As the Command Point system makes every squaddie cost a point to move, it's far more efficient to spam CPs on whoever you already have at the front lines than to bring up an ally to assist them. Even when the diminishing returns start to make spending further CPs on your point man a waste, those you leave unused will roll over to the next phase, and the poor enemy AI means letting them have a turn will rarely hurt if your units are in safe positions. "Orders" are another way to spend CP that's more efficient than wasting it on teamwork, the most useful one magically turning your scouts with light rifles into beasts capable of single-handedly destroying heavy tanks, and thus negating the need to use speciality anti-tank soldiers or your own tanks for such purposes.\n\nThe PC port adds quite a few bugs that do nothing to improve the experience. The most severe problem I suffered was a glitch that caused my troops to fall out of the map ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343008703 ) when they climbed any ladders in one mission, making it impossible to take out some deadly cannons you were expected to neutralize, and necessitating a cheesy and tedious maneuver to reach the objective despite that.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are mostly alright except for the tanks. They wiggle back and forth constantly whether controlled with mouse or keyboard, wasting AP, and will frequently get stuck on something invisible and vibrate in place until they can no longer move. During missions where I had to use the tanks a lot, I had to save before moving them and sometimes reload upward of five times before I could avoid glitching out during the movement. I shouldn't need a gamepad to play a PC game, assuming the tanks control any better using one of those.\n\nThe menu system is also cumbersome and makes it a chore to do anything, gamepad or not. SEGA could have done much better in the port department here, though I suppose it's impressive by the standards of Japanese publishers that the controls and interface are mostly usable.\n\nStory:\nNo comment. It's pretty much standard JRPG material aside from the twist of having a fantasy-WW2 setting. I can see where people who love it are coming from, and where those who hate it are coming from. For me, it was enough to keep me playing to the end despite my dislike of the gameplay, which seems a rather commendable accomplishment.\n\nI did notice something rather conspicuous when playing with Japanese audio and English subtitles. I'm pretty fluent in Japanese myself, but the subtitle translations (apparently an exact copy of the English voice actors' script) of Valkyria Chronicles are so loose that at times I wondered whether the person who wrote the English script was. Very few lines have the same nuance as the originals, some conversations are completely rewritten and there are even a few lines added in where the Japanese audio has only silence. The original dialogue is kind of dry and dull at times, so I can't fault the localization team too much for wanting to "punch it up," but I think it's a disservice to those who only know English and are unaware of the changes; I've seen quite a few people complaining about the corny dialogue in VC and wonder if they would have felt the same had it been more accurately translated.\n\nOne of many examples I could give, from the cutscene at the end of chapter 12 -\n\nなんだか不思議、ウェルキンと話していると、いつも元気が出てくるんだよね。\n僕も、アリシアと一緒だから頑張れるんだよ。\nうん。　ありがとう、ウェルキン。　私…\nウェルキンと出会えて…　本当によかった。\n\nMy own literal translation:\n"It's kind of mysterious. When I talk with you, Welkin, it always makes me feel better."\n"And it's because I'm together with you that I'm able to keep trying, Alicia."\n"Yeah. Thank you, Welkin. I..."\n"It really is wonderful that I was able to meet you, Welkin."\n\nAnd the in-game subtitles:\n"You know, it's funny. Whenever I talk to you, I feel like everything is going to be fine."\n"Yeah, well, you're the only reason I haven't completely lost it Alicia."\n"Really? Thank you, Welkin. Me too."\n"I'm glad we were able to meet... and work together."\n\nNitpicking? Maybe. But pretty irritating if you can tell, and worth pointing out to those who can't, I think.\n\nConclusion:\nAs long as you know what to expect from it, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a terrible game, but it's misrepresented by almost everyone and will only annoy and frustrate hardcore strategy game fans (like me.) I cannot personally recommend it, but it's evident that a lot of people would, and I'm glad they were able to find it enjoyable. I encourage them to try real strategy games sometime and learn the joy of thinking on one's feet and adapting to the unexpected that is nonexistent in Valkyria Chronicles.\n\nAdditionally, due to the buggy PC port, it's best played on PS3 and not PC. I hope that patches for the PC version are coming, but I don't expect them.","November 17, 2014","false","33.5"," 515 of 859 people (60%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","60","515","859","27","49"

Loving the idea of not having to "grind" levels on each character individually, which enables you to have a very flexible squad - you can select soldiers that would contribute the most with their abilities to a particular battle. Ability to buy upgrades and often choose different upgrade trees for your squad weapons also adds to it.\n\nInteresting story, taking a fairly unique approach to reinterpreting the WW2 theme. Lore is deep and as time goes by you uncover more and more bits of information about the game's world, characters, history. Makes the game quite immersive.\n\nArt style is pretty. 3D-rendered anime characters are beautiful and detailed. Environments could maybe use some more work at times and I'd personally appreciate if the game had some more contrasting color palletes.\n\nMusic is gorgeous. Beautiful orchestral arrangements never feel out of place.\n\nLocalization is pretty great. English voiced-over dialogues are enjoyable to listen to, most of the characters are voiced nicely with the exception of maybe one or two, that don't make their appearance all that often anyways. You can always switch to the original, Japanese audio if you so desire.\n\nGreat PC port, although lacking mouse control in menus, the battles themselves are absolutely 100% playable with keyboard and mouse and for me, personally, it works even better than using a controller.\n\nCons:I've only one major complaint about this game, and it surprises me how I don't see many people mentioning this. The AI can be VERY dodgy in this game at times. In some instances you can see enemy soldiers just move around through the entirety of their turn for no apparent reason at all and ending their turn in almost exactly the same spot where they began. Enemy tanks do the same sometimes, wasting Control Points (tanks spend more CP than foot soldiers) and sometimes ending up in a position where they expose their weakspots and are easy to one-shot. This breaks the immersion of the game for me.\n\nAside from that, some people might be put off by the amount of cut-scenes and game's attempt to focus on both story and gameplay. I personally wasn't bothered by it at all, but thought it would be worth pointing out regardless.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, I've enjoyed and am still enjoying my time with this game a great deal. The dodgy AI can be annoying sometimes, but it doesn't really justify ignoring this game, so if you're into tactical, turn-based RPGs and/or are looking for an interesting, well thought-out story, I'd say totally give this one a twirl.","January 25, 2015","true","22.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","3"

It's pretty much Xcom, but with a third person shooter mechanic and Nazis. Combat is surprisingly in-depth and can lead to some intense moments in-game.\n\nThe story itself is pretty good, being about 2 young adults commanding a platoon( I refuse to call them a squad. It has 20 people in it for god's sake) while going through the horrors of war. Despite its fantasy elements, it quite down to Earth in it's portrayal, filled with tearjerkers and heartwarming moments. I also really liked the characters, finding myself becoming really attached to them as the game progresses. My personal favorites are Jane the sadistic psychopath and Jann the token gay guy(voiced by Bender btw).\n\nSoundtrack is also pretty good. Same with the voice acting, though there is Japanese for the weebs out there.\n\nAs for performance, I managed to run it a constant 60 fps on a cpu that has frame dips on Half Life 2. You won't need to worry about your potato running it.\n\nOverall, pretty good game(except for Chapter 7. That chapter deserves 7 shocktroopers scorching it with their flamethrowers) and one I highly recommend for those that enjoy turn base strategy.","May 19, 2015","true","25.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","23","25","4","0"

This game has a fantastic art style, pays respects to civilians and soldiers who lost their lives in WWII and just shines in quality. WOW, SEGA! You've impressed me so much with this game! This is the SEGA I remembered as a KID! :)\n\nSquare Enix should take some lessons from SEGA and Nihon Falcom (The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky) on how to port a console game to PC. This game runs FLAWLESSLY! There's no graphical settings, but the game engine seems to scale the texture, shadow and particle effects quality settings in respect to your game resolution which works quite well! I can run this game at 4K downsampled to 1080P and everything runs at 60fps!!! AWESOME!\n\nNow, I do want to give you folks a serious bit of advice... THERE'S NO AUTOSAVE! So save your game after each mission.. because this game isn't 100% stable when it comes to alt-tabbing.. I've had it crash on me twice... and had to redo some missions which was annoying because I was too stupid to manually save  after doing each mission haha... so you've been warned. :P\n\nThis game just RUNS so smooth! I can't get over that hahaha... there are only a few minor performance problems... two in fact. First? The title screen is locked at 30fps so it feels sluggish compared to any other part of the game, including the book mode menus which run at 60fps.... second? The cutscenes have no upscaling filters and are not 1080P quality.. they used I'm guessing the PS3 versions which are 720P which don't look as good as the rest of the game... but that's just two minor nit-picks that barely detract from this game.\n\nNow? Let's talk about the game... Valkyria Chronicles is based off of WWII in the country of Gallum... which I'm guessing is the Netherlands if you look at the game's map of Europa. Gallum is a neutral country that was forced into EWWII (Europa World War II) by the invading forces of East European Imperial Alliance (aka The Empire) for the precious resource of Ragnite (the game's equivalent of the real world's oil / fuel... or if you love Command & Conquer? Tiberium! w00t! loved old school CNC). The game follows a handful of protagonists and their allies, plus a few of what the game calls "optional custscenes" of antagonists... now, I must say.. optional cutscenes? I'll watch them anyways. I love a damn good storyline... but I know some people aren't as patient as me lol, so they'll enjoy the ability to skip optional cutscenes.\n\nThe combat takes a bit to adjust to since it's very much an active-turn-based combat system... think of it as a kind of mix of Xcom (or Final Fantasy Tactics) with Syndicate (or regular Final Fantasy)... as you move your units around? Enemy troops will constantly shoot at you as you move around!! So keep an eye on your map, which direction they're pointed in and make your actions count! Once you're done shooting / healing / repairing / etc? Mash that ESC (or whatever gamepad button it is, haven't tried gamepad on this yet heh) button and END YOUR ACTION!! That? or quickly run your unit behind something to hide... because after you take an action? The enemy will start shooting you again. It takes a bit to wrap your head around when you're playing the game as I thought I was in the safe-zone.. and then bullets started flying again so I had to spring baction into action and try to end my actions before my poor unit lots all of their health due to my apathy haha... oops.\n\nTraining your troops goes by classes which is a lot more forgiving than games like Xcom where you shouted at your PC... "NOO!!! I just spent hours traning that guy just for him to get gutted!! Now I need to replace him with a greenhorn half ways through the game!? WEAAAAAKKK!!!".. Nope! This game? You loose a Lancer? Dammit... but at least the next Lancer still has the same training level. It still does suck to lose soldeirs though, as they can have some really darn handy "Personal Potentials" and "Battle Potentials"... which are kind of like the Perks from Fallout. They'll get advantages / disadvantages in combat depending on if they are near certain types of people (fellow Shocktroopers, tanks, males, dust, paved roads, etc) and have certain other soldiers they will "Like" which allows them to perform combination actions with them if they're near each other... so if you have a little squad of three that like each other? All three can potentially shoot their weapons together if one of them attacks / counter-attacks.\n\nJust... YEAH!!!! This combat system is so well thought out... well, everything about this game is well though out! It's a VERY VERY HIGH RECOMMENDATION! A special gem on the PS3 gets the special port to PC it deserves for a wider audience to enjoy. My hat off to thee SEGA for making this game and then giving it the care and attention it deserves for this port. :)","November 14, 2014","true","24.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabwamow/recommended/294860/","kabwamow","Kabwamow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabwamow/","120 products in account","Normally, jRPGs are played for its story telling: you just keep going (through countless, sometimes stressful, enemy battles) just so you can know what happens in the end, because simply most of them are very well written. On Valkyria Chronicles’ case, however, I’d say it is the opposite: the gameplay is what the game has of appeal while its story, although not bad by any means, is pretty predictable and straight forward. It’s more of a game to have fun rather than to get a master piece of a story.\n\nStory\n\nIt’s decent, but follows an anime-esque order of events which makes it feel a little generic: boy finds girl, both fight against an evil dude who wants to conquer the world, boy and girl realize they are in love with each other, boy, girl and a squad of around 8 more people defeat armies seventeen times larger because “friendship and love are stronger than anything else”. That’s pretty much it. You know how the game ends pretty much 3 hours in, maybe even less, depending on how used you are to this kind of story. The game, however, still has some really nice cut scenes now and then, which are pretty well done and cool.\n\nThe characters are OK, and you end up liking the main ones: they all have their own personalities and they are not (well, not most of them) bland. One thing that I thought was poorly executed, however, is that pretty much only five characters from your squad legitimately participate on the story, while the others that you choose to make part of your army just take part on the missions and that’s it. The game gave each one of them a biography, an unique personality and people they like/dislike, but they’ll never have dialogues or interactions with other characters (as in, by their biographies, Ted and Marina seem to have a hilarious relationship, but you can’t really see anything about it anywhere). I feel like making something like Fire Emblem, where you can develop relationships between characters on missions if they keep fighting together, and thus being able to see cut scenes of  them interacting with each other would be something really great for this game.\n\nGameplay\n\nThat’s where the game shines. Around the lines of XCOM, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based shooting game with all the RPG elements it should have, using equips, status and aiming to decide how much damage each attack does.  The missions and their objectives are very creative, and it’s really rare to have ones which you just have to “capture the enemy’s base”, or “kill all enemies”. Although the early game is fine, things really get good on late game, where you can’t just rush the enemy thinking there’s nothing to lose: some of the ending missions require the player to elaborate their own strategies to succeed (otherwise, you’re plain dead), and when they actually work, it feels really rewarding, especially when you’re aiming for a mission rank A. The leveling system on the game works in a way that you actually level up the classes, and not the characters: this way, all the characters of that specific class will be the same level, making it pretty much impossible to grind just one character to beast-levels and soloing the whole game with him, like many other jRPGs . All five classes are well designed and balanced, and you need to use all of them throughout the game.\nIt has its flaws, however: I felt like the aiming of the characters is just way too awful, to levels that really ♥♥♥♥ you off. On late missions, where missing a shot sometimes is really not an option, seeing your character failing an almost point-blank shot by a lot is not really nice, and may lose you the whole mission. The aiming gets better as the game continues, yes, but they sometimes still miss ridiculously easy shots…just because. By the way, it’s so bad early game, that I didn’t even bother using snipers until chapter 10+ (which is way after middle game). They just couldn’t hit anything at all.\n\nAnother thing is that controlling tanks was TERRIBLE. I played the game with keyboard+mouse, and while WASD controlled the direction of the tank, so did the mouse…and, since you need the mouse to change the camera to know where you’re going , and the keyboard to actually move forward or backwards, you need to use both at the same time, and boy, does that confuse the game. The tank sometimes goes the complete opposite direction you wanted it to go, wasting a lot of precious Action Points for nothing.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10\nOverall, a very nice game, with really fun and challenging missions.  My biggest issue was indeed with the story, as it felt like the writers didn’t really want to risk doing something out of the box and just went on with what normally sells.\nIf you think Naruto has a great story, however, for you I’d give the game a 9/10, as you’d be able to enjoy it as whole much more.","February 5, 2015","true","45.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","1"

If you've already beaten the game on the PS3, then I suppose you wouldn't need to buy this game again; however, for those who have yet to play this game I highly recommend it.\n\nI recommend you play this game with a controller by the way.\n\nNow onto the actual game review. The game is a semi-turn based strategy RPG. I say semi-turn based because enemy units can shoot at you while you move during your turn and vice versa. It's a fairly simple to learn game and infuriating at the same time due to the random trajectory of your bullets, but overall the game is incredibly fun. Highly recommended for those who enjoy strategy game with elements of action/shooting.\n\nP.S. It has dual audio if that's important in your decision making.

It allows arbitrary resolutions and framerates. While there is no mouse support in menus, the actual gameplay has decent mouse control. Graphically, it scales well with better hardware and runs well, although sadly all the cutscenes are the original PS3 prerendered quality. Thankfully the artstyle helps it age more gracefully than some other games. Save and Load times are vastly improved over the console version.\n\nAs for the game itself, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based strategy RPG. However, when you control characters the game moves in real time, with the exception of aiming. The maps in Valkyria Chronicles are not grid based, which allows the player a greater range of freedom compared to other SRPGs. Shooting is determined by line of sight (except for grenades etc), although RNG determines if you hit or not. This system works well, although sometimes the AI leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe gameplay sets the foundation for an excellent story, a beautiful aesthetic, and a good soundtrack. I wholeheartly recommend Valkyria Chronicles.","November 13, 2014","true","53.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

A completely new genre and, hopefully, the future of tactical role-playing games. Valkyria Chronicles (as far as I know) is the first game to ever try this formula and thankfully, it was done right.\n\nI really like this game and have tons of reasons of why you should buy it to back it up but before that let's get my main issues with the game out of the way. The ranking system doesn't take in account if you killed enemies or if you allowed any of your units to fall in battle, the ranking system ONLY takes into account how many turns you took to finish a mission which leads me to another problem, Scouts. They usually are your main units because you don't really need any other units! Why would you spend your time moving around all the other classes if you can just combine orders and scouts so they can basically do all the jobs of all the other classes? You can still achieve As without the so called "scout runs" but still... it seems a little broken (Thankfully I was able to avoid this by only trying to use 2 scouts per mission and little to no orders which made the game more fun and challenging).\n*You can still use scout runs to farm money and exp in the skirmishes but that's alright\n\n-STORY\nIn the year 1935, a huge war (EW2) takes place in the continent of Europa. The Empire tries to take on the continent in an effort to get more Ragnite for their country (basically a mineral which is used for EVERYTHING) but the Federation fights back. In the middle of both countries is located a thrid neutral country, Gallia. When the Empire decides to attack Gallia, the story of how a small country can beat a super-power begins...\n\nYou play as Welking Gunther, the son of the hero of the EW1, as he guides Squad 7 in an attempt to push the Imperials out of Gallia. In your journey you're accompanied by fellow aspiring baker Alicia Melchiott, former bar singer Brigitte "Rosie" Stark, veggie maniac Largo Potter, genius engineering prodigy (not to mention your sister) Isara Gunther, and a bunch of other colorful characters that make up your squad.\n\nThe characters are all unique and feel different (with some cliches here and there), the plot is enough to keep you entertained but doesn't really stand out, the game deals with theme like racism and life admist war, but what really makes all of this great is the way the story is told.\n\n-GAMEPLAY\nAt first, the game looks like your typical strategy game (Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc...) you're showned a map where you have certain objectives and you can see the location of your units and SOME of your enemies. Once you choose which unit to use with your "CP" or Command Points is when the real fun takes place. You are suddenly thrown into a third person perspective of the unit you chose where you're allowed to move around, crouch and take cover, attack enemy units, heal yourself or your teammates, save downed units, etc... How much you can do depends on how you spend your "AP" or Action Points which is represented by a gauge which deplets as you move. Aside from keeping watch of your AP, you also have to watch out for enemy fire which will go for as long as you are in third person perspective. Finally each unit is different depending on which class you are (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, or Sniper) and to further differ each unit from one another each character has their own Potentials which trigger based  on different criteria during the battle. I know it sounds REALLY complicated but to sum it up, the game is fun, unique and not really that hard to catch on once you get used to it.\n\n-SOUND\nThe soundtrack is great and always manages to fit the mood. The game is has full voice-acting for each and every character and really DO give a personality to each squad member or enemy. A MAJOR + is the inclusion of both Japanese and English voice acting but as far as I know, this game has GOOD english voice acting unlike most JRPGs or Japanese games in genral.\n\n-GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION\nGraphics are BEAUTIFUL and look rather unique with its oil-painting, anime like look. The game's hub world (if it can be called that) is divided in a story/picture book menu which divides the game in different sections and menus which, again, is really unique and looks nice.\n\nIn conclusion, BUY THIS GAME!!! Even at the full price of $20 this game is absolutely worth it!!! The game offers 60+ in the normal campaign, not to mention this version includes all 4 previously released DLCs. It has the option for a new game + and also every mission you're given a score based on performance, so you can replay missions and aim for the A rank in all 4 difficulties if that's your thing. Basically, it's cheap, unique, fun, engaging and has tons of replayability :)\nOh and I almost forgot, this game freaking has VYSE, AIKA, and FINA from SKIES OF ARCADIA!!!!! That already makes it a must buy for everyone on Steam :O\n\n*On a side note, I did encountered some problems:\n-The game ocasionally crashed (recurring examples include: after the first time you visit the Headquarters, and after the results screen in both missions of Chapter 5: The Kloden Wildwood and Report 6: What Lies Beyond Hate) I have heard this happened to many others too, hope it gets fixed.\n-Characters suddenly glitching out of the map. They literally fall to a bottomless pit of black screen that can only be fixed by loading a previous save file. This mostly happened after climbing up stairs. Hope it gets fixed soon too.","December 8, 2014","true","76.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

Good story/them historical references/weapons. In-depth n' stuff. Slow but tactical gameplay. RNG trolls hard. Buy it now pls.\n\n\nThis game is actually surprisingly in depth. It seemed very linear with a campaign-only visual novel esque style, but without the romance. Well it turns out I couldn't have been more off.\n\nInstead what I paid for was an extensive Semi-RPG/Strategy game with an enjoyable campaign and combat flexibility. Upgrades, passives, special abilities, weapons, etc (And some romance... god damnit). The gameplay is very smooth and easy to get into due to simple controls and mechanics. For you die-hard strategists out there, the game is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's welcoming to non-strategy players who just want to play through the story. At the same time, it can be extremely hard to plan and reach for utmost efficiency for the highest rank. The skirmish option allows you to replay levels for those extra hardcore perfect-run gamers seeking to get the spotless win (Me being one of them). You can even change the voices to Japanese if you're tired of hearing horribly awkward English voice acting!\n\nIt's hard not to like this game even if you don't particularly go for WWII based games. The story/concept is appealing for the average player. World War history buffs will drool over the historical references and weapons. My favorite of course being the Lancaar Anti-Tank-Gun-Thing that reminds me of the Panzer Faust. Albiet the gameplay can seem slow paced at time, it makes you stop and think rather than going Leroy Jenkins all over the enemy. Furthermore, each of the characters' unique personalities makes it easy to get attached to them, and hard to simply have them charge like a pawn.\n\nThere are no "choose your lifelong partner" options or super complex MMORPG skill trees. If you're looking for something ridiculously open-world and free then move along. Additionally the RNG can get a bit frustrating. Such as having your favorite stormtrooper sniped across the map by a tank... twice. I've had one or two hair-ripping, vein-popping, desk-flipping moments where seemingly easy shots will fly right over targets. Occasionally the the tanks you control spazz out and turn in wrong directions, or your soldiers will fire their entire clip into the ground because "F*** You" that's why. There's even some racism against the fictional race of dark-sins... darksens... darxsens... darcsens? It starts with a D or something. Oh and some characters get a power buff just by getting turned on... Just don't ask.\n\nRegardless of the small peeves, this game is definitely worth the money and the time.","November 15, 2014","true","11.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","3"

Valkyria Chronicles combines good animation with an interesting plot, driven by a psudo WW2 setting and complimented by interesting and diverse characters with personalities which crosover into the awesome xcom-like gameplay. Jump to the last 2 paragraphs for Summary.\n\nAfter the first 3 chapters you are given control of a squad of 20 people which you can pick from the starting recruit roster of at least 30. Each recruit has different things that they like and dislike which act as potential modifies to that recuits ability on the field. 'Alex' might fancy women, for example, meaning when he is in close proximity to women he has the potential to have an accuracy boost as he want to impress the ladies. There are many others such as "pollen allegies" which has the potential to distract the person when they are located near flora or on meadows leading to a reducution in accuracy. This little intricacy adds so much to the gameplay all the while surreptitious causing the player to form connections to each member of your squad as you begin to remember that "Alex" while he fancies women is also big on camaraderie so being close to multiple members of your squad could potentially increase his effictiveness in battle.\n\nBattles are acomplished in turn baseed manner, facilitated through the use of Command Points (CP) and Action Points (AP). Command Points are actions spent by the Commander (The player) to move troops and issue orders. Each troop can be activated through one or more CP. Once activated you are then given control of that recruit and can expend AP to move acround the battlefield. You can also choose at any time to perofrm a specific action whether it be shoot the enemy, throw a grenade at the enemy or heal yourself. This can be done withour completely expending your AP allowing you move to a position where your attack is potentially optimal and then retreat to cover to defend against attacks on the enemies turn.\n\nIn between mission you can upgrade your squad's equipment through expending points on armour and weapons while also improving the abilities of each class through spending earned experienced in the training area. The whole headquaters area reminds me once again of X-com as you have you barracks where you can look at detailed information on your men, the Research and Development tab where you can purchase equipment upgrades as they are unlocked through the story mode and the commmand tab where you can remove and add different members to your squad.\n\nTo summarise, if you like the gameplay of X-com, a low fantasy/alternative WW2 setting, and anime style animation then this is the game of your dreams. For $20 you get a game with an awesome setting backed up by solid gameplay mechanics which are easy to learn and control due to excellent Mouse & Keyboard functionality.\n\nAlso the performance on my rig was excellent as well the a solid 60fps@1080p in all gameplay circumstances. I did notice some micro fram stutter in the cutscenes, however it is not enough to detract from the overall experience.\nMain Rig Specs:\ncpu: AMD fx8350\ngpu: Gigabyte gtx 980\nMonitor: Benq 60fps 1080p","November 11, 2014","true","17.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

When it came out on Steam, I bought it the very first time it went on sale (although the game is more than worth its full price) There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll just keep it short.\n\nThe good:\nGreat visuals. Everything is rendered to look like a watercolor painting. It truly blends the anime art style with 3D environment.\nEngaging storyline. It is rather simple and somewhat predictable, but it's well written enough to keep you wanting to progress through the game.\nWell developed characters. All main characters have a unique backstory, and they actually affect the skills of the characters (called 'Potentials' in the game)\nExceptional fun combat. It really requires you to think about the moves that you're making. Every choice you make is crucial, from which unit to deploy first, to which direction your unit should face after their turn. It's a fair system, if you fail, it's only because you did something wrong. Each battle is rather long and failing it can mean restarting all over if you didn't save or you initial setup is wrong. But it never feel like a chore to retry a battle.\nSome people have complained that the pre-rendered cutscenes look outdated because they're rendered in 720p. I can barely tell the difference, and that's saying something since I play all my games at max and 60fps. I suppose the difference is unnoticeable because of the anime-like art style.\nFull controller support. I actually played this using the PS3 controller and MotioninJoy DS3 tool\nThe bad:\nOccasionally, I experienced lag. It would usually last 1 turn, and would return to normal once you go from unit view to command view. It is quite infrequent and not a major problem.\nSo, if you're a fan of RPG, especially JRPG, this is a must have.","December 28, 2014","true","41.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Hmph.\n\nSeriously though it looks like a solid port in terms of technical standards, its Valkyria as you know and love it if you are a fan of the series.\n\nIf you are new to the franchise then sure take a look at this simply because its a grossly overlooked game due to its presentation. For an animated game the art style is beautiful, beyond that of any animated game I have ever played. The story is surprisingly deep as well and handles many facets of wartime life and experience.\n\nI will say I had issues when running 16:10 with letterboxing, but using an external tool has sorted that out. Edit: Sound issues have been fixed with a patch within hours of release, what a lovely job SEGA are doing with supporting this game. Though if you are still having trouble, try switching speakers to 5.1 mode and disabling all but the ones you have, sound should work perfectly then.\n\nHans/10","November 11, 2014","true","250.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Without a doubt, I can say this is my all time favorite strategy and PS3 game. It has a beautiful soundtrack along with amazing graphics. The game also comes with a colorful cast of characters and is very story oriented.\n\nNow, if you don't enjoy cut scenes . . . chances are you will still love this game. Although you may find yourself sitting through cut scene after cut scene, each help develop the story and truly tell you just what type of game the creators were trying to make. I'm also a bit disappointed on the game's length, but that's probably because of this games uniqueness that isn't offered anywhere else.\n\nI will also mention that this game does indeed have two sequels. Unfortunately, both were released on the PSP, so don't expect a PC port. Plus, only the second Valkyria Chronicle is available in English. On the bright side, there is a fan made English patch available online for those of you interested.\n\nTo sum up my lengthy review: BUY THIS GAME! BUY IT NOW!

Marina vaulted the end of the ladder, already in motion, dragging the body of the patrolman clear from the ledge before setting down.\n\nCherry Stijnen bunkered down against a chimney, reminiscing on another well-spent night in a Ted's company. “And he loves warming up as much as doing it,” she continued, “he takes off my dresses real slow, takes care not to just rip my clothes off... like, he treats me like a present, like, the kind with the pretty wrapping you want to keep, y'know?”\n\nMarina clearly didn't know, and didn't care. She crouched down over the edge of the building, staying out of sight while scoping the surroundings. “Two shocktroopers by the objective,” she reported in, ever mindful of her role in the team, “Engineer and shocktrooper bunkered on the east side, light tank providing cover. Scout concealed in foliage further east, no clear shot. Orders, commander?”\n\n“This is a surprise attack,” Welkin answered over the radio, “Take out as many shocktroopers as you can to cover our scouts' advance, then the engineer to make Largo's lancers stick to that tank. Rosie, take care of anything out of Marina's sights.”\n\n“I don't blame him, though,” Cherry effortlessly segued, “they are beautiful clothes. Got them through a mail-order catalogue in Gallian Girl. Took like forever to save up for them, but they were totally worth it. You know, you should try something flowy sometime, Marina. It'd feel, like, so much better than those jeans and tees you always wear, y'know? You'd totally look better for it...”\n\n“Ugh...Stijnen's right here, surely she can handle one scout,” Marina reasoned with the commander, squeezing the trigger and hearing the satisfying thud of an enemy falling dead. Please, get her away from me...\n\n“Negative,” Welkin replied, “if something goes wrong you'll need the support. Cherry will back you up. Until we're in position, the field is yours.”\n\n“...roger, commander,” Marina acquiesced, her shoulders lumping with a dejected sigh as she lined up a shot. Cherry noticed this, and moved to her comrade as she fired, dropping another trooper.\n\n“Aw, don't worry, sweetie,” she cooed into Marina's ear with a pat on her shoulder that would've ruined the sniper's shot, “It's not a lost cause! Once we get you into some good clothes, you'll be totally hot! Of course, we'd have to do something with those nails, too... mmmaybe some eyeshadow wouldn't go astray, either... but it's probably mostly the hair. We need to totally pull it away from your eyes, y'know, let the guys know, like, what they're getting...”\n\nYou stay the hell away from my hair. “That's wonderful, listen,” Marina managed through gritted teeth, looking up with a glare that stopped Cherry in her tracks, “I need to concentrate on this, okay?”\n\n“Oh, um, like, totally...” Cherry sat back down, watching the quiet woman absorb herself in her task. Marina could still feel the scout's eyes on her, and it unnerved her. Her aim was wandering over the enemy shocktrooper; arm, torso, leg, neck, clean air... She felt agitated around anyone, let alone someone as obnoxious as her. She felt the eyes on the back of her head leave, and her aim steadied...\n\n“We could probably do something about that personality of yours too,” Cherry commented, getting straight back into it, “it's no wonder the guys don't look twice at you...”\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥!? Marina's hands shook violently as she pulled the trigger, executing what was possibly the worst shot she had ever fired in her military career. The shocktrooper was thrown from his feet, a bullet flying through his lower leg. He went down with a cry, and a grimace of pain, alerting all his friends to the hostile presence. Marina shot Cherry a glare that froze blood.\n\n“Damn... Turner, move forward and finish that guy off. Wulfstan, what's going on?” Welkin asked from the radio, as the screams of the poor shocktrooper intensified briefly, before petering out. “Are you under attack? I can get Nelson there to back you two up...”\n\nMarina steeled her gaze at Cherry. “Won't be necessary, commander,” she said coolly, “I can deal with it.” Marina reached over, grabbing the scout by the scruff of the neck. Cherry gasped in surprise as the sniper pulled her close, and placed her lips over hers.\n\nWhat..? Cherry's eyes went wide as Marina's mouth closed over hers, as her tongue explored Cherry's own, lapping and drawing at it, trying to coax it into action, action that Cherry's mind couldn't make through the shock of being kissed by another woman. She's..! Cherry sat paralyzed under the ministrations of the sniper, and could only look blankly at her as she closed the kiss, pulling away gently, smirking at the scout. She pushed Cherry back sharply, Cherry falling flat on her behind as Marina turned back to the road below.\n\n“My roof,” Marina said, as she cocked her rifle, lining up a shocktrooper on the ground. She's... Cherry managed to herself as Marina put a bullet through the enemy's eyeball.\n\n“My rules,” Marina cocked again, turning to the rear base and lining up a second, sliding a slug under his visor. Cherry could still only manage to sit and stare bug-eyed at the woman, the synergy of weapon and soldier in efficient, cold-blooded unison, cocking her rifle a third time in as few seconds.\n\n“My way.” she finished, planting the third round into the engineer's ear, who went down like a sack of potatoes.\n\nWelkin's voice crackled again. “The road's clear! Lancers, scouts, move up and clear that tank!”\n\nThe whistle of Largo's rocket screamed from the street, ending with a deep, resonating explosion, the shot a direct hit on the tank's radiator, destroying the vehicle in one deft move. Alicia moved forward, her footsteps echoing on the cobblestone road. Marina smiled as she surveyed her handiwork, quickly glancing at the frozen scout before turning back to the ladder, leaving Cherry to gather her thoughts.\n\nShe's... she's good... She wasn't sure if she meant a good soldier or a good kisser.","March 29, 2015","true","17.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","14","16","12","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayvah/recommended/294860/","ayvah","Ayvah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayvah/","33 products in account","I was sold on the game Valkyria Chronicles because it was supposed to have good strategy in a turn based format, and it was supposed to be frank about the horrors of war in an alternate universe mash-up of the two World Wars. This is what I had read about in reviews, and my mouth watered with anticipation of seeing this handled with the flair of an anime.\n\nThe StoryThis didn't feel like a game about war or about the military. There is an analogue to the Holocaust when the evil army burns down a building full of Darcsens (a race of black haired people). All the death happens off-screen, and the Darcsens in your squad (including one who had been living with them for a few months) effectively react with, "Oh well, such is life." No one ever mentions this again.\n\nOf course, at another point the whole squad gets two weeks of leave because a named character dies. Everyone just decided to put the war on hold, I guess.\n\nAlso, the problem with the Valkyria. The game starts out being mostly grounded in the idea of warfare against enemy soldiers, tanks etc. But about half way through the game it throws that idea out the window and it ends up about these characters with superpowers, supertanks, and other absurd ideas that ruin the tactical grounding it established in the beginning.\n\nThe TacticsWhile the game is tactical, in a sense, often it boils down to rushing the enemy and shooting them in the face at close range to kill them before they can counterattack. The same tactic works for tanks which can be insta-killed if you strike their weak point. This feels like a poor replication of the battlefield.\n\nThe Command Point system is open to exploitation. There are many times I've spent almost an entire turn's worth of command points on a single unit who would single-handedly mow down the majority of the enemy. If the AI exploited this system as badly as I could, we wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nThe combination of these two factors make the victories feel rather hollow, as I never really felt the illusion of feeling like I was playing against an intelligent opponent.\n\nThe biggest tactical challenge you have in this game is enemies who spawn suddenly without warning in a location that is not an established spawn point. You can position a soldier in a great tactical position only to have a swarm of enemies spawn on top of him and kill him before you have a chance to react. The battles become less about genuine tactics and more about replaying the battles in order to anticipate these spontaneous events.","May 1, 2015","false","31.0"," 172 of 303 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","172","303","11","3"

(or better wait for sales, this is steam) it has been a while since I didn't enjoyed so much a JRPG and even more turn based ( ;_;).\nIt's very addictive and the hours playing go very fast. Like in XCOM you will get affection to some characters of your squad and maybe for your bad decisions you will see them die.\nIt's because that you will take so much care in the battle of what do you do and how. If you manage well your movements and tactics the game rewards you pretty well.\nAfter finish the game I just can say one bad thing about the combat, if you use orders with main characters you will become into a inmortal god (Rosie with orders = Rambo + Chuck Norris + Van Damme, insane).\nI killed the final boss in one turn in my first run.\n+Story\nIt's not the best plot ever but is enough for catch you into the game. You will have some cliches recurrent of japanese games but thakfully the guionist do not overdo this situations (and other stupid situations for do everything more good looking like use a flare in the middle of enemy camp during a infiltration, Eh!! WE ARE HERE!!!)\nIf you have watched Full Metal Alchemist it's the best explanation for describe the setting in this game, WWI weapons with some more actual tecnology, a country in the middle of a huge war, mysterious powers in the background... It's very close to FMA. Very recommended if you liked the anime.\nYou also  have a lot of lore for read if you are interested in the universe of the game and it will help you for understand better the actual war during the game. It's not a very dense lore so you dont will get bored reading a look of text.\n+Characters\nYou have a plenty selection of characters for your squad and every one with his own background and story that's why you dont want see them die and you try finish every battle without a lose anyone, like a true commander in some way you get into that role very easy.\nI miss some new exclusive characters after finish the game like Selvaria (<3) or Jagger. Anyways you have a lot of them for send to a certain death.\n+Graphic options\nIt's a game of 2008, I was not expecting much but you have a lot of resolutions options and for diferent hz of your screen and that is always welcome.\nThe game at this point can run even in a toaster and dont have any new features from consoles except the resolution.\n+Control\nI was expecting play this with a controller but it's perfectly optimized to keyboard and mouse and works better. Aim to the head with the 360 pad it's horrible.\n+Duration\n39 hours and I dont finished all the skirmishes and try to get rank A in every mission. The game is very complete and offer you a very reasonable amount of gameplay.\nReady at Dawn take note please.\n+Soundtrack\nIf you pay carful attention to the soundtrack in videogames like me I'm pretty sure you will love the ost of this game. A great soundtrack for a great game.\n+Japanese Voices\nYes! Dual audio! please keep doing this. The english subtitles in some parts are not accurate with what the character is saying (this happens often in a lot of games) but the most part of the time it's a good translation from the japanese.\n\n-User Interface\nIt's just a port with minimal changes with consoles but the main menu is horrible for navigate... You feel like "ey I can click here and go fast to the next page" but no, you cant and you must open submenus.\nThe graphic options can't be changed in the game and have a independent launcher just for that it's a little bit odd.\nWould have been nice a completly new interface thinking on pc and the posibility of use a mouse for navigate around the menus.\n\n\nThe game absolutely deserve the exist in Steam and I hope SEGA bring more japanese games to pc. Yakuza come to us.","February 19, 2015","true","39.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","0"

I actually had "Play all" option on and reading a book for a while and it's quite enjoyable.\n\nThe achievements for this game is really straight forward but it does take 2 full play though to get them all.\n\nThe length of this game is quite long. Animation and story does take a long time to go though and it's pretty interesting and sad at times.\n\nOverall 8.5/10 would be my rating.","May 25, 2015","true","103.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

This somehow became one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI'd played this game for years and the revival on steam was a huge deal for me being away from home so often. It's a very unique title, with a great artistic feel and a storyline I thoroughly enjoyed. They weren't afraid to push some boundaries with the story, taking a look into basically the holocaust and concentration camps.\nSomething about the characters, the way their stories flesh out the more you use them really impressed me. I would go back for a second playthrough and realize half of my "Squad" had about two sentences in their biographies and would decide to make up a new "misfit" squad of characters I've never used. The story just captivated me and I fell in love with the characters and universe of it. Replayability isn't the highest but SP-Campaigns or whatever it's called going back through the story with all the tech you've already found is a lot of fun. I love the tactical/strategic genre and while it is a PC port with some interesting controls it wasn't that hard to adjust to.\n\nThe game for the most part struck me as an artistic experience. Kinda like Shadow of The Collosus way back in the day. A gorgeous soundtrack, a unique art style, just a different kind of game. Maybe not a AAA title but to be honest I'm getting sick of those. Here's hoping this re-release is the spur needed to get the sequels here in the West! Assuming SEGA can un-screw itself with that PSP business.","November 12, 2014","true","61.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I really wish I'd bought this for PS3 back in 2008 when it first came out.\n\nBeing an avid follower of JRPGs over the years, I put this one to the side upon its initial release back in 2008. The reason? Well, let's just say I was turned off by the military based story driven narrative. What a fool I was! Now having played through a good portion of the game, I can happily say that this game is an absolute gem, and I should of taken heed from my friends to play it when I had the chance.\n\nStill, here I am now, and it's a fabulous game, with a great cast of characters, interesting story arc and gameplay......OH THE GAMEPLAY, how awesome thine are. Each mission is beautifully designed, in such a way I never feel like any of the missions are copy pasta jobs. Each one has their own corresponding story event, and style. For instance, sometimes you just need to clear out the bad guys in one mission, and capture the base, another mission requires you to sneak through an enemy encampment and survive, and another tasks you with destroying a behemoth tank, but in varying stages throughout the mission. It really is a feat of how level designing should be done.\n\nThe main character and supporting cast are very engaging, and the storyline is fun and sad, but very endearing and you find yourself having empathy for a variety of the characters. Some of it is a little cliched, but not so much that it becomes overtly obviously. Just enough for it to be cohesive, but not enough for it to be cheesy, a nice balance imo.\n\nAnyway, here is a quick overview summary of my pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic port, with optimized controls and very easy to follow.\n- As far as strategic JRPGs go, this has got to be up there with Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea. But completely\ndifferent in style, truly a tour de force of strategic role playing right here.\n- Colourful presentation throughout, basic, but polished well where necessary.\n- Superb music. Traditional JRPG styled music with a strong element of military based rythmes.\n- Intricate customization options from weapon/tank modifications to order commands and squad assignment. It's all up to you, great fun.\n- Relatively cheap game for such plentiful content.\n- Great characters that you actually will care about.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are a little dated (It's a 6 year old game)\n- The AI can sometimes do stupid things like jump over a sandbag, run around, do nothing, then run back over the sandbag and hide.\n- The game crashes occasionally for me in really annoying places, like during a mission or before i've saved after a mission. So remember to save at every conceivable chance!\n\nSo there it is. At the end of this all, I could go into far more detail, but all you need to know is this equation:\nDo you like superb strategic JRPGs - Yes?\nDo you like great storyline arcs, with fascinating characters - Yes?\n\nThen wait no longer, go and buy this excellent game!","November 15, 2014","true","90.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I had never heard of this game before I saw it on Steam for %75 percent off during a Sega sale promotion. I was browsing through what games were available and, unfortunately for Sega, reviews on most of the offerings were unfavorable. But Valkyria Chronicles stood out with overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I can say now that I've reached the end of the game that every positive review it received was well deserved.\n\nWithout giving anything away, it has a complex but not overwhelming battle system that is part turn-based strategy, part third person shooter, which remains enjoyable and challenging until the very last battle. The story is touching and keeps you guessing throughout each chapter. Simply put I've never played a game like this; with all the COD clones and sequels nowadays its really refreshing to see something so original in both gameplay and story line. The only unfortunate fact is that more people don't know about this great offering from Sega.","May 11","true","37.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akuzimo/recommended/294860/","Akuzimo","Akuzimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akuzimo/","179 products in account","This game is amazing.  Through cel-shaded visuals they somehow manage to capture the horror of war without being overly violent and gorey.  Starting with a group of militiamen, which are only citizens who were called to take up arms; a good portion of them being under 18 years of age (Oscar is 15, to put it into perspective), you fight battles that the army deems (without explicitely stating it, but you start to realize it as your characters would) too dangerous or trivial to send their own troops to do themselves (normally, these 'trivial' battles involve throwing your people in front of tanks or machine guns to "clear the way" for the actual army, something that would usually encur high casualties) because to the army General, you're expendable and nothing but peasants and farmhands and he's not far off.  While the General believes himself to be Aristocratic, your group in Squad 7 is anything but.  Welkin, the main character was going to school to be a teacher despite being the son of a warhero General himself.  Alicia was just a baker, Oscar, who is 15 wants to protect his sick brother.  You have people in your group who were in EWI (European War I), a girl who was a magazine model, outcasts, students, a singer, all just normal people which put into perspective that you're not leading a group of battle-hardened soldiers into war, but a group of everyday people who just want to protect their homes.\n\nThe game starts off lighthearted enough but quickly ramps up in ambience when Imperial troops start shooting civilians while running away. The battlezones start colorful and bright but quickly shift to bleak trench filled warzones where you start jumping into trenches and getting down and dirty using your Shocktroopers against enemy entrenched troops with flamethrowers, hand grenades and sometimes just sheer luck all the while dodging mortars flying around and machine gun/cannon emplacements you have to keep out of the line of fire of, it gives you a sense of satisfying trench warfare that even top FPS games can't match (and this is a turn-based RTS RPG game).\n\nThat is evident when the game puts your in its own version of a Normandy-like beach landing where you have to capture a beachhead from the Empire and get past machine gun bunkers on the cliffside that will tear any soldiers that enter their line of fire to pieces with no chance of getting to cover.  After that, you go up the hill where tanks are waiting and foot soldiers, past them you enter trench fighting, where you then run down another killzone with machine gun bunkers to make it to their beachhead base where they have soldiers and tanks waiting for you.  Well Squad 7, time to get to work.  What drives it home more is throughout the game you unlock chapters focusing on specific characters to see the more human side to them, and on more than one occasion your people raise the fact that the missions they are about to undertake has a high chance to get them killed, a far cry from your "Oh what, we have to run through a burning building, scale a mountain and survive a nuke?  No problem" FPS-like super soldiers.\n\nIt's a story about war, love, betrayal, loss AND it has satisfying combat and appropriate challenge?  10/10, would recommend to anyone.","November 17, 2014","true","41.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

At $20 it is a great deal, It includes DLC that cost about $12 on PS3. Even now if you were to pick up a copy of the game on PS3, it would run you 15+ dollars in most cases, so for just a few bucks more you get all of the DLC as well.\n\nThe one thing that has bothered me about the port so far is that the time inbetween missions does not have mouse support, but it is still pretty easy to navigate with the keyboard.\n\nLoadtimes are very quick, any 16/9 resolution that your monitor supports is supported by the game, and framerate is able to go as high as your monitor's refresh rate. None of that "let's lock the game at 30 fps for no real reason" shenanigans. Also don't worry about the lack of graphical options. It seems like many of the textures scale with resolution.\n\nMake sure to turn up your mouse sensitivity a bit if the controls feel a bit sluggish, it helped me out a lot personally. Other than that the controls are quite solid in their default state. As someone that has also played the PS3 version I would say that the controls are on par if not better than what was set up for the PS3 controller.\n\nThe cast of characters is quite large, and they all have their own quirks. A lot of them are likable too. There are a large number of squads you can field because of this, and even some characters with the same class can play a bit differently because of their personality traits.\n\nThe story covers quite a few serious war related issues, and there are a lot of great moments. Don't want to say too much about it though.\n\nIf it matters to anyone, Dual audio is present, so you can choose from the original Japanese, or English audio.\n\nBuy this game. It is also quite fitting for Veteran's / Remembrance day. From what I have played so far it is a solid port and definitely worth the cost of admission.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n+ Solid story.\n+ Great combat system where tactical decisions actually make a difference.\n+ Large cast of characters with many different possible squad make-ups.\n+ Smooth controls (turn mouse sensitivity up)\n+ TANKS.\n+ A good PC port.\n+ TANKS!\n\nCons:\n- Mouse support not availiable in the menus.\n- In engine cutscenes look a bit dated because it is a PS3 game from 2008.\n- It took this long for it to come to PC.","November 11, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

And duh, romance.\n\nWould definitely recommend this game if you like RICH STORIES and TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES.","September 18, 2015","true","88.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The PC port handles excellently with only a couple of minor issues, that being the lack of mouse support in main menus and the pre-rendered cut-scenes still being in the console resolution and frame-rate.\n\nThe narrative captured my interest from the very beginning with an intriguing and somewhat satirical take on world war 2. The turn-based combat system is both unique and familiar, reminiscent of the likes of XCOM, while operating in real-time on a bar of movement points until the turn runs out in a third-person-shooter style.\n\nIt’s worth a look if you love strategy or JRPG’s and a fantastic story to boot!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW6ZXxw9sQI","November 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Before i go into detail i would like to introduce the actual game to people who are interested in it.\n\nIf you just want to know about the port quality, you can skip this part\n\nTo sum the story up really fast: This game is about a war set in 1935 EC between 2 powers in europe, the Empire in the east and Atlantic Federation in the west, that are in need of a specific ressource. The Empire crossed the border to the west an attacked, thus starting the second european war. Your place in the game is Gallian, a country that always stayed neutral so far, but now has to fight and defend themselve because the country possesses huge amounts of the needed ressource. The story is told like a tale from a book, chapter by chapter. You will have a lot of cutscenes, maybe more than some people would like to.\n\nThe gameplay could be described as a strategic and really advanced worms with more specific mechanics. It's turn based with different units which can be upgraded. People who enjoy this type of game will definitely have fun with VC.\n\nRegarding the port:\n\nThe port seems really solid. Keyboard and mouse controls might need some practice, but they are working fine. Resolution and frame rate are changeable, no crashes or performances problems (frame drops etc.) so far. Only thing i noticed is, that the cut scene aren't affected by frame rate changes. These still seem to be in 30 FPS, also not sure about resolution changes effecting them. Doesn't matter to much, because it still looks great.\n\nOnly thing that bugs me is, that the changes to sound volume don't really adjust the cutscene volume. At least not for me. So consider turning down the master volume on your windows mixer instead of the volume control in the game to have some consistent colume changes.\n\nOther than that: If you know this game, if you enjoyed it on PS3, if you want to support SEGA and you want it on PC with all DLCs for 20 bucks or whatever, i think it's safe to say, that you can buy this. If you are still unsure, i recommed watching some streams on Twitch.tv first before buying.","November 11, 2014","true","16.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

It looks gorgeous, has a stack of content and seems to have an interesting tale to tell. Unfortunately, the illusion crumbles over time, resulting in a thorougly disappointing experience.\n\nIt is not a strategy game. It is a glorified puzzle game, and not a very good one at that. It's riddled with exploits, unbalanced mechanics and awful AI - the sort which will send infantry running head-first at your tank. There are some interesting ideas there, but it's just so poorly executed. The main strategy involved seems to be replaying missions over and over again to learn enemy positions and understand the often obtuse gimmicks and quirks - a railing which somehow absorbs all shots in chapter 10, for instance. It's a grind, and not an enjoyable or rewarding one.\n\nIf the story was great it might be worthwhile, but despite some early promise it quickly descends into trite dialogue and grating anime tropes. The attempt at a serious story is undermined by the juvenile battlefield quips and the dissonant nature of the objectives - throw your people into risky situations to win as fast as possible. It's hard to get caught up in a dark tale of the horrors of war when you have soldiers who squeal "Yay! Happy grass!" at the sight of a meadow.\n\nAfter forming such a positive first impression, I found this game profoundly disappointing.","March 23","false","21.9"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","31","51","2","1"

This contains all the DLC and some touched up visuals.  This is an EXCELLENT game.  It basically takes the events of WW1/WW2 as in that both wars are/have happened and the land looks exactly like Europe.  Everything else is different.  You play as a member of a militia group from a small country that's on the defense from the eastern empire (Russia area).\n\nGraphics have been touched up, it can be run at 4k pretty easily with GeDoSaTo.  Running @ 4k and 60fps causes some issues with tanks being able to move up hills.  The audio comes in english/japanese (and may have more, I never checked).\nIt's a turn based strategy RPG.  You level up your classes instead of individuals.  You upgrade your weapons and tanks between missions.  Grinding isn't really necessary.  The way the game is potrayed, you can't redo story missions but you can replay 'skirmishes' over and over again if you want.  It is helpful for new people to learn units strengths/weaknesses but it's absolutely n ot necessary to grind.  I played every skirmish once and was able to beat the game without much issue.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, a little challenging here and there.  Has a great cast of characters with great voice acting.  The story is really well done.  I don't want to spoil certain parts but it handles some situations that don't get featured in games all that much well.\n\nYou can save practically anytime and quit if you have to run to do something!","December 6, 2014","true","60.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I would throw all of my bananas at it. Because it deserves all of them and it is shame it didn't enjoy the success it should've gotten back in 2008.\n\nIt's essentially an SRPG, JIm, but not as we know it. It looks better, it sounds better, it plays better. Everything about, like letting you take direct control of your troops in a 3rd person shooter style, to having all your troops have distinct personalities, to having death be permanent, to the audiovisual design ... it all feels deliberate. The setting is also novel for the genre, forgoing the typical fantasy for an alternate WOII. It even comes the closest to actually depicting the Holocaust of any game I played, a pretty ballsy move by itself. Ok, there are some anime tropes in the story and characters and not everyone likes those, but that's just one tiny drop in an ocean of awesome.\n\nAdd to that a pretty solid pc port, letting you enjoy the watercolor pastel visuals in resplendent 1080p and 60fps, and you've got yourself a game you won't regret buying.

And apparently, the sales blew all expectations out of the water and made good old´ SEGA really happy, so hopefully that means part 2 and 3 will make their way to the west on PC as well.\n\nThis game is absolutely great! It has a bit more story than most games, and it´s also very story driven with the book chapter format, which means you really feel for the people in your squad after a while. It also helps that all characters are believable and distinct like real people.\n\nThe game has an interesting, tastefull approuch to handling difficult topics such as hate, revenge, racism, and <!spoiler alert!> deadly concentration camps. As anyone who looks at the store page can probably see, it basically takes place during world war 2 with different names for the participating countries and everything taking place in Europe. (or well, Europa...) Despite the overall seriousness the anime like story still has time for some nice extras like a sexy T&A beach episode!!\n\nEnough about the story, I am worried I might reveal too many spoilers for people who still have to play the game. Gameplay, then: it´s pretty good. It´s an interesting mix between third person shooter (GOW style) and turn based tactics. It works! Accept for some bad AI at times, but nothing too shokcing. Just that I have seen, for example, mortars not just missing my troops, but only hitting their own. And the like. But nothing which breaks gameplay.\n\nGraphics are great, anime/waterpainting style. :D\n\nfinally, about the port. It´s decent. good keyboard/mouse controls (altoughI use x360 controller), 60 fps or highser support, low sys reqs, and support for any resolution including 4k with textures etc. automatically scaling in quality.Pretty good, sega!\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this game! :3","November 30, 2014","true","30.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Two large empires are fighting for a fictional resourse neccessary for the survival of their empires, and it just so happens that you're peaceloving neutral country sit's upon a huge stockpile of the stuff. The forces invade your  hometown, so in retaliation, you take control with 'Squad 7', a local militia, with the goal of liberaing the country.  This involves inventory management, the researching of new equipment, squad training and more.\n\nWhilst this doesn't sound like a very unique storyline, the way in which the games explores the war, while still maintaining a very fictional feel to it is very gripping and individual. Without spoiling too much, you see close friends die, Nazi Germany scale attrocities, and locations which you grow an attachment to destroyed. In addition to this, the game features some highly addicting X-COM style squad management gameplay, both in and out of battle. The challenging gamplay, gripping story, and refreshing presentation all make for a great game.\n\nThis is a 10/10 in my book, the best game I've played in 2014.","December 25, 2014","true","42.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Obviously, it's the same game you played in 2008, only with a higher resolution, framerate, and (arguably) better controls.\n\nThis shouldn't have come as a surprise to me, but as a result of many abysmal PC ports by other companies, it did. This game has mouse support! While the menus and chapter select screens don't have a mouse cursor and make you navigate with the keyboard, the actual battles fully support the mouse, and it works absolutely perfectly. I would recommend you increase the mouse sensitivity, however; the initial setting of 50 is a bit low and I found 75 to be much better.\n\nUnlike Final Fantasy XIII's recent PC release, Sega actually allows us to change the game's resolution to just about anything we could ask for. What a concept, right? While the pre-rendered cutscenes are still locked at the PS3's 1280x720 resolution, the battles look absolutely amazing in 2560x1440p at 60+ frames per second.\n\nIn an age where many console-centric companies see the goldmine that is Steam and decide to hastily and carelessly port their games over, Sega has done us an enormous favor and made a very respectable port of one of the best games on the last generation of consoles. If you've never played the original on PS3, you absolutely owe it to yourself to pick it up now. If you're like me and have played the PS3 version to death, you still owe it to yourself to pick it up again to experience all of the enhancements that the PC version brings. If we're lucky, maybe Sega will decide to port over Valkyria Chronicles 2 and, if we're very lucky, Valkyria Chronicles 3 to Steam.","November 11, 2014","true","28.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I  really enjoy the game's character designs and the method of presentation their gameplay. It was nicely introduced so that the player can digest slowly and learn how to experiment with their tactics and such.\n\nMy comments about the gameplay is a mix between the usual RTS and third person shooters. I really liked this combination. This requires some planning before striking your enemies and advancing through the game.\n\nEach character has a unique combination of attributes that may be advantageous or prove to be a disadvantage at certain situations. This gives a very nice blend of mixing the character combinations and see how it works out. I hope there would be a relationship feature or character interaction in or out of battles just like in fire emblem.\n\nThe music kind of reminds me about my days playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and A2.\n\nThe developers design for this world gives some sort of an anime world, but that isn't much of a surprise from a game from japan.\n\nThough I really wished to replay old mission as I wanted to do better.\n\nANd the interphase change to accomodate PC gamers is satisfactotionary, I need some time to get accustomed to play this game.\n\nOverall, this is a game that is worth your money, I never regretted buying this game and I really hope a sequel might come up but I doubt that.\nOverall:9.5/10 Gameplay:9/10 Music: 9/10 Interphase change from PS3 to PC:6/10 Plot:10/10 Character design:10/10 Replayability:8/10","December 5, 2014","true","60.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

VC had two more sequels released in the following years of 2010 and 2011.  VC 3 was released in Japan only, and neither of the sequels were able to live up to the original game.  If you want to read reviews about the PS3 version, which is identical to this version, I would suggest you start here: http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/valkyria-chronicles.\n\nPC reviews here: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles\n\nI personally have sunk many hundreds of hours into the PS3 version.  The game’s main positive attribute is the amazing story, which is masterfully voiced in both English and Japanese.  The awesome soundtrack is beautifully composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has also created scores for Final Fantasy titles.  The extremely unique and breathtaking watercolor graphics produced by the CANVAS engine make this game’s art style literally one-of-a-kind, and now it looks even better in high definition thanks to the work done by SEGA to release the game on PC.  The game also took advantage of Nvidia’s PhysX technology to simulate realistic physics for debris, hair, clothing, grass, and more on the PS3.  Without a doubt, this technology will be coming to PC along with the game, and possibly be even better than before.  The game also boasts its own type of gameplay style; I would describe it as “a turn-based real-time third-person-shooter strategy RPG”, yes, turn-based and real-time together.  The game’s characters are very easy to identify with, or at least make a personal connection to one of them.  Throughout the story, the cast (50 playable characters with unique personalities) will have to find strength to fight in a war they never wanted, and to find solace in even the grimmest situations.  Each one of the characters carries their own personal set of “perks”, or as the game calls them, “potentials.”  These unlock overtime, and throughout the game the roster of more than one hundred characters each have a different set of eight “potentials”, some good, and some bad.  For example, a unit may gain the ability to occasionally fire off a barrage bullets without the enemy having any chance to dodge from the aptly named “undodgeable shot” potential.  Or, a unit may slowly lose hit points during their turn because they are allergic to the terrain.  This makes for a great strategic gameplay mechanic as you will have to change your line up of soldiers for each mission in order to have the best possible team for the situation.\n\nShort Version:\n+Great Story\n+One-of-a-kind art style\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Great Characters\n+Great Gameplay\n+DLC included\n\nTL;DR\nGet.

Having played lots of JRPGs on PS1 and PS2, I'd honestly have to say I've never encountered game play mechanics quite like this. Though much of the story is presented in a somewhat manga inspired "talking heads" panels format, the game is suprisingly polished in so many ways. The stylized "drawn" graphics, the comic book text sound effect words hovering over things in game, along with a nice bit of background information on characters, weapons, and the world available to read, and a story that's (thus far) been pretty fun all contribute to the game's uniqueness.\nThe combat system is also interesting, combining third person perspective real-time control elements with turn based strategy elements.\nThough by no means difficult, the game does offer a reasonable challenge on first play through, requiring thoughtful consideration of how much you want to upgrade your troop's levels through repeatable skirmishes. There are often a few approaches to combat situations depending on how you utilize your "orders" (aka special temporary buffs) and class types.\nI've not quite beaten it yet, and though the story has a rather cliche love interest as a dominant part of the storyline, it's been a fun game thus far.\nDefinately worth grabbing for $5 to $10 if you appreciate the art of game design. They did a lot of things right in this one, and the PC port is pretty solid (though I suggest using a control pad for moving your tank around. The controls get a little weird on tank movement if done with a mouse.)","January 24, 2015","true","98.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The colourful missions, the familiar yet interesting mechanics of mixing map-level strategies with third-person action, and especially the memorable cast all make a good job to entertain us despite the horrible user interface.\n\nLong version:At first glance, Valkyria Chronicles doesn’t look to be more than a game that tries to mix JRPG and tactical combat, veering a lot more towards the latter with game elements like an overmap to place units at, or tactical points spent each round to determine which unit to take control of in a third-person segment.\n\nIt’s not even a balanced game: not only you can reach maximum level and highest-grade weaponry near the start thanks to the DLC challenges, but even without them, a single defence-boosted scout can make short work of most maps. On top of all, soldiers have personalised abilities, so some are borderline useless (like half of the Edy detachment), some are demigods (the other half of the Edy detachment).\nStill, with self-control, players can find a lot of fun and challenge on each map, as they all try to bring something new, opening up myriads of possibilities on ideal squad composition, tactics, and strategy.\n\nThe story is every anime ever, full of quirky, light-hearted stereotypes, who– thanks to their extreme personalities– are all memorable and easy to form an attachment to.\nThe plot is set in an alternative Europe, where the evil Empire (a combination of late 19th century Russia and Prussia) invades a small country (Poland moved to the Baltic). We play the role of the defenders, whose adventures are really predictable, but thanks to the very anime-like tropes and characters, it is fun to watch. It has to be fun though, since the levels are so short that about a tenth of the campaign is spent by playing, the rest is us watching this visual novel type adventure.","April 14","true","115.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Best for every money!"\n\nBut as a gamer with tendency to realism and perfectionism... while playing I was confused so many times trying to get those achievements... so I'm not feeling the game concept was right. In fact, there was so many furious "Why?!!" and "Oh, really?!" while I was getting a perfect from this game, so my final count drops to 7/10.\n\nBuy it, if you're a fan of the games in total, or if you're deep into all the "J" stuff. The game will perfectly suits in your collection.\nAnd DON'T buy Valkyria Chronicles, if you can't stand anime stuff for long and want all the achievements. Or if you want a realistic story about war. Or good tactics game. Because there, to get "A" ("SS") rating, you need to forget about good strategies like move carefully, stay covered, flanking enemies and so on. To get "A" rating you need to pick one scout and run like hell on enemies positions, dodging tons of bullets.\n\nOne of the most intriguing features at the start of the game as unique bio's on every soldier in your squad, meaning different behavior at the battlefield... quickly becomes a burden, because almost everybody are broken in some way. That means, you cannot collect a dream team, you need to pick different people for every mission, even for different terrains, and hey! it is not so easy, because of the way the management in the game organized.\nTo speak of controls in the general... well, optimization from console to the PC went not too bad, but controls, and more of all, use of the mouse... can be a real pain. Especially while driving a tank (another potentially great feature went really bad on PC).\n\nWell, like I already said, game's a facinating - for anime fans, and may be even dull for those who aren't.

Please port some other great games, such as: Bayonetta, Hastune Miku: Project Diva, Sakura Wars, Shenmue, Chu Chu Rocket and others.\nHave a nice day :3","November 11, 2014","true","45.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Alternatively, it's what happens when the country that brought us Code Geass decides to remake Final Fantasy Tactics, except with tanks.\n\nIt's the 1930s on NOT EARTH and NOT RUSSIA is invading NOT FRANCE in order to capture their supplies of NOT OIL in order to continue supplying their NOT WORLD WAR TWO campaign against NOT THE ALLIES. You play as Welkin Gunther, the son of the former hero of NOT WORLD WAR ONE who has, for some reason, inherited his father's tank. Seriously. The thing is just sitting in his barn as if it were his dad's old Mustang, and not, you know, an armored weapon of war.\n\nThe plot takes the Final Fantasy Tactics approach of having a linear campaign with some side missions you can do to grind levels if needed. There is an interesting storytelling conceit in that the framing device for the game is a history book written about the exploits of your character and his squad during the war. . . like Final Fantasy Tactics. Except this is different because instead of moving a glowing dot around a map, you're turning pages in a book. And stuff.\n\nThat's basically the game. You watch a bunch of cut scenes, do a tactical combat mission, then watch some more cut scenes. Occasionally you visit your headquarters to train up your troops and research new weapon technology. So basically, what will make or break the game for you is A. how much you're willing to put up with linear storytelling, and B. how much you like the combat.\n\nI happen to like the combat a lot. Most of the combat takes place on a top-down map, with your units and the enemy units represented as circular icons. You receive a certain number of "Command Points," based on the mission and the number of special character units you take along with you. Each Command Point allows you to activate a unit one time. During it's activation, you jump into the unit's head, controlling it directly Gears of War style. During each activation, you can move a certain distance and take one attack. Attack accuracy is based on weapon and character skill, headshots deal extra damage.\n\nInteresting enough, Valkyria Chronicles seems to take a page from the tabletop game "Infinity," or perhaps the old board game "Space Hulk." Rather than going down the list and activating each unit once, you can choose to use multiple command points to activate a unit multiple times. This gives you a chance to, say, take a followup shot with your sniper when RNG screws you on the first shot, or unload multiple rocket rounds into a tank with your one anti-tank dude.\n\nCharacters are divided into five classes. Scouts carry bolt-action rifles, move fast, and have the best vision range. Lancers are slower, but carry anti-tank rockets that can penetrate tank armor. Engineers are a bit slower than Scouts, but are still fairly fast, and can repair your tank and replenish ammo supplies. Snipers are the slowest, but have great accuracy at long range. Shock Troopers. . . do something, I guess. I still haven't figured out how best to use these guys.\n\nAnd then there's the tank. It's a tank. It's awesome. It can roll over enemy emplacements, shrug off small-arms fire, and blast the hell out of their tanks. On the other hand, if it blows up, you lose. And it costs 2 Command Points to activate.\n\nAll this ends up forcing you to use the kind of combined arms tactics that characterized World War II. You end up using your tank as mobile cover for your infantry, picking off enemy Lancers while the Tank clears a path. Or you end up using the tank to bombard enemy positions to clear firing lines for your infantry. Good, fun stuff.\n\nTL:DR version: It's X-Com meets Final Fantasy Tactics. If that sounds fun, give it a shot.","November 12, 2014","true","38.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's not very tactical at times and the AI is really bad (either scripted to stay in place or run to a pre-defined destination), but the unique mixture of third person-perspective action and turn-based strategy somehow works very well, making the game approachable for the fans of both genres. Missions are varied and don't let the player get bored by repetitive actions. The game is very enticing and it's too easy to suddenly realize that it's 2 AM now and you have spent half of the night playing.\n\nStory: characters are cliche and plot is cliche as well. Whoever wrote them though made a very good use of those cliches though, making the characters very likeable and easy to get attached to. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of fiction world has ever seen, but it works. If you're a teenager and this is your first jRPG, you will probably love it.\n\nGraphics: stylized to look like hand-drawn Japanese animation. If that's not your thing, you may have a problem, but otherwise it's clear and easy on the eyes. The port to PC was done very well so framerate is smooth. As a side note, character design was taken care of by a rather well-known hentai artist and, surprisingly, did not result in tons of fanservice but rather gave the game a no-nonsense war fiction feel.\n\nSound: I'm obviously biased here as the music was done by my favourite VGM composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII among others). I will spare you from singing praises, just listen to the battle tracks which he excels at. Voice acting is very competent in Japanese version and average in English, where it's hit or miss. If you don't mind a liberal translation, Japanese voices and English subtitles are probably the best way in this case.\n\nSummary: definitely worth buying and playing. This kind of game is what you would expect to see on handheld consoles, which is all the more reason to try one when it finally got a PC version. Score: 9/10","November 14, 2014","true","52.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You play a militia squad of a small country attempting to protect your people from the the greed of two superpowers. That being said the game world has its own history and politics with only thematic links to reality. One such link is the inclusion of concentration camps, a dark topic which contrasts with cheesier, anime trope ridden, writing. There were multiple moments when I would cringe at the behaviour of these grown adult soldiers, but this did little to take away from my overall enjoyment of the game. What the story does that is most important is set up unique tactical scenarios where strategies from previous battles will not be useful. The levels are presented episodically so you are free to return to any level you have already completed. The game is linear, with occasional side missions being the only exception. Your squad is fully customizable, allowing you to select what class units you want, select their weapon, and to chose among a variety of characters with their own traits. The one disappointment I had was that I did not feel quite as connected with my squad members as I thought I would have. The focus of the character building is on a set of core characters, with the side characters getting their back story told through text that you unlock on a personnel page. I was, however, able to assign them roles and play to their strength in the battles. Outside of the battles you have the option to upgrade your units and equipment, though initially the equipment progression is linear. During battles you can play cautiously, but you are rewarded for completing missions quickly, pushing you to take risks.\n\nAll in all this is an absolutely fantastic game. I strongly recommend it.","November 21, 2014","true","70.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

By that I mean it has an extremely clichéd, childish, predictably mainstream Chinese cartoon format of storytelling and characterization that isn't even the slightest bit realistic or well-thought out, assigning trope after trope after trope of everything you've both seen before and haven't really looked forward to rolling your eyes at since middle school.\n\nBy this I mean that in terms of the way it treats WWII-era modern warfare in both theory and practice and how this applies to realism and storytelling, it's just like Battalion Wars in that it's just plain dorky and mentally r e t a r d e d. In other respects it's like a Tales series JRPG, or a Fire Emblem game, in that it makes extensive use of overused anime character archetypes and plot devices while considering such things as highlighting individual relationships between characters to be far more important than the overarching premise of the game itself. In any normal RPG, this is normal and even expected, but when you apply it to a turn-based, pseudo-RTS, WWII-oriented tactical military strategy game, it comes out looking extremely messy and awkward, to put it in simplest terms. For example, senior military commanders with extremely distinct and flaunty personalities are, at various times, physically at one another's necks when they should be realistically separated by several hundreds or thousands of miles of war fog and various logistical sensitivities, and each time they either try to duke it out face à face like kings did during the era of Bronze Age chariot warfare, or they just talk for a while, go their separate ways to "take it outside", and then throw their huge, disposable armies of nameless human pawns at each other until the loser publicly admits defeat and runs away. Meanwhile, your snipers make use of only very light cover and more or less taunt and flail about whenever they pick off some poor ♥♥♥♥er on the enemy's side from just 75 feet away; in real life this would guarantee that his hiding spot would be compromised and his head would get blown the ♥♥♥♥ off by countersniper fire or something else within 3 seconds, but yeah this is just a game and it's super anime so screw all that.\n\nBottom line, if you like your tactical wargames super realistic and no-nonsense logical, you might just hate this game and drop it before you get past the third level. If you can overlook the frivolous and typically shounen animu arrangement of it all (or if, for whatever reason, that's what you're actually looking for), then you should be able to take the time to appreciate what a fantastic job Valkyria Chronicles does in making up for all of its faults, with its addictive and challenging, balanced gameplay, semi-innovative mechanics, and Go-oriented rather than Chess-oriented approach to low-intensity tactical warfare. It's entirely possible you will either love it or utterly despise it as a result of its various pros and cons, but it's still by all means worth giving a shot if you've found it in any way intriguing from my review.","November 28, 2014","true","69.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

It is still a very good game and very much enjoyable if you are its intended audience and understand what the game is about, but it does show some age. The assets were made for 720p TV and it looks considerably dated today. The port makes almost no attempt to accommodate PC interfaces, resulting in a confused mess of Tab, F, Enter and Space Bar and delays when navigating the menus. Even the story feels old (even though it was a fine piece back in 2008) as today's games and anime have evolved into ones with better storytelling techniques.\n\nStill, VC1 remains an excellent title. There is great gameplay for those who understand what it is and an enjoyable story for the open-minded who don't categorically hate anime. The steam release is made even better with the inclusion of all extra content formerly DLCs, such as Edy's Detachment or expert skirmishes, all for this bargain price. And yes, it includes the Japanese voice option just as the PS3 version did.\n\nIf you count yourself as an enthusiast of turn-based strategy, you cannot pass this one up.","November 15, 2014","true","55.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/recommended/294860/","Nikriontra","Nikriontra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/","161 products in account","As a person that does not watch anime or has never played any Japanese RPGs, this game struck me as an awesome looking WW2 game with a Japanese twist. I was rather sceptical about purchasing it because I did not want it to be like the horrendous Girls und Panzer anime based on WW2 and World of Tanks. However, I can honestly say this game is AWESOME!\n\nIt ticks so much boxes in all the right places. The graphics has a nice cartoony yet pretty feel to it, gameplay is smooth and stable, and the story (which people have criticized) is actually pretty good!\nThe story is simple. In an alternate planet, in the continent of Europa (which is obviously Europe) consists of two superpowers, the autocratic Empire and the Atlantic Federation. After a resource known as Ragnite (which powers everything) goes scarce, the Empire invades the neighbouring peaceful nation of Gallia to take their Ragnite reserves.\nThe story is viewed from the perspective of Welkin, a nature-loving nerd who is caught up in the Empire's invasion of Gallia. There, he meets Alicia, a baker who took up arms to defend her town from the Empire long enough for its citizens to evacuate. The story telling in this game is sublime, and I found myself sucked straight into it after the first 10 minutes.\n\nAfter some mumbo jumbo Alicia and Welkin are drafted into the Gallian Army. This is where the game properly begins. For those who've played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, this is exactly like it. You have your HUB where you can recruit and train soldiers for your squad. There are a lot of different squad members you can choose, and each one has different voices and their own stories which I find pretty awesome. There are some characters you get attached to, like the homosexual Lancer named Jann (who is voiced by the same guy who voiced Jake in Adventure Time.) There is also a R&D department where you can buy upgrades for your weapons and tanks.\n\nThat's the story out of the way. Basically, this is the anime version of Xcom but with WW2 themes. Each round you can choose where to position who (there are five classes of units)  and battle. To move a unit, you have to use one Command Point. Unlike Xcom, upon selecting a unit to move, you take full control of them from a third person perspective, allowing you to run around, explore the map and fire at the enemies at your will. This is the same with tanks.\nAs the game progresses, the challenge increases.\n\nHowever, there are many moments where you will just think "WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BS IS THAT!" This game is brutal when it comes to the missions. You've  made so much progress in a mission, and then you fail all because of an absolutely STUPID trickshot that blows up the Edelweiss. *cough cough GIANT OP TANK cough cough* I've had many rage moments where I just slam on my keyboard in anger and alt+F4 the game in rage. Pretty much every mission was like that. Have one or two game overs that end in rage, and then have a stunning victory. Be prepared for it.\n\nOn that note, one of the things that I did not find enjoyable is that the game can become extremely difficult (such as the second mission.) These particular missions you have no choice but to use the method the game expects you to, not using your own strategy against the enemy. I found this a real problem in an otherwise perfect game. Especially with boss battles (I hate the boss fights in this game.)\n\nI really wish that one was able to choose their own strategy and use it against the enemy. While some missions do present this ability where there are multiple ways of winning (be it spamming scouts and doing a hard/fast approach, or go in guns blazing with the Edelweiss and a buttload of Lancers and shock troopers) it still isn't perfect. Due to the lack of variation in enemy types, and the linearity of the levels, there isn't a whole lot of Supreme Commander stye strategy going on here. Not to mention that the A.I can be a bit too smart sometimes.\nThere is also a grading system that grades you on how well you beat the mission. However to attain a perfect score you must 100% of the time do the super scout approach.\n\nThis is a good game. If you like turn-based strategy games like Xcom, this is the game for you. If you're a casual player (which is highly unlikely since Xcom isn't a casual game,) then don't go for it, and watch the anime (read below) instead.\n\nEDIT: I discovered the existance of a "Valkyria Chronicles anime" that is practically scene by scene anime of the game but with some minor story differences. It's not brilliant, but it's a hell of a lot better than *shudders* Girls und Panzer.\n\nEXTRA REVIEW!: Valkyria Chronicles Anime (SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nAt the time of this review I am seven episodes in, and there is not much I can say really except for the  differences in character for some people, namely um... ALICIA, WELKIN AND FALDIO! To add more drama into the show the makers added some sort of love triangle, so now Alicia doesn't know if she wants the W or the F. Speaking of Alicia, she's a total B*TCH in the anime. In the game, she's very caring and you can see she has a thing for Welkin from the start. In the anime however, she constantly yells at him, calling him a "weirdo." Well, you kinda would agree with her because Welkin is really weird in the anime, he constantly seems really oblivious to the situation around him, never serious as if he has a cloud in his head instead of a brain. I love the scene where Irene threatens to tell everyone he tried to ♥♥♥♥ her if he doesn't give her an interview and he starts laughing innocently as if she just told a funny joke.\n\nFaldio acts like a charismatic lady's man, but the way the writers wrote him makes him look like a generic  "jock." He automatically starts gunning for Alicia and tries to win her heart by doing stupid things, such as telling everybody they saw each other naked (Alicia caught him shirtless and flipped her sh*t, and Faldio snuck up on her putting up her washing on a clothes line and picked up some of her underwear, and again she flipped her sh*t.) and then used Greek history to compare them to Aphrodite and Ares.\nThe other characters are pretty much the same. Jann is still the awesome homosexual guy (except that he isn't voiced by John DiMaggio. Seriously, they should have made him deliver his lines in Japanese.) There are also some other characters such as Faldio's sargeant, but they aren't really that memorable. Also, they made Maximillian seem like such a boring villain. In the game he sees everything with a hint of boredom, and isn't afraid of showing his wrath when needed. In the anime, he's bored pretty much all of the time.\n\nThat's really all I have to say about the anime. If you're a big fan of  VC, then have a go at watching it. I think it has remained loyal to the essence of the game, but does attempt to deviate (which is not a bad thing!) They tried their best.","December 20, 2014","true","10.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I hesitate to even call it a bad game. In many ways, it's promising. The first six or seven missions are quite fun, moderately challenging, and really seemed to be setting the game up to be great.\n\nHowever, around the eighth mission, the game really takes a dive in quality. It begins to introduce "gimmicks" to levels, such as supertanks that can't be damaged until a cinematic happens, an immortal Valkyrie that can move around the map and one-shot your units, mortars that target random areas and force you to waste movement points to get out of their way, and armored cars that move around a city block.\n\nThe gimmicks themselves aren't bad. Advance Wars, for instance, was a franchise that had a lot of them. Huge cannons, giant lasers, tank-devouring blobs, etc., and yet managed to make them quite fun. In many ways, in fact, this game reminds me of the Advance Wars model.\n\nThe key difference is that in Advance Wars, it was easy to see how the gimmicks worked. You could easily view the range of the giant cannons or the movement speed of super-tanks. Here, that's not an option. The only way to learn about how the gimmicks work is to experience them firsthand, since there is no way to see their range, movement, or how they operate. As a result, there's no way to fairly deal with these threats without repeating a level a few times or savescumming constantly. If you're like me, and hate cheesing your way through levels, you're forced to replay a level multiple times just to see how the gimmick responds to each new move of yours (Oh, you didn't realize that the turn after the Valkyrie appears, she'd be able to attack all your units except the ones that were hiding behind your tank or the enemy's supertank? Hope you saved at the right turn with your single save slot!).\n\nHonestly, it's very disappointing. The first few missions were quite fun, and I really tried to press on once I started getting to the gimmicks, but ultimately, I can't recommend this game, even if you can get it really cheap. It doesn't reward skill. It just rewards savescumming.","May 19, 2015","false","15.1"," 128 of 238 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","128","238","2","10"

That being said, this is a pretty target-audience game, with a lot of focus on character development and relationships.  Rather than being overbearing (like many other SRPGs), creating such a memorable group with unique (if sometimes rather one-dimensional) personalities ties in well with the gameplay itself; you pick and choose certain companions for different terrain/locations/enemy types.\n\nThe gameplay itself is where the game shines: think of a tabletop RPG like Warhammer, for the tactics element (you move characters on a map), side-by-side with RPG elements (you gain experience, buffs, members), and minimal shooter elements (you shoot manually — sort of).\n\nIt is, overall, a great game.

Since it's much like Poland or France's lunch with Germany in 1939/1940 (or if you prefer Finland's lunch with Russia during the same time) the NCO pool is empty and they appoint Welkin Gunther as platoon commander of 7th platoon. With the lovely Capt.

Fully recommend this game! Let's drive these Imperials out of Gallia!\n\nLong Version\n\nOptimization\n\nValkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port, but I think that they did an excellent job with the mouse and keyboard transition (You might want to turn your sensitivity to 100). The game supports higher resolution and fps than the original, although cutscenes are still PS3 quality. As of 11/12/14 the sound mix for the weapons seem a little quiet than I remembered, but this is not a game breaking bug. No crashes on my end\n\nGameplay\n\nValkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy-third person shooter hybrid. Fans of the Xcom, fire emblem, or advance wars will probably find something to enjoy in this. In the game the player are given command points (CP) for each turn in a overview map. Moving a unit takes up CP and will turn the game into a 3rd person shooter. In 3rd person the characters are given an action points (AP) bar, which depletes with each step a character makes. The objectives for missions vary, but most of the time it requires capturing a enemy base, and player is encouraged with more XP and money to win with fewer turns. Permadeath is in place for any non-essential characters, so protect your waifus/husbando. I should mention that you have a couple of turns to tag fallen waifus before permadeath occurs. Your soldiers are all given a background and perks unique to their background. The leveling system is class dependent, so no worries on using new characters in later missions. There is a upgrade tree for weapons in each class as well, and each upgrade is applied to the class as a whole. Note: There is a almost gamebreaking strategy by the end of game, but there is a big difficultly spike in the middle story.\n\nStory\n\nThe game is set in a mixture of WWI and WW2, and your fighting for a neutral country caught in up in a larger conflict. Some of the stories and character rely on anime tropes, so if you absolutely hate that stuff you probably won't like the game. Ultimately the game is more about the characters and their reactions to the war than the actual conflict itself. I played on the PS3 and thought it was a humanistic stories slewn with optimism for a better future. By the end of the game I also connected with at least a few of the characters. (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers) This is also one of the few games that touch on racism in a mature way, so major props.","November 12, 2014","true","18.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That said, you won't need a flashy desktop PC with multiple graphic cards to enjoy it - it runs very smoothly on my 2 year old Dell XPS 15 (GT 630M, i5 Ivy Bridge).\n\nI haven't played the game on other platforms, but I am a fan of the genre (I loved XCOM, Shadowrun Returns, The Banner Saga, and turn-based 4X games like Civilization and Endless Legend), and I'm having a lot of fun so far. I really loved that there are voice options in either English or Japanese, and that all the DLCs are included. Being a history geek, I really dig the alternate history theme in 1930s Europe.\n\nI'll be updating this review once I finish the game (which won't be until for a few weeks), but it would still pretty much be a thumbs up anyway for all that I've said above.","November 11, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I ignored it for about a year because it didnt really interest me, but once I started playing i knew i was missing out.\nIt puts a nice twist on tactics based games. Once you select a unit, instead of moving them on the overhead map and attacking, you actually control the character in 3rd person view and can interact with the environment. When you are in the stage enemies can attack you instead of standing there letting you run past. If you are familiar with xcom the attacking system is a little different. Instead of rolling the dice you have a crosshair that you can move to different parts of the body. On human troops headshots do extream damage and on tanks they have radiators, which allows light infantry units to damage to damage the tank.\n\nThe story is eh, but the artstyle is great. Every character has personalitys or "Potentials" that can make or break a battle. Some units gets a defence boost when under fire, while one outright refuses to attack due to being a pacifist. If units are next to each other, there is a chance they will shoot with you when you fire, allows you to make some devastating combo attacks.\n\nDifficulty wise, it can be a roller coaster. On chapter 7 for example, you fight a very difficult and rather long mission, while chapter 6 and 8 can be rather easy, though the difficulty kinda levels out near the end of the game. Despite this, the game requires little to no grinding, which is a plus in my book. You can go the entire game without beating a single skirmish or extra mission.\nOnce you beat the game you can start again in New Game+, which allows you to keep all levels and equipment, which means you can absolutly destroy the missions you once had trouble with, and along with that, you unlock an extra difficulty on skirmishes.\n\nAll in all, its a great game. Is it for everyone? Of course not, its a strategy game with an anime-esq artstyle.","December 9, 2014","true","41.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The keyboard and mouse controls are far better than I'd anticipated from a port, so there's absolutely zero need to play this with a USB controller. The story, the characters and the elegant mechanics create an almost flawless package. In fact, as I'm only about four hours in, I'll refrain presently from leveling any complaints.

The only downside is that the pre rendered cutscenes are locked at 720P and there aren't that many options when it comes to visual quality but it's still overall great.\n\nThe story of the game is really good; if you don't like anything about anime you may not want to pick up this game because the game's length is at least 50% cutscenes/dialog but it isn't bad because it's pretty well written!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/recommended/294860/","CelJaded","CelJaded","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/","84 products in account","Valkyria Chronicles feels unique, looks gorgeous and is blessed with a great PC port, but its punishingly slow gameplay, unengaging story and jilted controls ultimately ruin what could have been a grand tactical adventure.\nEssentially an analogue for the events in Europe during World War II, this fictional account of those violent years blends elements of science fiction, low fantasy and classic war stories to create something that certainly feels a bit different from your usual turn-based affair.\n\nEach battle feels remarkably tactical and you'll often find yourself with only enough command points (or CP) to do half of the things that you really want on your turn; you're constantly being challenged to think out your approach in advance and trying to balance all of these concerns can get pretty stressful at times.\n\nIn a general sense, the story in Valkyria Chronicles is perfectly serviceable. The many cutscenes do a decent job of establishing the key players and side characters and there's a good cast of voice actors to make the English dub bearable.\n\nThe problem is that's there's just too much story with even the non-optional interludes quickly outstaying their welcome. The majority of cut scenes are those ploddy and often completely inconsequential sequences that the anime art style is known for; plenty of irrelevant exchanges illustrated through talking heads and static backgrounds rather than dynamic action and movement.\n\nObviously this game's cult appeal is partially due to its heavy anime influence, but it doesn't suit the more gritty Weird War scenario at all. What's worse is that the game tries to have it both ways; one minute you're witnessing a horrible scene with innocent people being shot down in the street and their homes burned to the ground, and the next moment you're being introduced to the squad's newest member: a cute little flying pig mascot that says "moink!".\n\nThere are plenty of plot analogues for racial discrimination too, but any meaningful message here is just offset by other absurdities such as a stupid romance angle, a plethora of submissive female stereotypes and a typical plot involving a super-powered ancient artifact that was once buried in legend and whose awakening threatens the stability of the world. Yawn.\n\nA lack of originality in this sense is hardly a crime and, granted, settling on an anime theme isn't always a recipe for instant disaster, but the tale that Valkyria Chronicles is, well, chronicling is just so ultimately boring at its core.\n\nAdding to this sense of lethargy are the missions themselves which, whilst somewhat entertaining for their tactical nature, go on for way too long; anywhere from 30 to even 60 minutes for the primary missions alone. The whole game in fact plays out in a very sluggish manner. Menus are slow to appear when clicked, troops meander across the battlefield at a leisurely pace and the pre-battle cutscene (complete with poor lip-syncing) can never be skipped.\n\nIndeed, the main campaign of Valkyria Chronicles does not seem to be terribly long, as the bulk of your time is spent watching cut-scenes and navigating the 'we're a JRPG, so let's bury everything under a ton of menus' style of interface. In case it's not clear; this is certainly not a friendly title for those new to the genre.\n\nThe controls are also puzzlingly awful. Each command is mapped to a reasonably sensible place, but turning your characters is a lot more difficult than it needs to be. As a console port, things feel a lot more natural when you use a controller (the menus don't seem to be compatible with a mouse for some reason) and the game's blend of turn-based plotting and real-time moving and shooting is undoubtedly better with a pad too.\n\nBut it doesn't stop the mix from feeling a bit awkward and nowhere is that more apparent than in trying to correctly maneuver the squad's tank- a maddening task if ever there was one.\n\nEngagements between troops also play out in a fashion that is way too random for a strategy title. Shooting at any enemy comes with an innate chance of your attack being evaded and there's really not much you can do about it.\n\nYou can be at point blank range with a rifle to the back of their head, but there will still be a chance that the shot will be dodged; not only wasting your precious activation point, but also chancing that your character will be ripped apart in the resulting return fire. For a game that also features character permadeath, it something that can lead to a few frustrating moments to say the least.\n\nAnother sin the game commits is in its lack of an autosave function. For a game released in 2008, this is quite simply unforgivable and woe betide you should your game crash during one of those 45 minute missions... I imagine many players have stopped playing outright because of this and I wouldn't blame them one bit if they did.\n\nIt's a real shame because on the whole the PC port is actually well programmed, the game runs well and loads new scenes pretty quickly in comparison to its reputedly slow console cousin.\n\nAt this point I feel like I should stress that Valkyria Chronicles is not a bad game as such. There's a unique setup, a great visual flair and some fairly entertaining and tactical missions to play through here. However, these good points are spoiled by mistakes that could easily have been avoided and I wonder how many fans have overlooked these failings because of a connection with the game's central theme and romantic sub plot.\n\nIf you're a nut for slow burn strategic titles with a dollop of randomness and you have an anime fixation, then by all means; play this game right now as you'll likely join the majority in absolutely loving it.\n\nEveryone else though would do well to steer clear of Valkyria Chronicles altogether; there are games out there that do this sort of thing a lot better without the protracted gameplay and cute flying pigs.\n\nRead the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","July 7, 2015","false","11.5"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","34","61","0","3"

I am very, very glad I bought this game then, and I was happy to buy it again on Steam.\n\nIf you love anime...well, you wouldn't be reading this, then, unless you wanted to argue with me about how I am an idiot for not liking anime. Just move on, because I'm sure you have some cutscenes to watch.\n\nIf you're like me, though, I do have to warn you that the cutscenes in this game - of which there are MANY - are anime as hell. I don't even need to go into it, though, because I am pleased to report that you can skip any of them - or all of them, if you want - if you get tired of watching Welkin and Alicia blush with embarrassment just from talking about bread with each other, or listening to the winged pig squad mascot have an 'oink oink' conversation with squad characters, or just generally annoyed by the anime of it all in general. So, skipping cutscenes = awesome.\n\nThe gameplay is GREAT. I wouldn't say the game is hard. It starts out very easy, but gets a very nice level of difficulty going for itself later on. The game is also fairly long. I've replayed the game a bunch of times on the PS3, and you really do get the feeling that you like playing it even after beating it two or three times. There are also the typical 'skirmish' missions that allow you to gain EXP and credits outside of the stroy missions, and they are fun, BUT there are only ten different maps for skirmish. There are varying difficulty levels, but to be honest they all feel the same except for the 'EX Hard' mode. The real disappointing thing about all of them, though, is that your ranking for each map is mostly based on the number of turns you take to complete the objective, usually capturing the enemy 'base' (walking up to a flag and hitting a button). Every map can be beaten in either one turn or maybe two turns, and so once you figure a map out for that rating, there's no real challenge even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nBut, that's really only a minor complaint. Figuring out how to get that one-turn victory is fun in and of itself, so it's not really a negative other than the limited replayability aspect. There's enough gameplay here to make up for it.\n\nThe game looks great. The art style is really neat, and really just looks amazing during play. The different classes and vehicles have a really nice rock/paper/scissors distinction going, and upgrading equipment, vehicles, and squad levels is not complicated - you can't really screw it up. The down side of this is that there's not a great deal of choice for you to agonize over. The real strategy for you is deciding how many and what type of classes you choose to field for any map rather than which squad members - most of them (except for the 'main' characters, which may or may not be required for a given map) are interchangeable. Also, you can actually switch squad members out during the play of any map and bring in other squad members to replace them.\n\nThe best thing about this gameplay system, though, is that you get to field enough squad members on any given map that you can deal with the enemies on the field in the way you want to deal with them. You can have a lot of really effective squad compositions, and it is neat to try out the levels in a bunch of different ways. Also, certain characters have affinities or dislikes for certain other characters, or may have different attributes trigger under a given set of circumstances that happen in game. These come in the form of both buffs and debuffs, and do really add to the variety. Some of them, particularly affinity-based buffs and debuffs, are really very amusing, and you find yourself laughing your ♥♥♥ off at the way some squad member reacts whenever his secret crush is around. It's well worth finding out all the good ones.\n\nYeah, I do highly reccommend this game. The gameplay really is a blast: it's not Xcom hard, but it's got a decent enough level of challenge, and the missions get big enough that you do have to spend time figuring out how to exploit the enemy. If you do like turn-based strategy, this game does it WELL, and you'll probably like it quite a bit.","November 14, 2014","true","118.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

I recommend this game to both fans of strategy games and fans of japanese games, and really, to anyone that is looking for a really good game at a really good price.","November 12, 2014","true","55.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Why?  Because it's easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time.  Fantastic, strategic gameplay.  Great replayability. Good story.  Loveable characters.  Challenges are pleasantly difficult.  And the added achievements are icing on the cake.  This is one of the few games I have that I am dead-set on 100% completing all the achievements.\n\nThis is a surprisingly well-done port.  Supports 1080p resolution which actually does make the game look even better (though cutscenes are all still in 720p, BUT still look good).  Controller support.  There'll probably end up being mods and post-process injectors to make this game look even better than it already does.  Aiming with the mouse is SO nice for precision shots, something that was often difficult on PS3 because of how much the curser moved with the analog sticks.\n\nYou OWE it to yourself to get this game.","November 12, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You play as a division within the Gallian military during an invasion of your homeland by the Empire, who has invaded your country for your plentiful Ragnite supplies.  If you want to know more about the story, get the game :P (or read a review with spoliers in it).\n\nThe mechanics of this game are such that it requires tactical thinking before moving your soliders.  Enemies will fire at you at will while you ar ein their line of sight and can kill you quickly if you dilly dally too much in action mode.  A quick way to deal with this is to plan your targets and move locations ahead of time and only change your plans if surpises arise (like hidden units that you have traveled passed or new enemy units that have your move location clearly within their los) and then enter fire mode asap or end the current action turn asap.\n\nEvery unit has strengths and weaknesses, for example scouts are a very fragile unit but can move the furthest and have the largest sight range.  On the other hand tanks take two CP per turn but are resistant to everything except lancers and other tanks (especially if you get hit in the weak spot).\n\nIf you plan to run around out of cover for most of a mission, you are going to fail it end of story.  Move from cover to cover and plan your attacks based on weaknesses and strengths and there are very few situations that you will not be able to handle if your units are leveled enough.\n\nThis version on Steam also has all of the DLC for the game so there is extra content that you may not have on your PS3 version as well as the Japanese voice overs.  Do yourself a favor, as well, and either use or buy a controller.  The control scheme, while doable on k&m, is tens of times more suited to a controller.\n\nYou are even able to replay missions as you go forward and have stronger units so for those of you, like me, that like to find a more simple or quicker stratagey can experiment to your heart's content.  You will even get exp and dct to use for upgrading your equipment and units from replaying missions.\n\nI really can think of no negatives in this game other than that the configuration menu is a separate exe file, like many other Steam games (SPAZ for example).  I don't consider it a negative though.\n\nThis game, on its own, gets a 9/10 from me.  I will knock of half a point (8.5/10 for the PC port as without V-Sync and frame limiting there is massive screen tearing and there are a few graphics glitches in crossfire/sli).\n\nI have this game on PS3 as well and have sunk hundreds of hours into it.  Not much is too different between the PC port and the console version.  Though there is one particularly nasty bug:\n\nWhen you go to the headquarters for the first time, do not do stuff at the training grounds and R&D Facility.  Instead just go there and get the basic run down and then leave.  Once you have visted these and the other two areas, leave the HQ and then save and re-enter.  If you do anything at the R&D or Training Grounds the game will crash upon attempting to return to Book Mode.\n\nThis is the only major bug I know of so far though I am a paltry 9 hours into the game (on Chapter 4).\n\nIf you like tactical games like FFT, Breath of Fire, or Growlanser then you will like this game.","November 12, 2014","true","22.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For those who haven't played it buy it here, you get the whole thing.\n\nNow onto review. A masterpiece. 10/10 Hardcore fan. Was so into it when I was younger.  This game took me by storm and revisited the days when the ps3 first came out and you are literally playing a wonderful story that has familiar elements of description depicted in WWII and WWI. However the game itself has you take the grand role of Welkin. Now I must state this games mechanics was unique. There was ways to upgrade, replay areas for cash(Yes farming for your upgrades and seeing characters lines and actions). The people have unique bios and personalities. There are some interesting facts and cross overs. You have a Tank (I'm not complaining).  The characters have their own coming of nature throughout the story. The side quests delve more into it as well as the bio from taking them into battle and having the reporter cover it. You play this game, you won't regret it!\n\nGALIA TO ARMS!\n(Spoilers ahead)\n\nThe feels of Isara...\nThe singing...\nYour characters can die.\nThere is Skies of Arcadia Vyse and Aika as well as Fiona (Medic)\nThe bios are funny... same with lines\nYour tank is your friend\nUPGRADE\nShocktroopers best cover fire\nScouts and Snipers best shooters\nLancers don't you dare miss\nEngineers Repair and grenade. Shots mediocre.\nInteresting side notes and cutscenes\nWelkin has a fan club, same with Alicia apparently\nI don't care if Darcsen, they are fine as hell!\n\nNow that the small stuff is out of the way.\n\nThe characters. Yes all of them have a unique story. The theme is befitting of the story and game. The plot is very well done and will play you out for some. One of the best things is that I can say about this game is that back then not everyone knew and when they finally did spread about it, oh man was I one of the few that had the hard copy. Still proud and never gonna forget playing this game and the memories. Now I'm playing here for old times sake.

So it is with great happiness, when I say that Sega has made a very good port here. Controller support, V-Sync, great resolution options, the whole shabang. The only thing lacking here portwise is the inability to use the mouse in the menu screens, which you will quickly get used to; the other problem is that cutscene quality is not changed from the PS3 version, fortunately the unique artstyle makes the game look rather nice even during those. Now as for the game itself, it's a turnbased tactical thirdperson shooter hybrid and boy does it work well. Move your soldiers about one at a time with your limited pool of command points, which are higher depending on your unit selection as some units provide cp bonuses when on the field. This game features permadeath for soldiers in your company who are not main characters, and each of these character has certain traits and a small bit of backstory to make their death oh so sad. I would recommend that any strategy fan pick up this game because there is nothing else quite like on the market, and this is something that you should definitely experience.","November 11, 2014","true","39.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Thus I was very happy to see that after 6 years, Sega finally decided to release the game on pc, and I was even happier to see that they actually put some effort into this port. I'm not going to pretend that it's perfect, as it has some pretty obvious, though very minor flaws. So far I have managed to enjoy this game fully without even having to bother plugging in a controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls feel very fluent, which in my experience is very rare for console ports. This pc version is definitely one of the better ports out there.\n\nThe game itself is also excellent. Turn-based combat mixed with a bit of action is definitely a hit. So is the story of the game, which is told in either well made animation or little conversations between characters that remind me of skits from Tales of -series.\n\nValkyria Chronicles has so far been the most fun I've had with a video game since Fire Emblem: Awakening.

Even though the background story is about war and opression (also include some racism), this game delivers it in a way that's not too dark, and makes you want to cheer for the characters in the story. Further along the game you might even sympathize with some of the antagonists once you know their background story.\n\nGameplay : The gem of this game. Even though it claims itself as a tactical RPG, it's actually a bit more than that. The freedom of movement in your action and the various methods you can do to complete a mission is what makes this game shines. Even the skirmish missions, which is essentially missions for grinding, can still be fun when you experiments with different completion methods. Though sometimes you will get frustated wishing for that one extra Command Points. :P\n\nCharacters : A LOT of characters, each with their own quirks which often will make you chuckle, or sometimes grind your teeth in frustration. Ex : those characters who sometimes forgot to reload their gun, too bothered to move, etc\n\nArt : I think I'll simplify it by saying that this game was once praised as one of the RPG with the best art on the console version.\nFair warning though, not sure if it's my PC or the game itself, but the there seems to be jagged edges on some of the textures especially when playing cutscenes. Not really that noticeable though.\n\nPorting Quality : A lot of games which were ported from console to Steam usually suffers from inadequate porting issues which causes a lot of bugs etc. What surprises me is the porting quality of Valkyria Chronicles is really good. Tens of hours into the game and I haven't encountered any problems yet. A big plus.\n\nExtras : The Steam version comes with all the DLC and also original Japanese voice for the game. Might be a plus for some people.\n\nConclusion : A must have game if you're a fan on anime style storylines, fun tactical gameplay, and pretty art to look at.","December 21, 2014","true","50.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Haven't felt this way since I played Fire Emblem for the first time on Gamecube.\n\nThe unique combat system, engaging narrative, and immersive atmosphere really make this game stand out.\n\nThe combat is essentially the kind of turn based RPG you might be familiar with from games like Fire Emblem, but actions are played-out real-time, with the other units on the map getting "attacks of opportunity" a la D&D. Difficult to describe, but that's the best way I can put it, and if offers a very unique and challenging experience.\n\nThe narrative and characters are filled to the brim with anime and RPG cliches, as well as real-life streotypes. The game seems to all but acknowledge this, without breaking the fourth wall, so its easy to not only ignore, but enjoy. There were moments, however, where the game's dramatic tension was dulled by the predictability of certain cliches. I, however, like to think I'm pretty scrutinizing when it comes to narratives, so perhaps this won't bother many people. And if you're not familiar with anime and RPG cliches, this shouldn't bother you at all, as the narrative is otherwise very good!\n\nThe atmosphere really complements the game. Behind all the light-looking, cutesy anime figures, is a very serious backdrop of a nation suffering from conflict. Being only 12 hours into the game, it feels like this seriousness could be played-up a bit more. Through all the info that Gallia is suffering from the war, the player seems to only rarely see the devastating effects of war first hand, and it works counter to the comentary about wanting to stop the war and bring about peace: if war means being able to kick ♥♥♥ and be a hero all the time, who cares about peace?\n\nAgain, I'm cynical when it comes to narrative, so this probably won't bother you.\n\nThere are a few other very nice touches about the game. The glossaries detailing the histories of characters, statistics and fluff info on weapons, in-game news reports about the war, the intricate cutscenes involving the main characters, the fun of customizing your troops gear and skill level. They all add icing on the cake!\n\nOverall, this game is a work of love, and it shows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/294860/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","It has become an increasing occurrence lately to see popular Japanese console games being ported to PC.  In many cases, these ports are half-baked without features many PC gamers have come to expect, but in Valkyria Chronicles, Sega has done a masterful job of porting over one of the PS3’s cult classics.  Valkyria Chronicles is a tactics strategy game that is not only a great example of PC ports done well (see the end of this review for a quick port summary), but an expertly crafted game in and of itself.  Though it has occasional pacing problems and runs a bit long, Valkyria Chronicles is solid enough in terms of narrative and gameplay that it ranks itself among other tactics greats such as Fire Emblem and XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nVC takes place in a thinly veiled, slightly more fantastical version of World World II era Europe.  The meat of the game is similar to other tactics games; you control a small squad of soldiers on a battlefield, each with different specialties and abilities.  A turn consists of moving and taking actions with these characters in an over-the-shoulder third person view, allowing you to move and attack with a personal perspective of the battlefield.  After using up enough command points, the enemy takes its turn, and so on.  Each victory nets you experience and money based mostly on how many turns you took to complete the mission, which you can then use to level up your soldiers and upgrade their equipment.  Progression is handled well and by the end of the game, I found myself pretty content with how far many of my soldiers had come in terms of skills and abilities.  Core combat mechanics are fun and satisfying, although I found that some mission-specific mechanics could have been explained a little better.\n\nBattles themselves feel well-varied throughout the course of the game, and usually strike a fair balance in terms of difficulty (later missions get pretty darn tough).  It doesn’t explicitly tell you, but VC does allow for saves during a mission -- a point of contention in some tactics games.  In many ways it is a nice feature because you may sometimes unwillingly send your allies into a hellstorm of enemy fire without realizing it, and it makes the game a bit more accessible to newer players.  The fact that VC gives rewards based on fast mission completion, however, means that it can be very tempting to continually save and reload once you understand more about the mission and the enemies you are facing (or if you make a crucial mistake).  Obviously that’s a choice that’s completely in the hands of a player, but it’s a serious temptation when you are effectively penalized for not doing so.  Unfortunately, mid-mission saving and loading makes missions a little less satisfying to complete and makes an already long game take considerably longer -- I’d encourage anyone playing VC with experience in this genre to use this feature as little as possible.\n\nValkyria Chronicles’ story itself is surprisingly pretty good, though it does take a long time before it gets interesting.  The plot gradually unrolls through a huge amount of dialogue, so be warned that this is a pretty long (30-40 hour) game if you want to experience everything.  Characters have some depth and relationships are multi-dimensional, which is helped along by mostly quality voice acting.  To Valkyria Chronicles’ credit, it takes the brutal atrocities of World War II head on, and does so with sufficient tact, but the juxtaposition against its whimsical presentation is a bit jarring at times.  Anyone who outright hates anime may have some trouble with the visual art style, though anime tropes are used sparingly and everyone but the most close-minded should find the characters and style perfectly fine, if not likeable.  It’s also worth noting that the musical score throughout Valkyria Chronicles is beautiful and very well done, from the opening title screen to the final battle.\n\nFinally, some quick port details.  I was able to run VC at 1080p at 60 FPS on a GTX 570 with no issues whatsoever.  It supports both mouse/keyboard and Xbox gamepad support, and works well with both.  Cutscenes are still rendered in their PS3 resolution, but look perfectly serviceable.\n\nOverall, any tactics fan will find a ton to like in Valkyria Chronicles.  For those less familiar with the genre, VC is a decent starting point in that it is not too punishing and offers up an enjoyable war tale.  Combat is rich and satisfying, and the sheer amount of content offered to the player is impressive.  It may be a bit much for those looking for a short and sweet experience, but for most players, Valkyria Chronicles will be worth every minute.","December 9, 2014","true","47.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In many cases, these ports are half-baked without features many PC gamers have come to expect, but in Valkyria Chronicles, Sega has done a masterful job of porting over one of the PS3’s cult classics.  Valkyria Chronicles is a tactics strategy game that is not only a great example of PC ports done well (see the end of this review for a quick port summary), but an expertly crafted game in and of itself.  Though it has occasional pacing problems and runs a bit long, Valkyria Chronicles is solid enough in terms of narrative and gameplay that it ranks itself among other tactics greats such as Fire Emblem and XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nVC takes place in a thinly veiled, slightly more fantastical version of World World II era Europe.  The meat of the game is similar to other tactics games; you control a small squad of soldiers on a battlefield, each with different specialties and abilities.  A turn consists of moving and taking actions with these characters in an over-the-shoulder third person view, allowing you to move and attack with a personal perspective of the battlefield.  After using up enough command points, the enemy takes its turn, and so on.  Each victory nets you experience and money based mostly on how many turns you took to complete the mission, which you can then use to level up your soldiers and upgrade their equipment.  Progression is handled well and by the end of the game, I found myself pretty content with how far many of my soldiers had come in terms of skills and abilities.  Core combat mechanics are fun and satisfying, although I found that some mission-specific mechanics could have been explained a little better.\n\nBattles themselves feel well-varied throughout the course of the game, and usually strike a fair balance in terms of difficulty (later missions get pretty darn tough).  It doesn’t explicitly tell you, but VC does allow for saves during a mission -- a point of contention in some tactics games.  In many ways it is a nice feature because you may sometimes unwillingly send your allies into a hellstorm of enemy fire without realizing it, and it makes the game a bit more accessible to newer players.  The fact that VC gives rewards based on fast mission completion, however, means that it can be very tempting to continually save and reload once you understand more about the mission and the enemies you are facing (or if you make a crucial mistake).  Obviously that’s a choice that’s completely in the hands of a player, but it’s a serious temptation when you are effectively penalized for not doing so.  Unfortunately, mid-mission saving and loading makes missions a little less satisfying to complete and makes an already long game take considerably longer -- I’d encourage anyone playing VC with experience in this genre to use this feature as little as possible.\n\nValkyria Chronicles’ story itself is surprisingly pretty good, though it does take a long time before it gets interesting.  The plot gradually unrolls through a huge amount of dialogue, so be warned that this is a pretty long (30-40 hour) game if you want to experience everything.  Characters have some depth and relationships are multi-dimensional, which is helped along by mostly quality voice acting.  To Valkyria Chronicles’ credit, it takes the brutal atrocities of World War II head on, and does so with sufficient tact, but the juxtaposition against its whimsical presentation is a bit jarring at times.  Anyone who outright hates anime may have some trouble with the visual art style, though anime tropes are used sparingly and everyone but the most close-minded should find the characters and style perfectly fine, if not likeable.  It’s also worth noting that the musical score throughout Valkyria Chronicles is beautiful and very well done, from the opening title screen to the final battle.\n\nFinally, some quick port details.  I was able to run VC at 1080p at 60 FPS on a GTX 570 with no issues whatsoever.  It supports both mouse/keyboard and Xbox gamepad support, and works well with both.  Cutscenes are still rendered in their PS3 resolution, but look perfectly serviceable.\n\nOverall, any tactics fan will find a ton to like in Valkyria Chronicles.  For those less familiar with the genre, VC is a decent starting point in that it is not too punishing and offers up an enjoyable war tale.  Combat is rich and satisfying, and the sheer amount of content offered to the player is impressive.  It may be a bit much for those looking for a short and sweet experience, but for most players, Valkyria Chronicles will be worth every minute.","December 9, 2014","true","47.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldeity/recommended/294860/","digitaldeity","Deity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldeity/","1570 products in account","Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy/tactics game, originally released in 2008 for the Playstation 3. The game takes place from an aerial view of the battlefield, and when you select one of your units you control them in real time from a third person perspective. The game includes many RPG elements such as experience points, leveling up, perma-death, and equipment upgrading. I won't go too deep into the explanations of the gameplay, as it's already on wikipedia.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Valkyria Chronicles was how gritty the story was, but how contrastingly puerile it's told. Bright and cheery storybook graphics, and limpid dialogue between the main characters undermine the harsh realities of the war going on in this game. The game does not shy away from mature philosophies and subject matter, and many atrocities such as racial cleansing, torture, and genocide are commited. And yet, nary a swear word is uttered by your characters as their squad-mates get ripped to shreds by a hail of gunfire, shedding not a drop of blood. It feels almost juvenile. But regardless of this, Valkyria Chronicles manages to tell an emotionally gripping narrative, expounded by the main character, Welkin Gunther. With his all-around likeable personality, optimistic yet realistic world-views, and brilliant voice acting, it's hard not to get sucked into Welkin's story and his relationships with his squad members.\n\nSpeaking of squad members, you can pick and choose from 54 of them. All of them are individually voice acted, with their own backstory and personal benefits and flaws. One may be allergic to dust and would therefore be unsuited to desert combat, as another may have been born and raised on a farm and be naturally suited for combat in the country side. Or maybe one is a lady's-man, and will perform at his best when near a female squad member to impress her. (Or a man's-man. Homosexuality is fully accepted in this game.) All squad members interact with each other, and whether they like or dislike the person they're fighting alongside can affect the flow of battle. Members with a high affinity for each other are more likely to use Team Attacks, where they both fire on the same turn when near each other. Others are racist, and will receive a debuff when near certain squad-mates. As you use squad members more and more, their backstory will be revealed, but if they die in combat, they stay dead for the rest of the game, ala Fire Emblem. This makes for a very immersive and enjoyable experience, as your squad actually feels and performs like a squad, with individual lives that you can directly affect. Unfortunately many times the immersion will be shattered by the aforementioned limpid dialogue. One of my members proclaimed that he wasn't dying, he was just tired and wanted to take a nap, before dropping lifeless to the ground after taking a tank shell directly to the face.\n\nThis callow dialogue is justified, or at least reinforced, by the setting of the story. Your character, Welkin, is a university student, living a carefree life studying nature and animals, far removed from thoughts of war. But when his hometown is invaded, he's forced to take up arms to attempt to defend it, and eventually enlists in the military. His lineage and experience defending his home town earns him the rank of lieutenant, and he is assigned his own squad.  Taking place in a solitary country being torn apart by a much more powerful invasion force, the country is forced to conscript the majority of the population, including women and children, to help retake their nation. The majority of your 54 squad members are under 20 years old, some even as young as 12, and have little to no combat training. As a member of the lowly militia, you and your squad are ridiculed and looked down upon by the members of the legitimate armed forces, and you'll often find yourself ordered on impossible and dangerous "suicide" missions that the experienced military won't take. Welkin is forced to use his vast knowledge of nature to find unique and unorthodox strategies, in his efforts to keep his squad alive. The story is told using CG cutscenes and simple dialogue sessions. While the story won't blow you away with unpredictable plot twists, (it's essentially a World War 2 allegory in an alternate history with magic) and it's not the most philosophical of war games, it at least tells a competent and emotional story, tied together with great character interactions, voice acting, music, and immersion.\n\nThe game progresses from story to battle at set intervals, (linear progression), but in beween missions you have the ability to take on many optional missions, mostly unrelated to the story but related to your squad progression. All experience points earned in optional skirmish missions are carried over to the story, as well as earning you Ducat, the fictional currency, which can be used to upgrade your weapons and buy more optional missions. The weapon upgrade system is mostly pointless, as most weapons and armor are upgraded from a single linear branch, not allowing much room for customization. The character progression is also pointless, as the entire game can be completed without levelling your characters at all, though it will be slightly more difficult. You can also earn awards and medals as you play, interestingly tied to the Steam Achievements. Your character is awarded the medals through in game cut scenes as you unlock more Steam Achievements. It's certainly unique, and adds motivation to unlock them all, as your merits are usually accompanied by new weapons.\n\nThe only downside to this game is poor tank controls. For some reason rotating the camera with the mouse causes your entire tank to turn, rather than just your turret. A small downside to an otherwise outstanding game. The upsides are a unique art style, unique third person/turn based tactics/RPG hybrid gameplay, intricately detailed squad interactions, tons of content, superb voice acting, perfectly suited music, tons of variability to your tactical approach, and every aspect of the game serves to immerse you in the life of a squad commander, including the uneccesary upgrade system that could've easily been left out. The unique but unimaginative story is neither a positive nor a negative, as while it's not nearly as philosophical as it thinks it is, it serves it's purpose well enough, and doesn't cast a shadow on the amazing gameplay.\n\nAll in all, this game has become my personal best in class for tactical turn based RPG's, mimicking, evolving, combining, and surpassing genre greats like Growlanser, Disgaea, Eternal Poison, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xcom, and Fire Emblem, so if you enjoyed any of these games give Valkyria Chronicles a shot. It's simply fantastic.","April 3, 2015","true","29.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

The game is set in a world war II environmen drawing heavily on real world issues to fuel the story with that fantasy JRPG flair to it. The environments and artstyle have that cell shaded appearance and makes the world more immersive and allows the game to age like a fine wine.\n\nThe gameplay mixes turn based combat where either side moves their troops and takes turns going after one another.  When it is your turn, you actively take control of your soldiers in a third person shooter style, whereby you move based on your stats and then enter a firing mode. The gameplay is mission based and the story component is told through cutscenes and mission dialogue, the mix works well athough it does seem a bit disjointed in terms of the journal setup. The classes are all moderately balanced although you will typically just focus on select characters as they "carry the fight" and the character cast makes every soldier feel unique. The cast of characters each have their own backstory with priority given to those in the main story arch of course, however completionists will enjoy utilizing all the characters and trying out multiple approaches to beat the missions.\n\nFull recommendation, regardless of whether you are a fan or this knd of genre or not, has tactical, JRPG, and WWII stylized elements all combined in the perfect blend to create an unforgettable gaming experience.","November 11, 2014","true","92.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Long compared to anything else.\n-RNG hates you and wants to see you suffer. Like all other RNG's ever.\n\nThat's literally all the flaws of the game. It's beautiful, has a large cast with unique voice acting, great combat mechanics, a good plot, and a very fair learning curve. It avoids pulling its punches, with enemy units often outnumbering and overpowering yours by a very significant margin, even from the early maps, where they'll have multiple tanks, anti-tank soldiers, snipers, and all manner of stuff set up in nasty positions. New Game + is a thing, and opens up extremely hard maps as well.\n\nOn the port side of things, it's a solid, proper port. It has its bugs, namely when going to higher FPS counts, but it looks better, runs better, and plays better than its PS3 counterpart.","November 17, 2014","true","40.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It plays like a mixture of Fire Emblem and Gears of War. That's gotta be worth $20, right?\n\nGood things about this game:\n-Graphics are stylish and nice\n-Sound is good, unless you're repeating the same mission again and again, but I'll get to that later\n-Combat is intuitive (doing stupid things will get your dudes killed most of the time)\n-it's an anime. This is good if you like anime.\n-The port is good, but you should be playing with a controller for an optimal experience.\n\nBad things about this game:\n-Mission 7 is frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm about to spoil it for you. Basically, you personally fight Hitler in North Africa and he's piloting a tank the size of a naval cruiser. When you're about to lay the smackdown on Adolf himself, Rule 63'd Rommel appears with an ancient space laser and kills all of your units, and then you probably get obliterated by a panzershreck. UNLESS, of course, you're replaying the mission for your second, third, or fourth time. By that time you'll know Rommel's on her way; otherwise it's completely out of left field and you'll lose have to repeat the mission. This is fundamentally bad because it ruins the experience. If Rommel had just slaughtered my men in droves but I still won, that would have been fine. But because of the instant-kill factor forcing me to repeat the mission, the whole experience was ruined. At time of writing this review, I've played Valkyria Chronicles for 12 hours, and 2 were spent playing that one same mission.  I'm not complaining that the mission was too hard, I'm saying it's just poorly designed and frustrating to basically require the player to have precognition or a strategy guide to clear it on their first try.\n\n-No character development or screentime for anyone aside from the 6 main characters (but then again it is an anime so what did I expect)\n\n-Wonky hitboxes on RPGs make it impossible to hit certain targets from certain angles, which leads to moments where a shot clearly connects but deals no damage. You'll know what I mean when you get to Mission 7.\n\n-Aiming controls take some getting used to. They're clunky, which can get you killed sometimes. Most of the time it's no big deal though.\n\nIN SUMMARY: buy this game. It's fun.","November 27, 2014","true","26.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I saw the art style (anime) and saw how amazing all the reviews on the store page, so i decided to look up gameplay. The first time i saw Alicia running at 1080P 60 FPS (something the PS3 version does not support) i thought it looked amazing, then i saw a few comments about this game having a great sound track, then i was sold. I would of bought it on the holiday sale, had no money. I'm such a sucker for games with good sound tracks, and this one didn't disappoint. It's pretty good to see Sega pushing out a game like this since i'm a big Sega fan. It goes on sale fairly often, don't buy it for 19.99 (even though it's definitely work 20 bucks easily) just wait till it's 9.99.\n\n- Solid story line\n- Great sound track\n- Great graphics\n- Great gameplay\n- Solid keyboard and mouse controls (kind of wish you could use the mouse on the main menu though, but space bar being confirm makes up for it though)\n- Comes with ALL the DLC free that was on the PS3 as far i know (pretty sure it's all of it though)","January 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Fortunately, in-battle controls are great, and the mouse works just like it should.  So basically, when it counts the controls are great, but when it doesn't it can be a bit annoying.\nThe plot and characters at times are almost saccharin.  A few missions in this makes more sense, as there is permadeath and the combat can be gritty.  The plot does its best to keep the whole thing from depressing you.\nThe game grades your performance on speed alone.  This means that if you want high grades on a lot of missions you're best off just using scouts and the occasional lancer.\n\nThe good:\nIt's a mix of strategy RPG and third-person shooter.  It works much better than it sounds, and it doesn't sound all that bad.\nEvery character is unique, and picking the right characters (not just character classes) can make missions drastically harder or easier.\nGear and tanks can be customized.\nAnnoying character?  You can permanently kill them off.

Unfortunately sales wise, Valkyria Chronicles fell victim to SEGA's little to non existent marketing and to a poor release date in the west. Due to this fact and because the decline of the home console market in Japan, the second and third games  were only released on the PSP. Sadly the third game was never even localized in the west. So, you can see that Valkyria Chronicles as a franchise had a long and rough ride, but don't let it discourage you. In the SRPG genre, it's one of the best, and in my opinion, it's also one of the best games ever created.\n\n-Art:            5/5 If you like anime, then you won't be dissapointed. Every character and enviroment looks phenomenal.\n\n-Graphics:   4/5 Valkyria Chronicles aged well, and compared to the original 720p version on the PS3, the higher resolution options and unlocked FPS helps it tremendously.\n\n-Music:        5/5 The soundtrack is a beautifully composed orchestra, you'll often find yourself humming it.\n\n-Story:         4/5 Valkyria Chronicles has a good story with likable/relatable characters, although it can be considered a little bit generic.\n\n-Gameplay: 4/5 The combat is fun and engaging, but since it's a tactical game, sometimes it can be punishing.\n\n-Overall:      4.5/5 While the fanboy in me wants to give it a 5 out of 5 (YES, i consider it THAT good!), i don't want to decieve anyone, so realistically it's a 4.5. The PC version is good, the keyboard and mouse works perfectly with remappable buttons and a mouse sensitivity option, so props to SEGA for that, it's really rare these days to get a proper PC port.\n\nWith the current price of 17,99€ (wich almost feels like a steal for such a great game), i can only encourage anyone who is thinking about buying it. Hopefully this time, SEGA will see the potential left in the franchise.","November 11, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sure the interface isn't fully incorporating a mouse but the pop-ups show what keyboards commands are required at the correct moments and you can "look" around with the mouse in a reliable fashion.\n\nStory is a good localization of what is your typical Japanese themes but set in the harsh reality of an industrial war.\n\nGreat musical score and the mechanics are reliable.

The port is fantastic; everything flows in combat and I never felt the controls (which can be rebinded anyway) were the cause of my failures, albeit the cutscenes will look weird as they're still in the 720p quailty from the PS3 version. The navigation and menus take some getting used to on the keyboard, but I definitely prefer to aim with a mouse in this game. The story is not the greatest out there, but this was first game ever to make me care about the minor characters. The main reason why I love this game is the gameplay (which should always be put first in my opinion), and this game really punishes you for little mistakes like being a centimeter away from sandbags and not retreating when your units are being overwhelmed. If you feel the game is too easy (which is definitely isn't) you can change the difficulty to a really hard mode, but only in skirmishes; I think the story missions vary from being a piece of cake to ridiculously difficult, which results in some frustration sometimes.\n\nThe game comes with the 2 DLCs:\n\nEnter the Edy Detachment:\nA short mission where you save a village from a raid and escape once you save the villagers. Hard as hell if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nBehind her Blue Flame:\nBasically you wreck the army as a general from the Imperial Army and it is badass.\n\nIf you have any interest or like for strategy games and like (or hate) anime, you should give it a try regardless because it's just that good of a game.","November 11, 2014","true","31.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Swap between KB/M and Pad without leaving the game and the button prompts swap on the fly.\n\nThe bad:\nMany things in the game tied to the framerate currently which can cause issues with a variety of things. Tank movement is wonky as the suspension seems to be increasingly spongy as the framerate increases. Interception fire is faster and more frequent as the framerate increases (technically balances against scout rushing maps, but makes some A ranks near impossible). Cutscenes framerate can vary wildly (playing fine for a while, then dropping to 5-10, then playing fine) if the framerate is above 30, possibly increasing frequency the higher the framerate.\nNo/minimal mouse support in menus, however default keybinds can quickly navigate menus after a small getting used to period.\n\nIf it's physically possible for them to find a solution to the framerate problems then this would be one of the better ports I've seen in quite some time. Otherwise running the game at the old 30 FPS limit will avoid the issues (as much as I'd like to run it at 60).\n\nGeDoSaTo supports this game, for those curious.\nGame also has an accompanying short Anime season that follows the same storyline.","November 17, 2014","true","69.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My only qualm is that, with KBM, tank controls are sketchier and difficult to get used to. A gamepad is generally preferable in this case but you can definitely play with either.\n\nThis is probably my favourite strategy RPG of all time. Progression through stats alone is not enough to get ahead, you have to adapt to the terrain and enemy team in every match to get ahead. Gameplay is engaging and fun, and very satisfying, though with some understandable quirks that could be corrected (but there hasn't been anything like this so they can be forgiven). Any given battle is a significant investment of time, and you end up getting a ton of mileage out of the game as a consequence. Each of the units and classes are useful in their own ways and you will use all of them healthily. It's well-balanced.\n\nThe orchestrated OST is stellar, the watercolour art engine is outstanding, voice acting is professional and draws from all kinds of actors. The story is probably overwrought with war movie tropes, but the world-building surrounding Europa and the background attributed to the characters, weapons and countries are captivating. It's a product of love.\n\nValkyria Chronicles is one of my favourite games of all time, is what I'm saying. The PC port captures everything great about it. Absolutely look into it, it's a unique game that anyone can enjoy.","January 22, 2015","true","48.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nizoreth/recommended/294860/","nizoreth","Zoreth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nizoreth/","129 products in account","Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 console-port from 2008. I can't make comparisons to the original, since I know nothing about it. The graphics are improved though, as the game supports high resolutions. You can't directly change any other graphical settings, but higher resolutions render the textures and shadow maps in better quality. You can also disable the console limit of 30 FPS to your native refresh rate for a smoother experience.\n\nControls are working in full gamepad support, as you can expect from a console port, but keyboard/mouse functionality is limited to the game's combat phases where mouse usage gets its debut. Menu navigation is managed strictly by directional buttons. I played it through using a gamepad, because it felt more natural as in how its meant to be played. I only used mouse for a bit of aiming support. That's where mouse is vastly more accurate than a gamepad. But it's not necessary by any means. The game is paused when you take aim. You can take your sweet time fumbling with the analog sticks if that's what you prefer.\n\nThe main story is cut in pieces of visual novel -like speeches, pre-rendered cutscenes (which by the way are lower resolution than the rest of the game, probably straight copies of PS3 version) and combat sequences. The story is as cheesy as any moderate anime series. It has the usual characters mental growth, bits of romance, drama and handful of twists and turns in the plot. It has the common manga clichés like a group of teenagers being in control of the world's fate and awakening to superhuman powers (kinda, if you see it that way - I try to not spoil anything). I personally love that stuff. This game is based on a fantasy world - look for reality checks elsewhere. The otaku in me noted the lack of "fanservice" though. That would be the only minus in my personal taste.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are a real treat to us turn-based/srpg lovers out there. Combat sequences start by positioning your units. You get a set amount of action points each turn that are shared between your units. One action point is used when you select a character to move (or two action points for a tank) and you can attack once before deselecting it. Moving itself is a blend of real-time and turn-based system. Running inside of enemies sight/range, they will fire at you. They stop firing once you stop and take aim to shoot - it works quite well. If you select the same character multiple times during one turn, they are each time more fatigued, resulting in shorter stamina bar which indicates how far you can move.\n\nYou can also use your APs to issue "orders" that you learn with more combat experience. Orders can be things like buffs to your units stats, healing or issuing a mortar attack anywhere in the battlefield. Although there's a decent list of different ones, I found myself hardly ever using them unless I was in a worrying situation. When you end your turn, the un-used action points are transfered to the next turn as a bonus. The enemy count tend to outnumber you the more the further you get, but their AI is, frankly, bad. You can use that to your advantage when planning the battle. The bad AI didn't really bother me. Rather, it balances the odds and helps you predict their next move.\n\nWinning battles award you with money and experience. Money can be used to upgrade your tank(s) and your mercenaries equipment. Experience is used to learn new orders and increase your character classes levels. Your units don't have individual leveling. Upgrading a shocktrooper class for example levels up all of your units in that class, potentially giving them new personal "traits" such as chance to trigger evasion bonus when under enemy fire or a shot that never misses the target. You can freely change the units you take into the combat. The experience you gain doesn't only affect those you take with you to the fight. They all gain benefits equally. Each character has his/her own "personality", stats and relationships. Good relationships with another character next to you in a battle makes both of them attack simultaneously when one of them attacks along with other possible bonuses. Bad relationships naturally decrease the peformance.\n\nBefore wrapping this up, I should mention about those white cloudy borders you probably notice in all of the screenshots of the game. Yeah, they seem kinda unnecessary and I don't know what it's about. It was a curiosity at first to me - why is my view obscured by odd cloudy borders? During the 3D enviroinment of battle scenes, you can sometimes see manga sketch -like black lines of the background within that stuff. Did I understand it backwards? Perhaps the colored middle section was a result of my imagination when the real game was actually monochrome pages of a manga? When you enter a smokescreen grenade, the whole screen is filled with that stuff and you only see black outlines of everything. Am I seeing something that don't exist? Hmm! ;] Whatever it may be, after short gaming I forgot about it and my eyes started to ignore the white. It's probably just how they want the game to look more dreamy with already pretty canvas-like graphics.\n\nOverall, this game exceeded my expectations. It's fairly easy game, but oddly satisfying and addictive to play. While the story might not be anything to write home about, I will remember this title by its gameplay system. I would recommend it to anyone fond of turn-based war games and anime. I give it five out of five stars. :]","March 10, 2015","true","44.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Playing this game has been a hugely enjoyable and thoroughly rewarding experience, and I already know that this will easily become one of my favourite games of all time. If you wish to know in detail why I feel this, please continue reading.\n\nThe storyline, for me, is flawless. I originally expected it to be a strange retelling of World War 2, but instead I was treated to a long and gripping plot including hugely likable characters and storyline developments that I genuinely didn't see coming. At one point it even brought me to tears. Until now I had honestly felt that I had grown out of JRPGs, but this game certainly proved me wrong.\n\nGameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles can be a very, very frustrating game to be honest, but frustrating in a GOOD way. Whilst it is true that character movement (and particularly tank movement) is a little clunky, I never found myself hating the game because of it. When I became frustrated it was because Valkyria Chronicles is challenging and very unforgiving. If you make a tactical mistake or stupid movement with your troops, you will be very lucky not to be punished for it and rightly so. This game makes no excuses for not holding your hand and giving you an easy ride. Similarly, it will reward you for thinking strategically and this is the beauty of the game for me. There was no lengthy tutorial detailing every single strategy available to me. You start the game with a simple mission, begin to naturally acquire a feel for the controls, and before you realise it you are thinking of ways to effectively move your troops and prioritise targets. Valkyria Chronicles masterfully hides what it is teaching you so much that you don't even realise you've progressed until you return to older missions and annihilate the enemy with euphoric ease. It's just a real pleasure to play through this game. It never makes you feel like an idiot or treats you like one, which for me is a trap that many current generation games fall into.\n\nGraphically Valkyria Chronicles looks surprisingly good for a PlayStation 3 game from 2008. SEGA have done a wonderful job of upscaling the graphics and sharpening up the user interface. I have no complaints whatsoever, and would even praise it for its use of a beautiful hand-drawn style cel shading which has aged considerably well.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly and thoroughly recommend this game to anyone, and I really mean that! I am neither a strategy game fan, nor a big JRPG fan (the last JRPG I played and really enjoyed was Final Fantasy VII!), and yet this game grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me in. It's simply a very, very good game and as a gamer I honestly wish that there were more games like this being made these days.","February 10, 2015","true","75.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally love that stuff. This game is based on a fantasy world - look for reality checks elsewhere. The otaku in me noted the lack of "fanservice" though. That would be the only minus in my personal taste.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are a real treat to us turn-based/srpg lovers out there. Combat sequences start by positioning your units. You get a set amount of action points each turn that are shared between your units. One action point is used when you select a character to move (or two action points for a tank) and you can attack once before deselecting it. Moving itself is a blend of real-time and turn-based system. Running inside of enemies sight/range, they will fire at you. They stop firing once you stop and take aim to shoot - it works quite well. If you select the same character multiple times during one turn, they are each time more fatigued, resulting in shorter stamina bar which indicates how far you can move.\n\nYou can also use your APs to issue "orders" that you learn with more combat experience. Orders can be things like buffs to your units stats, healing or issuing a mortar attack anywhere in the battlefield. Although there's a decent list of different ones, I found myself hardly ever using them unless I was in a worrying situation. When you end your turn, the un-used action points are transfered to the next turn as a bonus. The enemy count tend to outnumber you the more the further you get, but their AI is, frankly, bad. You can use that to your advantage when planning the battle. The bad AI didn't really bother me. Rather, it balances the odds and helps you predict their next move.\n\nWinning battles award you with money and experience. Money can be used to upgrade your tank(s) and your mercenaries equipment. Experience is used to learn new orders and increase your character classes levels. Your units don't have individual leveling. Upgrading a shocktrooper class for example levels up all of your units in that class, potentially giving them new personal "traits" such as chance to trigger evasion bonus when under enemy fire or a shot that never misses the target. You can freely change the units you take into the combat. The experience you gain doesn't only affect those you take with you to the fight. They all gain benefits equally. Each character has his/her own "personality", stats and relationships. Good relationships with another character next to you in a battle makes both of them attack simultaneously when one of them attacks along with other possible bonuses. Bad relationships naturally decrease the peformance.\n\nBefore wrapping this up, I should mention about those white cloudy borders you probably notice in all of the screenshots of the game. Yeah, they seem kinda unnecessary and I don't know what it's about. It was a curiosity at first to me - why is my view obscured by odd cloudy borders? During the 3D enviroinment of battle scenes, you can sometimes see manga sketch -like black lines of the background within that stuff. Did I understand it backwards? Perhaps the colored middle section was a result of my imagination when the real game was actually monochrome pages of a manga? When you enter a smokescreen grenade, the whole screen is filled with that stuff and you only see black outlines of everything. Am I seeing something that don't exist? Hmm! ;] Whatever it may be, after short gaming I forgot about it and my eyes started to ignore the white. It's probably just how they want the game to look more dreamy with already pretty canvas-like graphics.\n\nOverall, this game exceeded my expectations. It's fairly easy game, but oddly satisfying and addictive to play. While the story might not be anything to write home about, I will remember this title by its gameplay system. I would recommend it to anyone fond of turn-based war games and anime. I give it five out of five stars. :]","March 10, 2015","true","44.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Playing this game has been a hugely enjoyable and thoroughly rewarding experience, and I already know that this will easily become one of my favourite games of all time. If you wish to know in detail why I feel this, please continue reading.\n\nThe storyline, for me, is flawless. I originally expected it to be a strange retelling of World War 2, but instead I was treated to a long and gripping plot including hugely likable characters and storyline developments that I genuinely didn't see coming. At one point it even brought me to tears. Until now I had honestly felt that I had grown out of JRPGs, but this game certainly proved me wrong.\n\nGameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles can be a very, very frustrating game to be honest, but frustrating in a GOOD way. Whilst it is true that character movement (and particularly tank movement) is a little clunky, I never found myself hating the game because of it. When I became frustrated it was because Valkyria Chronicles is challenging and very unforgiving. If you make a tactical mistake or stupid movement with your troops, you will be very lucky not to be punished for it and rightly so. This game makes no excuses for not holding your hand and giving you an easy ride. Similarly, it will reward you for thinking strategically and this is the beauty of the game for me. There was no lengthy tutorial detailing every single strategy available to me. You start the game with a simple mission, begin to naturally acquire a feel for the controls, and before you realise it you are thinking of ways to effectively move your troops and prioritise targets. Valkyria Chronicles masterfully hides what it is teaching you so much that you don't even realise you've progressed until you return to older missions and annihilate the enemy with euphoric ease. It's just a real pleasure to play through this game. It never makes you feel like an idiot or treats you like one, which for me is a trap that many current generation games fall into.\n\nGraphically Valkyria Chronicles looks surprisingly good for a PlayStation 3 game from 2008. SEGA have done a wonderful job of upscaling the graphics and sharpening up the user interface. I have no complaints whatsoever, and would even praise it for its use of a beautiful hand-drawn style cel shading which has aged considerably well.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly and thoroughly recommend this game to anyone, and I really mean that! I am neither a strategy game fan, nor a big JRPG fan (the last JRPG I played and really enjoyed was Final Fantasy VII!), and yet this game grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me in. It's simply a very, very good game and as a gamer I honestly wish that there were more games like this being made these days.","February 10, 2015","true","75.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Pretty good story told through some of the best Turn Based strategy of last generation. The World War II inspired setting is really unique and gives some familiarity without hamfisting it down your throat.\n\nIn terms of the port: It's just about average. You can launch into a configuration window but all it really gives you is the ability to switch between keyboard and controller, although it does give you the ability to rebind keys! Which is often overlooked on PC ports.\n\nAnother problem about this port is that if you chose to use the keyboard, you'll have to use it to control menus since this has no mouse support for that. In combat you can use mouse aim and select units with the mouse but that's as much integration as it gets.\n\nLast but not least, there is no graphics menu....not that the game is worse for it since the art style is fantastic, but i was kind of excited to maybe see some AA or DSR options (which you could force through Nvidia Control Panel). It's not that big of a deal to me for a game as rich in art and atmosphere as this, but it certainly would have been an improvment.\n\nIn the end I plugged in my gamepad since this was clearly designed with a controller in mind and unfortanatly Sega didnt do much to give it a PC makeover. (It seems like it would be an easy thing to patch in, so this could be an outdated problem someday.) I am enjoying Valkyria Chronicles immensely and anyone who didnt have a PS3 last gen to experience one of the best tactical RPG's Sega has to offer, I highly recommend you pick this up.","November 13, 2014","true","33.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My only qualm is that, with KBM, tank controls are sketchier and difficult to get used to. A gamepad is generally preferable in this case but you can definitely play with either.\n\nThis is probably my favourite strategy RPG of all time. Progression through stats alone is not enough to get ahead, you have to adapt to the terrain and enemy team in every match to get ahead. Gameplay is engaging and fun, and very satisfying, though with some understandable quirks that could be corrected (but there hasn't been anything like this so they can be forgiven). Any given battle is a significant investment of time, and you end up getting a ton of mileage out of the game as a consequence. Each of the units and classes are useful in their own ways and you will use all of them healthily. It's well-balanced.\n\nThe orchestrated OST is stellar, the watercolour art engine is outstanding, voice acting is professional and draws from all kinds of actors. The story is probably overwrought with war movie tropes, but the world-building surrounding Europa and the background attributed to the characters, weapons and countries are captivating. It's a product of love.\n\nValkyria Chronicles is one of my favourite games of all time, is what I'm saying. The PC port captures everything great about it. Absolutely look into it, it's a unique game that anyone can enjoy.","January 22, 2015","true","48.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is often compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, even though it was released a full four years earlier; outside the similarities in the tactical game design, though, the two games are far apart in terms of visual/audio style and narrative.\n\nValkyria Chronicles' story is actually quite outstanding, taking on tough themes such as war and racism with due thoughtfulness. The long-winded presentation, however, stands out as a distraction. Cutscenes and conversations drag on for much longer than they should, and can make the battles feel too far apart. Even so, the emotions are strong and the story adds a great sense of context to the epic battles.\n\nOn the gameplay front, there are some areas for improvement. I would have preferred partially-randomized enemy positions and variety options (like XCOM's “second wave”) to improve replay value. Smarter enemy AI also would have made for a better challenge. Regardless, I love how organic the battles feel (no square tiles), and they hold up well across multiple playthroughs.\n\nStrategy fans will enjoy the tactical depth, and anime fans will enjoy the watercolor visual style and fun characters; fans of both are guaranteed to have a good time. It's good to see Valkyria Chronicles reach a larger audience on PC, and at the discounted price it's absolutely worth picking up.\n\n(Rating: 9/10 “Great”)\n\nNote: This PC version of the game includes all of the DLC.","December 28, 2014","true","43.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Its not anything revolutionary, but it is one of the best love stories (personally) in a very long time and a nice, simple war story. It did a good job of keeping my attention and the bonus maps kept the story flowing very well and not seem abrupt (except the beach vacation one).\n\nMoving onto the gameplay, this is one of the best Tactical RPG systems I have ever seen because there is a lot of room for creativity, devising strategies, and planning. You want to get A ranks? Well there is no set way to do it. The world is your oyster here and your mind is very important, more then the levels of your units (more on that later). There are tons of possibilities with class loadouts, creative exploitation of game mechanics (smoke grenade are a good example), and orders. I did use a walkthrough for a large portion of this game, but I found myself messing up instructions or the instructions not working. So what I did is make my own improvements to their strategies and found a way to do some of these in less turns. And unlike some other games where you can get a "god loadout" (Fire Emblem Awakening and Bravely Default come to mind), most maps have their own unique feature that this is prevented, therefore most maps aren't too boring or repetitive. Quickly on leveling, it isn't what a match rides on. You can be lvl 20 on a map with lvl 8 enemies, but still lose your A rank easily because of bad decisions.\n\nBad points about the game. 1) Some maps are way to stupid. Put Rosie here, use up all but two turns. Then put Alicia out and win. Another example is just putting Alicia out and only using her and getting an A rank (and I did this several times). 2) Most of the special weapons you hunt down aces for are completely worthless. The only notable weapons are the ultimate flamethrowers in the game, which are pretty much it. Otherwise there are like 8 sniper rifles that are worthless. 3) To get A ranks in most maps, it relies HEAVILY on the save/reload function.\n\nSide note: The anime is garbage. Welkin is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Alicia is a typical tsundere which was painful to watch.  Valkyria Chronicles 2 is supposed to be trash. Valkyria Chronicles 3 is supposed to be decent, but Sega won't internationalize it. So Sega hit gold once and then ruined it basically.

Pretty much like XCOM, but years before that. Everytime you select a unit to move from a top-to-bottom view of the map, you go down into the battlefield and move it yourself in real time. Enemies will shoot at you if they spot you, even though it is your movement turn, meaning that you can be killed if you don't do something fast. This game constantly switches between thoughtful decisions when planning your movement and sheer action when you are actually moving / attacking.\n\nHowever, Valkyria Chronicles also does a great deal at story-telling, world building and character development. It is some sort of allegory to WWII told from the point of view of some characters whose hometown just got burned down and enlisted into the militia to defend their country (a tiny, neutral nation, sandwitched between two superpowers). You become the C.O. of Regiment 3, Squad 7, and you proceed to pick the soldiers who will aid your quest. May I point out here that each and every one of them are unique and have their own background, personality and oddities, all of which will show up in the battlefield, whether you like it or not. Most of them are not even professional soldiers, but common folks like you that have nowhere left to go and are now stuck with you.\n\nOn top of that, the game is long, enjoyable and once you get started, you'll want to see it through the end. It was originally launched for PS3 in 2008 and now it has been ported to PC, improving it in the way here. It also has that good little "something" all SEGA games have. I can't recommend this game enough.\n\n+ As I said, great job at world and character building.\n+ It has to be the best story I have played thorugh in any game ever. Some of you may call it "cheese", and I can't blame you, but when a game makes me laugh non-stop in one sesion and cry like a little girl in the next, I call it a win on the developers' side.\n+ The battle system is pretty unique, if not a little annoying at times.\n+ Not taking the main characters into account, every recruit in the game (who, as stated, are all unique) can be killed in action if you mess up. Even though it isn't unreasonably hard, the game does not forgive. Remember that cute little gal who run around the battlefield, singing? Well, she's now dead. Forever. And it is your fault. Deal with it.\n+ Over 40 hours of gameplay average. Can be rushed or taken seriously, your pick. And all previous DLC is included in the price.\n+ The anime-like graphics recieved a boost in the port, and are now HD. You have to like the genre, though.\n+ Add a superb OST to the list. I think we can all agree on that.\n- The game will get repetitive if you play the entire campaign straight. Take your time.\n- Some battles can be dowright frustrating, and the "rank" given at the end only takes the amount of turns spent into account, not how well you performed.\n- The controls can feel a little wonky if you use a keyboard, especially when commanding a Tank.\n- The story missions cannot be repeated until you clear the entire game and start NG+. Then you can play them as much as you god damn like.\n\nDespite its flaws, this game still gets a full 10 out of 10. Seriously, it jumped to my list of best games I ever played in a matter of days.","March 31, 2015","true","81.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Guilty because I'm an older guy and it's obviously aimed at a young audience. On the other hand I still love Star Wars and Pixar movies so what the hell...\n\nThe game is set in an alternate universe World War 2ish with the main quest following one military unit and it's soon-to-be-a-hero commander as their own small country becomes the fulcrum in a continental war between two vastly larger powers. The enemy are also busy digging out ancient mystical artifacts which adds an Indiana Jones touch to the story.\n\nWell polished (and child friendly) as it is the story aspect of the game is not the draw here. It's fun enough with lots of chat between missions and builds relationships with your team well. It also ties in nicely with the upgrade systems for your tank and troops but it's largely filler for me.\n\nThe campaign features turn-based tactical battles which are great fun and have greater tactical depth and graphical polish than the last XCOM. However, Valkyria swaps XCOM's more random spawnings in favour of more varied and strictly set-piece battles and this sacrifices replay value for a more definite winning tactic and subesquently a more satisfying victory. Apart from the early missions you go in to each battle first time hopefully, but expecting to lose and learning from your loss.\n\nThere is a good mix of large mass combat and small squad missions as well as skirmish maps to be unlocked as you progress and I've really enjoyed puzzling through the campaign. 8/10","January 28, 2015","true","27.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is highly tactical and relies on the player to make quick decisions and think way ahead, but it gives newbier players the crutch of having an OP tank, so its alright for new players too.\n\nTL;DR for my morning rambling, if you like RPGs with guns and you don't get stressed out by tactical games, give it a shot. It's 20 bucks and it's a hell of a lot better than a lot of the more expensive "next-gen" games out there. The voice acting can be rough, but the characters are genuine and the gameplay is fun.","November 12, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its not anything revolutionary, but it is one of the best love stories (personally) in a very long time and a nice, simple war story. It did a good job of keeping my attention and the bonus maps kept the story flowing very well and not seem abrupt (except the beach vacation one).\n\nMoving onto the gameplay, this is one of the best Tactical RPG systems I have ever seen because there is a lot of room for creativity, devising strategies, and planning. You want to get A ranks? Well there is no set way to do it. The world is your oyster here and your mind is very important, more then the levels of your units (more on that later). There are tons of possibilities with class loadouts, creative exploitation of game mechanics (smoke grenade are a good example), and orders. I did use a walkthrough for a large portion of this game, but I found myself messing up instructions or the instructions not working. So what I did is make my own improvements to their strategies and found a way to do some of these in less turns. And unlike some other games where you can get a "god loadout" (Fire Emblem Awakening and Bravely Default come to mind), most maps have their own unique feature that this is prevented, therefore most maps aren't too boring or repetitive. Quickly on leveling, it isn't what a match rides on. You can be lvl 20 on a map with lvl 8 enemies, but still lose your A rank easily because of bad decisions.\n\nBad points about the game. 1) Some maps are way to stupid. Put Rosie here, use up all but two turns. Then put Alicia out and win. Another example is just putting Alicia out and only using her and getting an A rank (and I did this several times). 2) Most of the special weapons you hunt down aces for are completely worthless. The only notable weapons are the ultimate flamethrowers in the game, which are pretty much it. Otherwise there are like 8 sniper rifles that are worthless. 3) To get A ranks in most maps, it relies HEAVILY on the save/reload function.\n\nSide note: The anime is garbage. Welkin is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Alicia is a typical tsundere which was painful to watch.  Valkyria Chronicles 2 is supposed to be trash. Valkyria Chronicles 3 is supposed to be decent, but Sega won't internationalize it. So Sega hit gold once and then ruined it basically. Sounds about right.","May 28, 2015","true","38.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

REALLY lots of cutscenes.\nIt's more like you are watching an anime than actually playing it.\nIf you love anime, this game is really enjoyable to follow.\nthey got a freaking bonus episode (aka: fan-service) in there.\nthe funny thing is, you need to buy this bonus/extra chapter (with ingame currency). and this one special chapter cost a whole lots more than the other episodes. The first time I saw it, I was like. WTF.. why suddenly this extra chapter cost a fortune. But it was damn worth it\n\nStory: 9/10\ngood plot, lovable character, got both humor and romance in it.\nHas its happy, sad, and shocking moment.\nSome of the characters actually have a really nice development\n\nGraphic: 9/10\nit's an anime ffs, if you like anime. nuff said\n\nGameplay:  6/10\n\nThe gameplay is actually not that bad.\nIt's just the turn-base system is not really a "fair" and good turn-base mechanic/system.\n\nThe opposing team can 'free' shot you even if it's not in their turn.\nWhat's bad from this is that we/they don't have to reserve any action point to do so. This is why I call it free.\nAt some cases it can be ridicilously annoying.\n\nMoreover, when it's the against the AI, they can free shot you all the time.\nEven when you are just standing there, not using your action point to move.\nWhich is really weird for a turn-base game. And our unit only shot when the AI move (not fair dude, not cool at all).\n\nYou can move the same unit again and again, which can be exploit easily.\nAnd in most cases, perhaps it's the only/easiest way to finish the game with an A rank result.\n\nFrom mid until late in the game.\nOne of the class feels really OP, that you basically only need to use this one class to wipe the entire enemy team.\nHeck, in most of my missions, I only use 2 units of this class to finish the mission.\n\nThere are lots of characters in the game, but some is clearly stronger than the other and once you know it.\nYou will only use those same characters again and again. This brings down the diversity and i feel sorry for the rest of the character.\n\nRegardless of all this flaw in the mechanic.\nIt's still fun to play tho.\nFor anime lover out there, I can recommend this game.\n(or just watch the anime version)","July 13, 2015","true","50.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A big thank you to Firehawk for helping me see the game through the anime. If you haven't read his reviews you really should (someone give that man a job!)\n\nI love this game. However, it does have many, many flaws. Again thank you to Firehawk for helping me acknowledge what i knew but wouldn't accept.\n\nLet's get past the bad part, the gameplay. I won't go into too much detail as others (*cough* Firehawk *cough*) have done a pretty good job, but I shall summarise. Enemies that stand still and take bullets, moments where the AI is incredibly dumb, a very odd leveling system, unbalanced gameplay, some units that respond to incoming fire (scouts, shocktroopers and tanks) and some that don't (all the others) as well as several poorly planned scenarios. Oh you may need to have a certain tolearance for occasional poor dubbing and repetitive soundtracks. There that'll do. For full details see Firehawk.\n\nNow onto what sells this game, aesthetics and writing (though according to some the latter needed work). Beautifully styled anime graphics mean it is the best looking turn based strategy game one can play. Anime fans will instantly be in love with how this game LOOKS.\n\nThe best part though, by far, is the setting and characters.\n\nIn all my time video gaming I have never seen a game of this type that went to so much trouble, not only to create a great game, but also to craft an intricate plotline and give us great characters that we really want to keep alive. You REALLY feel like you have lost a friend and ally if a unit goes down and you are unable to get a medic to them before they die!  There are at least fifty (though there may be more i have yet to encounter) units All units divided into five classes suited to various combat roles. Each is genuinley an individual with they're own personality, strengths weaknesses and even little things like being a neat freak that can affect combat. All of this together equals a need to really think ahead, plan and use every advantage in order to complete your mission and bring all of squad seven home alive.\n\nSo yes if you play this game, play it as a form of escapism, or as a person who simply enjoys anime and beautiful design. If you are a hardcore tactical and strategy fan, you will be dissapointed. I will still recommend this game for people who are strategy/tactical fans or anime fans (or if you are like me, both).","March 14","true","28.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Epic battles with tanks and soldiers in an alternative history of Europe around WW2.  This game has amazing gameplay and requires actual strategy to make use of your units effectively.  One wrong step and you can say good bye to your forces and your chances of winning the scenario.  Fortunately, the game is fairly forgiving in many aspects, so survivability shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you are just constantly rushing into things.  The game has an amazing soundtrack, as well, with music very fitting to the scenes and battles.  The mix of drama, storytelling, and battles is carefully balanced and it's really nice that you can go back and watch most of the story content at any time.\n\nA tip to those who are having a hard time after chapter 4:  it's a bit tough to do, but rank up your scouts to rank 2 or 3 and do the scouts challenge in the second page of the skirmish menu (yes, there's a second page).  This will give a lot of experience points and cash for boosting your units, as well as an awesome rifle that dishes out tons of damage, despite it's short range.  Running through this scenario a few times will allow you to increase the damage factor of your scouts and engineers, increasing their effectiveness in many missions.","December 5, 2014","true","40.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The story is a reinterpretation of WW2, with fantasy added to the story. as Juck Fames puts in his review: you will enter looking for fun but will emerge with feels\n\n- Gameplay: is a mix between 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy (3rd person x-com i've seen people call it). This sort of combat gets you in closer to the battle instead of just seeing everying from up high, and for me personally being able to control my Squad in 3rd person helped me feel more attached and bring the feeling of war far better. Unlocking special orders you can issue during combat for granting various bonuses is not only immersive but strategically important as you go along to put it in short: Your squad will die without orders from their commander.\n\n- The characters: you as a commander of Squad 7 is put in charge of gathering a fighting force and there is easily more than 40 different characters you can recruit into your squad each with their own name, backstory, strengths and weaknesses. Each character will have set of "perks" showing strengths and weaknesses for example some characters might have "Sand allergy" and thus thinking about bringing that particular unit to a desert battle is not a good idea as it will result in damage over time for due to the allergy but brining a "City born" to a fight in the city will increase his/hers defense. These characters can die on the field of battle and thus you will have to replace lost soldiers.\n\n- each battle scenario is scored with a grade A,B,C etc. and based on your grade the more XP and Currency you will recieve. I am not a huge fan of that as it temps the player to find the quickest way to complete a scenario(you dont have to look far on youtube before you can find a guide that shows which maps can be completed in 1 turn) but i can see the enjoyment of hunting A grades after completing the game therefor i would recommend when first playing this game to take it a bit slower and plan you moves.\n\n10/10 - Im off to do a 2nd playthrough!

The graphics are beautiful, the story and characters keep it entertaining, the backdrop has been used often (WW2) in games but never from this sort of rural perspective. This game involves military cadets at a small country caught between two warring powers- but while you may be used to brawny, muscle bound CoD war machines, the characters in VC aren't so war hungry. They have weaknesses, fears and personalities all their own, and it hurts if they fall in battle.\n\nThe gameplay itself is both unique and fantastic, a major draw of the game. It uses a mix of turn based strategy and active movement- where you'll come under fire while moving, where cover like buildings, trenches and sandbags can really save you. You can sneak through grass- and each class has special abilities, such as scouts to spot those in grass, snipers which can't defend themselves but can take out enemies from a distance, and machinegunners which tear up close enemies as they run by on their turn.\n\nVC is what a strategy game should be- strategic, yet quick paced with every movement and position and action having meaning, and mistakes being very costly.\n\nI'll happily endorse Valkyria Chronicles as the best game of the PS3, and those who didn't have the chance on console should pick this up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zedrin/recommended/294860/","zedrin","Zedrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zedrin/","246 products in account","Shortened version:\nPros\n-Side character designs, vices, and backstories are diverse and interesting\n-This is a good concept, even if it's horribly implemented.\n\nCons\n-This game is SLOW. There are a LOT of loading screens, cutscenes you need to go through, in game cutscenes you can't skip, dialog bits, and even waiting for the enemy to move takes a long time\n-On that note, you can't fast forward enemy turns. Minimizing pauses the game as well.\n-This is a strategy game with a HEAVY reliance on random number generation and probability. Many chances are a complete hit or miss--you either succeed or fail catastrophically. Some people also refer to it as a JRPG, but the RPG elements are very limited.\n-That said, the game is also horribly imbalanced. Many of the super difficult missions can be beat in a single turn by exploiting certain properties of your classes, while others can be beat quickly with a scout rush. The random aspect actually contributes to this.\n-Characters fail to come across as realistic. They feel almost there, but still a step away from human. Repetitive dialog doesn't help.\n-Plot has some decisions that are questionable or just stupid. The ending in particular is senseless (more on that below).\n\nFull review:\n\nValkyria Chronicles seriously felt like a giant 30 hour sludgefest. As in I was slowly wading knee-deep in swamp.\n\nGood god why would a strategy game rely on random chances and probabilities for 80% of its actions?\n\nWhy are there so many loading screens? Why are there so many goddam cutscenes that, even if you can skip them, you still need to load and watch a second of them first?  Why are the credits unskippable?\n\nWhy is the dialog so long? Half the time it doesn't feel at all realistic. When characters interact, they usually reaffirm what each other said about 3 times, and they do it via repetition. (E.g., paraphrased: “Wow this bread is good! You should open a bakery!” After saying this like 2-3 times, instead of responding with “I’ve thought about doing so” or whatnot, the other character responds with something much more repetitious like “I’ve always wanted to open a bakery.” This is just paraphrased and isn’t word for word how it went.) Character interactions constantly feel a step away from human, which while it gets the point across, rarely feels genuine.\n\nThere was only one character death in the game that made me upset. The only other death I sympathized with wasn’t even a character with a name, nor were they an ally. The rest were anticlimactic, predictable, or just outright stupid. (”I love you so I’ll kill myself in a blaze of glory for your honor!” f**k my A-HOLE.)\n\nThe worst offender was at the very end, when you defeat the final boss. You literally have him about to surrender. He's disarmed, his super weapon’s been powered down, he’s weak and surrounded. Yet even one of your friends shows up and grabs him only to kill the bad guy in a suicide maneuver to atone for how he hurt you and and another team member earlier int he game AND IT'S SO GODDAM UNNECESSARY I'M ACTUALLY MAD. There was literally NO realistic reason for him to kill himself nor the final boss when they could’ve easily apprehended him. The icing on the crap cake? He kills them both by pulling the baddy-mc-badguy into a pit on board the carrier you’re on, which causes his deactivated weapon to explode, which causes the carrier to start exploding and basically screws the two main characters over. (GOOD JOB ATONING FOR YOUR DICKISH BEHAVIOR.)\n\nBeing an anime game of course there’s supernatural aspects, but it’s only ever used against you. One good character has special abilities, but they only show up in game context once for the first half of a single mission and you don't even get to control them at that time. That's literally it. It's a huge  letdown--I would've LOVED to turn the tables and command a super soldier against an impossible objective. If they wanted it to be a plot device, they should've kept that in cutscenes only, not actually put it in a mission and not let you use it.\n\nGameplay wise I love the concept and attempt at the approach, but the reliance on random factors is maddening and outright stupid. The way the game is set up, either things will go perfectly, or they'll go horribly wrong. There is no in between.\n\nSo you wind up saving at a spot just to avoid watching the debriefing cutscenes, and the unit positioning, and the map-start cutscenes, etc. Probably the start of your turn, or right before a big play. Now you have to hope a perk you have will activate or your character won't suddenly develop Parkinson's and miss a nearly point blank shot, and when things do go wrong and you do absolutely no damage because of it, you'll reload. If you forgot to save recently, then prepare to watch all the cutscenes that played all over again since your last save, watch all the dialog bits, over and over and over again, until finally the RNG system stops jerking with you and you can move on.\n\nWhether or not it works in your favor, because of the random aspect most missions you can just rush a full scout team and have them slip in and capture the objective. Balancing is non existent. There is no difficulty curve, just a probability curve. Skirmishes can be beaten in 1-3 turns via a scout rush. Campaign missions can be anywhere from as much of a cakewalk, or can be absolute bull difficulty unless you know how to exploit the class imbalance. (One 'difficult’ boss that can kill your units in milliseconds if you don’t have cover can be beat in a single turn with just a smoke bomb and 3 snipers. Another can be beat in a single turn just by rushing shocktroopers.)\n\nOh and of course, as you’re moving a unit around, if a perk activates randomly you’ll suddenly freeze and have a little mini-cutscene appear on screen as they say something gloaty, and then they get a perk to activate. Sometimes they can activate repeatedly during the same turn, btw. (Yay perk, boo WASTING MY TIME AND DISRUPTING MY MOVEMENT. One of Ted’s perks activated literally 3 times in a single move.)\n\nThe game has a horrible habit of also changing mission objectives on you at random, without warning. One mission has two tanks spawn on opposite ends of the map. The only way to beat this mission is if you knew in advance that these tanks were going to spawn, and you equipped both of your own with anti armor rounds so you could actually kill both of them.\n\nMy profile shows 30+ hours of play. About 40% of that was actually my gameplay. The rest was watching (and rewatching) cutscenes (some of which were unskippable), waiting for loading screens (there's plenty to go around!), and waiting for the enemy to make a move (even after they pulled some RNG bull and killed a key position of mine. Wanna restart? Too bad: you can't pause in the middle of enemy movement. You have to wait for their AI to tediously and meticulously finish. Even if they can easily kill you in their first move of their turn, they may decide to wait and finish you off during their last move.)\n\nI like a lot of the side characters you can put on your squads for their designs and backstories, and I feel like this system has a lot of potential, but beyond that this game was incredibly frustrating and slow as crap.\n\nI don't know why I bothered to finish this game. It was ticking me off for a while, and still does aggravate me.","August 20, 2015","false","33.8"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","29","54","0","0"

Glad to see that Sega at least made an effort with this one. A straight up port would have served me fine but the minor added features are most welcome (widescreen support, refresh rate matching,  japanese audio, and etc). An excellent port for an excellent game. Here's to hoping they bring over the rest of the series.\n\nI can't recommend this enough.

Keep that in mind.\n\nIt's day one of the release of this PC version, so a review might seem premature, but I played the PS3 version extensively and this seems exceedingly faithful to it.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the engine seems to have come across flawlessly, and the full range of resolutions available would at least indicate that it hasn't been a lazy port by any means.  Surround sound works well, M+K controls are well-implemented alongside the direct controller support, and the entire experience is smooth - as a port, I doubt we could ask for anything better.\n\nThe game itself is a predominently turn-based squad tactical game, although that severely undersells the charm and quality of the gaming experience it provides.  You're given a pool of 'command points' each turn with which to issue orders to your squad from an overhead tactical map.  View then shifts to the unit in question, and you proceed to control them in semi-realtime action, moving them and performing such actions as they are capable of on their turn (such as shooting, throwing grenades, healing, etc).  That unit's turn ends when they run out of 'action points' or when you choose to end it early, and view switches back to the overhead map screen where you can use your next Command Point.  This continues until your Command Points are used up and the enemy gets a turn.  This continues until victory or loss conditions are met.  It sounds simple, but like many tactical games there's a lot of depth available to you that you'll only appreciate by playing it.\n\nBracketing the combats are many well-presented story segments done in the game's signature watercolour style which are a joy to behold, as well as the opportunity to construct, expand, and advance your squad.  You also get to delve into the backstory of several of your squad members as they can get their own little sub-missions.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, you've probably spent 2 minutes now reading this instead of playing the game.  Shame on you!  This deserves to be a huge success on the PC, hopefully breaking free of the somewhat cult status it holds on the PS3.  Buy it now - Galia needs you!","November 11, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ports have not had the greatest history on steam, but rest assured, there are many things in this game that were done right:\n- Framerate defaults to 30fps, but this can be changed.\n- The resolution defaults to 720p, but this as well can be changed.\n- The controls are fully customizable for mouse and keyboard, and the game recognizes and works with the xbox 360 controller, so far as to have the buttons show up on the HUD in game.\n- Fullscreen can be toggled on or off\n- Don't forget V-Sync! Yay V-Sync!\nMost of these things are really what should be expected from a game on steam these days, so knowing that some ports are coming out with this now makes me happy (there are some that are missing these features that shall not be mentioned here, instead I will mention llamas: Llamas). What's even better than ports coming out with these basic features PC gamers have come to expect? When the games that are being ported are games like Valkyria Chronicles, this game is great! No really! You who are taking the time to read this should really consider buying it, if not for the game just to support the porting of games like this to steam.\nAnd also, TRADING CARRRRRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nDisclaimer: You may want to read a review that actually talks about the game itself before purchasing.","November 11, 2014","true","38.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like Skies of Arcadia, Anime, or tactical games even a little don't miss it!  The graphics have a very cool "colored pencil" cell shaded art style. The gameplay is equal parts turn based and real time and the story's vibe reminds me of the 16bit RPGs of old.  You command a squad of soldiers and have a certain amount of turns  to perform actions with each one. During your turn you control them in 3rd person view and move them around in real time. But when you decide to attack you drop into first person mode to aim and the action pauses allowing you to take your shots. The mechanics are well explained during tutorials in the game.\n\nThere are numerous classes and upgrades to each. The missions are creative and enjoyable in their own right but the story may be what is best about this game. It has a wonderful plot and set of characters in your squad. The squad mates have good character interactions and you'll actually care about them and who makes it thru the battle.\n\nAlso as a bonus for people who remember Skies of Arcadia..You can get Vyse and Aika in your squad!

This is a very unique game the only thing I can compare it to is Final Fantasy Tactics and XCOM. If you enjoy those games you will love this one. I love building an awesome squad that synergizes well. The only two down sides are the fact you can only rebind keys before you launch the game and the older cut scenes did not upscale as they were not in engine, sad but understandable for a six year old game.  The positive now really good mouse and key board support in regards to control and the actual in game engine looks gorgeous and scales well on most systems, I have amazing performance. Be warned this game does not hold your hand. You may find it easy in the beginning but rest assured I promise you there will be encounters that will challenge you and you will enjoy overcoming them.

There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for.  My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a "bad loss" where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile.

Amazing!\n\nSeriously, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. First off, it's a great port. Customize controls, muck with graphics settings, and easily use a mouse and keyboard if you wish. Well, sometimes driving the tank isn't the easiest with the mouse, but it's a pretty minor concern. Not only is the port well done, but the game itself is fantastic. It's like if Studio Ghibli made a movie about World War Two, and gave you interactive control over all the little battles in which our plucky protagonists participate. Think X-COM with an order pool.  I'm only about 5 chapters in, but the difficulty has been a nice gradual slope, and the system is complex enough that you can play around a little. Add in relationships between squadmembers, a nice little R&D and unit training system, and a boatload of solid voice work and you've got a recipie for awesome.\n\nMy ONLY real issue is the occasionally uneven pacing. Sometimes the jumps between discussions of minority rights and the horrors of war to lighthearted anime antics and squad-level hijinks can be a bit jarring. Of course, this could be seen as an result of the style and influences.\n\nAnyone who likes anime, military history, or squad-level tactics should give this game a really solid look.","November 13, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've spent as much, if not more time, simply watching the characters interact than I have playing the combat. If you don't like cutscenes or heavy narrative elements then I would avoid it.\n\nHowever, the narrative is incredibly well realised and absorbing. It's rich and touches on elements not normally found in games. The parrallels are easy to see, but unlike a more historically accurate setting the alternate earth allows for enough freedom that the story goes in unexpected directions. You can know what happened in WWII, but you can only guess what will happen in the game.\n\nThe mix of realtime and turn based combat is excellent, and I'm very disappointed that it didn't become a 'thing' as I'd like to play it in other games (Xcom, I'm looking at you).\n\nDon't expect fast paced action all the time - but the action it has is excellent.","November 13, 2014","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The cell shaded graphics are beautiful.\nThe gameplay is astoundingly fun for a turn based strategy game. (The style of gameplay gives new life to the type of game somebody would think of if they heard the tags used to describe this game "Strategy, JRPG, Turn-Based")\n\nThe transition from the original PS3 exclusive title from 2008 seems phenominal, graphics settings allow for higher resolutions and effects like shading scale accordingly. The game is said to run fantastically on modest hardware, and for me the loading screens are less than seconds long. There is also the option to switch out the English voices out with the original Japanese voices if listening to English VA's trying to fit a Japanese game is too much for you to bear. Other than some people being dissatisfied with the menu's lack of mouse support, the port offers excellent keyboard and mouse controls.\n\nThe cons of the port are as followed:\n1) Cutscenes are bottlenecked at the 720p regardless of graphics settings\n2)The Menu does not have mouse support\n\nLet it be known that I dont find the latter of the problems too particularly terrible. The way the menu was designed, using WASD to navigate is no difficult task and 'left click' still works as a selection key so there is little need to move your hands around switching from mouse to the enter key. As for the first problem, it too, is nothing particularly troubling; however it does dissapoint me that the cinematics are less than up to par with the remarkability than the other parts of the game.\n\nAt a modest price of $19.99 the game comes with all of it's DLC included, an incredible deal for anyone interested in this game.","November 12, 2014","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The battle system is a unique blend of tactical 3rd person shooter and turn-based rpg.  I won't explain any more since it's more practical to youtube the gameplay.  If I could recommend one game to buy out of all the games I have ever played, this would be it.  Read other reviews and see that there is near universal acclaim from those who have played this.  It is unfortunate that this game wasn't more financially successful.\n\nI hope that anyone considering this game will buy it so that there is some hope for a legit sequel.  Okay If you have to wait for a deal then at least put it at the top of your wishlist (Though it is worth the $20).  And if you won't put it at the top of your wishlist then at least put it higher than Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty.\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\n(1) Unlike some other ports, this game plays just as good, if not better than the original version.  Visuals are definitely better.  I can't speak to keyboard and mouse controls but it works just fine with a 360 controller.\n\n(2) One of the things I like most about this game is that there is no grinding. All battles progress you through the story. There is, however, an experience system and you can play though optional battles as needed if you need to level up your sqaud.","November 11, 2014","true","54.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Set in a loosely inspired WW II setting, you play as Welkin Gunther, a young Gallian University student fascinated by nature, who is drafted to the militia and made leader of squad 7.\n\nAs the story unfolds you will have to manage all aspects of your squad, from picking recruits, handling research to upgrade your weapons and equipment, to training your troops, among others.\n\nThe story is excellent with many twists and all characters being fleshed out, with complex backgrounds that end up justifying their personality and actions. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the few games that actually deals with heavy issues related to war, such as civilian massacres, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing, but portrays them in a mature way. Nonetheless it avoids being too heavy as you have the occasional casual moments with some respite between operations.\n\nThe combat mechanics are somewhat similar to XCOM. The battles are turn based, where you select your soldiers and control their actions. There are 5 different classes of infantry: scouts, shocktroopers, lancers, engineers and snipers who all have different roles on the battlefield, while Welkin uses his tank, the Edelweiss.\n\nThe graphics are simply stellar, as it uses an unique graphical style with the visuals looking like a moving watercolor painting.

Is it another Norse mythology thingy? Not in the slightest. "Valkyria Chronicles" is a (former PS3 exclusive) Turn-based Strategy JRPG heavily inspired by World War II.\n\nThe story is set in the continent of "Europa," which is basically Europe in the early 20th century with the borders redrawn and a few fantasy elements thrown in here and there. The continent is currently embroiled in its second "Europa War" waged between the Federation in the west and the Empire to the east. Caught in between these two superpowers is the nation of Gallia. A tiny principality of less than a million people which is caught in the crossheirs of the Empire, who're lusting after Gallia's vast reserves of Ragnite (the setting's all-purpose Phlebotinum). However, Gallia has one big thing going for them: EVERYONE AND THEIR MOE LITTLE SISTERS ARE *REQUIRED* TO HAVE MILITARY TRAINING.\n\nEnter Welkin Gunther (who's first and last names I keep getting mixed up), a Gallian university student who returns to his hometown of Bruhl just before it gets sacked by the Empire. After escaping Bruhl with his adoptive sister, Isara and his (not immediately) obvious love interest, Alicia, Welkin enlists in the Gallian Militia in order to defend his homeland. This being a JRPG, you probably have guessed that it will have at least some of the stock JRPG tropes, but I'll digress.\n\nBattles take place on two "layers," a map from which you issue "orders" (which are usually buffs that you can grant to your units) and select units to control. Upon selecting a unit, the map zooms in and becomes a third-person-over-the-shoulder-shooter-ish-thingy from which you'll have to transition from moving to aiming/firing at enemies (you can't move and shoot at the same time, kinda like "Resident Evil 4" to an extent).\n\nYour infantry units are made up of five classes:\nScouts, who have the most mobility of your troops, but no baseball bats.\nShocktroopers, who can deal lots of damage to enemy but lack mobility and have little accuracy.\nLancers, who--WHY THE HELL DID WE NOT INVENT EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE THAT COMES OFF THE TIP OF A LANCE HERE IN THE REAL WORLD?!--are your anti-tank guys.\nEngineers, who lack southern accents but make up for it in the ability to disarm mines, repair friendly tanks, and set up cover.\nAnd Snipers, who *aren't* compelled to throw jars of urine at your foes.\nIn addition to these classes, you also have a tank called the "Edelweiss" (not so "small and white" this time).\n\nBut to conclude, I think "Valkyria Chronicles" is a very solid JRPG with some interesting ideas and is quite worthy of the attention it's been getting. Buy it. It's cheap compared to how it was when it first came out.","November 15, 2014","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I never was able to play it on the PS3, but always wanted to.\n\nBasically, it's like an anime based on WW2 (with enough of its own thing to distinguish it) with a great story, loveable characters, and really fun and addicting gameplay at the same time. (I would also recommend people play it with the Japanese audio, the English dub is pretty good but I feel as if they don't pull off the characters' emotions too well).\n\nThe game itself looks great, a sort of weirdish arcadey type of animation that fits perfectly, the musical score is really enjoyable, and all the little elements of the gameplay like the Word on the Wall and other bits of narrative like character profiles is really nice and adds to the already great storytelling.\n\nOne thing I must mention is how this game has gotten me attached to the non-main characters. Of course Welkin and Alicia are present and strong as the main characters, but the soldiers you can recruit from the HQ each have their own personality, looks, and backstory, and though the majority of my soldiers are female (c'mon, with a game called Valkyria chronicles there's no way I'm not gonna have my own version of a Valkyrie 7th Squad) I'm still connected with them and hearing them cry out when they die (which happens a lot with me lol) is painful, and I can never leave a soldier to die.\n\nThe medic system itself is very useful for that, and gameplay on the whole is refreshing and only really gets better as the game progresses due to upgrades to characters, etc. All the little perks your soldiers can get (I can never remember them and probably don't pay as much attention to them as I should), as well as their de-buffs are really nice touches, especially the 'hidden potential' stuff. Even little things like attacking amongst friends which creates an overwhelming hail of lead is super cool, but I tend to not take that into account due to my playstyle.\n\nHonestly, buy the game, if you've read this far. Seriously. It's amazing, and I haven't even finished it.\n\nAlso Selvaria is badass I don't care what anyone says.","November 15, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems to be an untouched port directly from the console, with the biggest difference I've noticed being the blessedly sped up loading times.\n\nIt's turn based--you use up all your command points activating units, then your enemy does the same.  You select which units to "activate" from a two dimensional battle map, but after selecting a unit, the camera changes to a third person camera for the unit you've selected.  From there you run around and aim/fire like a third person game until you've used at least one item/attack and exhausted your movement points for that unit, or until you manually end that unit's turn.  You can level up your troops, upgrade their armor and guns, and customize your tank, so there are some "RPG elements."  The troops are also unique characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and quirky potentials that provide some variety even among units of the same class.\n\nIt scratches my X-COM squad-tactical-strategy itch, complete with permanent unit death, though not as punishing difficulty wise.  The cutesy animu style belies a story that is at times quite stark and serious, covering topics like racism, xenophobia and the callous indifference of war.  The experience is futher enhanced by a solid and memorable soundtrack, including one of my favorite vocal songs from a video game.\n\nA big thanks to SEGA for making it easy for PC players to enjoy what I believe to be one of the best games on the PS3.\n\nPsssst...

It brings joy, sadness, and ermuhgerd all doze feelz, along with an HD retooling to better suit the machines it is destined for.\n\nThe Great:\nStory is amazing, albeit very heavily weighted towards the end. Graphics could be said to be dated, but IMO doesn't show it thanks to the stylistic choices made - let it be known that sketch art is amazeballs. Strategy is simple for most missions, but getting the hang of the systems and how to exploit them will aid in attaining those coveted 'A' ratings.  Music is fitting and quite delightful throughout. Additionally, people say the english VA is campy, but I found them to be pretty spot on.  If it bugs you, you can use the original JAV tracks instead. Finally, the game is of a good length; not too long but not too short. I made it through in around 30 hours with minimal grinding (which wasn't necessary, by the way.)\n\nThe Not-So-Great:\nThose PC Controls.... dear lord they are convoluted and nonsensical. Do yourself a favor, plug in your X360 controller for the best experience. Also, play with your framerate locked to 60Hz until the issue with tank physics is patched... otherwise, your tank won't be able to traverse semi-steep terrain which, while not required, is helpful in various missions.\n\nAs an addendum: SEGA needs to release the two sequels on PC as well. I don't care that they were PSP titles, I WANT MORE OF THOSE FEELS! It's a quaint, well-realized world built with enough history and detail that I sat up and read all of the lore. I haven't done so since the first Mass Effect.

It also comes bundled with ALL the DLC.

I picked this game up on sale for $10, and it was the best $10 i've spent. Even when it's not on sale I would recommend this game. My first look at the game; I was kinda unsure about if it would be good or not, but I feel like it was amazing after I have played it. I didn't know about the JRPG, Anime game style, but it turned out to be great. When I first got into the game, I was stunned from how great everything looked. It was beautiful. Everything looked so pretty down to the grass on the ground.\n\nThe Characters in Valkyria Chronicles are so great. Every single one of them in their own way, whether it be that they are cool, nice, kind, or if they are cold hearted, hateful, or jerk. The two protagonists of the game are: Welkin Gunther, and Alicia Melchiott. These are my favorite characters in the game, because of there background (SPOILER ALERT) their romantic relationship formed throughout the game. Welkin Gunther is a man in hie early 20s, that gets dragged into a war. Welkin is drafted into squad 7 as a lieutenant, who is also a tank commander of the tank Edelweiss. He is in love with nature, and wants to become a teacher. Alicia Melchiott is a woman the age of 19 who was formaly a baker, who later on got drafted into squad 7 as a sergeant, because of her role in the Bruhl town watch. There are also other main characters such as Largo Potter, Brigitte Stark (Rosie), Isara Gunther. Which are all awesome characters with good storys behind them.\n\nAs far as game play goes, I would say that it has its ups and downs. But every game has that. I like the Third Person view when controling your character. The only think I dislike is that you can't see from the enemys eyes, when they are in view. I really like how you level up classes instead of leveling up one individual at a time. In my opinion that can get really annoying.\n\nSome advice when playing this game\n- Level up scout first. They are the best unit in the game\n- Another note on  leveling up. Get every unit class to elite rank before you get one to level 20\n- Save after every turn if you're unsure about how to win the battle\n- Make many saves\n- Don't let your units die!\n\nI rate this game 10/10","March 13, 2015","true","60.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're not a fan, might wanna read below to know if it's right for you. If you are a fan, still read below to be aware.\n\nI liked the characters, as well as the slight personality for all most of the 'grunts'. It reminded me of Fire Emblem: Awakening, though the grunts are less developed than that. The story was fine; not incredible, but delightful all the same. Im also glad the characters avoided the Squenix Effect, were relatively simple and weren't all belts and zippers. The translations were really well done, and I like the throwback graphics, though for some reason my comp would chug at times (it's been able to run any game so far without a problem). On the heels of that, though, the team who ported this should be given the utmost credit: they did a very good job of bringing thiis to PC without any muss or fuss (though I did have a clipping issue at one point on level 15).\n\nThe real issue is the gameplay itself. In Fire Emblem:Awakening or XCOM, you're given indicators of whether or not you'll miss and how far you can advance. This game doesn't do any of that, and just instead gives you an AP bar for running and no indication of your chances of hitting, forcing you to wing it. That'd be perfectly fine if that system wasn't also intersecting with the rating system. To not struggle immensely towards the later part of the game, you need to get 'A' rankings on your missions to get the exp and gold boosts to upgrade your people sufficiently, or else be forced to replay maps over and over again to farm exp. To get an "A" ranking, you need to speed through each level with a precision and timing your troops just don't have, requiring you to save-scum and killing some of the fun of the missions. Because if you're gonna go for A rankings, which you pretty much have to, the tactics and decision making becomes very rigid and lacking in choice. Since SRPGs are supposed to be all about doing it your way, I have to raise an eyebrow at one that punishes you for doing it your way. TL:DR version: It's a rigid system in what's supposed to be a fluid genre, requiring a lot more luck than skill or tactics.\n\nAnd the less said about how the tanks handle, the better.\n\nSo at the end of the day, I can recommend it for the story and characters, but gameplay will depend on how easily frustrated you get.\n\nThat said, I can't wait for them to put out the second one.","November 16, 2014","true","59.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since you can skip most of the rest it comes down to a yes.\n\nThe combat is interesting and rather unique (some balance issues) the squad management is great (even if the menu navigation is a weird).\n\nThe setting is not bad either. Alternate history world war (although calling one side a loose federation of democratic countries and the other an authoritarian empire makes things very black and white), Lots of interesting backstory.\n\nThe characters are overly silly, but I can live with that as it makes them a bit more memorable and distinct (although lots of overused cliche anime characters among them).\n\nThe basic plot: battle for independence against a superior evil foe led by an underrated militia section whose leader is thrust to the front lines and is trying to get out of his fathers shadow to protect his sister etc. etc. Not bad actually now that I am writing it down and thinking about it.\n\nAlas it does not matter though, since the storytelling is awful. vomit inducing. Everyone is silly happy cheerful despite all of the horrible ♥♥♥♥ supposedly going on. Even if it just happened like 5 minutes ago. I am not asking for realism in terms of science, just emotion please. All of the overused anime tropes aren't helping one bit either. Everybody seems completely out of touch with reality most of the time (by reality I mean their reality). Lots of "Friendship will save the day" kind of lines.\n\nSo much is just ridiculous:\nThe main character after being asked if he is going to sign up to the military says: "no - being a soldier is not for me I want to be a teacher" which happened 10 mins after he killed 3 enemy scouts and saw several civilians killed for no reason in front of him, during an attack on his home town which basically was a declaration of war on his tiny country by an empire spanning half the world, oh and their tiny country has conscription, which is revealed 2 chapters later, I guess he forgot about that. Lets see, what else? The soldiers that shoot innocent civilians at sight yet somehow stop to explain to 2 people how they hate them and are going to kill them and don't do anything when one of them grabs a gun and points it at them. The general who is faced with impossible odds and yet seems to care more about lookign down on the militia and getting them killed than winning the war. The soldiers who are facing impossible odds and find time to be racist towards their own comrades and refuse to fight with them despite getting orders for going on a suicide mission the next day. The reporter who doesn't quite understand how government censorship works, luckily for her neither does the script writer.\n\nI found the best way to digest the story was to be drunk and think of it as a "so bad it is funny" kind of a comedy.\n\nAnd that is all in the first 5 chapters, don't know when I will be drunk enough to continue.\n\nPS: half your army is underage with one girl, a shocktrooper no less, being 12 years old.\n\nIt will cost me more in alcohol to play through this game than the actual game itself.","February 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you watched the anime, you know what is going to happen and you are pretty much spoiled. If you havent watched the anime... i think you will find it kind of hard to keep up with the story, because you are not sure which characters are important to the story and which are not, but i think you will enjoy the story over all.\n\nGameplay, is kind of unique. It is a turn-base strategy game, but things can really change depending on the live input you putin to each action because the enemy will attack you while it is your turn to move characters.\nWell, it makes sense, In real battle, the enemy wont just sit there and let you come in to their face and shoot them.\nThe biggest plus of this game is that you have a some-what control over aiming the guns of your units instead of praying that RNG will roll in your favor. but of course, the farther away from your target, the harder they are to hit, so I always find the need to get really close to my enemies to do significant damage... but that maybe because my units are still low level and my weapons are not that upgraded.\n\nYes, I did mention levels and weapon upgrades. in this game, you get to train your units and research upgrades for your weapons.\nleveling is pretty simple, you gain experience points in battle, you go to the training grounds and spend experience on the class of units you want to level up. Although when I was first told that I have to level up a whole class instead of individual units, i thought the developers were being lazy, but then i noticed the number of units you have at your disposal and the fact that units could die, and be never used again, I came to the conclusion it was the right choice by the devs.\nWeapons upgrade is similar proccess. You gain development Points in battle and you spend them in the R&D. From what I have seen, it seems like each weapon has loads of upgrades that could be done on them, and you can definitly feel the upgrades getting applied in battle.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this game was the fact that you pretty much need to grind 2-3 levels to gain enough surviveability in between each chapter... it kinda derails you from focusing on the story, which is pretty enjoyable.\n\nI rate this game 8.5/10(because of the forced grinding, and the fact that i watched the anime before i played the game)","April 1, 2015","true","69.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Alot of content.\n\nAlthough there are two things which I didn't like about the game related to the turn based combat.\nThe battles can be a challenge the first time you do them and of course you need to upgrade your squad's gear and your tank because your enemy gets harder. But when you have learned the AI and the game mechanic it's really easy to exploit it to make it really easy on normally a hard map. Quite often the AI do dumb decisions when it moves its troops.\n\nAnother small thing is the control when using the tank. It's abit clunky and odd until you get used to it.\n\nSteam can put this game up on sale from time to time. Still it's worth it even at full price but it's better to wait for the sale.

The port lacks settings customization (there are NO anti-aliasing settings for example) and in-engine cutscenes are pre-rendered in 720p (or even less) and extremely aliased; why pre-rendering cutscenes made with the game engine? and why on that resolution without anti-aliasing?\nIf cutscenes played a marginal role in the game I would have not been disappointed much, but since most of the game time is actually spent watching cutscenes I really can't comprehend the choice, not to mention that this also made the game extremely fat download-wise (~10GiB instead of probably 2~3GiB).\n\nMixed feelings aside I have to say that this game is still really good and extremely enjoyable so I'd like to recommend it to all turn-based combat games enthusiasts and to all romantic/grand-strategy anime fans.","May 9, 2015","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993115244/recommended/294860/","76561197993115244","Kontrollsjefen","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993115244/","115 products in account","TLDR: If you enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay with squad customization and character advancement, and you find the visuals appealing and aren't put off at the prospect of an animu-style storyline, give Valkyria Chronicles a go.\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles is an old (2008) PS3 game that was ported to PC in November 2014. It tells the story of Welkin Gunther, son of a famous general from fantasy Europa's World War One equivalent. As a citizen of the tiny duchy of Gallia, situated between two continental superpowers: The Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Empire. When Gallia is attacked by an imperial army, Welkin is drafted into the country's militia, taking command of a squad of soldiers which he leads from the Edelweiss, a tank piloted by his adopted little sister. The game's storyline follows squad seven's struggles against the invading imperials, whose invasion in turn seems to be connected somehow to the myths of the Valkyrur of old.\n\nThe game's characters are colourful, in most cases charming and likeable, but many members of the core cast can come across as a little cliched or over-the-top. Story-wise, it's good, but not great. There are some twists and turns along the way that I really didn't see coming, but the overall impression is brought down by the often fairly cheesy anime dialogue. The ham-handed way the game presents racism against the black-haired Darcsens is a good example of how an attempt to portray complex social and ethical issues doesn't work well when you're only really painting in black and white.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game succeeds with a few bumps. Battles are split between a top-down tactical view where you select which units to activate, transitioning the game to a third-person view where you get to control characters and tanks individually. Each turn, you receive a limited number of command points that can be used to activate soldiers and issue orders (single-turn boosts to various unit stats, or other indirect benefits)  from the tactical view. Each activation lets your unit move and fire or perform another action. The different unit classes have different strengths, weaknesses, equipment and abilities, from scouts that specialize in fast movement and spotting enemies to engineers that can clear mines, repair vehicles and restock ammo.\n\nIn general, this recipe works well for providing interesting tactical puzzles to overcome. Many challenges promote or require unit cooperation and combined arms tactics. However, the AI is generally lacking in sophistication beyond predetermined simple scripting, and beyond killing soldiers left hopelessly out of cover and such it generally fails to do much productive during its own turn. The gameplay style favoured to achieve "A-Rank" on the various missions (which depends solely on speed and no other parameters) tends to be dependent mostly on rushing a few soldiers forward as fast as possible, taking out special enemies along the way while completing the objective in a low number of turns. This emphasis on speedrunning in terms of what rewards you get from each mission somewhat hampers the overall enjoyment.\n\nThere are other bumps in the road as well. The tanks move a little differently than infantry, spending movement points both when moving and turning. This might not be such a problem if they didn't have a tendency to spin around and jitter a lot, potentially draining all your movement very fast, owing to small glitches and a very awkward control scheme. The consequence is that you'll probably often just leave your tank parked in the deployment zone for the duration of many battles. Other sources of frustration include the fact that you cannot bring up the ingame menu during the enemy turn, which means if you realize you made a critical mistake you're forced to watch the entire sequence of enemy movement before being able to reload. Sometimes, I found it faster just to alt-f4 rather than wait for the AI to finish.\n\nAs a final note, I'd like to say I enjoyed the visuals throughout the game. Some people might not like the style, but if you take a look at the preview pictures you'll get a good indication of whether this is for you or not.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Pretty visuals\n- Engaging tactical puzzle gameplay\n- Plentiful challenge in the DLCs\n- Colourful cast of characters\n- Solid story\n\nCONS:\n- Issues with the port (tank movement, console-ish controls et al) can cause frustration\n- Poor AI\n- A-ranks only based on speed, tends to depend on reloading a lot to pull off difficult shots to be feasible\n- DLC weapons can screw up campaign balance\n\n\nOverall, the game gets my recommendation. It's a game I was frustrated with at times, but one I also enjoyed a lot and ultimately found satisfying.","May 23, 2015","true","62.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you watched the anime, you know what is going to happen and you are pretty much spoiled. If you havent watched the anime... i think you will find it kind of hard to keep up with the story, because you are not sure which characters are important to the story and which are not, but i think you will enjoy the story over all.\n\nGameplay, is kind of unique. It is a turn-base strategy game, but things can really change depending on the live input you putin to each action because the enemy will attack you while it is your turn to move characters.\nWell, it makes sense, In real battle, the enemy wont just sit there and let you come in to their face and shoot them.\nThe biggest plus of this game is that you have a some-what control over aiming the guns of your units instead of praying that RNG will roll in your favor. but of course, the farther away from your target, the harder they are to hit, so I always find the need to get really close to my enemies to do significant damage... but that maybe because my units are still low level and my weapons are not that upgraded.\n\nYes, I did mention levels and weapon upgrades. in this game, you get to train your units and research upgrades for your weapons.\nleveling is pretty simple, you gain experience points in battle, you go to the training grounds and spend experience on the class of units you want to level up. Although when I was first told that I have to level up a whole class instead of individual units, i thought the developers were being lazy, but then i noticed the number of units you have at your disposal and the fact that units could die, and be never used again, I came to the conclusion it was the right choice by the devs.\nWeapons upgrade is similar proccess. You gain development Points in battle and you spend them in the R&D. From what I have seen, it seems like each weapon has loads of upgrades that could be done on them, and you can definitly feel the upgrades getting applied in battle.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this game was the fact that you pretty much need to grind 2-3 levels to gain enough surviveability in between each chapter... it kinda derails you from focusing on the story, which is pretty enjoyable.\n\nI rate this game 8.5/10(because of the forced grinding, and the fact that i watched the anime before i played the game)","April 1, 2015","true","69.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It tells the story of Welkin Gunther, son of a famous general from fantasy Europa's World War One equivalent. As a citizen of the tiny duchy of Gallia, situated between two continental superpowers: The Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Empire. When Gallia is attacked by an imperial army, Welkin is drafted into the country's militia, taking command of a squad of soldiers which he leads from the Edelweiss, a tank piloted by his adopted little sister. The game's storyline follows squad seven's struggles against the invading imperials, whose invasion in turn seems to be connected somehow to the myths of the Valkyrur of old.\n\nThe game's characters are colourful, in most cases charming and likeable, but many members of the core cast can come across as a little cliched or over-the-top. Story-wise, it's good, but not great. There are some twists and turns along the way that I really didn't see coming, but the overall impression is brought down by the often fairly cheesy anime dialogue. The ham-handed way the game presents racism against the black-haired Darcsens is a good example of how an attempt to portray complex social and ethical issues doesn't work well when you're only really painting in black and white.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game succeeds with a few bumps. Battles are split between a top-down tactical view where you select which units to activate, transitioning the game to a third-person view where you get to control characters and tanks individually. Each turn, you receive a limited number of command points that can be used to activate soldiers and issue orders (single-turn boosts to various unit stats, or other indirect benefits)  from the tactical view. Each activation lets your unit move and fire or perform another action. The different unit classes have different strengths, weaknesses, equipment and abilities, from scouts that specialize in fast movement and spotting enemies to engineers that can clear mines, repair vehicles and restock ammo.\n\nIn general, this recipe works well for providing interesting tactical puzzles to overcome. Many challenges promote or require unit cooperation and combined arms tactics. However, the AI is generally lacking in sophistication beyond predetermined simple scripting, and beyond killing soldiers left hopelessly out of cover and such it generally fails to do much productive during its own turn. The gameplay style favoured to achieve "A-Rank" on the various missions (which depends solely on speed and no other parameters) tends to be dependent mostly on rushing a few soldiers forward as fast as possible, taking out special enemies along the way while completing the objective in a low number of turns. This emphasis on speedrunning in terms of what rewards you get from each mission somewhat hampers the overall enjoyment.\n\nThere are other bumps in the road as well. The tanks move a little differently than infantry, spending movement points both when moving and turning. This might not be such a problem if they didn't have a tendency to spin around and jitter a lot, potentially draining all your movement very fast, owing to small glitches and a very awkward control scheme. The consequence is that you'll probably often just leave your tank parked in the deployment zone for the duration of many battles. Other sources of frustration include the fact that you cannot bring up the ingame menu during the enemy turn, which means if you realize you made a critical mistake you're forced to watch the entire sequence of enemy movement before being able to reload. Sometimes, I found it faster just to alt-f4 rather than wait for the AI to finish.\n\nAs a final note, I'd like to say I enjoyed the visuals throughout the game. Some people might not like the style, but if you take a look at the preview pictures you'll get a good indication of whether this is for you or not.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Pretty visuals\n- Engaging tactical puzzle gameplay\n- Plentiful challenge in the DLCs\n- Colourful cast of characters\n- Solid story\n\nCONS:\n- Issues with the port (tank movement, console-ish controls et al) can cause frustration\n- Poor AI\n- A-ranks only based on speed, tends to depend on reloading a lot to pull off difficult shots to be feasible\n- DLC weapons can screw up campaign balance\n\n\nOverall, the game gets my recommendation. It's a game I was frustrated with at times, but one I also enjoyed a lot and ultimately found satisfying.","May 23, 2015","true","62.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The whole concept of the game is done remarkably well, as the mechanics and engines make the whole experience unforgettable. When you start listening to the awe-inspiring music, you find it to be so diverse and interesting that you never actually get tired of it, not to mention the graphics seem to fit in place beautifully with the music. Running the game, you will find that there is limited lag. (As long as you aren't running fullscreen-resolution) If I were to compare this port to the original PS3 version, I find that the game comes easier with the DLC, but the tanks themselves tend to me quite buggy...

Words cant describe how much I love this game and I am thankful for Sega for porting it to PC, otherwise I would of never expected it.\n\nThe year is 1935, you are the small independant country of Gallia in Europa. To the East is the Empire, an autocracy nation and to the west is the Federation. Both nations are at a 2nd world war with eachother and both nations depend on a rare material called ragnite for their needs. Gallia happens to have rich ammounts of ragnite in their soils, and thus The Empire invades the small country for this precious mineral.\n\nYou take on the role as Welkin Gunther, who is in love with nature, who is the leader of squad 7 in the Gallian malitia, from here you can customise who is in your squad, level up a certain classes with xp, learn special commands, read the news and upgrade your tank and weapons.\n\nAll the characters have their own personaility, rememorable and are fun to watch.\n\nArt style for this game is beautiful and unique, everything looks like it came out of an pencil sketch\n\nMusic is fantastic, not a single moment I hated any of the music\n\nThe gameplay involves a tactical view of the area of operations, where you can see you whole squad on the map and any enimies in their line of sight, you then use CP (command points) to chose one of your soldiers to move and shoot within the same CP, tanks however use 2 CP. One of the cataches is that whenever you use the same soldier within the same turn, their movement speed decreases each time you use them.\n\nSpeaking of PC ports, the port is fantastic, runs at a constant 60fps, has keyboard and mouse support and feels great.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RidM5C1JbYw","November 22, 2015","true","83.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A bulk of the missions are actually brief episodes advancing character development and plot; to me, that's what really sets this game apart from the rest. Sure, the turn-based / over-the-shoulder shooter aspect of the game is creative and expertly done, but while the mechanics of the game are phenominal they are also overshadowed by what I believe to be one of the best narrative experiences on the market. It can get a little corny here and there, but Valkyria Chronicles easily made its way into my heart and my top games list. 9/10","May 22","true","65.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not a strategy game (not even in the Fire Emblem sense of "strategy) as much as a puzzle game, really. There's basically one approach (Mostly "use Caution on a scout, rush the flag") that will give you an A-rank in a mission. Trying to do something else will probably backfire (Though I'm sure you can finish every mission without ever using a scout, if you're not into tangible or intangible rewards).\n\nI still see a lot of Fire Emblem resemblances, and I feel like the game would have been far better if the semi-generics you can recruit to your squad had a bit more interaction with each other and the main cast beyond their combat barks (something like FE supports) and if every unit you brought on the field got a turn, while CP would be used for extra turns and orders.\n\nThe anime is... a thing. The squad has a flying pig mascot character. After you liberate a concentration camp (and the guards massacre the prisoners in retaliation) there's a beach episode. Magical girls are a nuclear weapons allegory.\n\n...\n\nI actually liked some of the Not!Jews stuff with the protagonists sister.","January 17, 2015","true","113.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/J182/recommended/294860/","J182","♫ Tesrad ๖","http://steamcommunity.com/id/J182/","53 products in account","I recently bought the game a few days ago at 25% off for the christmas sale and i have to say it has been my best buy all year. Already i have logged a great amount of hours playing.\n\nFirst I want to mention that this is a console port so if you are like me playing on a laptop and you get slowdowns just change the resolution down a bit, for me 1280x720 fixed it. Others say that changing the fps limit to 30 will fix it aswell.\n\nYes it's a long review i really like this game and wanted to give out my opinion on alot of the topics.\n\nStory:\n[+] I am 3/4's way through the game and i have to say the story has been fantastic there has been a great deal of character development from both the main protagonist and the antagonist. It is your classic world war plot with a sub-romance but it pulls it off in a very unique way and every chapter introduces a great deal of information about everything mentioned in the game. For those of you like me that don't mind looking in the glossary or info tabs for more information about all the events, characters, places, and weapons. It does a great job of adding plenty of backstory.\n*This version of the game includes all the DLC bounus missions and content.\n*playing battles with extra characters unlocks backstory about them - giving you information on why they have the traits they do.\n*Story answers questions after it presents them or soon after\n\n[-]\n*It is a bit unfortunate that it seems a bit rushed at times (there are a few moments where something happened and some of the characters just gloss over it very fast.),\n*the chapters can be extremely short especially with most of the beginning chapters just including 1 battle with a few short cutscenes.\n*You may not get some references the characters make in the dialouge if you do not check the glossary on the events that happened in the past.\n*Some of the characters can be forgettable\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a very unique style which i have to say i love.  If you have played X-Com you will notice some similarities.  It is a turn-based top down 3rd person tactical shooter "whew".   You start off in the top down command screen where you use your "CP" given to you each turn to move your units on the battle field. Once you select a unit you go into third person where you are able to move around as much as their stamina bar will let you then you can do an action ie: shoot, heal ect...  The game also allows you to choose what upgrades you want for your tank/weapons  If you want a accurate sniper you can make it, then you can make a more powerful one and then equip them to different people in your squad for certain fights.\n\n[+]\n*The game is very challenging. There is no difficulty setting for the story missions (atleast for the first playthrough it does not seem to give you a choice.)\n*the skirmish battles allow for multiple difficulty choices.\n*Every mission will be throwing you into a different scenario forcing you to adjust your strategies on the fly and make quick decisions to complete the given objective.\n*some maps may seem small but the use of cover and some nicely placed invisible walls make the maps seem 10X bigger than they actually are.\n*The game allows you to have 20 uniquely voice acted characters in your squad. at anytime you can swap them out for different characters who become unlocked as the game progresses. In the battles that i am at i have only been allowed a max of 10 soldiers on the field at a time. [i will update if this changes]\n*Unique playable characters, with their own personalities and voice acting.\n*The ability to lose characters forever. (yes your characters can die in battle leaving you to actually care more for the extra guys and gals than you normally would)\n*ability to save in battles (thank you! lol)\n*give squad members different weapons so they all don't just have the best accuracy gun should you choose to upgrade it.\n*Class leveling system - You level by classes not by individual so you don't have to worry about not taking alicia in every battle and think she will fall behind.\n\n[-]\n*Some of the gunfights can come down to luck or the old RNG, you can be right behind someone and aim for his head but miss Completely only to leave you facepalming and your character getting downed the next turn lol.\n*No present diffculty option for the story missions.\n*some smaller map design limits the posibilities of how to tackle a certain situation.\n*Tank's seem to dominate really easily so they overload the enemy with tank busters\n\nGraphics/bugs:\nAs it is a Ps3 port i was expecting it to not be in a high quality but i was pleasantly suprised. they have updated the PC version to allow support for beyond 1080p but for me and some others higher resolutions seem to cause problems without limited the frames to 60.\n\n[+]\n*I love the art style in the game, it is very vibrant and colorful\n*Runs great with no performance issues whatsoever\n*All enviroments are very detailed and definetly give off the worn battlefield feel\n*Characters are visually detailed and animated facial expressions and unqiue movements and animations on the field.\n\n[-]\n*a strange border style to give it more of a picturesque feel.\n*30 fps on certain resolutions may be noticable to some.\n*game will crash often if you alt tab during a skirmish\n\n\nLanguage?/Voice: This release is in english but it also comes with a japanese voice option. Unfortunatly it seems that the subtitles in the japanese version use the same ones as if you left subtitles on in the English dub. Now for us who can understand a bit of the Japanese language it seems that what they are saying and what the words at the bottom display do not always match. So if you are an wanting to hear the original script or a direct translation you may be better off finding a fan made translation/patch. I am playing the game with the english voices and i have to point out that they did a fantastic job setting the tone for each character. I even enjoy the lines given to the characters you can recruit into your squad, you can tell what kind of person they are just by how they sound.\n\nSound/OST: From what i have heard in the game the music is great! the compostition Hitoshi Sakimoto put together fits the mood for almost every scene. he said that it took him a total of eight months to complete it and what time well spent. i can only say that the ost is definitely one i will be looking to pick up in the future.   Now for the sounds.\n\n[+]\n*The game adds visuals to sounds... what i mean is that if you see a tank moving the game will add a "Vvrrrmm" or "rumble rumble" next to it in a anime'ish style which adds alot to the art style. the same can be said for any other sounds like an explosion might have a big "BLAM!" come out of the ground which is nothing less than satisfying.\n*I'm not a gun expert in anyway but they sound good enough to me im not going to complain if they sound fake or hold it against them the sounds they use fit the art style and serious tone, it adds a certain charm to the game.\n\n[-]\n*Some of the voice acting for the English dub is out of synch with the characters facial animations. This can be normal with translated game but in this one it can be very noticable.\n\nReplayability: As this is a linear game i am a bit worried about how i would enjoy this game on the second time around so far the majority of the "side quest if you can call it that" is just a skirmish battles, it is very "this is what you have to do now do it".\nThe extra characters that you choose for your squad at start are random. my friend had bought the game and i told him he should get a person named Lynn but he did not have her or many of the ones i started with. he had some characters that i had just unlocked in recent missions.\n\nI may update with more once i start my second playthrough or complete the game.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10","December 23, 2014","true","46.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One small country is faced against two huge super power countries/nations, similar to during WWII when smaller nations faced against both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.\n\nThe story/plotline shows political issues of all sides, some short rom-com, brief comedy jokes, and tactical viewpoints.\n\nAnd of course... LOTS and LOTS of Anime cliches.\n\nWhat's not to love about that?\n\nThe game processes through a seemingly 3D like Anime in a watercolour style picture. Which brings the look of the game to an oustanding view, and a work of art.\n\nThe character designs are very well made, especially the side characters in which the game also adds a short brief autobiography of them. (Surprisingly not many obviously noticable tsunderes for an Anime/Manga look of a game)\n\nLittle side missions and episodes are also featured throughout the game, just like fillers or OVA series from Animes to keep you still watching and following the series.  (They are lovely and great!)\n\nThe in-game music/soundtrack is very beuatifully well done. Every corner you turn there will be music that'll either bring you enjoyment, or enjoyment in tears! The soundtrack is great!\n\nI've never had the chance to play this game when it first came out on the PS3 all those years ago.\nHowever now is different! I've just recently finished the game and the story and ending brought me to tears.\n\nOther recomendations from me would be the Anime and the Manga of this series. (They all have short/small plot twists that differ slightly from each other but is still worth spending time to watch/read)\n\nValkyria Chronicles has everything you could ask for. Storyline/plot, Anime-like episodes, side series/episodes, in-game music (<3), a dash of comedy and romance too!\n\nEvery minute I've spent in the game so far is unregretable.\n\nI hope they decide to port the other pieces of this series to Steam!\n\n5/5\n10/10\nDefinetly worth that $19.99 or at any price!\n100%!

More positives will be coming in, surely. If you're wondering if you will regret buying this game, let that be your indicator.\n\nI wanted to discuss something else. Nostalgia. If you're like me, and you used to play games that left an impression on you. Games like Lunar, Lufia 2, Grandia, and for me, even Final Fantasy Tactics. (The Tactics comparision had to be made, as Sakimoto, the composer is the same guy.) I feel there are too many games where you are the over powered hero. The ultimate swordsman (Except, you know, your rival) or you are the silent protagonist doing anything you want without a care in the world, such as in Fallout 3. Now, these games are great. They have a place. Valkyria Chronicles does not place you with a group of super heroes. It places you in a terrible position. A war ravaged fictional country, much like in World War 2.\n\nIt does not glorify the war. In fact, quite the contrary. The main character, Wilkin, is fascinated by nature. He loves to draw in his notebook the different things he finds. He loves to create, rather than destroy.\n\nNow to my point. With the combination of being a character who only does what he has to do and take charge, it's like any one of us. You could be put in a situation one day where you either have to take charge and stand up for what is right, or just let others push you down. He isn't a bad-♥♥♥ soldier. Far from it. His group, in a way, represents everybody. How politics drag the average people into the most horrible of situations and they either toughen up or die.\n\nAnd in the end, it wraps up. It lingers with you. I played this game when it came out on the Playstation 3. I rented it. I took it back to Blockbuster. (That's how long ago it was!) And I've been thinking about it ever since. I saw it in the store last week (LAST WEEK) and debated repurchasing it because it was such an amazing game but I heard about it coming out on Steam. I own thousands of games, and this is one game out of a few that have stuck with me emotionally.\n\nIf you want a game that will most likely punch you in the heart and then comfort it, play Valkyria Chronicles. Because, really. When is the next game that is going to give you feelings going to come out? They are few and far between.\n\nAlso, just play if you're a Skies of Arcadia fan. You'll see.","November 12, 2014","true","26.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What I did notice however is that it could use more anti-aliasing (if it even has any).\n\nSo if you don't know the game was released in 2008 on the PS3. It's got great strategy, good gameplay, an amazing watercolor anime art style, a great soundtrack, and indepth squad creation and management.\n\nThe protagonist is a young male named Welkin from Gallia who gets caught up in a huge war inspired by WWII. After that, he joins the army and becomes a Lieutenant who fights and commands his own squad against the Empire to liberate Gallia and so on. The story itself isn't too memorable or anything ground-breaking, but the characters are what really drive everything forward. Sure it has its share of cliches here and there, but we got some actually characters worth caring for. In the story, every has more impact on you, the player, than it normally would thanks to these characters. There's definitely some feels moments here and there that are enough to make the story more captivating.\n\nThe game is turned-based. Not in the traditional, click unit, click position unit goes to, click enemy for unit to attack. Here you are given a certain amount of moves every turn. For each move, you choose one of your team members. You are then able to control that character, dodging incoming fire, going from cover to cover. However, each character has a bar that dictates how far they can move. After the bar empties itself, youre no longer able to move. Whenever during that character's move, you can go into aiming mode which will allow you to well, aim your weapon at an enemy and take your shots, or perhaps aim at a teammate to heal them. When I say aim, I mean actually aim, like with the mouse. Aiming center mass means the likelyhood of shots hitting will increase, while aiming at the head will have increased damage if the projectiles connect with their targets. Overall, it's extremely satisfying and quite liberatig to be able to have almost full control of the character.\n\nThe most memorable aspect of the game for me (back when I played it on PS3) was the character recruitment. By that I mean, each character is special, they aren't just nameless soldiers with randomized stats that die off and get replaced like a pair of socks. All the soldiers you can recruit have their own voice actors, their own quirks, and their own back-stories. Of course, if they die you won't be getting any of that. The incentive is to make you want to keep them alive because they all have something that makes them unique and worth keeping around besides just differences in combat traits. I tried to keep them all alive, but it gets increasingly difficult once story chapters enter the double digits. It's pretty heart-breaking when you see them just dropping dead. Of course, there's a mechanic where if you can get to the fallen in time, a medic will come and whisk the unit away. The unit doesn't come back to life for that mission, but they'll still be around for you to select in future missions.\n\nThere's lots of side missions to play around with, but the real fun starts in new game plus. In new game plus you retain all your class levels, but now have the option to replay any story mission (as long as you've completed them once in new game plus) alongside the side content in order to get S ranks on everything, level everything, buy everything, and discover all the hidden characters and ace rank enemies.\n\nWorth. Really worth. Definitely one of the best JRPGs you can get on Steam.","November 11, 2014","true","53.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The ultimate swordsman (Except, you know, your rival) or you are the silent protagonist doing anything you want without a care in the world, such as in Fallout 3. Now, these games are great. They have a place. Valkyria Chronicles does not place you with a group of super heroes. It places you in a terrible position. A war ravaged fictional country, much like in World War 2.\n\nIt does not glorify the war. In fact, quite the contrary. The main character, Wilkin, is fascinated by nature. He loves to draw in his notebook the different things he finds. He loves to create, rather than destroy.\n\nNow to my point. With the combination of being a character who only does what he has to do and take charge, it's like any one of us. You could be put in a situation one day where you either have to take charge and stand up for what is right, or just let others push you down. He isn't a bad-♥♥♥ soldier. Far from it. His group, in a way, represents everybody. How politics drag the average people into the most horrible of situations and they either toughen up or die.\n\nAnd in the end, it wraps up. It lingers with you. I played this game when it came out on the Playstation 3. I rented it. I took it back to Blockbuster. (That's how long ago it was!) And I've been thinking about it ever since. I saw it in the store last week (LAST WEEK) and debated repurchasing it because it was such an amazing game but I heard about it coming out on Steam. I own thousands of games, and this is one game out of a few that have stuck with me emotionally.\n\nIf you want a game that will most likely punch you in the heart and then comfort it, play Valkyria Chronicles. Because, really. When is the next game that is going to give you feelings going to come out? They are few and far between.\n\nAlso, just play if you're a Skies of Arcadia fan. You'll see.","November 12, 2014","true","26.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shad0wriderz/recommended/294860/","shad0wriderz","W r a i t h","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shad0wriderz/","225 products in account","A solid port with 1080p, 60fps, japanese and english audio with english subtitles, and no frame dips. What I did notice however is that it could use more anti-aliasing (if it even has any).\n\nSo if you don't know the game was released in 2008 on the PS3. It's got great strategy, good gameplay, an amazing watercolor anime art style, a great soundtrack, and indepth squad creation and management.\n\nThe protagonist is a young male named Welkin from Gallia who gets caught up in a huge war inspired by WWII. After that, he joins the army and becomes a Lieutenant who fights and commands his own squad against the Empire to liberate Gallia and so on. The story itself isn't too memorable or anything ground-breaking, but the characters are what really drive everything forward. Sure it has its share of cliches here and there, but we got some actually characters worth caring for. In the story, every has more impact on you, the player, than it normally would thanks to these characters. There's definitely some feels moments here and there that are enough to make the story more captivating.\n\nThe game is turned-based. Not in the traditional, click unit, click position unit goes to, click enemy for unit to attack. Here you are given a certain amount of moves every turn. For each move, you choose one of your team members. You are then able to control that character, dodging incoming fire, going from cover to cover. However, each character has a bar that dictates how far they can move. After the bar empties itself, youre no longer able to move. Whenever during that character's move, you can go into aiming mode which will allow you to well, aim your weapon at an enemy and take your shots, or perhaps aim at a teammate to heal them. When I say aim, I mean actually aim, like with the mouse. Aiming center mass means the likelyhood of shots hitting will increase, while aiming at the head will have increased damage if the projectiles connect with their targets. Overall, it's extremely satisfying and quite liberatig to be able to have almost full control of the character.\n\nThe most memorable aspect of the game for me (back when I played it on PS3) was the character recruitment. By that I mean, each character is special, they aren't just nameless soldiers with randomized stats that die off and get replaced like a pair of socks. All the soldiers you can recruit have their own voice actors, their own quirks, and their own back-stories. Of course, if they die you won't be getting any of that. The incentive is to make you want to keep them alive because they all have something that makes them unique and worth keeping around besides just differences in combat traits. I tried to keep them all alive, but it gets increasingly difficult once story chapters enter the double digits. It's pretty heart-breaking when you see them just dropping dead. Of course, there's a mechanic where if you can get to the fallen in time, a medic will come and whisk the unit away. The unit doesn't come back to life for that mission, but they'll still be around for you to select in future missions.\n\nThere's lots of side missions to play around with, but the real fun starts in new game plus. In new game plus you retain all your class levels, but now have the option to replay any story mission (as long as you've completed them once in new game plus) alongside the side content in order to get S ranks on everything, level everything, buy everything, and discover all the hidden characters and ace rank enemies.\n\nWorth. Really worth. Definitely one of the best JRPGs you can get on Steam.","November 11, 2014","true","53.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's your classic "evil empire of evilness wants to conquer your country, longing for more power"-story for the most part, where you as a player follow the military resintance group who fights against the seemingly overpowered foe.\nIt is, however, a JRPG after all. So, don't expect a retelling of historical facts or anything as it is still set in a fantasy world and also - while staying down to earth for the most part - adds a couple of supernatural elements later on.\n\nThe story doesn't quite manage to stay clear of cheesy plot twists, especially towards the final chapter where it kind of disregards its own logic and artificially creates dramatic scenes just for the sake of being emotional. That aside though, the main plot is easy to follow and has a good, conclusive ending. As one would expect, it touches on topics like friendship and camaraderie as well as your token love story, but also anti-Semitism, betrayal, anxiety and of course death.\n\nWhat really makes the otherwise generic story shine, however, is the amount of detail they put into the characters. Not only the main cast, but every single character you use in battles has a unique back story and a reason why they joined the military to fight the "evil empire" in the first place, ranging from a 27 years old songstress who witnessed the inhuman "hunts" against the Darcsen race first hand, to a 37 years old widow who lost her eatery, or a 27 years old florist who discovered a strange joy in killing the Imperials after her shop was destroyed by them, or even a 15 years old boy who just wants to protect his brother, and many many more.\nNone of the characters, main and supporting cast alike, follow your typical anime tropes. So, fortunately, there is no annoying tsundere girl, no airhead tomboy, and - first and foremost - no cheesy "this is MY story" hero.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is, however, how the game doesn't just throw backstory about the characters at you to give you something to read, no, the individual character traits also play a major role in how you assemble your squad, because some characters just straight up hate each other lowering their stats when they fight side by side, or some of them have pollen allergies for example inflicting a negative status effect whenever they walk through tall grass, others have superior vision during night time, and some even get a damage boost out of pure joy of inflicting pain to the enemy.\n\nThe gameplay in itself is pretty much standard turn based strategy. You choose your favorite units for each mission, select them individiually on a top down battle map which comsumes one action icon, and then change into a 3rd person view to directly move them across the battle field. It allows free movement for as long as the unit has AP, which continuously deplete with every step. (I played with a controller to more precisely maneuver my units around contact mines and over obstacles.)\nYou can then choose to take one action with the character like shooting an enemy, throwing a grenade, healing allies, repairing vehicles ect. Interestingly, the character's turn does not end until you specifically select the 'end current action' command (so, move->shoot->move is possible and very much encouraged as clever positioning is pretty important).\nThe game generally feels well balanced in terms of difficulty, although the AI sometimes gives the impression of not using their turns with all their units to their full potential.\nAs in, you - the player - made a mistake and put your units in a suboptimal position . In theory, the enemy units could now kill your commander/ main character with one attack from behind, which is an instant game over. However, they all just waste their turns on attacks from the front or just straight up run into your (automatic) reaction fire and get killed.\nThis is balanced out by the fact that the AI usually has more soldiers at their disposal and can call unlimited back-up units (this still costs an action per unit called).\n\nThere is  a good variaty of mission objectives ranging from capturing the enemy base, to killing a specific enemy general or destroying a structure, or holding a camp for as long as necessary, to just moving one of your characters through a group of enemies to a specific point on the map. Several optional missions with extra rewards become available as you progress through the story. The faster you beat a main or optional mission the better your rewards, which can be used to enhance your characters' abilties and equipment.\n\n\nTl;dr\nTo conclude this review : if you're looking for a game with a beautiful art design, a nice, classic war story with not-so-tropey anime characters, and you're enjoying turn based strategy games like XCOM, by all means, buy this game.","January 23, 2015","true","59.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/recommended/294860/","Tenryuu-Chan","Sakuragi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/","70 products in account","This game is great. One of the best single-player strategy games I have tried so far. It is very addictive with a great storyline, great characters and character progress, interesting mechanics, and great graphics. This game is an instant favorite for me the moment I saw the intro. I have already poured over 30 hours into the game and I felt satisfied. So lets get down to the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's:\n\n1. Story: The story is by far the strong suit of the game. The story revolves around a small independent nation, Gallia, being invaded by the Imperials from the east. Your job is to stop them and reclaim the nation as the militia. You follow Welken Gunther and Alicia Melchiott along with their squad, Squad 7, as they fight to save their nation. The story will grip you at moments and give you all kinds of emotions. Happiness, saddness, gloom, hopeful, and more. This game pulls the player in on the story with extensive lore that updates the more missions you complete. So if you are looking for a great story, this is one of them.\n\n2. Characters and character progress: The characters and their progression throughout the war is great. There is, also, a tab to learn more about each member of Squad 7 and the other characters throughout the story. You can increase your squad members backstory by using them in missions. Even at the end of the game and do new game plus, you can read up more on the squad of what they did after the war. It adds more depth in the characters in your squad. Even the main characters get great progression as time passes on in the story. One such character is Brigitte "Rosie" Stark. I won't spoil the story about her and her change but she is one of the strongest characters to get progress. This game makes you attached to the characters and makes you want them to win and live on throughout the war.\n\n3. Gameplay: The gameplay is a mix of turn-based strategy with third-person shooter and real-time strategy. It is fun to play and is quite interesting. There is also character potentials to unlock when upgrading in the training room and by using them in combat. There are various types of characters with different traits and potentials, though some are a lot better than others. *cough* Jane *cough* You are given CP (command points) to use a character. Tanks take up 2 CP while foot soldiers use 1 CP. In that one CP, you can choose to move anywhere because the game doesnt use the traditional square turn-table but instead a free roam map. You can do an action like firing your rifle or throwing a grenade and even if you do that, if you have left over stamina, you can move again. They also added a mechanic where you can use all of your CP on 1 character but the character loses stamina when selected. There are orders you can give out as well that cost CP. 1 turn can take 2 minutes or even 15 minutes with so many options at your disposal. There is also class variations like scouts and shocktroopers. Each with their own role and benefits. Scouts with the greatest stamina and rifles but average armor and shocktroopers with the highest armor, smgs, and average stamina. It has upgrades and weapons you can pick up from battle as well to equip. You can even select who you want in your squad to change it up. There are even challenges you can do along side with the main story. It has so much to offer that it is hard to put down.\n\n4. Soundtrack: The soundtrack is excellent. I loved each song played, especially one song sung by one of the characters. It help show more emotion behind the story and in combat. Once you beat the game and start a new game plus, you unlock the music tab and you can listen to the entire soundtrack. It is great.\n\n5. Art style: The art style is great and amazing to look at. It's a mix of a sketch color art and drawn graphics, creating an interesting graphical outlook on the game.\n\n6. The price: For $20 for over 30 hours of content plus extra, this is such great value and a steal when on sale. I got this for about $6.79 and it is worth it. For all of this content, it would even be worthy of the $60 price tag.\n\n7. Level up: This game knew that people dont like leveling up one character at a time so they decided to throw that out the window and say that everyone in a class now levels up. To level up, you go to the training room and spend exp on classes to unlock new orders, new potentials in soldiers, and better stats on soldiers. So you dont have to worry about replacing a squadmate for a new one just so you can unlock their potential or to level up because this level up system affects all units under each class.\n\n8. Japanese and english dub options: This game gives you the option to change how the characters speak, which some japanese games dont give the option to the player. With this, you dont have to listen to japanese dubs, though I prefer japanese dubs. if you dislike how they voice-act.\n\nCon's:\n\n1. Anime: Now this one is a small gripe but I know some people will not play this just because it is like an anime, which it is. Even with that, I still think that non-anime players and anime-haters should give this game a try and not shun it. It is worth it.\n\n2. Replay value: After beating the game once, all that is left is to get better scores on missions. For people who want to be a perfectionist, this game will suck you in for another 20 hours but for me, I kinda dont want to replay a game for a better score.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nThis game is absolutely stunning. I would use this game as a perfect example of why single-player games should continue to exist instead of games like Battlefield or Titanfall or even COD. True, multiplayer is fun and holds up the game a bit longer than a single-player game but most of the games like Battlefield or COD, will leave you un-satisfied. I always felt un-satisfied with those games but this game made me feel real satsfied and was a blast to play. I hope this game gets more attention and I hope that the sequels of Valkyria Chronicles get ported over to PC because I will literally throw my wallet to my computer screen.","April 3, 2015","true","55.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The faster you beat a main or optional mission the better your rewards, which can be used to enhance your characters' abilties and equipment.\n\n\nTl;dr\nTo conclude this review : if you're looking for a game with a beautiful art design, a nice, classic war story with not-so-tropey anime characters, and you're enjoying turn based strategy games like XCOM, by all means, buy this game.","January 23, 2015","true","59.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a turn-based squad strategy game incorporating strong flavours of a third-person shooter.\n\nThe game is set in a neutral and non-partisan fictitious small country, Gallia, situated in the continent of Europa. The land is rich in the mineral ore Ragnite, a much sought after ingredient due to its vital properties that see it being used both as fuel and medicine. The Empire, an alliance of autocratic Eastern Europan nations, declares war on The Federation, an alliance of democratic West Europan nations, to kick-start the Second Europan War (EWII). The Empire has its sights set on Gallia's ragnite rich deposits.\n\nYou play as Welkin Gunther, a Gallian and son of celebrated war-hero, General Gunther, as you command a troop of organized Gallian militia soldiers known as Squad 7 whose job is to thwart The Empire's advances in Gallia. During the course of the playthrough you command foot soldiers and tanks as you set forward to complete objectives and, thus, win battles in the process. The game is divided into chapters which is further sub-divided into small episodes.\n\nFirst things first, the game is gorgeously good-looking. The art-style is inspired by Japanese animes while the visuals are unique, feeling as though the entire game is a sharp watercolour painting brought to life.\n\nThe game has five combat Classes; namely Scouts (Rifle), Shock Troopers (Infantry), Lancers (Anti-Tank), Engineers and Snipers. In addition, you also get to control Commanding Officer Welkin's tank. All equipment is upgradeable, relying on XP points which are gained as missions are completed. The Combat system is an amalgam of turn-based and third-person elements. You deploy a squad of your choice and each time you click on a squad member, the camera pans to third-person and he can be moved to an appropriate place. The camera then swings back to the bird's eye view of the map allowing you to plan your next move. Combat is challenging and is easily the best part of the game. Level environments are well-designed and test your strategic skills to the hilt.\n\nThe game's setting is inspired by real-life incidents, with a mix of fantasy and fiction elements thrown into the mix. The plot is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. It's B-grade anime with trope characters and a cliched predictable story. There are a few instances in the game where the plot impresses but, highly unfortunately, those are few and far between.\n\nI really liked the game. The war-setting negated some of the cheesy anime moments and the combat was fun and challenging. I'm glad Sega ported this over to the PC. Valkyria Chronicles is a definite recommendation from my side, if just for a refreshing change of art-style and grueling turn-based gameplay.","August 9, 2015","true","50.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","4"

The combination of tactics on the strategic map and controlling a soldier in the TPS style is done well, although there are some minor issues.

Visually game looks good, especially from the artistic side of things, although it's not a technical showcase - far from it. The music is pretty good and fits fine, but again nothing spectacular. Controls on the PC should have been better executed but after a little getting used to, it's good enough. For me, the biggest flaw of the game is pretty silly AI - often leaving troops in the wide open areas without cover, not using all action points, improper use of artillery and orders - true, they make up for it with sheer numbers of enemy soldiers but game is still a bit on easy side when you get used to mechanics and don't just rush forward with your troops (with exception of few missions).\n\n8,5/10","December 7, 2015","true","41.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A must buy for anyone who has even the slighest interest in RPGS and action games.\n\nPros\n\nStoryline\nInnovative battle system with perma death elements\nMusic\nCharacters\nCel shaded goodness\n\nCons\n\nBattle system targeting mechanics\nPerma death :(\n\nGameplay\nWhen I first saw Valkyria Chronicles on the Ps3, I remember thinking how lovely the artwork was. I remember passing this many times when I went into the shop, telling myself one day I would buy this game, often picking it up and just re examining the cover and blurb at the back, as I did with all games I considered bringing into my collection at some point.\n\nA fun combo of the Sakura Wars series, Fire Emblem mercilessness, Skies of Arcadia and third person element gameplay – Valkyria Chronicles delivers to its audience a refreshing experience and take on RPG action – and even spawned an Anime based on the game.\n\nFor lovers of emotional, involving story games, Valkyria Chronicles will not disappoint. With many allusions to the second world war, your main character and his forces start off in a tiny nation known as Gallia. As much as this nation would like to remain neutral in the erupting war between two superpowers around them –  because Gallia is rich in the precious mineral that sparked the war in the first place –  it gets invaded by the main antagonist nation: the East European Imperial Alliance.\n\nThrough the exploits of Squad 7, you will follow an well constructed emotional story that hints to darker elements of history.\n\nSpoiler text\nWithout spoiling too much, (but just in case so blank blank blankity blank) you have the Darscens, hated and reviled by everyone around them. You have the mysterious legend of the Valkyries, who have not been seen for decades, who wielded incredibly advanced tools, thousands of years ahead of the nations around them. So you have the small nation resisting a superpower through the incredible luck, skill and tight knit troops of Squad 7, and you follow their story into mortal peril. I will say that this game made me cry. There are small side stories too where you can learn more about the supporting characters. Combined with the game-play, it will take you a good length of time to complete the main story.\n\nThe Gameplay is a nice spin on normal tactical elements. The system used is referred to as BLiTZ, or Battle of Live Tactical Zones. Once you've gotten past the cut scenes you control a set amount of troops on the field, each with different abilities. You get to select your own troops in the recruiting menu. Each individual troop has strengths and weaknesses which add a nice personal element to the game, as you will actually end up being attached to some of your troops, despite their minor impact on the main story. In your Action Phase, where you can control the troops on the field, they have a movement phase and targeting phase. Your movement is determined by your AP (Action Point) Gauge. Once it runs out, the unit will no longer be able to move. So you will spend your precious AP trying to position your units in the best way possible, and take out the most targets. Positioning is absolutely vital because after you've finished moving all your troops, the enemy gets to do the same in return. So an out of position troop could get out maneuvered and targeted by several enemy units, and die because it was too far isolated, or unable to receive supporting fire from your nearby troops due to a bad location. Surveying the terrain and deciding which unit is best placed where will work to your advantage. You have: Scouts who are able to move very far, but are weak and lacking fire power. Shocktroopers who have less movement but more damage. Lancers who are slow, but can take hits and deal chunks of damage to tanks. Snipers who are also limited in movement, but have long range and can nitpick targets from towers. You also have tanks which are devastating to infantry and can knock down walls, but can't roll over certain terrain and have restricted controls. Engineers who can repair damage, barricades, disarm traps and replenish ammunition. These are just a few of the units mentioned.\n\nAlthough the system is turn based, it does require a lot of forethought in what you do with your turn. The bad thing about the third person camera viewpoint is that even what should be dead accurate shots can miss, due to the awkward angles it can sometimes present the character in. I personally really like the tactical elements behind this – especially as wrong mistakes will punish you in permanent unit death, like Fire Emblem.\n\nThat's right. Start resetting those levels every time you lose someone you like. (Unless you play with a heart of iron and accept each unit death that occurs.) I don't have a heart of iron. So resets did indeed occur. :(\n\nGraphics wise, I love the animations. Cel shaded games can be a bit hit and miss in my opinion, but this one has beautiful artwork, smooth and polished graphics with watercolour style backgrounds, with enough detail to keep you moving along. Although they're not stunning, they're well presented.\n\nI find the music of the game great. There are sad melodic piano tracks, uplifting battle themes and tense tunes in moments of great strife. I loved sitting around and listening to certain tracks loop, because they were so well crafted. The voice acting isn't particularly memorable in my opinion, but bearable and good enough for what we're presented with. You have the option (At  least on my U.K version) to have it both with the English voice actors or the Japanese voice actors. I actually did it with the Japanese voice actors.\n\nHonestly, I loved this game. I would happily recommend it to anyone that I could, especially as it combines the best of both worlds – a strong story, characters you become attached to, and an innovative battle system that will have you planning out your moves as best as you can, sometimes with the odds horrifically stacked against you.\n\nDefinitely get. Like, seriously. What are you waiting for?\n\nWant moar?

This game was under my radar for long time, until it became game on my radar, but never on top priority list.\nThen voucher popped in my inventory and tought to finally try it out. At time of writing this review, im just 5,3 hours in and im still what feels very much in beginning. And this game is fantastic. Despite its cheerful looks, it also has dark side, as well as rather complex and interesting gameplay. Only real gripe i have is with using a tank. Though if you look for lot of action, you might not also like it, as it has LOT of story.\nGameplay wise, one other thing needs mentioning: while it is fairly well ported, you can get somewhat confused at start by controls. But be assured- you can get over it fairly quickly (except mentioned tank).\n\nAs for story? Well, its set in fictional world, where continent named Europa is in 2nd great war in 1935. While war is between 2 major alliances, Gallia is small country thats neutral. But one side- the empire (which i find great that it is based on both starters of ww2 (signers of molotov-ribbentrop pact), not just one)- decides to attack Gallia.\nAnd even with just those 5,3 hours, i've found several themes, that make it easier for me to relate my nations history (not as lucky as Gallia in ww2).\n\nEDIT: 10,3 hours in and story just keeps getting better.","March 2","true","34.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Since I don't care for the characters nor the story, I don't care for the episodes. Fortunately, they can be skipped. As for gameplay, this is a turn based tactical game in the vein of X-COM.

I'm not a huge fan of anime but the art style won me over with it's steam-punk ish look. The game does a great job showing that you are not leading faceless and disposable soldiers but individuals who all have their own personalities and traits as well as written bios if you want to learn all you can about every character. The game also is supposed to pay hommage to both the German and Allied sides of WWII and both sides are humanized without removing some of the barbaric things both sides did to each other (there is a mission where you liberate a concentration camp, just as an example). The gameplay is a mix of turn based and real time where you position your soldiers then aim their weapons and while you are doing anything but aiming, enemies can shoot you and vice versa.\n\ntl;dr get it because it does a good job with the history, has good characters, there's an option to enable Japanese language with English subtitles, and the gameplay is unique.

The problem with it is that if you want to fully upgrade your weapons and skills (which you WILL need for later missions), you're going to want consistent "S" ranks for each mission which is VERY difficult to figure do, and more often than not there is only one real correct way to do it.  After a while, I found myself trying to mimic exact movements on Youtube for people doing "S" rank tutorials for each mission.

This can easily result in you losing your precious energy bar ridiculously quickly. However, aside from that, I see no other negative point of the game.\n\nThe story itself has a nice blend of military action, fantasy and romance.\n\nThe game itself has an interesting and fitting art style, with a "pencil shade" sort of effect applied which gives the game the impression that it's being told from a book, which it actually is and it is not the sort of realistic looking graphics you see in video games these days. Even though the game has third person shooter elements in it, it still retains the strategy aspect of the game. When you start the game, you realise that your units if used wrongly can be taken out easily, forcing players to strategise and plan out their next moves instead of recklessly rushing in to kill off the enemies.\n\nI could go on and on about the positive points but I feel that the points mentioned are the main aspects that I really love about the game.

Takes me back to my PS2 and Dreamcast days!\n\nI have never played this game before on PS3, but I have have always been a fan of JRPG type games. So when I found out that sega was going to port this game over to PC I got pretty excited because I had heard good things about this game when it came out for PS3.\n\nI'm not very far into the game, but so far the game is showing great promise. I love the way the game is illustrated. Meaning that the animated scenes kind of look like a painting(in my opinion). Now the animated scenes are not what I would call "current gen" graphics. I would assume this is because of the amount of work that would have to go into rerendering all of the animated scenes (and there are alot of them) would simply not be worth the effort. While these scenes look "old" it simply does not bother me. The rest of the game looks very nice and has obviously been updated. I even went as far as to tinker with it a little bit with sweet fx mixed in to increase the saturation and the sharpness. Although with this game I didn't find myself wanting to turn up the saturation much because this game looks good in my opinion being somewhat "washed out"\n\nThe controls for the game do take a little bit to get used to. It is only because the mouse cannot be used in the menu's. Once you get used to it though it really is not bad at all and honestly the way the game is set up it would actually be harder to get around the menu's with a mouse in my opinion. While you cannot use the mouse in the menu's it can be used while in combat which is huge, because at first I tried using the keyboard to aim and it was way to touchy to aim efficiently.\n\nThe story so far is interesting, but I cannot elaborate on it too muchon it, again because I am not that far into the game. It has the typical JRPG type feel and it is noticable in some of the dialogue, but in all honesty I have really missed it as of late being on the PC and not have owned a console since the PS2.\n\nI would definitaly reccomend this game to anyone who likes JRPG's and turn based strategy type games!\n\nAlso, not sure if anyone else knows about it or recognizes her or not, but Aika from Skies of Arcadia is in it! When I found her in the recruit list I got pretty excited! Skies of Arcadia was and still is one of my favorite JRPG's of all time! Now i just need to wait and see Vyse!... I need to dig out my dreamcast and play that again.","November 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looked and played beautifully, and this is still the case today.\nThe story is fun, the characters are memorable and the music is brilliant. It was criminal that this game was largely ignored, and releasing the sequels on the PSP only made the issue worse. Being a fan of a languishing franchise is the worst.\n\nSega have done every fan, and themselves, a favour by re-releasing this. Not only have they done a good job and released a game that *works* but they've ensured it runs well on less powerful machines.

This option is sadly not included in many English releases of Japanese games these days, but I'm happy to say that it is here. Having the option to choose between either full English voices or full Japanese voices is awesome, especially when the subtitles don't move too slowly or too quickly under the cutscenes. In terms of which you should choose, I would personally choose the Japanese audio.\n\n- The graphics are quite good. The watercolor-esque art style makes the game look very appealing. In addition, the added graphics control options, although not very numerous, still get the job done, making a game released in 2008 comparable to more modern games.\n\n- I'm happy to report that the port quality here is notably good. With recent disasters like Deadrising 3 and Watch_Dogs, I was expecting at least a few problems, but that's not the case. The game features keyboard support as well as controller support, with full interfaces for both. The keyboard controls take a bit of getting used to, but they're there, which still is a plus. The game runs smoothly, and I haven't noticed any glitches or bugs yet. Also, Steam Achievements are included, as are trading cards.\n\n-All DLC is included\n\n- Parts of the story are very good. It's rare for a war game to delve into genocide and neutrality like VC does. Even within the first hour you're witness to both of these oft-unused themes. Best of all, it's handled in a even-handed way, and it's interesting to see that it's not just the enemy that persecutes, but some of the hireable squad members are persecutors as well. I also like how the squad members each appear visually different, even if they lack a major role in the story.\n\n-Combat is fun, and the strategy aspect is present. Interesting mechanics like the "land potentials", which give bonuses and penalties to certain soldiers when they're on certain terrain, add another layer of strategy to the combat. The game's active aiming system also makes it fun to use the weapons. Finally, while active and fast-paced strategy are needed (especially when enemies fire at you while you move in real time, not just at the end of turns), the early game does a great job explaining the systems without holding your hand too much (if you die once, your second attempt won't display all the tutorial messages you've already seen.)\n\n\nMixed:\n- While I like the story overall (see above), some of the individual characters feel a bit stilted. I think this will pan out later in the game, but some of the early game interactions still seem awkward, and some of the classic anime stereotypes do exist. This isn't a big problem for me, since I don't mind some corny dialouge and hyperbolized personalities, but I do see how this could be a turn-off for the non-anime group.\n\n-The squad size seems a bit large already. I tried out a skirmish, and found that I only used a few of the many soldiers I deployed. While this can be fixed by well, deploying fewer soldiers, I'm afriad that the game is going to eventually force me to use more troops than I'll be able to command.\n\n- I wish there were more gameplay options to choose from. I wouldn't mind the ability to turn off the "aim lines" that give you the positions of your target, or the ability to only see an enemy on you're map when they fire at you or they are in your line of sight. It's a small complaint, but I feel that it would make me change up my tactics, and provide more of a challenge.\n\nVerdict:\nOverall, Valkyria Chronicles is a excellent example of how a port should be done. The port keeps the great original game intact while still making sure that the game is accesible to PC gamers (the system requirements aren't very intensive at all.) Couple this with a $19.99 price tag (US) and the inclusion of the game's DLC, and you have a game that's very much worth your money.","November 12, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(I had to give up progess in a operation because of time.)\n\nEverything aside if you like civ 5. I would say this game may perplex you. If you play xcom this game will do more then delight you. If you like any third person shooter/turn based game if you don't play this game you are missing out. But that said if you do not like turn based games. Do not buy this game. If you do not enjoy third person games but can tolerate the aspect of turn base. I suggest to buy it.

The story is rich, the detail put into the characters is deeper than most games today, and the art style is one of a kind. A strange mix of strategy and JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles will put you in charge of a platoon of soldiers. As you progress, you'll be able to recruit more, and will be forced to change your roster as locations shift.\n\nIt also has a unique homeage to older SEGA games like Skies of Arcadia by bringing in some recognizable characters into the frey. Though these characters aren't cannon per se, they do add a bit of unique flavor to the game. But even so, Valkyria Chronicles focuses on some interesting gameplay that makes each battle more diffucult than the last. Maybe your team is divided, maybe the enemies have more tanks. Who can say.\n\nThe units of your platoon act similarly to Rock Paper Scissors. Consisting of Lancers, Scouts, Assualt, Engineers, and Snipers. Scouts beat Assualt, Assualt beat Lancers, Lancers beat Tanks, and so on. The real odd ones out of this though is the Engineers and Snipers who act as supports mostly. The combinations of troopers is ever changing, and permadeath is a threat if you aren't careful.\n\n\nOverall, I highly suggest Valkyria Chronicles. While it is an older game, it has held the test of time, and is still better than most things Ubisoft.","February 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mostly turn-based with a little splash of real-time-ish components: when you activate a unit, you swap to a 3rd person over the shoulder. Movement is AP based, not time-limited, but units will fire in real-time at a unit that is in movement mode (applies for your units shooting at moving enemy units as well) so you still want to be mindful of cover while you move.\n\nDon't worry if you're not a FPS champ, once you switch to aim mode, enemy units stop getting that free suppresive fire, so you may calmly aim at your leisure (just be quick to hit the "aim" button when you're done moving, if you happen to be getting shot at there).","February 7, 2015","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The developers did a phenomenal job of recreating the pain of living through World War 2 by creating the most arduous, drawn out battle mechanic for an enemy I've ever seen.\n\nIf you leave that part out, the game itself offers an entertaining, likeable characters that grow as the story progresses and superb game mechanics. 10/10 the ani-nazis stole my tank.","December 2, 2014","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really enjoy them.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nBeautiful anime-style graphics in a drawn-looking style. only 9 points because of ps3-quality cutscenes.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nThis one's pretty subjective. If you like strategy rpgs á la Fire Emblem, FF tactics, XCOM, Wasteland, etc, you will probably enjoy it as much as i do.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: If you like strategy rpgs and/or anime-style games, this one's a no brainer, probably one of the best out there. Well worth its 20€ and (imo) much more enjoyable than most AAA titles!","February 9, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also it is about magical girls duking it out for fantasy switzerland during (Fantasy!) World War II. So the story and dialogue leave a bit to be desired, though they do have their moments.\n\nThe other big difference from other turn based tactics games is the unit control. Instead of just directing troops to move and shoot, you take control of them like a lite third person shooter. You move to where you want to go, select an enemy to empty your clip into, then get the chance to move again. Additionally you can spend your actions each turn to use various buffs and abilities as the commander. Another unique touch is that every one of your soldiers has a unique model and backstory, with abilities that reflect their personalities. The writing, again, is not fantastic, but you should be able to find a few characters you like to latch onto\n\nThe port was well done. my only issue is that the menus in the game cannot be navigated by mouse. The keyboard controls work well, but it is a bit unexpected. In combat the controls feature full mouse support and work wonderfully. Graphically the game has a great style that stands out and works well, even at higher resolutions. It is all very anime, but the watercolor theme adds a nice touch. The port supports any 16:9 resolution (Leterboxes if you have 16:10 as I do.) and runs very smoothly. The perfomance is far better than I have seen on other last gen PC ports, its really rather impressive.","November 12, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is something else that I can't quite classify. You have a certain amount of points you can spend on actions each round from an overview of the battlefield marking known troop locations and terrain features. Soldiers use one point, your uber-tank uses 2 per turn. You can use the same unit multipe times each turn, but you lose movement every time you do. When you select a unit, you're dropped into a 3rd person position in control of them and you have a meter that is burned while you run/take cover. During this time enemies are shooting at you eternally until you take the one shot you're alloted or end the turn. If you stand there not burning your turn energy, you'll die from enemy fire. When you go into shoot mode, the game pauses to let you line up your shot and take it. Then if you have any energy left you can dart back to cover, or just end the turn.\n\nBetween rounds your units heal a little, or a ton if they are in favorable conditions, like a camp. It's pretty sweet actually.\n\nThe real unique system here is that every troop you field (and there are dozens to pick from) has a unique set of personality traits that can give benefits and disadvantages during combat. As you train the squad more traits are unlocked, for better or for worse. Some units like others, and this causes special events to trigger when they are close to one another. It's as confusingly deep as any JRPG, but isn;t too hard to wrap your head around.\n\nYou can spend XP and cash earned to upgrade weapons and tank modules. There is a set of skirmish maps that aren;t tied to the story you can repeat endlessly for XP/cash, but if you lose a unit in them they're still gone forever.\n\nBottom line: 10/10. Solid port, fun story so far, and I want to keep playing instead of doing Dad stuff or sleeping.","December 20, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
