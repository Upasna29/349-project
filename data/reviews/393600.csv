I like that the plot doesn't take itself seriously but still has character and momentum. Here's what it does well:\naliens have unique styles and tactics. My favorites are the humanoid that splits in half as it's damaged and the spinning koosh ball death hamster things. The bosses are huge and menacing, kind of like Contra villains.\nmaps that build the alien station into fun and distinct regions (a la Castlevania/Metroid).\nexcellent art for a one-man shop. It's a combination of digitized hand-drawn and pixelated art. Some sprites are more polished than others, but the overall tone and feel is solid.\nweapons with different use cases: regular and upgraded laser, regular and upgraded sword, and, by far my favorite, the grenade launcher. I think there are others that I haven't found yet.\nOverall: Fun game and solid design. At first, I found it on the difficult side, but once I got into it, got sucked in. There's a lot to explore and find in here. Worth it for the price.","September 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/393600/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Not much to say about this one Robot Exploration Squad is a metroid-vania that while not bad, doesn't really add anything, nor does anything particularly well.\n\nThe aesthetic is, as you may imagine from the screenshots, serviceable, but not really... focused? The areas and atmosphere (along with the music) don't really push the game toward a certainly feeling or idea. It's just there.\n\nThe power-ups weren't anything special (they were either statistical upgrades (+armor/damage), or keys to acess new areas), but they were very one-dimensional. A counter-example would be Guacamelee, in which the abilities you gain are important in both combat and platforming in major ways.\n\nThe level design is alright, nothing wrong there either. Yet, again, it wasn't particularly meaningful or well done. It's solid, for sure! The areas connect well, there are a few secrets, your progress is fairly controlled, etc. etc.\n\nThere were some details in the game feel that I liked (the way the vegetation flew all over when you cut it was cool), and the jump, while floaty, had some fine control to it.\n\n\nOne thing I really disliked was the last boss-fight not having a checkpoint close to it. Fortunately, I only died once. But having to go through several challenging rooms and spending minutes before being able to get to the boss is really not a good way of doing things. At least not in this context. It was inconsistent (never in the game was this a thing) and artificially makes the boss harder.\nEDIT: There is a save-point, according to the developer, it's just not explicit!\n\n\n\nIf you just want a very simple metroidvania to pass the time, sure, this can do the job. But there's a general lack of purpose in it... nothing seems to be there for any particular reason. It's a metroidvania for the sake of being a metroidvania, and never really tries to add or excell anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the developer: please, don't be discouraged by this. The game is certainly functional. And it's complete, which is already something. But I'd rather play a game that has more to say, instead of being yet another one in the crowd.","March 17","false","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

It took a little over 3 hours to complete with everything explored.  Hidden coins scattered around were fun to collect.  Bosses were enjoyable to beat.  The map is a good size and easy to use.  A few teleporters are scattered around to prevent excessive backtracking.  Graphics and enemy AI are fairly simple, but that's really all you need for this type of game.  My only complaint is that I wish the map also showed various upgrades.  That said, I did find them all without too much trouble.","September 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

But look past that and you'll find a very competent Metroid clone for a really cheap price. Yes, it's low budget. It makes no attempt to hide that. It is a cheap, low budget game, with low budget visuals, low budget physics, low budget everything. But I had plenty of fun with it.","December 24, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
