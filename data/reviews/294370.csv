It hides its incredibly unforgiving randomness behind the disclaimer of "Roguelike," yet it provides little sense of progression or accomplishment.\n\nGrinding is the name of the game here.  You'll spend the first several hours fighting the same 3 enemy types - wolves, guardsmen and thieves - over and over as you run through the same scripted scenario over and over.  The environment becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly.  The points of interests that you'll come across aren't interesting at all.  Most of them provide some a generic text description before presenting a single "Search" option.  They'll either provide loot or do damage to your party.\n\nThe mechanics of combat are simple, and there is very little depth to the tactical nature of the combat.  This makes each run-through (and eventual death) flat and uninspiring.  I do not feel as though I have learned anything from that run-through which will aid me in the next.  I am left with the feeling that I merely ground out a little bit more xp to become numerically stronger, to get a little bit further when I play the same series of events and combats over again.\n\nThe made-for-mobile interface is reasonably polished and makes this experience less painful than it could have been.\n\nThe idea of FTL with turn-based party combat is a good one.  Unfortunately, this is not the game to do it justice.","November 8, 2014","false","10.8"," 143 of 185 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","143","185","0","0"

I'm going to break this down as simple as I can because there is a lot to chew.\n\n[Lazy Version] The sound is pleasing. It looks like an old disney cartoon. Characters are distinct but distinct enough to warrant more depth. The enemies are cool but lacking variety. On sale it's a yes, full price it's a maybe.\n\nThe sound is fantastic in this game. Not just the music but the way it softens when you're in a menu or how it changes tempo at the end of a battle. Something about it is just very pleasing to the ears. The music in each stage is also great without being so memorable that it gets repetitive.\n\nThe visuals are very reminiscent of the days of VHS tape cartoons. Think disney's robin hood or the fox and the hound. So if you're into that sort of thing, there you go. Another thing to note is the way the map folds out in little hexagons as you travel. Whenever you go to click on something the hexagon pops up and back down with a little wooden thump. Like you're playing a game with miniatures.\n\nThe characters are a little bland, which is disappointing. In FTL (my only real comparison to this game) you grew a little more attached to the hirelings. They were bland by design so you put a little something into them, but the mercenaries you use in this game are give distinct features and names. It just isn't early enough to warrant individuality. You only get a handful of them so the very least the designers could have done was give them a little flesh. Which isn't a huge problem until you think of longevity.\n\nThe Combat is fun, but not as diverse as it could be. Each zone has different mobs, with their own abilities and such. By the time you figure one out and get the hang of it, you get to another zone and get rocked all over again. Which I love, it keeps you on your toes as you advance, but there is no mixing. Which seems odd for any unit based strategy game. It's not repetitive, at least as far as I've played, but it would make things a lot more interesting if it did. Other than that the combat is a chess match of positions and unit abilities and chaining attacks. If you love strategy you'll like the combat.\n\nI think that's enough information for anyone on the fence, so I'll stop there.","June 13, 2015","true","25.5"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","42","52","0","0"

The gameplay is fluid and instinctive, the music is superb and even with only 40 mins of playtime under my belt, it's had me grinning several times with some wonderful humour.

I like the art style and the stripped-down resource/inventory management/crafting systems work surprisingly well. Actually, it has all the groundwork needed for an excellent game. And then it kicks you in the balls and runs away.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, for one, bosses tend to have gimmicks and gotchas. It means that you're unlikely to win a boss fight on the first go, because while you figure out what to do with him, you're probably lying down on the ground already anyway. So it's more Nethack than DC:SS.\n\nThe choices you make in exploration seem to be mostly based on luck, like FTL. There's no way to know beforehand if you should observe the snails or dig the ground in a cave, so there's no risk/reward mechanism, just guessing and being punished or rewarded. At least now you have a vague idea of the threat level of random mobs on the map (but not story encounters or strength increases... until you've died and learned from this, because there might not be any way to recover from a mistake).\n\nIn battles everything is dependent on keeping the main character alive (you can revive mercenaries, but once the main guy goes down it's Game Over), which makes you play the battles in a very conservative manner. Even if you have concentrated on building up nothing but health and dodge skills for the main guy, he can easily die in one or two turns (at least early on) if you've made the slightest error in the positioning. It is 'classic roguelike', but goes against everything that the genre has learned and moved towards to in the last decade. Especially in games with permadeath mechanic there has to be some way to ensure an error margin for the player, and one-shot death doesn't allow for it.\n\nI'm particularly frustrated, because there's lots to love in the game, but playing it makes me feel as if I'm in an abusive relationship. There is an easy mode, but it relies on grinding more than anything.\n\nThe skill in the Crowntakers comes not so much in mastering its mechanics and making informed choices, but learning its patterns and 'gaming' the mechanics. I'm sure there are people who are into it, but I'll be looking forward to the developers' next game. They do show a lot of promise.","December 28, 2014","false","4.2"," 51 of 71 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","51","71","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggg/recommended/294370/","eggg","EggAtix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggg/","314 products in account","So I have about 15 hours logged in this game. I've unlocked all of the characters, and all of their seperate loadouts. I did all of this on easy, which is the only game mode available to you until you beat the game once.\n\nThis game is actually a lot of fun. I really enjoy a lot of aspects of it.  It does a good job of blending the resource managment that you find necessary in roguelikes with the meaningful strategic choices that are present in any good tactical RPG. The engine works pretty well, I've only had one freeze, and one sound bug. But it autosaves before every fight, so no crash is every too big of a deal.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is that it feels, mechanically and systemically, unbalanced. It seems to work at first glance, but the more you play it the more you find yourself consistently frustrated by stupid things.\n\nA perfect example of this is their equiptment upgrade paths. In the game, you upgrade your character's equptment by using upgrade materials (Iron->Steel->Gold for Weapons;Cloth->Leather->Gold for Armor). The upgrade itself doesn't add any stats to the equiptment, but rather adds a slot to it. That slot can be filled with a rune to grant various bonuses. The important thing to note here is that any upgrade is, by itself, useless. Without a rune, there is no reason to upgrade, These materials can be found in the world, or bought from the blacksmith. Now here's the thing: Each character you recruit into your party needs to start with iron before moving onto steel, but iron stop showing up in shops or the world around zone 3 of 8.  So unless you horde enough iron to upgrade all of your future recruits by the time you leave the third zone, you can never upgrade them. And this directly goes against what a good roguelike player would do. They wouldn't waste money (which is used to do pretty much everything in the game) on materials that they can't use for another 50% of the campaign. Its locking away valuble gold in useless assets.\n\nThis is an EASY problem to fix. Just have certain events have an option to drop iron/cloth in later zones. Boom. Done. But this level of imbalance persists throughout the game across a lot of little mechanics.\n\n\nMy other big concern is that the difference between 'easy' and 'norma' is the difference between night and day. The difficult jump is so large in fact, that it qualifies as a design flaw in my opinion. Not necessarily how hard it is, but the fact that you force the player to play easy mode, a lot, before unlocking normal, and then expose them, with no transition, to the insanely more difficult normal mode just seems silly. Not only that, but the differences between the two modes isn't actually explained. They mention that your characters will all start from level 1, and you are foced to fight the bosses at the end of each level, but that's just a small part of what makes it so different.\n\nThe differences I've noticed are:\nCharacters start from level 1\nFewer rewards from battles\nSignificantly faster enemy growth\nMust fight bosses\nMajority of objects in the world are now locked, and require a lockpick\nLockpicks no longer sold in stores\nRes scrolls no longer sold in stores\nMercenary selected is restricted to 2 ranom mercs selected from the roster of 9 at each tavern (biggest and most significant change after the level honestly)\n\nI am going to keep playing normal, but as of right now (especially considering how luck dependant the combat can feel sometimes) I fail to see how it's beatable.\n\n\nTL;DR REVIEW:\n\nGood game. Needs a few patches. Don't get excited about Normal mode though, just play and enjoy the mandatory Easy mode when its still beatable and fun.","November 9, 2014","true","28.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

It just doesn't have the longevity to justify the full price.\n\nPros:\n- Turn-based combat on a hex grid. It functions as you'd expect and is largely entertaining.\n- Good aesthetic. Roguelites aren't always colorful or easy on the eyes, but this one certainly is.\n- Strong upgrade system. You can find some really cool stuff that has a huge impact on how you approach battles. This ties into a con below, unfortunately.\n\nCons:\n- Not balanced. Drops and store items are randomized, but not remotely equal. What you get and when has a *huge* impact on the difficulty of the game. One item (the book of bluffing) allows you to skip almost all of the combat in the game and gets you out of nearly every negative random event.\n- No need to rush. The game claims enemies get stronger depending on how long you take, but after a deliberately slow playthrough, I am unconvinced. It does not seem to have a counter for taking your time and grinding powerful items. The attempt is giving you a "bad" victory if you take more than 18 days, but considering I won easily at 20 days making absolutely no effort to hit the deadline, I don't think it would be terribly difficult to reach the "true" ending with a similarly laid back approach.\n- Enemy AI is moronic. It targets your units without regard to the damage incurred from doing so, for which units are likely to die if attacked, or for setting up its own counterattacks. Enemies love to set up overwatch in areas you'll never enter or guard on their second turn for no reason at all.\n- Huge repetition of enemies. Ignoring bosses, there are all of 4 units in the royal army (of which I only saw 3 multiple times), 5 animals (3 recolors), and 2 alternate factions, both of which appear to only have one unit with minor variations. It's not enough to stay interesting over 7 areas.\n- Few interesting random events. Crowntakers is clearly inspired by FTL, but where that game had different events at nearly every stop, this game instead offers you the same choices at nearly all stops, and Search (2h) is almost always the right one. What events there are have often entirely unpredictable consequences and lead to fights or damage for no reason at all. The characters and items required for special choices are often unclear and are never shown unless you have them.\n\nCrowntakers is a great idea that unfortunately did not translate into a great game. My three hours played were enough to beat the game once and see *many* of the random events multiple times in spite of how rare it is to get one.","October 22, 2015","false","4.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

The closet relative of which I'm aware is FTL in the sense that it's a game of multiple stages where the objective is to gather enough resources to beat the final boss, and most of the time (even on the Easy setting) you will not be able to do so because of the RNG.\n\nI defeated Easy in about 20 hours, and took about 8 attempts to do so once the other stage bosses were clear and I am thoroughly lame. (For instance, I did not even realize in over 8 hours of play that you could at any time in battle select of any your characters to use the next action point in a turn, and, thus, was limiting myself to the random order that the characters were selected by the game.) Each of the 9 available characters has two unlockable forms (each with one unique skill) in additional to its starting form, and so it's worth paying attention to what it takes to unlock the additional forms as you work through Easy, because otherwise you will probably have to grind a bit on Easy to do so. The additional forms are not necessary but do add variety to the available tactics.\n\nNormal is much more challenging, and I cannot imagine with my poor play skills the kind of luck that it would take for me to beat it. The bosses reset in every run on Normal, and every character starts from level 1, and so experience and food become much more relevant resources.\n\nLike Nethack, it's a fun challenge even if you have no resonable expectation of ever defeating it. It's quite a bit simpler and shorter than Nethack. (No item testing required in this game: once you know what an item does, it will do the same thing in all games and so you can safely sell the 4 poison kinds of muchrooms, for instance, once you know which they are.) You can easiliy get through even a comparatively succesful run attempt in less than 2 hours.

There is no tutorial so you have to learn the game for yourself, which personally, in a game like this, I think was a good thing, particularly since it’s not overly complicated and I did enjoy working things out.\n\nThe combat system is well thought out and quite easy to understand, but does have some little intricacies to it, such as the opportunity mechanic. Also, it’s clear what you’re doing before you do it, so you can’t really blame the game if you screw up, particularly when it comes to combat, which is certainly important in any rogue-like. (for example, the game displays whether you are at risk of taking damage from opportunity strikes, while also clearly displaying things like directions units can hit, where you need to be to backstab etc. It also shows if a ranged unit will be able to attack a certain unit from a new position before you move it – something not enough games get right).\n\nThe levelling up and equipment systems complement each other nicely and would allow for a variety of possible builds for a character. The rune system is a really cool idea – when you upgrade equipment instead of getting just a flat bonus you get spots for runes which give things like crit or dodge chance, lower cooldowns or armor. It combos nicely with the stats you can pick when you level up, giving you a degree of freedom when it comes to\n\nSo, while normal mode will certainly be the favourite of all of the hardcore rogue-like fans, I think the easy difficulty is a welcome addition, since this game is very hard, and letting you keep that little bit of progress really does give you that motivation to keep trying, because you get a little bit closer to winning every time. It also means newer players who may not be particularly experience with rogue-likes aren’t just thrown into the deep end and scared off by the difficulty.\n\nIf you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here’s a 2 minute one: http://youtu.be/qHOk6wGiQC4\n\nAnd if you want a more indepth look at the game, here’s an approximately 30 minute video: http://youtu.be/VzG3Ez9ruJY","November 8, 2014","true","15.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I thought I would give it a try...and was really surprised by how many great game design choices the developers made!\n\nExamples of great game design:\n+ Every map is randomized - not only the map layout, but also your units' positions!\n+ The fight is not going well and you're in a bind.  Do you use potions now or save them for a later fight?\n+ Mercenaries have different abilities, and choosing which mercs to use (and their variant skills) and building combos make it fun and replayable\n+ Normal is quite difficult, so the ability to carry over experience after defeat in Easy mode is a great option.  (I was able to beat the game in my 2nd easy playthrough, but it was close!)\n+ Runes for your fighters have good variety - enough to make choosing which merc gets which runes important for battles.\n+ A new merc can be unlocked with each playthrough, which incentivizes playing it again and again, even if you've won already (winning one time through might only take 3-4 hours)\n+ Your hero and each merc have unlockable skills. To unlock them you have to do perform various feats with each hero, which incentivizes you to change your tactics each playthrough.\n+ On the main map, at each cave/house/roundtower/etc, you can only choose to perform one action out of 2-5 options. Once you've done the action, you have to live with your choice!  On the next playthrough, you can choose differently...\n+ There is a trade-off between spending time searching all the houses, caves, etc, and progressing through the map.  Every night it says "another night has past, your enemies have gotten stronger".  It's another design element to force the user to choose a strategy.\n+ The user interface, menus and buttons have a good layout and are pretty intuitive.\n+ The encounter stories are entertaining.  They are short vignettes, entirely appropriate for the casual theme.\n\nOverall, very impressed with the design elements, as well as the bright colorful art.

A bit like Final Fantasy Tactics Lite.\n\nThough if I had some complaints of the game it would be Bugs, Price and Depth. ( Launch of the game puts you in a stuck screen, relaunch it.). The price of 15$ is a bit steep for what the game gives you. The Pit costs 13, FTL 9, Issac relaunch 15.

It took me several hour filled days to complete it on normal. Being a lot of fun and exceptionally challenging, this title was well worth the ride at every turn. It may not be perfect, but it is close.\n\nIt has that old school edge where the game doesn't provide you with out of game information about its parts and you must simply test them out as you go and memorize them for the next attempt. It stands strong on a solid bug free environment. It has an obvious beginning, middle and end game, which you can plainly see by way of the map.\n\nYou cannot get lost even though each stage is revealed as you go. It is mildly reminiscent of FTL in the way you progress and unlock content, play and replay, Feel when you have finally won for the first time on normal difficulty. Which, lets be honest, is all good…\n\nI did find the randomness in the loot drops to be strange at times when you are left holding tier 3 upgrades while no tier 2 upgrades drop. I think that the loot drop & shop inventory randomness may need a slight tweak here and there.\n\nI did find that the game could have benefitted from a greater variety of enemies with a wider range of special moves. I remember fighting wolves, thieves,  knights, & barbarians. Their may have been others but I honestly don't remember them right now. Even the boss battles, I wish had more variety on their moves and your options to win them. While fun and with much replay value already in the base game, I am very much looking forward to buying the DLC and playing through that as well.\n\nI truly hope they create a sequel to this game that is much longer and that has a wider variety of everything. Overall this game truly delivered a fun & challenging ride. I would surely recommend it to my friends and have already. I hope they move on a sequel right away and that it is simply put "A larger cast of characters & enemies", "A longer less linear journey", "Less blindly randomized loot and more space to carry it all" I would love to spend a lot more time in this game.

It wouldn't be "RNG" if it were "balanced", RNG implies randomness which is not solely dependent on "fairness" ( you can flip a coin 50 times and get 50 heads).\nThat being said, if there were ever a Crowntakers2 or DLC to extend the campaign (or institute a new one) I would buy it. -I also feel like this game could have an interesting multiplayer mode if developed.\n-Feels short, but then again theres a lot of content that justifies the $15 price tag\n\nRegarding some of the individual grievances against the game:\nFirstly, saying that this game is meant for you to fail before you succeed is incorrect.\nWhile this seems like the case in easy mode, easy mode is more of a way for you to learn and understand the true nature of the mechanics, specifically how the mercenaries work together and their individual skills. You can do a lot by combining the different skills of the mercenaries in different conformations. Another key aspect of this game is that it has a lot to do with positioning in combat. Often, people don't understand this and charge in meaninglessly. This difficulty isn't manufactured, it is intrinsic in the games design. Thinking of how you will position yourself for the enemy's phase is often more challenging than deciding what moves you want to make on your turn (which also is considerably difficult). Also, fighting thieves work on the former mechanic much more than the latter (and you can definitely win without losing anyone). While you will likely die because of your incorrect choices and on part because of the RNG, it is ultimately up to you to consider which choices are risky and which aren't.\n\nAll that being said, it is entirely possible for you to succeed on the first playthrough if you fully understand the games mechanics and strategy. I won't say its likely, but it was designed so that you can progress (from level 1) all the way to the castle in one sitting, because normal mode is beatable.\n\nThe game is not grinding based (once again, because normal mode is a thing) although you will need to if you want to unlock some of the different mercenary stages (which have no impact on your ability to beat the game, just your method of beating it).\n\nI'm not gonna address the QQ "errybody conters cept me" responses when the game hasn't been played for more than a couple hours.\n\n","November 14, 2014","true","17.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's got a lot of charm, everything is really well polished, and it's decently challenging without being too punishing.  I'm a big fan of rogue-lites and tactical strategy games and this does both portions justice, although with only a moderate amount of depth.  Think of it as a really well-done, casual-minded rogue-lite.  8/10\n\nStarting off can be a bit rough, but once you unlock some of the 'good' characters, like the scout, the game becomes much, much easier.  Also 'easy' mode is the way to go while you're getting a hang of the game and still unlocking.  A lot of the problems I had in the beginning were from rushing and not exploring, thinking the time pressure element was more important than it actually is.  Unfortunately, once you get the hang of it, it's a bit too easy.  And if you get the DLC, the game is also substantially easier, but does have more 'fun' content.\n\nCombat is the major portion of the game and I'm glad to say it does it quite well.  Certain mercs synergize quite nicely.  The map is never 'too big' and almost always fits entirely on the screen.  You always start first, but don't get to choose positioning, which is a fair enough tradeoff.  Most battles will be over in a few rounds.  Only the bigger boss battles stretch out and try your resources and resourcefulness.  Stun is a bit overpowered, which makes the barbarian maps a bit of a pain, but there are multiple options for avoiding fights, so it's by no means a gamebreaker.\n\nThere's a good number of 'fun things' like unlocks and achievements to keep you playing after you've won once.  A single run can last a few hours if you explore all the nooks and crannies.  I'm hoping they release some more DLC with an extended challenge.  Overall, it's a really fun game that I'd totally recommend for a weekend romp.  That said, $15 is a bit much, but during seasonal sales, it goes for much, much less making it an insta-buy.","December 10, 2015","true","14.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Just a simple turn based Roguelike with some persistent stats in the starting game mode. The graphics are neat, the art style reminds me of an older Disney cartoon movie, like the Sword in the Stone. The music is appropriate kind of cheerful fantasy style.\n\nThe controls are entirely mouse driven, and easy to use.\n\nIt has an option for a controller, but I cant get it to work, and I have no idea why you'd use a controller for this game. Trust me, I have a physical disability, and have to use a controller for most M&K based games that rely on realtime keyboard for movement and mouse for options/looking around. I'd be the first to be asking for controller support if the game needed it. This one doesn't, but has it.\n\nThe full review:\nThe help files suck and I still dont know what all those symbols with the hand and arrow on the right hand side does (Hold in inventory, give to someone, drop?)Theres not to much in the way of deep tactics, but its entertaining.\n\nBasically, you move around a hex board. You choose the direction you go, and then you walk to the next crossroads. Sometimes theres a place you can interact with (search a cottage, visit a merchant or blacksmith, an inn, cave , a fight ect). Random events happen at these places. Usually searching for small items, but other things such as HP or gold gain/loss, or nothing at all\n\nThe blacksmith and inn are used to improve your weapon/armor, buy things, rest and buy food, hire mercenaries. To improve your weapons you need to buy or loot a certain item shown in your inventory screen then take that item to the blacksmith and pay a fee. The item is upgraded. Then you take armor/weapon runes and put them in the slots you get from upgrading. The runes have different effects, and are swappable but only armor runes work with armor and vice versa.\n\nMercenaries are the people you hire at the inn to help you fight. They can gain XP and some of their their XP is persistant even after you die. So they get better and better as you go. Every mercenary is slightly different. I have found an archer and a fighter. Each character has 2 special skills they can use to help them in battle, and they are all different for each mercenary that Ive found so far.\n\nThere is a day/night cycle and after every 24 hours (shown in the lower left corner) the enemies get stronger a bit. So you have to balance searching everything and getting to the end of the map. The maps are random for each playthrough, so you dont know where everythings going to be.\n\nFighting is done on a turn based hex grid. Its simple. Move, attack, and choose facing. The arrow that is yellow instead of red is the chars back. Backstabbing does extra damage so facing matters. There is permadeath, so when the hero dies, you have to start again. Your mercenaries keep their XP (depending on gameplay mode), though, so its not like everythings completely lost.\n\nSeems like itd be really fun on a phone if I was stuck waiting for something. I dont do the phone-as-gaming-device thing though.","November 8, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

While certain elements leave something to be desired, ultimately, it's a game better than the sum of its parts.\n\nCharacters and game mechanics make the game.\nYou start out with a single hero, and gradually recruit mercenaries you meet in your travels (up to four extras per run). The mercenaries come with skills unique to them, and part of the fun is figuring out their strengths/weaknesses. In addition, each character comes with additional unlockable archetypes (i.e. skillsets), something I really appreciated. It made for fun rewards, a reason to use characters you wouldn’t naturally be inclined to, and gave everyone the potential to become useful where their default skills might be lacking.\n\nThe storyline is extremely light and just barely passable...\nI get that the game is more about proper resource management, the challenges you overcome, and the people you meet along your adventure, but a narrative consisting of two basic strings of storyline text (intro and finale), doesn't leave a whole lot of room for extrapolation. The story doesn't incentivize the player or encourage you to replay the adventure, it doesn't even help develop character.  It’s, summarily, placeholder text for a better story not yet conceived. Thankfully it’s also skippable (for the most part). Even the bits that come up when you investigate a new location are easily ignored, as the choices are basically, 'You wanna fight, or not?' (the answer is yes btw, always yes, and you don’t need to read through a snippet about an old woman begging for food to know it).\n\nShort in length, but highly replayable\nA typical run takes about an hour or so to complete (once you understand how everything works), and you will be required to run through the game more than once to unlock achievements and mercenaries. Where the story was lacking, the achievements are not, and provide ample reason to go back and play through the game over and over again.\n\nRogue-light, an easy mode that actually works.\nStart with Easy Mode if you want to give yourself the best chance at enjoying this game. It’s a welcome entry point to the game mechanics and world. You play through the story the same way you would in Normal Mode, but with the added advantage that you don't lose experience and levels gained in each run. Failure never feels quite so devastating when you know your characters are going to retain their stats (for the most part) in subsequent attempts. By the time you’ve completed your Easy run, you’ll be more than ready for Normal. In either mode, the only thing poking and prodding you to go forward is that enemies grow stronger by the in-game day.\n\nExploration and Battles remain fun.\nCollecting items and equipment, and taking on enemy mobs are rewarding experiences. The danger in a game so focused though, is that the game can become monotonous if the formula isn’t changed all that much from start to finish. Having special elements based around each area helps remedy this to a point, instead of fighting soldiers and thieves at every turn, some areas house natural threats/inhabitants and mysterious landmarks.\n\nThe storybook art style works marvellously for a game like this.\nExploring the map is enjoyable. Areas (in and out of battle) are vibrant and interesting. Each area has a unique look to it, and the contrast between them helps keep the game feeling fresh.\n\nThe soundtrack is an argument for quality vs quantity.\nIn a game you're likely to spend a considerable amount of time playing and replaying, 2-3 songs isn't really going to suffice. The tracks are good, and melt into the backdrop as you play, but even the best song is going to feel repetitive if it's the sole musical leg on which a game stands. The sound effects are satisfying though, my favourite being the sucking sound your cursor makes when hovering over items in your inventory.\n\nThe world is always changing… I think.\nI can't tell whether the maps are randomized. I've played through the game 4 or 5 times across each of the difficulties and each time, the maps kind of mesh together in my mind. It's not that it's overly samey, it’s just not immediately clear to me how the maps are differentiated. It could just be a by-product of the fog-of-war and the small scope of each area. However, it might be saying something that the random world doesn’t feel very random.\n\nFinal Thoughts.\nIf I was to sum this game up in a word, it'd be barebones. Crowntakers is entertaining however, and I don't feel bad in recommending it to anyone. I just hope the devs continue to expand the offering. This game really deserves it.","December 5, 2015","true","29.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The difficulty (which a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from) is around FTL level, there is an easy mode which is rather easy, and a normal mode, where the actual challenge lies. Actually beating it on normal requires some skill, but also some luck. If you don't like chance and randomness, this isn't the game for you, but if you enjoy high replayablity and don't get angry if you can't beat the game on your first few tries, then you should check it out.\n\nUpdate: Turns out the game gets rather easy once you've figured it out. I can beat it almost every run on normal now, which is slightly disappointing and I wish there was a hard mode or something. I still have a lot of stuff to unlock and I'm still having fun, but the game itself not posing a challenge anymore isn't perfect for a rogue-lite.","August 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As is deciding how to spend your gold as upgrades are very important and you can feel a real difference on each weapon or armour upgrade as well as potions in battle. Getting a hold of runes or rarer artifacts that boost your characters in different ways are a real treat too!\n\nCombat is great fun. It is also swift but has lots of depth. You really feel good whenever you dodge and counterattack an enemy. And having Halfarus the Archer on overwatch and snipe approaching foes from atop his tower is fantastic.\nWith awesome design features like getting an action point back when killing a foe, you can do some spectacular moves if you strategize well.\nI'd say the difficulty scales well and the Mercenaries getting powerful along the way with even more to be unlocked makes for great replayability.\n\nI was very surprised as to how much i like this game and i heartily recommend it.","November 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With some experience with tactics, this game is easy once you learn how things work. But many random factors create challenge every time. This game aint too easy to begin with, however: I tried to start with normal difficulty, and got my butt handed back to me twice in a row, before I swallowed my pride and switched to easy difficulty. Especially with DLC, inventory gets painfully small. Game is still being polished, meaning that devs haven't abandoned it yet, so there's hope that few bugs here and there may get fixed eventually. Maybe even new DLC may appear some day? Current DLC expands the game a bit (one new optional map, one new character, new items to clutter your already small inventory), so it's nothing like a mere overpriced texture. Game has autosaving, so if you have to alt+f4/cmd+q out of the game during a battle (have done that twice due to a bug), you don't lose your adventure.\n\nI recommend this game.","November 29, 2015","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing annoyingly wrong with it, and a lot is satsifyingly right. The grid-based combat is built around a "reset rampage" mechanic that makes the battles fast-paced (and if you set up your ranged hero properly they can often wipe out a whole encounter in one turn). The upgrade system works really well and it gives you a lot of chances to find ridiculous synergies (infinite range crossbow guy gets a "deal and take more damage" buff, you're pretty much set for life with that). Only real problem is that the game doesn't tell you when your inventory is full (at which point you start dropping things) so you have to keep track of that manually.\n\nThis is a short game (10 hours and I've beaten it twice, pretty sure I've seen everything outside of the DLC) but it's a neat experience so grab it on sale.","March 8","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maps, item drops, and combat starting positions are all random to drive the challenge.  Good run-thoughs can turn bad pretty quickly.  Replayability is good because you can mix the four helper mercenaries from a group of about 10.  Two game modes- first keeps hero and merc experience [rogue] and  second always starts them green.   Most interesting thing about this game is that it achieves a sliding degree of difficulty without just wrenching the enemy health/number.  If you play easy with fully leveled up heroes and take your time you should succeed about 90% of the time and get a weak ending to the story.

It's as if they made the game as a single-playthrough experience which lowers the difficulty automatically each time you fail (which would be a fine small game IMO), but then they added the replayability unlocks to it...\n\n\n\nThere are unlockable heroes, which are limited to unlock only one new hero per playthrough, as well as hero-variations if you have used each hero well enough (i.e. kill 30 enemies with Hero A1 to get A2. Get Hero A to 10 strength to unlock Hero A3)\n\nIf you "just" want to complete the game fast enough to get the achievement, this took me 7 hours.\nIf you want to try all the different heroes as well as each of the 3 variations of the heroes, then I'm guessing it might take 20-30 hours.\n\nI suspect it will start to get rather repetitive if you're trying to unlock all the heroes though, but I was not bored during this first win.\n\nConclusion:\nI'd say this game has 5-7 hours of effective gameplay, followed by an optional grind of roughly 10 hours to unlock everything (maybe less).\nI bought the game on sale, so I'm quite happy with the amount of entertainment I got for it.\nI'm not sure if I would want to pay 15 EUR for it (normal price for my country), so I recommend getting it on sale (30% off or less).\n","December 31, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One second you could be doing perfectly, all your party members are full health, and full power. The next, you find an event that does something horrible to you that can screw your entire run up. It can be annoying, it can and will frustrate you, but this game has such a nice charm to it that I keep coming back.\nIt's not the easiest game, it's a Rogue-lite, you WILL die, but all your characters will keep their experience and level (when playing Easy Mode). Some runs will just be to level up newer characters you unlock. I've done quite a few runs like that so far. The art style is fantastic in my opinion. Everything looks nice and fluid and the soundtrack, while not amazing, does a good job of fitting the game.\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game, but only for people who enjoy Rogue-lites and a bit of a grind to get characters up levels and for the final boss (which can be a pain in butt if you're low levelled).\n\nPS: If the Devs read this, I do have one big complaint, and that's the way you deploy into battle. The deploying is randomized, and more than half the time, my ranged characters would ALWAYS be right next to one or more melee enemies, which means they would be useless. If you guys can fix that, or at least make it less random for the enemy to spawn right on top of you, that'd be nice.

The now angry authorities opened fire on my vessel in order to "quarintine the outbreak"...\n\nThe music is fantastic and the art style has a Disney fantasy film flavor that feels both charming and familiar.\nIt's still a lot of fun to grab a new party member and test out his abilities.\n\nIn a word, the game is light but probably not the rogue-like you are looking for.\n\nI paid about $10 but probably should have waited for a steeper sale.","February 23, 2015","false","14.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Die, die, die, die, die, die, die. The end.\n\nNo, I'm not very good at this game and that's the rub.\n\nI understand what Crowntakers is trying to do. It's trying to be a cute, short, rogue-like game. I just think it doesn't pull it off very well. I've played many rogue-likes and either this game is obtuse or the difficulty needs to be adjusted because it seems to be the same old thing. I get through the first map OK. I died probably 10+ times on the second until I cleared the Wolf boss. The third map? Not a chance nor do I see how it's even possible. The map is filled with enemies that literally just appear on the battlefield and stab you for a couple of points of damage before you can act. That might not sound like much but when you only have 7 HP to start, a couple of hits like that and the game is over because I almost NEVER find anything to heal with. So where's the fun? I don't even see how it's possible to win and that's where the game breaks for me. A good roguelike holds out hope of winning next time if things just go your way a little bit better. After an hour and a half, I don't see any opportunity to progress.\n\nOk, I realize that sounds whiny. And I asked for help on the forums. The general responses were (from a very limited group of fans) along the lines of "suck more noob" and no developer response. That certainly didn't help my impressions of the product.\n\nThat's too bad too. I find the art style cute and the music ok. I want to play in this world. But I'm not able to figure out the "puzzle" and repeatedly dying doesn't make for a good roguelike, it makes for a boring one. The real trick in crafting a game of this type is balance and I don't see it as being well balanced. Moreover, with very little variability from start to start the game quickly becomes tired and tedious. That's a fairly fatal flaw. In most roguelikes your next game is very different from the last one. In this one it's just another go at a very similar map. This isn't a recipe for fun. Given the large number of roguelikes out there, this one can be safely avoided. I paid about a buck fifty for the game and I didn't even get that much enjoyment out of it.

Crowntakers is an indie turn-based RPG from Bulwark Studios and Kasedo Games. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nI was a fan of the vibrant colors that are presented in the Crowntakers color palette (which is unusual for me, but hey.)\n\nThe Bad\n\nJust like the statement I opened with, Crowntakers reminded me a lot of FTL, but it lacked all the things that made FTL a fun game.\n\nCharacter customization is practically nonexistent. There are no other weapons or armor to swap out on your characters (which could have really helped fight some of the monotony that is rife in this game); what you see is what you get until you upgrade to a marginally less lame version of the equipment.\n\nThe music is repetitive. Very repetitive.\n\nThe main character that you are stuck with looks like some backwoods halfwit and it is almost insulting that you are forced to play as him.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThe most Meh thing about Crowntakers is that they want to charge you money to get the game.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nIf you have been wanting to play Crowntakers, don’t bother. It is a waste of time and you could better spend your time and money on a far more entertaining game. As always, thanks for reading.","November 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will rapidly find yourself facing enemies that the game says are far too tough for you if you ever make the mistake of clicking the 9H option, so why add it? The rewards for clicking 9H are laughable (+1 str that you can buy for 1 gold). Add in the random start locations taking any semblance of strategy out of the battles and you've got a game that just feels annoying rather than hard. 1 minute you're facing 5 health minions, the next you're suddenly facing 3 armor/13 health minions who can inexplicably counter attack. And the bosses who can teleport or can't take damage from melee, inexplicably, without any reason, without any warning.\n\nObviously you're supposed to play it again and again, but other games the pressure is gradual, the challenge ever growing. This one it's, easy, easy, easy, STUPIDLY STRONG. Having played 4 games, the difficuly ramp up just isn't there, even on 'easy'. There's no balance, no finesse, no satisfaction. You simply feel like you wasted an hour of your time to get rofl-stomped against an enemy that doesn't obey the same rules and makes any sort of strategy completely pointless.\n\nI've played and loved FTL/Dungeons of the Endless/Rogue Legacy but this simply doesn't work.","September 30, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like the art direction and the concept. Play a hero on a quest exploring maps, hiring party members and upgrading their stats and equipment. Problem with the hero system is you have to complete quests to get the heroes. You will die the first couple plays as you get your party of 5 together. Brutally hard in the start and then ends very abruptly with a fairly easy battle; which might be for the best because it gets dull. If the journey just had more depth and variety I could see it being worth playing through more times to see what other party members I could find but of course it would also need a stronger ending. Unfortunately I have no urge to play through it again after beating it.\n\nTo bad the game was not really expanded much with the DLC. I started off with the DLC installed, as far as I can tell it adds a new class and a new small map. Problem with the map is using it turns off the new party member quest making it take even more plays to get party members. I finished the game however once I could obtain 5 unique characters partly because this new class is over powered. If you do buy it I would recommend passing on the DLC.\n\n4/10\n","September 26, 2015","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played this for nearly 20 hours and I have to agree with most of the negative reviews, Dont waste your money. This had the potential to be a great game but it is onesided and often to predictable. the only thing you have going for you is pure chance during strategic map movement, and the only thing you have going for you in Tactical Combat is pure Time in game and high level character and mercs, otherwise you are going to lose. I agree , they could make this much more enjoyable, especially considering the continual re-run of the same monotonous crap in order to get your character and mercs to a high level.  It's enjoyable on a play one map and leave the game alone for a while level.  Otherwise I wish I could get a refund and wait for a similar game that actually makes adventuring not so dang predictable...

Extremely random with too few player choices and not enough information about the choices that are available.  The only rogue-like aspect to the game is permadeath.\n\nMaps are presnted as a hex grid  for no particular reason since map movement is point to point. Each of the several possible encounters can be met once & the player must make his choice without any suggestion of possible outcomes.  Few encounters well balanced.   Many cannot be avoided.    Once the player has exited a map he cannot return to it.  As a result, if the player encounters a situation which he cannot beat in his current condition there is rarely a way to improve the character and try again.\n\nCombat begins with players characters  deployed on a hed grid map, frequently with no opponents in view nor any suggestion of their location.  Nearly always surprised even though the text says that player is aware of opponents.  It is not uncommon for player's characters with seven or eight hit points each to face four or more opponents each with six to fifteen hit points, when played on easy.\n\nThat the devs assume that placing the player into situations in which he has no chance of success makes for amusing game play is but one mark of their shortsightedness.\n\nCamping & inns do not replenish hit points and rewards for the rare battle victory are inadequate for character survival.\n\nThere is no sense of progress.  No feeling of having learned how to increase the character's chance of success in subsequent games.\n\nThe entire game could be condensed to having the player roll a die at the beginning and then declaring him failed or victorious.\n\nAll in all a poorly designed game utterly lacking in the elements that that would make it enjoyable.\n\nThe game is not difficult it is highly random with an extremely restrictive choice basis.  That means that the player's chance of completing each level is very small.\n\nThe first level has eight to ten encounters.  Each encounter has two or three options.  Each option may have up to a half dozen outcomes.  Since each encounter occurs once per game sampling each of the possible  options on the first level  alone requires between 64 and 512 plays.\n\nIt is relativly easy to reach the second map but highly unlikely that the play weill have gained enough knoweldge/experience from the first map to effect his chances of surviving to the third.\n\nThe second map is a bit less random.  It has more combat encouters  but opponents are significantlhy stronger.  I place the probability of surviving any one combat between one-quarter and one-third call it 7/24.  There are four combat encounters, I believe.  The chance of surviving all of them would be about 1/140.  It takes 97 plays to have a 50% chance to complete this level.\n\nIf you are willing to play the game a couple hundred times you might make it to the next map.\n\nThough there a many player choices on each map the outcome of each choice has a high variability.  That means that very little of the information you have garnered from previous game play will contribute to your choices in your current game.\n\nSince each map has few opportunities for character improvement unpassable roadblocks are common.\n\nIt is these last two points where this game fails as a rogue-like.  The best rogue-like games present problems for the player and provide him with opportunities to surmount them.  The worst rogue-like games simple provide scads of random events.\n\nWazHack & Bionic Dues ae both good rogue-like games.  Crowntakers is not.","December 25, 2014","false","15.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

On easy level with all 5 merc's at level 10 and great weapons and armor upgrades you will get totally pawned by the final boss. He has 50 HP 6 Shields and regens shields every turn, does not take attack of opportunities when he moves or attacks and when you do kill him he respawns with 25 HP and 4 shields which rege every turn as well with no apparent cap. By then the other 6 henchmen, 4 of which heals him every turn really makes this unrealistic. I love a challenge but this goes far beyond that. I wish I had not spent the money. Hereo/mercs cap at level 10, HP from 6-13 max, the cost to upgrade dodge or crit take away too much from damage or health so not balanced at all. ie great crit % but you will get killed in one or two hits. The game has very little strategic value as everything relies on luck not skill. 80% hit chance is more like 20% hit, more often than not your 3-6 attacks will miss.

The final boss is pretty terrible though - it breaks basically every single rule of the game that you've learned up to that point and there seems to be no real strategy to it. The way they handle difficulty is also poor - you are stuck on "easy" mode until you grind enough to kill that boss, then you can play "normal" mode where all of your progress is permanently lost forever and you are unable to make any more progress. Significant flaws, but fun for a few hours.

I'd have to say this game is basically Heroes of Might and Magic in the rogue-like genre. If that sounds fun to you then pick up this game on sale it's worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Two difficulty settings that are significantly different depending on how you want to tackle the game\n-Art style is like something from a childrens fairy tale book, colorful (no more shades of gray and brown!), and aesthetically pleasing\n-Combat is fun and very fast\n-Time limit forces you to make tough choices if you want to see the "good" ending\n\nCons:\n\n-Lack of variety in tile sets\n-Music, while fun, is a little repetitive (it seems like they are mostly short tracks on infinite loops)","September 7, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically medieval FTL, but quite a bit easier.  It could definitely use more difficulty levels (I think harder, but a lot of people apparently want easier ones too).  It can be too hard for some, and gets too easy after about 15 hours if you are the sort of person who loves FTL and can beat it on normal.  It would be as good as FTL or Dungeons of Dredmor (which are as good as it gets imho) with a selection of harder difficulty levels.\n\nThe graphics and sound are both very charming and immersive.  It has great music for this type of game, and I love the look of it.","August 25, 2015","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
