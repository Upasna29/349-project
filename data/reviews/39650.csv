This game is great for those who enjoy business and life sims, plus it's in the medieval times. I became addicted to this game because of its political mechanics, and how you rival other dynasties through out time (Through business trade, political regard, and even combat). I have played too many hours on the Guild 2 and the others in the bundle, and I'm always finding out new ways to do things. Does it have bugs? Yes. Is it pretty behind in terms of graphics? Yes. But to me, it's a really good game that I can spend 10 hours on in a row and not get tired of it. If you feel iffy about the game, then just get it when it's on sale. However, I highly recommend this game and The Guild 2: Renaissance and would say they are worth their standard price.","November 26, 2013","true","81.9"," 176 of 179 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","176","179","0","0"

I can't say I have seen much if anything like this. You directly control your clan and family, but you also have RTS style building elements and upgrades. Theres also politics and courts and elections you can go through aswell.\n\nThe only problem is its not made very well. Theres alot of stuff here but not all of it works very well or is interesting. You can manage business yourself, but thats very tedious and the AI knows what its doing while even on AI control you can still manually assign business to do stuff.  You can also hire thugs to do your bidding and I found the simplest way to get stuff down was to kill my competitors in the street in the middle of the day.\n\nJust call me Machiavelli, its better for them to fear me then to love me. Better to bleed them in the street then to take them to court.\n\nWhich is unfortunate because there seems to be a decent amount of buruecracy you can do to get what you want in this game but thus far it seems more of a bother than just hitting them with your pointy bits and calling it a day.\n\nIts alright but unfortunately its just not put together very well and can be pretty buggy. In theory its an amazing idea but the game falls a bit short of that though it still remains pretty good if you can look past issues like people switching between German and English voice actors mid court for no reason and AI just refusing to do what you tell them do forcing you do find a way to make them.\n\nOn top of that the mechanics just arn't telegraphed to the player extremely well and how things work is a bit confusing.  Such as how do you get elected to a seat? Bribing people seems to not work very well and it seems random luck if you do win an election.\n\nIf you really want a city/village building game with politics and family management then this is about your only choice, its not a terrible game but it certaintly is meant to fulfill a niche and it could definetly have had more work put into it and polishing.","May 24, 2015","false","9.0"," 68 of 94 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","68","94","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/39650/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","Was fortunate enough to win this in a giveaway, and I am so happy to have had the chance to play this game.\n\nIf you like managing a family dynasty, heavy emphasis on ROLE-playing, and micromanaging simulation seen in games like the Patrician series, then you will love this one. For me, I can pass so many hours playing without even noticing (very similar to how I play Civilization - "just one more action...").\n\nThe aesthetics are great despite being a bit dated - on max settings it is still really nice to watch your characters move around. The music is appropriate and helps immersion into the medieval setting.\n\nThe controls are not too challenging to familiarize yourself with, however, the learning curve can range from moderate to quite steep - especially if you are not used to playing resource management games (in particular, buy/sell mechanics in the market). The tutorial is absolutely essential if you haven't played the first Guild, and I strongly recommend you play through the 7 different tutorial scenarios. They are pretty quick, and you can breeze through it if you click the message icon on the left of the screen, which allows you to read the narrator's script and move on to the next bit (if you are a faster reader).\n\nThe options in the game are amazing and refreshing for an older game - I wish you could do some of the things in here in newer open-world games like The Elder Scrolls, Witcher, and Fable series.\n\nYou start off by choosing which game mode to play - I suggest just leaving it set to "dynasty," where you keep on playing until your family tree ends (last living member dies without an offspring). Set the difficulty closer to easy and the number of dynasties to a lower number like 2 or 4 to help you get a feel for the game.\n\nBefore you start, you will make your first playable character. The different classes give you specifc boosts to skills, encouraging you to focus on areas where your role excels in. For example, the scholar is very powerful in politics, so concentrating on upgrading your charisma, rhetoric (used in political intrigue), and empathy (used to break through opponent's rhetoric) will benefit you greatly. The rogue can be extremely difficult to play because many of the things you will do are illegal, so maximizing your dexterity (for dodges) and stealth (less likely to be caught performing illegal actions) will be critical.\n\nAfter you start the game, you will have enough money to build a starting building that will provide you with income through resource accumulation and management. For example, the scholars can build a church or a specialty shop - both of which can be staffed by workers (priests and conjurers {pretty sure that's what they're called}). These units can collect natural ingredients (holy water by priests; herbs and plants by conjurers) that can then be transformed to more expensive items that you can sell back to the market. Other bonuses are granted by the buildings you choose to build - for example, you can hold sermons in your church to publicly denounce a rival family under the guise of divine favor (or disfavor for the opponent, I guess). You can also create positions in your magic shop to cause people to temporarily like you more (increase favor).\n\nBuildings can be upgraded once your character(s) meet the required level, however, for your houses you must be a certain reputation level. To increase this value, you need to apply for a higher noble standing in the town hall (just have to pay a heavy fee). You start off as a commoner and can pay 500 gold to become a citizen, which allows you to upgrade your modest hut to a nicer house. After that, you can pay 2500 gold to become a patrician (again unlocking the next tier for housing). Be advised, it is difficult (and time-consuming) to amass a large number of gold in the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are also upgrade trees for each building, where you can do things like increase storage capacity for items, increase worker count, and increase security of the building (causing thieves to take longer to break into your structures). The game has a slow - fast forward feature, allong you enough time to plan your actions (or accelerate them if you are ready to move on).\n\nAs you perform actions, you gain experience points that you can use to upgrade your skills like dexterity, constitution (increases health points and number of items slots you have), martial arts (determines how proficient you are in combat) and bargaining (gives you a larger bonus when you sell items).\n\nYou can hire bodyguards from your household to follow you or protect your assets (you can make them patrol around your buildings). On the flip side, you can build rogue buildings like a smuggler's den to recruit thieves (they can break into buildings or pickpocket within an area) or a thug hideout to hire bandits (they can camp on spots to waylay any caravans). Crime is very risky in this game, as witnesses' memories for your actions will slowly decay over time (during this time they can still report you to the guards). Even worse, a competitor can even try to blackmail you with evidence of your illicit activites or take you to court. Depending on the crime and the crime laws, you could be fined or even executed.\n\nThe courtship mechanic is fairly simple, but critical to surviving dynasty mode since you need offspring to continue your legacy. You start off with one character, but once you get a spouse you can choose to use her/him as a second character (you can only have 3 active characters at a time). Once you choose to turn an active character to an inactive one, you will be unable to add them to your active party - forcing you to really plan out your long-term goals.\n\nFor politics, you can choose to run for office (starting at the lowest available tier). As your town develops (first into a city, then further on), you will unlock more positions that you can run for, with mayor at the very top. When you run for office, you can try to bribe the current council members to help swing votes in your favor. You could also blackmail them with evidence of their illegal activities (perhaps you ordered one of your bodyguards to "spy" on a councilman, following him until he tried to assassinate another competitor), however, they need to have illegal activites in the first place.\n\nThe game is absolutely fantastic, and I will provide you with a possible scenario to help show how the game can play out:\n\nYour character is a craftsman, so you built a smithy to start crafting weapons and armor. You buy raw materials from the market, bring them back to your smithy with your wagon, then turn it into basic weapons and armor. Once you have enough money, you hire a few workers to craft the equipment for you. Free of your regular labor, you move on to see a wife.\n\nOnce you successfully court a woman, you immediately take her to bed and have a baby boy. With your heir secure, you begin your very long-term preparations to enter the political scene.\n\nYou've upgraded both your house and your smithy thanks to your effective craft/sell management. With an excess of gold, you are able to send your child to school, then to an apprenticeship at the local magic shop, and finally to university (you have 3 different opportunites, each costing more gold and providing higher bonuses to your child in preparation for when they turn 16 and you can add them to your party).\nSince you have the only fully upgraded smithy in both towns (you can select maps with 1, 2, or 3 towns), all four of your bodyguards are outfitted with the best equipment. You make sure to spend some experience points on leveling up your son's martial arts in case.\nYou eventually realize that your patriarch will most likely not live long enough to become mayor (life expectancy is represented by the height of a candle on your character portrait), so you change plans and decide to pave the road for your son.\n(continued in comments)","July 25, 2014","true","4.9"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","4"

I play "The Sims" for a day and call it quits, its just not for me. Ive only been playing "The Guild 2" for half a week and ive already invested nearly 40 hours at the expense of work and sleep, for me this game was very addictive. Its practically the sims but based in the dark ages where you grow a family and basically conquer your village with money, economic strength, and political power. This game features an abundance of mechanics, marriage, work, religion, politics, assassinations, blackmail, ect but there are various areas where its broken. For example there are times when my building was being attacked and i couldnt defend it because the attackers were glitched inside the house while not actually inside the building. (this can be countered by sending your men inside the building, then exiting the building with the camera and re selecting your men and ordering them to attack, then they exit and fight properly...assuming that there are no obsticles in the way). The game allows you to upgrade your cart to move faster, but you can only move as fast as traffic will allow, sometimes the streets are packed (it may be intentional to force you to strategize timing). My only other complaints are with its options menu, you cannot run this game windowed unless you alter the .ini file, and even then it pauses when you click away to another monitor, and you cannot remap buttons which you might assume isnt a big deal but when your speed keys are + and - it takes much longer when it could have simply been remapped closer to WASD. Oh and the game crashes on me once in a while so i recommend turning on autosave. Otherwise this is a game that i HIGHLY recommend if youre into sims and historical themes, yes it has a few problems but the positives outweight the negatives. Just be sure to get it on sale.\n\nThis is just a funny story that happened in game, you dont have to read this if you dont want to. My wife applied for the position of town executioner which was held by the member of a rival dynasty. They didnt like the fact that i was trying to rob them of their title so they killed my wife, i reported this crime to the town hall and was given a day to appear in court to testify. I was working that day in 3x gamespeed just blacksmithing to pass time and I missed the court date. The next day i was arrested and thrown in the dungeon to be tortured for missing court. so essentially, i was tortured because my wife was murdered :(","October 3, 2015","true","63.8"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","27","28","11","0"

This game is worth more than the metacritic. Personaly, If you read the ALL of the  tutorials, its a fun game. It takes you about 25-35 minutes to complete the tutorials, not reading them will screw you in failure.\n\nThe pros:\n.Four classes, so when you finish a game in one class, you dont say, well Im done, you say, lets play another class.\n.Mulitplayer. Dont let the "Single Player" fool you. If you can find people to play Guild 2, then your in for a party!\n.Crime: Yes, there is a "robber" class, however you can't just to bad things willynilly.

Yes, you can "run" the town, but once again, the game wont just say, Here you go.\n.People speak SOME words. You have to admit, thats better than reading text.

Essentially what this means is that it is a simulator with some heavy RPG elements where you play as a family through the ages.\n\nAs the game starts you make your character and pick a profession then you get put into a European city of your choice and set up your business. Soon enough however, your starting character will die off, hopefully from old age and not an angry competitor, but that is not the end. If you were smart enough to get married you can continue playing as your spouse as well as any children you may have had and so the game continues.\n\nAs you progress in the game your character get increased stats and abilities which will rub off your children through teaching and genetics as well as the ability to purchase higher titles and run for public office. Of course there are other dynasties that try their best to put you out of business through out-competing you as well as myriad of more nefarious means such as firebombing your business and shooting you.\n\nThe game is heavily reliant on the flowing and open supply and demand economy that dictates the price of all the goods in the game, unfortunately this does not always work quite that well without player interaction and cities often run out of basic products quickly simply because the only supplier has died or gone bankrupt.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in the character interactions that all come out through this economy simulation. Did someone firebomb your bakery, go to court and attempt to have him put in jail if he doesn't bribe the magistrate or kill off the witnesses first. You want to get rid of someone but doesn't have the legal status to risk murder? Challenge him to a duel and hope for the best.\n\nSomething that is also worth mentioning is that The Guild II, despite choppy animations, is a fairly pretty game for what is almost an indie production. Turn the graphics up as high as you can and you can almost forget that it was never an AAA development, until you hit yet another bug that is.\n\nThe Guild II is a fun game in a fairly limited genre, it is heavily marred by bugs and semi-broken economics but it is still a game you can get tons of hours into without getting tired of it.","January 14, 2013","true","221.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

You can do just about anything you want, approach it any way you want, end goal is simply to outlast the other noble families. Whether you do that by planting an identical business next to them and driving them out of business and into debt, taking them to court for every little misgrievance, taking your place as king and exiling them to another city to restart, becoming the judge and bringing down the lawhammer on their everythings, robbing their houses and trashing their wagons, simply going about your business and hoping they die out due to no sons to pass on the family name, or any number of other methods. It's a surprisingly in depth game about playing your cards right and sometimes slipping a few gold coins into the right palms to become the only noble left in the land, and 100% worth the purchace if on sale, or full price if you are really into management/sim style games.","April 3, 2015","true","32.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","17","18","10","0"

While it has a steep learning curve, this game is truly a gem of a sim/rpg. My only suggestion is PLAY THE TUTORIAL. This game was almost impossible to figure out on my own, but after playing the tutorial the game got a whole heck of a lot more fun.\n\nBasically, choose to start your family dynasty with a selection from several classes including: Craftsman, Patron, Scholar, and Rogue. Once you get started you can start a business, hire employees, improve your buildings, buy titles for yourself, woo a lady (or man), have children, send them off to school (or dont), commit crimes, bribe city officials, blackmail people, smoothtalk your way out of a court sentencing, smoothtalk your way into a public office....

Well then became simple smith,alchemist or farmer delivering your merchandies to market every day and dont pay any attention to that mean world around you.\n\nWhat i like:\nGraphics is nice,textures are sharp enough,scenery is beautiful with flowers moving in wind,\n4 different seasons and corresponding weather like heavy rain in autumn with grey gloomy colors while summer is more vibrant and alive.\nInterface is pretty simple and easy to navigate,soundtrack fits game perfectly,there is enough game modes consisting typical sandbox where you make you own goals,mission mode where you choose your main goal you have to reach to win,or simple extinction where last one standing wins.\n\nWhat is ok:\nAI Is responsive enough and do what it should do most of times, they climb hierarchy ladder using their friends,politic power and spies againts you, kill member of rival dynasty and feel their wrath, they dont hesitate to bribe or use buff items to help their cause.Though when it comes to bodyguards they never spend a dime on their equipment leaving them with -1 dagger. And too bad they dont fear walking alone at night in forest in places where other members of  their family died...too bad for them ofcourse .(normal difficulty)\nAnimation is nothing special and serves it purpose  though i wouldnt mind if there were more immersive animations .\nCharacter creation is typical you can choose your first and last name,faith,appearance,voice,level of your starting skills and occupation.\nRPG elements are ok there is 8 skills that affect certain actions + every few levels you get perks.\nYou can level up and max your skills pretty easily which makes classes little pointless but its not big deal.\n\nDissapointing:\nFact that family members who are not in you party are idle. For exception of going to church or another town they do not level up,take council seats,buy bussines,work,have kids,or getting married you have to add them to your group and even after that if you assign member of your family a bussines and remove him from your group he looses that bussines.\nCourting is too easy and even if it says you need to take different approach for each class it doesnt really matter you can basicly do anything and it will have same effect on every class ie patron will like dancing same as rogue .\n\nWhat sucked:\nBad optimalization(better turn bloom off its ugly anyway) horrible pathfinding and from it surfacing problems like getting stuck  or fighting in group where some merc just freeze and are useless.\n\nAll in all i will recommend this game it is not perfect  and has its flaws for me flaws that didnt stop me from having alot of fun  even if sometimes ugly words were yelled...at monitor at night when i should sleep...because i had to go to work.","July 15, 2014","true","38.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Much more indepth then any of the civilization series. Sadly it is unplayable, after ~(close to)6 years.

Even after the onslaught of patchs, this game suffers horrible memory leaks, crashes and poor (no?) optimisation. Leaving  a game that you could easily lose yourself in because of its charming world and fun game play for hours, to nothing more then a forgotten bit of software from its makers. With standalone addons telling customers one thing, the games engine was so riddled with bugs that the dev team decided to throw most of its code base out the window and start over?

The concept is great, but the execution is weak. Guild 2 had the potential to be something really amazing.\n\nPros: The artwork on the towns and maps is well done despite the limitations of the graphics capabilities. The gameplay is innovative and provides a lot of varied options including building wealth by running your day to day business operations and expansion, getting involved in politics and the accompanying intrigue, sabotaging competitors, and building a family.\n\nCons: The pathing AI is horrendous. Much of your time will be eaten away hoping that your toon can find their way home or to town hall. Speaking of time killers, as you get into politics, the meetings get longer and longer. They end up easily taking up half the game play time. So, it ends up being mandatory to set up AI control of your businesses. You will probably want to anyway after the first few interactions with managing your business on your own because it quickly goes from interesting to tedious.\n\nI put in almost 4 hours and desperately wanted to love the game. Also tried the Pirate expansion in the hopes it would fix some of the issues. Eventually it became too annoying to enjoy.\n\nThis could have been something awesome with better design.

It's a lot like the sims without micromanaging of having to take a dump, showering, and whatnot. That's not to say that you don't have to micromanage though...because you do in a way.\n\nFirstly, you start out with humble beginnings, usually pretty broke, a small home to your name, and you're not but a peasant, not even considered a rightful citizen yet. You'll have to get a new title from the courthouse and then get a business going, whether it be robbing good folk of their coins or goods, curing aliments of the diseased, working metal, farming, or whatever other professions there are (only certain classes that your character(s) is/are can work certain professions). After that, you fight tooth and nail to make some coins so you get new titles, rise in politics (courthouse) and ultimately, either kill all your competition or outlive them (if that is the mode you choose in the menu, which has various setting to customize the game to your liking).\n\nOverall, I love the game. It takes a long time to get anywhere, but that's not changing anything in the configuration files to add money in the beginning. It can get a little boring after a while, but I find it addictively fun and great in small to medium burst (30 minutes - 2-ish hours). At the current price in this summer sale (9.99 for collection) I'd pick it up. You could wait to see if it hits a sale, but if it doesn't I'd pick it up on the last day of the sale. I doubt this will drop it's standard store selling price anytime in the near future and $10 is well worth the fun this collection provides.","June 22, 2014","true","41.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The RPG elements are weak, the economy is fine until you start expanding, the political part is decent put the lawsuits ruin the whole game. I got a death penalty for a murder I didn't commit. Wouldn't be that dumb if the person I "killed" wasn't the same person blaming me for the murder.

Anyway, The Guild 2 and its expansions kept me occupied for a good 11 hours or so, but I'm honestly not sure why.\n\nYou control your family and have to run a business or become a politician or be a bandit or something. It's like a medieval life simulator. The game isn't that great but there's nothing too bad about it either, it's just one of those things that chews up your time without you noticing.

It's part social/life simulator, part business simulator, RPG and strategy all mixed together to create one of the most unique games I've played. You create your family's first member, then from there, you must choose a career path. You then must go about managing your business, obtaining wealth, climbing the social ladder of your town, ensuring your bloodline continues after your inevitable death, and trying to become the most powerful family through whatever means you wish. One thing worth noting is that while I fully recommend controlling your own business 100%, if this isn't something that interests you, you can choose which aspects of your business you want the AI to manage (can be nice for those who hate micromanagement of inventory, production, employees, etc.) or have the AI manage it fully.\n\nTo expand on a few things mentioned, we'll begin with the jobs, which vary enough that certain careers can make the game play entirely differently from others. You can produce raw resources, such as wood/paper, metals, and ingredients to sell to the blacksmiths, alchemists, and priests. Or you can be the ones making armors, weapons, potions, and scrolls that sell quite well in the markets, but have the overhead cost of raw resources. Or you can be the ones using the weapons and armors to beat up opposing families who are either competing with you, or sending their cronies to attack your buildings simply because you looked at them wrong in the market yesterday. Or you can just go to the highways, and rob trading carts that are transferring valuable supplies between towns and businesses. Likewise, if you are a businessman, your own cart is subject to the risk of thievery, especially when travelling outside your city. Or you can be like me, and become a church priest, who can make documents that give social bonuses, and sell for quite a bit, in addition to being able to give sermons. With a high amount of speech, you can get a lot of money for just talking to your attendees about a magical man in the sky. Stupid blacksmith, having to buy metal and make items of value out of them, while I just prophet and profit. This is also one of the easiest ways to butt-kiss your way through the political ladder of your town.\n\nSpeaking of the political and social aspects, they are quite entertaining as well. If you're good at speaking, and have some charisma, you can try your luck at earning one of the town positions by manipulating votes and your fellow townspeople. Each town has a certain amount of positions available, each offering little perks and abilities to the holder, and the amount of positions is based on the size of the town. There is also a justice system in place, giving a legal alternative to murdering the thieves that keep robbing your carts, or that one family that keeps sending henchmen to attack your buildings. If you visually witness any crimes, you obtain evidence, which is all listed and can be viewed at any time. Evidence is rated on severity of crime, believability, and time elapsed since crime was committed.  Believability is typically dependent on how you obtain the evidence. If you saw it with your own eyes, it's 100%. If you sent your henchman to town to investigate rumors, it's typically 50% or lower. Once you have a few severe crimes, or a lot of little ones on someone, you can probably get them the death penalty. But if you accuse someone, you are the prosecutor, so make sure you show up to the trial. If you're a criminal, or the thieves guild, it's in your best interest to make sure your prosecutors are unable to arrive to the trial by whatever means necessary.\n\nOverall, this game's unique gameplay and combination of genres makes it worth a purchase. From what others have said, I'd advise looking into The Guild II: Renaissance over this particular version though. Each of the Guild II titles are stand-alone games, so you are not required to own this to play Renaissance. This game does have it's share of bugs, and I will list the ones I found below in the pros/cons:\n\nPros\nIn addition to political and business aspects, this game is an RPG. Your family members have levels, stats, and perks that they can acquire every couple of levels.\n\nVarious career paths give the game replayability. Some careers are unique in how you will play.\n\nRobust social system - each person is unique, and most are born instead of generated. The game keeps track of 100+ individual characters throughout multiple towns. Each person must marry and reproduce to continue their bloodlines, or become a footnote in the history books.\n\nThis game is truly unique. Not only is it highly enjoyable, but there is no game that really comes close to this style. Sims Medieval attempted, but failed.Cons\nBugs/Glitches - While I have read other reviews with worse issues than I've had, I encountered one problematic issue. Rarely, when my rival families would send their cronies to attack my church, they would somehow spawn in the walls of my building. Guards would stack outside my church, along with my own henchmen I sent to defend it, unable to go into the walls to reach my aggressors. I almost lost a level 3 church, which costs a lot of gold, because the attackers were invincible. Luckily for me, they disappeared somehow before fully destroying it. But because the guards and myself were unable to stop them, I had a hefty repair bill that should have never happened.\n\nAI Pathing - While this is technically a bug too, it warrants it's own bullet-point. Several times I have accused an opponent of crimes, and set a court date. When the game informed me the trial was soon, I would click the accuser, right-click the town hall picture, and send him on his way. However a few times, he didn't make it, due to wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out a path to the same town hall he's been to before. This would result in not only my opponent being found innocent by default, but me getting a fine for wasting the court's time. I have also noticed that when anyone approaches the town hall from the side that has a tavern neighboring it, everyone will walk into the tavern first, then walk out and go into the town hall. Just make sure if you have somewhere important to be, you follow your character so he doesn't get lost. It's fairly rare, but annoying. Also, my children would sometimes be unable to attend school. After I paid for their schooling, they would cancel it because they are idiots who are unable to leave the house for some reason.","November 7, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

Essentially, the game allows the player to use a bunch of maneuvres and tactics to climb the social ladder. If you like games that reward you for playing strategically, than this is for you. It's a deep and intricate game that gives you the freedom to do what you want. However, don't expect it to be easy or lightweight, it requires patience and concentration. The game however has a few bugs which will probably not be patched since the game is pretty old and a new installment will be coming out in the near future.

TG2 presents itself as CK2 minus the strategic gameplay, with more of a focus on the characters themselves. That's pretty cool, right? Being able to forge a strong dynasty, play the political game, rise to power, govern a fiefdom, all while taking care of the day-to-day activities of medieval life. Who wouldn't want to play something like that?\n\nWell, that's not what you get. For $10.99, you get a glorified city management game that plays like it was designed for mobile devices. You know all those terrible cash grabs you find in the app store? The ones where you click on some materials, click on a building, and are awarded gold and a big neon CONGRATULATIONS sign? That's essentially the gameplay you're paying for with TG2.\n\nSure, you can construct buildings, but that's essentially a matter of having enough gold and clicking on a large enough empty plot. Sure, you can get married, but the relationship system makes DA:Os look positively lifelike. Sure you can design your character, if you're happy with choosing from five beards, six hairstyles, and a couple of skin tones (rough estimates, not actual numbers).\n\nI know this review sounds harsh, and I know I'm using some pretty strong rhetoric here. However, when you listen to how 4Head describes their product ("the shining successor of the ultra successful medieval life sim...", "State-of-the-art role playing features...", "a beautifully crafted and immersive 3D world...", etc.) and read the significant number of positive reviews on the store page, the objective and experienced gamer can't help but feel a little misled.","February 2, 2015","false","2.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

Whilst its offers a big grapical upgrade over the original game, there's a sense of pointlessness about the gameplay itself.  The tutorials have you yawning and losing interest quickly.  This, I admit, is largely due to there being so many very much better games of a similar type around, and not to any inherant fault: it's an old game, and there's always a questioon mark when old games are revived for the current market.  This wasn't exactly a smash-hit trend setter in its day, so the classic-retro card can't be played.  There's nothing nostalgic about a game that merely occupies your time, doesn't entertain or amuse you.  Unless you have time to waste, I'd suggest avoiding this and joining the classic-retro game queue at a much later date, with a more accompolished title.","January 10","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What it is is a management sim and it ain't a very deep one at that. For something that's supposed to be about you living the medieval life there's not an awful lot of you livin' a life and probably a bit too much of you micro-managing your businesses and your employees. It is possible to set the AI to manage the buisnesses you build but you're very unlikely to make a sustanible profit doing that.\n\nThe political system seems interesting at first but once you've climbed to the top it doesn't feel very fulfilling, and it doesn't add anything to the game to make you want to continue playing longer.\n\nThe family system could've been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that it requires almost no effort what-so-ever. The most complicated thing you'll do is court your mate, but all that consists of is using four or five actions in the right order to increase your prospective spouse's affection, but each of these actions have a linked cool down with the rest so you have to wait a good few hours of ingame time (you can speed up the clock thankfully) before you can perform the next compliment. Children you send to school with a push of a button and there's no need to keep either parent at home to look after them either.\n\nCombat does exist in this game as does criminal actions but it's all rather pointless, you'll be far more successful running a lawful business than you ever would a criminal one and using actions like threats or murder are far too risky and made pointless by the fact that you can just bribe anyone and everyone into liking you.\n\nI find it hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game. Yes i've been critical but as a management game it's not bad and i've certainly played worse. It does carry an interesting premise, if not a particularly well implimented one. What it comes down to with me is, tho, the fact that it claims to be an RPG and a medieval life simulator and it's just not.\n\nA word of advice if you still wish to pick this game up go for the Renaissance stand-alone expansion since it has everything that both the main game and the Pirates expansion offers.","July 15, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

After which, my wealth exploded.\nBecause the mine was making much more then it was selling and wasn't controlled by one of the houses.\n\nExpanding my little empire, I ran into the rank problem which required you to buy an higher title to build more buildings. And decided to build stuff in another town.\nMeanwhile I had reached the highest political rank, with two children on the two 2nd tier positions.\nMaking it easy as pie to stay in position and also to quel my oponents.\nAnd everybody was bribing me to get any position, which was a nice income as well.\n\nBut at this point, the game lost my interest. There was little challenge left and only 'chores' that remained.\nThe scope of the game doesn't magically increase. The city and villages around it are you playground, forever.\nWhich means once you got enough buildings and such, you basically won. No endless games.\n\nYou can make the AI 'run' your buildings, which is nice and all that, but mostly poorly worked out.\n1) You cannot setup 'routes' like "Bring XX wood from woodcutter to blacksmith, then bring XX iron from mine to blacksmith"\n2) The AI buys the resources needed, not necessarily at your resource-producer\n3) You cannot set your building to sell only to -your- carts, thus you cannot set a lower price for yourself\n4) The AI ignores your "only work in current city" setting from time to time\n\nBesides that there are various annoying buys:\n1) Translations in dialogues are missing or buggy. Resulting in German speech.\n2) Carts standing next to a building (or in it) don't show up for interaction in the building\n3) Various other glitches\n\nAll these combined result in my regretting buying the game.\nIt was fun for a maximum of 9 hours, but after writing this review and deleting the game.\nI highly doubt I ever will touch the game again.","November 19, 2014","false","10.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, it crashed (hard) two thirds of the way thru the tutorials and I had to reboot my entire PC. That kind of ended it there. Interest was already waning, and I'm not willing to handle technical problems on top of design problems.\n\nFrom what I played, which wasn't much, the UI was a real turn-off - unintuitive and difficult to use. It was compounded by spending a significant amount of time just waiting (and this is in the tutorial, so I'm assuming it only gets worse). The graphics are, of course, typical of a game its age, so that doesn't help any.

My person, if you can say person, entity, whatever he was, got attacked by thugs 30 seconds into the game, and the guards got glitched or something and would follow him everywhere.\n\nHe wouldn't fully heal, and I was only seeing trickles of profit from something I bought, and the game plays in real time and I couldn't fast forward so I could move forward quicker to actually do anything in a reasonable amount of time. Further more, I managed to find a place to sleep, or lie down, and the character wouldn't heal. But the guards followed me, and it showed them all storming in and waiting at the foot of my bed for whatever reason, they were just glitched on me. The game just feels unfinished, and bad.\n\nIt's not worth $10, it's not even worth $1, I feel like I should of been paid $10 to play the game for the 10 minutes that I did, that's how aweful it is.","December 9, 2013","false","0.6"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","0"

Proceeded to have two daughters and apply for office with both husband and wife and upgrade the business once. With the city informants now under my control, I got large amounts of evidence against two rogue families, one of which stole some oak wood from me early on. I blackmailed them for huge amounts of experience with both husband and wife. And so it went on and on.\n\nNow at year 1432, or turn 9 I think (Dynasty Mode), I have 4 fully upgraded businesses. I turned my husband and second daughter, named Burbles, into powerful fighters with the best equipment. The husband just had outlaw status lifted from him after 8 years as he didn't get immunity before being accused of that which made him a "walking nightmare", so he's been running between our hut, the church and the town hall to attend elections without being swarmed by bailiffs which attack him on sight. While the husband was out of commission, Burbles continued his legacy of blackmail, theft and murder. She has already been accused, but I will be judge in the trial. Now, finally, father and daughter can commit murder together.\n\nI've completely ignored the first daughter, named Hurkle. I simply sent her to school and she came back as\nDr. Noblewoman Hurkle ♥♥♥♥-my-lord. For all that money, her stats rose from 1 to 2-3 and she goes to church all the time.\n\nHowever, doing all this may feel clunky if you just jump right into the game. I had to do the tutorial first to understand the basics, and even then some things are not (well) explained. I also read that the Renaissance expansion is better for bringing the best features and the least bugs.","July 18, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not optimized at all. The concepts behind the game are great, but little can be said about the execution.\n\nDisregarding the terrible performance issues, characters actions are very clunky and rough. It's missing many mechanics that are needed to conform to it's structure, particularly RPG elements, in that respect it feels unfinished.\n\n\nThe game is very suggestive about the type of game it wants to be, but has no content to back it up, which could leave you being frustrated with it.\n\n\nThe already implimented mechanics behave randomly and you will be getting into trouble for no apparent reason.

After going through the tutorial, you get "some" basic idea about how the game plays, but when you start the game you pretty much feel clueless on what to do or how to approch it. After fumbling around for a while you'll get your business up and struggle to maintain it. All you will be focused on will be trying to juggle getting resources, making items and selling it. On top of that, you risk your hard work being taken by robbers on the way to the market at the other town. Another thing to juggle with is finding and courting a partner, getting married and have children. If you don't do it, eventually your character will die of old age and there will be no one to carrying on your family business. At this point you haven't even started on the politics side of the game. FRUSTRATING is the only thing I got out of this game. I really want to like it and play it, but the frustration due to the complexity of the game makes me want to uninstall this game and not waste my time with it.

Proceeded to have two daughters and apply for office with both husband and wife and upgrade the business once. With the city informants now under my control, I got large amounts of evidence against two rogue families, one of which stole some oak wood from me early on. I blackmailed them for huge amounts of experience with both husband and wife. And so it went on and on.\n\nNow at year 1432, or turn 9 I think (Dynasty Mode), I have 4 fully upgraded businesses. I turned my husband and second daughter, named Burbles, into powerful fighters with the best equipment. The husband just had outlaw status lifted from him after 8 years as he didn't get immunity before being accused of that which made him a "walking nightmare", so he's been running between our hut, the church and the town hall to attend elections without being swarmed by bailiffs which attack him on sight. While the husband was out of commission, Burbles continued his legacy of blackmail, theft and murder. She has already been accused, but I will be judge in the trial. Now, finally, father and daughter can commit murder together.\n\nI've completely ignored the first daughter, named Hurkle. I simply sent her to school and she came back as\nDr. Noblewoman Hurkle ♥♥♥♥-my-lord. For all that money, her stats rose from 1 to 2-3 and she goes to church all the time.\n\nHowever, doing all this may feel clunky if you just jump right into the game. I had to do the tutorial first to understand the basics, and even then some things are not (well) explained. I also read that the Renaissance expansion is better for bringing the best features and the least bugs.","July 18, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
