I got it on sale on a whim not know much about it. I saw from the screenshots the basic gameplay. I've put 25 hours into the game and while that might not seem like much given the gameplay and how much one "level" lasts it is a long time. I've beaten it on easy, normal, hard and I'm now working on very hard. It is one of those types of games you can easily be playing forever.","February 28, 2012","true","25.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

If you like Luxor Evolved, you will like this.  I have to admit that I got this through Groupee and that I prefer the Bejeweled style for recurring puzzle game.  I have played Luxor games and they are alright.  BUT, I love Luxor Evolved.  It is totally cool.  Its retro vector style graphics with modern powerups and music is awesome!  I have put so many hours into playing that.  I love it!\n\nSo, the simple part is this:  If you love Luxor Evolved then you will love this.  It has all of the same powerups, awesome graphics and effects, great presentation, new puzzle levels  It also has a store where you can upgrade your powerups, get new ball styles and so on.  This all set in the Egyptian style, of course.\n\nNote: The store uses coins you earn in the game.  It does NOT use real money.\n\nI realise that I have it backwards and that Luxor Evolved cam after, but I played it first.  That's why the comparison.  I was really suprised to find out Luxor 3 came out in 2007!\n","March 22, 2014","true","10.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The graphics are slightly better and it's still a lot of fun to kill some time.\n\nIs it worth it to buy this casual game for 10 bucks (normal price) ? Hell No! But I will still recommend this game IF being sold for a much lower price.","February 8, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Lots of power ups that will help you gain more points and move onto more fast and exciting levels.","December 18, 2010","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you have an xbox you can pick up a copy of this game for literally pennies do not bother with if you have the affor mentioned os. There is also no plans to fix the problem either. save your hard earned money and get something else.","June 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

So that the line of balls don't reach your base. This just isn't as addicted as similar games like Tetris, Bejeweled, Dr Mario or Puzzle League. If you are a puzzle game addict this and need a different game the Luxor games are good, but if you occasionally play puzzle games like that just play one of the great ones.","May 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"
