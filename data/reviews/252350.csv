As a monumental testament to why you fell in love with computer games in the first place, it epitomizes gaming as a whole.\n\nAnd like that unattainable and often-dreamed-about Time Machine which we all want so badly, it irrevocably and fondly reminds you of the best part of your life (before you had to handle unreasonable bills, incomprehensible taxes, dishonest politicians, heavy mortgages, sour spouses, moronic bosses, and r£t4rd3d neighbors, all doing their best to dull your senses, beat you into submission, rip your heart out with a wooden spoon, spit on your dreams, and generally make you suffer as much as possible) - as a kid playing games in the arcade, without a sorrow or a care in the world.\n\nI'm here to say to you: It's gonna be okay, everything will be alright.\n\nBecause Double Dragon Neon is here to save you from it all. You might not believe me now, but you have to trust me, you just have to take that leap of faith, for this gem is everything - it's the best Time Machine, the greatest Pillow Fort and the sturdiest Tree House of gaming, all rolled into one.

It was one of the first arcade beat-em-ups and arguably one of the best of its time. Now WayForward has finally brought their reimagining of the franchise to PC after a console release in late 2012.\n\nPros:\n-----\n- Neon introduces a few new concepts to the genre such as Gleam, which doubles your attack power for a short time after successfully dodging an attack and an upgrade system for magic attacks and passive bonuses in the form of mixtapes. The more of a mixtape you have, the more powerful that attack or bonus is. Enemies drop them, but you can also buy them from shops. Tapesmiths allow you to pick up more tapes in exchange for mythril, which you get from defeating bosses.\n- (Note: I played with an XBox 360 controller) While there are more button commands to get used to than the original, the controls feel very solid. Nothing seems janky or off. I suggest a quick glance at the Help screen to see all your available standard moves.\n- There is a good variety of enemies, some requiring a specific way to finish them off quicker than just mashing your punch button. Abobos are freakin' huge now!\n- Effects and voice acting are passable, but what really stands out is the soundtrack. Virt has done an amazing job making original songs for the game that have that definite 80's vibe and the remixing of the original game's tracks are very well done.\n- ONLINE CO-OP. It took the PC port of this game to get what console owners were promised over a year ago and never received, online co-op. Beat-em-ups are always 10x more fun with a friend, and with team powerups like sharing health that you can activate almost anytime by high-fiving your partner, it makes traversing the game easier as well.\n- Unlike the dark, gritty visuals of the original, this game goes for a brighter, cartoony aesthetic. This game knows its audience and opted for a campy, offbeat feel, almost making fun of the era it wants to copy, and it mostly works.\n\nCons:\n-----\n- All these attacks at my command and NO BACK ELBOW? Anyone who played the original Double Dragon knows that move is your bread and butter for making progress in the game.\n- Graphics are alright and the game has a cartoony vibe, but nothing really stands out. Also, apart from resolutions and windowed/full screen mode, there's no graphical tweaking. I'm not saying a game like this really needs those options, but when you see them in nearly every PC game, it's noticeable when they're missing.\n\nI feel this is one of WayForwards best games to date. Much like with DuckTales Remastered, they have honoured the source material while adding a modern flair. Join up with a friend and go save Marion!","February 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 140 of 162 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","140","162","0","1"

The golden era of pop culture. It brought us many wonderful things such as the NES, Ray-Bans, Transformers, and bigass hair. It also brought us an arcade classic, a 2-player beat-em-up known as Double Dragon. It got everything right, from smashing gameplay to perfectly executed co-op mayhem. And now WayForward has stepped out of the DeLorean to hand us their throwback to the past: Double Dragon Neon. This magnificent tour-de-force blows the 80's head off with a rocket launcher, builds a cyborg out of it's corpse, and then puts said cyborg on a surfboard to the future to kick modern gaming convention in the cojones. All while listening to hair metal on a boombox. It has been a long time since I have seen a game that has this level of insanity taking itself with a gospel level of seriousness.\n\nAnd what would Double Dragon be without the twin heroes, Billy and Jimmy Lee? WayForward has brought the original dudebros to life with amazingly detailed cel-shaded models. All the classic enemies are here, from the lowly street thug cannon fodder, leather-clad whip-cracking bondage babes, and the infamous Abobo. Add to that the main villian, Skullmageddon, who could easily be described as a skeletal version of The Shredder from TMNT. That is if The Shredder was batsh*t insane and on LSD. This guy is pure evil though, and he makes no bones about trying to pun you to death. On the music front, Jake Kaufman (AKA Virt) has brought the sound of the 80's back to life with a massively awesome mixture of vocal pop and hard rockin hits. The complete soundtrack is downloadable at his Bandcamp page for the low low price of NADA, so check it out!\n\nThe gameplay in Double Dragon Neon is largely unchanged from the original game, however there are a few new addons that change things up considerably. As you make your way through the game, defeated enemies will drop mixtapes. These audio treats come in two flavors, upgrade tapes that add to your stats, and Sōsetsuken tapes that add to your special attacks. Be sure to grab as many as you can, because you can stack each tape to further upgrade your stats and moves! The special attacks are quite varied, ranging from a classic cyclone kick to a hadouken-inspired fireball. Be sure to listen to each mixtape as well, the lyrics are quite funny.\n\nI started out playing Double Dragon Neon expecting to play a decent remake of a beloved game. And what I got was an experience that far exceeded my expectations as WayForward has ripped the 80's a new one, and yanked this glorious beast out of the void. I honestly cannot find a single thing to complain about with this game. So if you are pining for the days of big music, bad puns, and beating the ever-loving crap out of big dudes named Abobo, Double Dragon Neon will NOT disappoint. And it's only gonna take up $10 of your hairspray budget!","February 6, 2014","true","0.3"," 197 of 262 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","197","262","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/252350/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Double Dragon: Neon is a beat 'em up game which was released in 2012. It was released on PS3 and xBox360 before eventually coming to the PC in early 2014.\n\nAs with previous games in the Double Dragon series, you take control of a martial artist Billy if you are playing single player, whilst if you play two player, Jimmy Lee is also introduced. You are fighting to rescue a damsel in distress, Marian, from the Shadow Warrior gang. You start the game on the streets, and you progress to different locations which has a pretty wide variety, ranging from out of space, to grave yards.\n\nAll of the classic beat'em up controls are here; punch, kick and dodge mechanics all to be found. Sadly there isn't any sort of combos which I thought was a slight let down, but you do get the addition of being able to pick up different music tracks which gives you special bonus' and perks which can add some interesting ideas into the mix. Whilst you progress through the game; you'll also find multiple copies of the same music tracks which will then act as an increase to it instead meaning you will end up swapping to different tracks quite easily depending on the situation at hand.  The gameplay is at times slow paced, the characters normal movement speed is slow, and the "run" function feels very clunky to use as it can take a second for your character run because of the animation.\n\nGraphically Double Dragon Neon looks OK. Whilst it is nothing special, it does work well. All of the fighting animations are nicely done, as well as some of the special abilities, and the backgrounds to each zone are very well presented as well.\n\nThere is pretty much hardly any story elements to this game; the only real bit of story you get is at the start of the game and the end, everything else in between is sort of filler and has no real relevance to the plot,  which I thought was a little bit of a shame.\n\nThis is another game which has a heavy focus on the sound track, each of the music tracks you pickup throughout the game will change the music being played, since the game is set in the 1980s era, you should expect that kind of music to be played. I have to say, the credits features probably one of the funniest songs I have heard; finishing the game is worth it just for that track alone.\n\nDouble Dragon Neon can be hard, I died a lot in this game until I reached a point where I had found the perfect combination of tracks to use in order to make me be pretty much a walking killing machine, I was able to one shot most enemies and it became a walk in the park, up until that point though, there is a pretty high challenge on offer. I would say until level 7 or 8, you will die quite a bit, and maybe later in the game if you choose different tracks.\n\nA full playthrough of Double Dragon Neon will take you roughly around three hours give or take a little. For what you are paying for here, I am happy with that amount of time, as what it does do, it does it very well. You unlock harder difficulties as you finish the main game once, so that can add some replay ability, as well as the feature of local co-op which is also immensely enjoyable.\n\nI didn't have any technical issues whilst playing; a controller is highly recommended and works very well, fully supported. You'll find the game running at 60fps which is always nice to see on a console port too.\n\nI can recommend Double Dragon: Neon; it's one of the better fighting/beat'em up games out there on PC, and for the price of £6,99, you can't really go wrong. The game has been known to go as low as around £1 on external sites, so keep your eye out for a mega bargain!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nYou can find a YouTube play list for my playthrough Double Dragon Neon here: (which videos will be added daily)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPiYxRIDCDgbpGHr5ETG7MMDkJttG6RtX\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I will try and address them and give my opinion as to why this is probably one of the top three Double Dragon games.\n\n**Graphics:\nSolid art design, although some of the enemies are a bit more cartoony than previous DD designs, the colors, backgrounds, animations and effects are pretty solid. The game mixes 3D models with the occasional 2D background object, The alley level is particularly nice. Varied environments and enemies with vibrant colors.\n\n**Sound:\nGreat remixes of classic double dragon tunes and some new additions. Music and sounds are near flawless in this game. Some may loathe the voice acting, but for the tone they're going for, it's appropriate.\n\n**Controls:\nThe game controls solidly for me. A lot of "Double Dragon veteran" players have criticized how slow and heavy the Lee brothers move, but I think they haven't played DD for a while. DD was always a slower, more methodical game than other beat 'em ups. Neon is actually a little bit faster (go check youtube, watch Super Double Dragon, or DD II). The dodge button is responsive, although you're vulnerable if you execute some moves. The dash is not instant unlike DD Advance and DD3, and that can be a cause for some headaches.\n\n**Gameplay:\nThe game has a lot of moves, and some combos . Clever players can find ways to juggle opponents multiple times and incorporate grabs and special moves while doing so. The Lee brothers have mixtapes that grant abilities and special moves like fireballs, hurricane kicks, etc. You can't steamroll through waves of enemies thoughtlessly though, as enemies have some moves with "armor", not many, but it does require some recognition on the player. Players who dodge attacks correctly get a temporary buff. It's a nice addition, though not as satisfying as Super Double Dragon's parry and grab mechanics from blocking.\n\n**Verdict:\nFor Insider: 8/10\nI've played every iteration of Double Dragon, even the three fighting games (if you count Rage). I knew exactly what to expect from this game. I give it an 8/10. I've beaten it in normal and Dragon difficulty, working on replaying it again to do so in Double Dragon difficulty (which is quite hard).  Highly recommend it.\n\nFor Casual: 6/10\nDon't even listen or Read IGN's super ignorant review of this game. It's a solid game if you like slower methodical beat' em ups. My wife is an RPG, Strategy game gamer and was able to beat this game a few times with me. She enjoyed the humor and although she doesn't always play beat 'em ups, she really enjoyed this one.  6/10\n\nFor newer fans to the genre: 3/10 to 5/10\nThese fans will probably hate this game the most. If you're used to the speed of Castle Crashers and want to blow through enemies with fast attacks and screen clearing moves this game is not like that. Watch some of the youtube videos for this game, but approach with caution.\n\n** Extras Info\nGame's tone is different from prior DD games, at first I was frustrated by this as I wanted a serious DD game, but the game did get more than a few laughs out of me. There are plenty of easter eggs and references to 80s-90s games and culture.","September 26, 2014","true","17.4"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","50","57","0","0"

This isn't really like the arcade games, it's more of an action-rpg with beatemup elements. Yeah I know, it's confusing isn't it? Just hear(read) me out.  Technos Japan, the original developer of Double Dragon, also created the Kunio-Kun franchise. Remember NES classics like Super Dodgeball and River City Ransom? That's Kunio-Kun. Neon is a combination of RCR and DD. You collect or purchase and upgrade mix-tapes to improve your stats as well as use special abilities. This game is made up of 10 missions, all of them linear, with a structure that mostly adheres to the arcade games.\n\nNow if you just want a straight-up Double Dragon beatemup without all of that RPG nonsense, I'd suggest Double Dragon Advance (GBA). It is in my opinion the best entry in the classic series. In any case, we're strictly talking about Neon for the rest of this review.\n\nSome days it just doesn't pay to hang out in front of your boyfriend's garage, as Marian gets kidnapped AGAIN. This time around the villain is a lovely chap by the name of Skullmageddon. A silly name deserves a silly character, and he's all that and more. This is the goofiest and most 80s entry in the series. Along with a ton of familiar names (with not so familiar faces), there are a handful of new enemies and bosses to contend with. Aesthetically this game is very well-done, with a truly excellent soundtrack that elevates it to another level.\n\nSince these days it apparently isn't enough to make a game about beating hundreds of people up, Neon features RPG elements. Trying to ignore them in search of a "legitimate" challenge will just frustrate and anger you. There are 20 mix-tapes, 10 are special moves, 10 function as stat-boosting equipment. You can switch mix-tapes at any moment in the game. It's strategic in a sense. You can switch to a magic-boosting tape and fling a few fireballs, then switch to your absorb tape to replenish some health. You can even micro-manage like you're playing a JRPG with an ATB (active-time-beatemup) system.\n\nThe actual fighting is comparable to the previous games, although slightly stiffer. Some moves have been changed around or removed, but classics such as the flying knee and spin-kick are always handy. The most important move is the duck. When you duck an enemy's attack at the right moment, you get the glow and do 4x damage for a few seconds. Also while ducking you can do an evasive roll. This is an extremely useful move to master. Overall the fighting is standard, but it's enjoyable. It could be more satisfying I suppose, but juggling an enemy never gets old.\n\nAs you'd expect from a Double Dragon game, Billy and Jimmy can team up some brotastic bro-op fun. Just don't expect much if you attempt to play online. I've tried hosting a few times and the results were pitiful. Players would jump on, play for a minute or two, and then just leave. I'm not sure what the deal is here. I've read that the online doesn't function properly, or it has issues with certain machines, or it only works when it's raining in Georgia. Whatever the case, it's a darn shame that more people can't enjoy this game online, it's way more fun with a friend. There's always local-play at least.\n\nThere are other issues with the PC port, such as memory leakage, crashes, and so on. I didn't really experience anything firsthand, so I guess I lucked out. While there was a patch early last year, it apparently didn't go far enough in fixing the game. Abstraction Games, the team responsible for the Neon port, had ONE TESTER working on it.\n\nWhat the Butt?\nONE TESTER!\n\nI couldn't believe it. Let's figure this out.\nWhile the PC can be considered an easy platform to develop for, you have to account for a multitude of variables. How do you expect to make a game that's compatible with every PC, when it was only tested with one?\n\nAnother problem with having ONE TESTER is that Double Dragon is an online co-operative game. You can't possibly expect ONE person to test a TWO player game...can you?\n\nAt the very least a beta-test should have been done. It's not like volunteers are that hard to come by. Hell, it seems like these days we're all beta-testers (especially whenever a new Assassin's Creed is released). It'd be nice to beta-test a game for free instead of paying for it. Wow...ONE TESTER...I just can't get over that.\n\nAll in all Double Dragon Neon is a good game. Its quasi-beatemup/RPG elements give it it a rather unique spin, and I can't recommend the soundtrack enough. Just do some research, hold your breath, and hope for the best if you plan on getting this port. It just might crash and burn on you.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne tester...SMH","January 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","41","49","7","2"

On one hand the gameplay itself is varied, and offers more ways to defeat enemies than have ever been possible in the franchise (Super Double Dragon or Battletoads/Double Dragon Ultimate Team). Wayforward defintely has its heart in the right place. On the other hand, the game is frustrating to play for all the wrong reasons and will probably turn away potential players.\n\nFor what it gets right, Double Dragon Neon is a very stylish nod to the 1980's and all the cheesiness bravado that was found in arcade video games during this era. DD Neon employs an experience system and offers shops to spend money/ore you collect in levels, much like the Game Boy Advance version of TMNT via UbiSoft. The PC version offers various resolutions, and offers very smooth 60 fps beautiful cell shaded animation and graphics. The soundtrack here is probably the best original score for its release back in 2012, and offers throwbacks to the 80's with very catchy lyrics accompanied by synthesizers and drum machine beats. The game also is very leniant with how combos work, allowing for mid-air catches and throws while allowing for moves that involve running or crouching. Overall, the combat (and screen clearing attacks) are more reminscent to Streets of Rage than classic Double Dragon (or its many sequels or spinoffs).\n\nFor what the game gets wrong is heartbreaking. Billy and Jimmy Lee are incredibly sluggish when controlling around, and its made more frustrating when you have to dodge telegraphed boss attacks that can (and will) juggle you in the air or in the corner; effectively draining your health and losing a precious life (lose all your lives and restart the entire mission over). There are sections in the end where its uncommon to fall off cliffs because you weren't fast enough to dodge a whirlwind attack and lose precious health (losing lives would have been much worse).\n\nThe coop aspect makes more sense when playing local coop, because the coop here is very weak especially in this "definitive edition" PC port. Stealing lives, sharing diet coke health pickups, and allowing the other player to collect 1-ups is essential for this very hard game (even when using the 'training wheels' tape)....so its too bad none of this can be done effectively in the PC port. The PC version supports no text or voice chat whatsoever, so playing with a random person in Steam matchmaking is hit or miss.\n\nWhen joining as a client, it's no help that the game still has issues with latency (overall performance on the zombie forest stage is horrible even in single player)...online play is functional....but reduces frame rates to about 25ish with all the stuttering and teleporting (online code as of 7/2/14).\n\nAbstration Games have pretty much done little work to get this port to the PC, as evident in the very confusing key assigning in the options (good luck seeing that its Tab key to even get in there with keyboard controls) or the obtuse indicator for reviving your coop buddy via rewinding his tape (good luck seeing that its done with your throw key). Save yourself the frustration and don't bother playing this game with a keyboard, because the devs clearly just pushed this out the door with an Xbox controller in mind.\n\nOverall, this game just barely wins a recommendation from me clearly on the presentation and solid combat while playing single player or local coop. Game offers a lot of little fun things to do with a coop partner (one player beatboxes and the other breakdances), and its clearly meant as a local coop game. The problems from the console release are here for the most part, and I can't really recommend this version of the game if you want to play online (while your online partner is very far away or has a subpar internet connection). If anything, pick this game up when it goes on Steam sale.","July 2, 2014","true","14.0"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

There were at least two sequels I know of, which were also a blast to play. I think this game stays true enough to the game series that it could be seen as a sequel as much as a remake. It is fun to play on your own, online or with local co-op. There are upgrades to buy that allow you customise your play style to a certain extent. One play through will take 3 hours approx. Hpowever, there is enough content and achievements to make you spend more hours on it.

It may feel out place for a lot of old-school fans but it's a welcome addition.\nGenzo's style fits perfectly in the game and his new designs really work as a modern look for old characters.\n\nThe music is perfect, from remixes of the original themes to 80's covers, and they're vocal.\n\nAs for the plot, you already know it. Marian hanging out, bad dudes arrive and kidnap her.\nBUT, here's where you either LOVE the game or HATE it completely.\nDDN never takes itself seriously and you'll notice it. It has humour out of place considering the source material and even it has its Gurren Lagann moments, but hell, personally I LOVED them, they fitted with Genzo style and never broke the flow of the game, in fact, it made it even better. I won't spoil all the surprises this game has to offer, so just be prepared for some really crazy stuff.\n\nThis game IT HAS TO BE PLAYED COOP for the full experience. Grab your nearest bro and prepare to have a great time, because Double Dragon Neon DELIVERS, and delivers FUN.\n\nRemember back then when you played games for FUN? I know I do.\nWayFoward, you never dissapoint.","July 1, 2014","true","9.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

DD: Neon feels like a total reboot of the entire Double Dragon series, starting things over from scratch + then also taking it completely into its own direction. Paying homage to 1980's & 1990's culture in video games, movies, music, and so forth - DD:N succeeds in being an outlandish, ridiculous, funny, fun & often challenging brawler in the DD universe that especially fans of that era of brawlers should take on.\n\nTo begin with the basic DD premise, here's the story: Marion gets kidnapped by someone, so the Lee Brothers, Billy & Jimmy, head off & adventure out to find who took her, kick butt & go rescue her. That is just the start of things, as the game that feels grounded as it begins and then eventually adventures into outlandish + ridiculous over-the-top territory, not feeling like many of the older Double Dragon games. Neon is constantly tossing out 80's + 90's references and paying homage to the classic games, movies, music & things from that culture + era. This game is definitely not to be taken seriously - and thankfully, it fits b/c the game's just often really fun to actually play.\n\nBut, oh - can it also be challenging + frustrating, too. Multiple run-throughs of a level b/c of no auto-save placed in an entire level can be annoying + frustrating, feeling like a trip back to the 80's + 90's of difficult games from the Nintendo era. The game will save itself once you finish a level, though. So, you won't have to always restart from Level 1, if you need to leave the game + shut it off for a bit. And this all here was on its Normal difficulty (which is what you start with; you have to finish the game to unlock the others)!\n\nGameplay feels like your typical side-scrolling 2D-style brawler, for the most part. Of course, the game isn't without its own twists - by basically combining many classics brawlers + throwing some RPG upgrading-elements on top. If you've played classic fighters such as Streets of Rage series, Final Fight (some moves are just plain unrealistic + combat is faster than old Double Dragon) and especially Double Dragon (since it's still a bit methodical with its combat) - you basically know what you're getting into. Combat here just feels great with the X360 gamepad. While Neon is mostly a linear affair, like River City Ransom (NES), you may run into shops in-game where you can purchase upgrades for your skills + abilities. Constantly, you are defeating enemies + picking up power-ups for your skills (which are mixtapes + even have their own songs in the Inventory menu!).\n\nIf this all sounds good to you with gameplay + combat - well, you're in for a treat. Combat here is a lot of fun + a joy here to take part in, for the most part. Playing with the X360 controller, the controls felt very smooth + the game also ran very well, normally ranging from 55-60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB VRAM of GF GTX 560 Ti; 16 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) when set in a 1920x1080 resolution (1080p). The game sports a very nice artistic direction that just oozes cool for its 2D environments, while its 3D character models look also good. Don't expect a technical masterpiece here, this isn't Crysis - this game's all about its sweet art direction.\n\nThe music absolutely stands out here + sounds great, having that 80's & 90's vibe. Whether it's an actual song they made + performed with lyrics, or a piece that sounds like it could've been in an 80's movie, or a complete remix of a classic tune from Double Dragon games - the music always fits the bill and sounds great. No doubt about it, the soundtrack here is just always fantastic.\n\nThe game is not long, by any means per playthrough. For my first run-through, playing solo, it took around 4-5 hours approximately. There are Leaderboards, so you can compare your run-throughs & compete with other players online & even your Friends. Also, you can go through the Co-Op locally or on the Internet via Steam, so you can play with your Friends. Also, once unlocked - there are multiple difficulties, so if you want more of a Challenge and want to compete on the Leaderboards, it's certainly there. This all certainly could help the replay value, if you actually like the game & want to give it multiple run-throughs.\n\nWhen it all comes down to it: DD:N is just a lot of fun, for the most part. It plays lots of homage to 80's + 90's culture, runs well, plays well, looks cool artistically, has a fantastic soundtrack & delivers a really solid experience. While auto-saves locations are placed after each level, some might like this challenge & feel that is reminiscant of games from an older era (Nintendo era). DD: Neon is quite good. Neon is often funny, outlandish, ridiculous, over-the-top & a flat-out fun brawler that gamers, especially fans of this genre (of brawlers), just should not miss.\n\nFinal Grade = B-.","March 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","2"

This is the best Double Dragon I've ever played, and I've played them all, including the arcade originals. If you've played the console version of Neon, it's the same game here, with one big exception: As of this review, the console version of DDN does not have online co-op, while the PC version does. That's a big seller for me. Also, it seems to me the PC version of Double Dragon Neon has more responsive controls. Play this with a gamepad or prepare to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you often.\n\nIf you haven't played DDN, or any DD game in general, it's your standard 2D beat 'em up. You can collect cassette tapes to gain new abilities and fighting styles and upgrade them. DDN is quite challenging, but not unfairly so. Learn to dodge or get ready to get whooped.

The combat in this game is the best I've ever played in a side-scroller beat'em up. It almost feels like playing a side-scroller Street Fighter game with RPG-esque elements thrown in with shops found throughout the levels. Dodging and countering are very meaningful and give a real sense of achievement when you can successfully fight your way through a crowd taking very little damage or using the environment to your advantage. In addition to your own ability to combo through a crowd, you are also equiped with different "songs" that equate to abilities/magics, one being a passive buff and the other a special attack. I liked the brawler feel so I went with an absorb health/spin kick combo, it works really well to keep your health up and bulldoze waves of enemies. I really enjoyed the humor of this game, it really hit me in the right spot.  The original version of double dragons was among the first games I ever got my hands on and played heck trying to get to work in our overused Nintendo.

However, that doesn't mean that Double Dragon Neon is not worth mentioning. The game is very fun, either played solo or with a friend, while the difficulty level is relatively high and requires some skill, instead of plain button-mashing, something that partly offsets the game's short duration. Overall though, if you are looking for a good beat' em up, Double Dragon Neon will not disappoint you and if you are among 80's pop aesthetics lovers, you will have one more reason to love it"\n\nFull review (in greek): http://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/double-dragon-neon-pc-review\n\n","February 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

First level is basically a recreation of the first level in the original Double Dragon.  The original theme music has been remastered, even adding a guitar solo in it.  You can customize your moves & even upgrade them if you find tapes to do it & mythril to upgrade those moves.  The graphics are EXCELLENT in comparison to the old 8-bit graphics you used to have on old console systems, even better than the 16-bit graphics on SNES; they are cell-shaded however, which I was never a fan of, but I think they did well with them in this game.  This is not the same game that you would have played during your childhood however, there is plenty of suggestive content that you may not what your children playing this game.\n\nThe game has been turned into a bit of a spoof if you consider the original developers had this game as a no nonsense beatdown:\n- The main enemy in the game happens to be a bit of a ripoff of Skeletor from He-Man with a high-pitched voice you get from a lot of Japanese lowlifes wearing facepaint.  He's no pushover, but the comments that he's making throughout the game just has me shaking my head.\n- Another thing that seems to be odd is that special moves appear to be granted through cassette tapes which are dropped from enemies as you defeat them or by buying them;  I can't argue with the fact that this allows you to customize your fighting experience, but the fact that these are granted through songs just seems a little ridiculous to me.\n- The mythril concept is another concept taken from other games that just doesn't seem right in this type of game, but it does give a means of upgrade...\n- The game does seem a bit slow compared to what I remember in older games.  Seems they turned down the speed on the game to make the animations more realistic & fluent.\n\nThere are a few things that just puts me off on the game & I can't really say I expect they'll be fixed:\n- Just another game that does not except game input from any gamepad other than XBOX controllers.  And this game is not easy to play using the keyboard, so the lack of proper gamepad support puts a HUGE dent in the playability of the game.\n- The game has some SERIOUS performance issues after you've played a few levels, the lag actually gets to the point that it reminds me of some flash games where they were not optimized for the Flash Player or have too many elements on the screen at the same time.  I am hoping this will be fixed in the future, because this is one thing that is going to get people to stop playing the game pretty quickly.","March 4, 2014","true","26.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","6"

Playing co-op is a absolute blast. It has a great 80's themed soundtrack and great sound effects, the graphics are awesome, the story is who cares just mash buttons to bash faces in, and the controls are pretty solid. They are very sluggish though so you have to get used to them. Also you are going to want a controller to play because playing a game like this with keyboard is just dumb. The special moves are pretty sweet and the game has good humor besides the awkwardly misplaced air guitaring. It is a really tough game solo but co-op makes it easier. You can even juggle bad guys between you like the bad guys could do to you in the original games. And the same rule applies here: never get between enemies or you will get hammered. It has a all-around good challenge and all fits together nicely for a solid experience.\n\nIts only downside are the super sluggish controls but they are fine when you play some and get used to it. Even if you have never played a Double Dragon game before you should play this if you like beat em up games. If you don't you are hopeless.

This game both looks and sounds awesome. The soundtrack is a joy to listen to and the visuals are very pleasing to the eye. However I can't recommend this game because of what it does wrong. The gameplay is difficult in the worst way possible, the totally unfair way. Whether it is unstoppable attacks or not landing a hit because you were just a smidge off on the vertical, this game is massively unfair. Now I've played frustratingly hard games before, but the ones I actually wound up enjoying were the ones that I felt gave me a fair shake in the game, and that when I messed up, it was 100% my fault. This game does not do that for me, and it does help that the controls are a mess. Everything controls slowly. You walk slow, you move vertically slow, and even the sprint is slow with it's half second to a second delay before you actually start running. Plus the duck isn't all that effective, and using it feels more like a roll of the dice to see if you get hit or not.\n\nTo me the biggest problem with this game is that it seems that the devs put more focus on the art and music than on the actual gameplay, and that they were looking to make a great looking game instead of a great playing game, which hurts it in my book. Part of me also feels that the devs thought that they could just make the game really good and not worry to much about the gameplay because people are going to like it anyways because it's a Double Dragon game. Because of this, I can't recommend this game.","March 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

At first I thought it was going to suck, being just some dumb cash-in on 80's retro.\n\nI ended up loving this game.\n\nThe first time I played it was with a friend and we co-opped it in a single sitting. Playing it again, solo, I still had a blast.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know what Double Dragon is, DD was one of the pre-eminent beat 'em ups back in the day. Many series tried to emulate the simplicity of punching, kicking, kneeing, throwing, and spin kicking mobs of bad guys into bloody submission. Few achieved their goal.\n\nAnd that's really all DD is about: beating the tar out of a colorful cast of villains. The plot is paper thin, and that's okay, we're not really here for the story. DD Neon updated the tried and true formula DD 1 and 2 perfected by adding a ton of special moves and character builds to the mix. That might sound pretty not Double Dragon, but it actually adds a nice bit of depth to simple gameplay. Want to excel at offense? Defense? Physical attacks or special moves? Want to throw a fireball? Some lighting? How about a head crushing knee drop? The options are varied and allow the game to cater to many different play styles.\n\nThe graphics are bright, colorful, and varied. The music is insanely good, offering plenty of original tunes as well as some sick remixes of classic songs. And the controls are good. A little slow, but it gives the game a nice pace.\n\nA game like this is why Wayforward is one of my favorite developers. A Boy and His Blob, Ducktales, and Double Dragon: they take classic games and create playable love letters to them.\n\nIf you love DD, play this. If you haven't played DD before, but enjoy good arcade style action games, play this.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

If I went totally by my first impressions, it would have been to dismiss the game as a well-presented but mechanically clunky beat 'em up. After giving the game some time and learning the mechanics, I found the gameplay both complex and rewarding.\n\nConsidering the genre, there is a lot of variety in each mission and the progression system allows different styles of play. There are also plenty of enemies with diverse styles of attack. The pacing is excellent both in terms of level design and the way difficulty scales.\n\nWhat makes Double Dragon Neon truly stand out is the comically colourful art design and one truly brilliant soundtrack. This along with the rarity of new games in the genre makes this a definite recommendation.\n\nThis is one of the best and most original beat 'em ups since the 16-bit era.","July 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And needs much love for fans who love Double Dragon, beat'em ups, and nostalgia trips of the 70s and 80s.\n\nThe Good: The game has a vintage feel of controls like a blast from the past. The music in this game features remixes of classic theme music from past Double Dragon games, and some new original music thrown in as well that is up beat and awesone to beat down. Making you wish there was a sound track seperate to the game. Graphics is smooth and the art style and theme of the game with "Neon" fits perfect of 80s throwback. The game now features some RPG elements, such as power tapes that can increase your stats and powers as the levels start to get slowly harder with tougher enemies. There are a veriety of weapons for you to pick up and use. The bosses have predictable partens in this game, but provide challange. Most of the game has a lot of pop culture references of the 70s, 80s, and even 90s. Unlike the console ports, the PC version offers what all Double Dragon fans wanted in the game, which is online bro-op, co-op. So there is a lot of replayability with this game featuring co-op online or off.\n\nThe Bad: The controls can feel a little awkward to handle at first. And can take time to get used to. There isn't really a lot of attack veriety in the game such as different combos or different attacks that can be performed to add in depth of gameplay. The game feels short and can be done in about less than 2 hours. The game also has a few difficulty spikes in some parts. So going back to previous levels to grind is an option if you can't progress the next level.\n\nAbove all, this is a game that deserves recognition. It's been a long wait for those who are Double Dragon fans and beat'em up fans alike and feels like a breath of fresh air. As it's the classic story, the evil syndicate steals your girl, you go out to kick their head in with your one true weapon that is your fists, and save the girl. And the evil leader who is behind all of this is...a Skellator wanna be. Who cares if it sounds out of place? This is Double Dragon, and I hope to see more of the brawler/beat'em up style gameplay continue for future games to get better and better.\n\nX3","May 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not. The over the top 80s aura is what makes this a nice game. From Genzoman's colorful artwork to the 80s glam-synth-pop music it's a festival to what 80s was. Dude! even the dialogs is like a mid-budget movie: so bad it's laughably good.\n\nI've read some bad reviews about the controls, and I have not had any of such problems. Even found one that was complaining on the half-second dodge move (a duck) and then saying, and I'm paraphrasing, this game is about speed and fluent fighting. I have no problem ducking almost all of the hits and returning a Gleamfull o' fists. Controls are just to be used to in a couple minutes of gameplay.\n\nAlso read some whole lot of reviews puitting it on the ground for having no online co-op. I can only tell "you do not have real friends?". I do not remember playing any DD title without a friend shoulder to shoulder with some "I needed that life, bro!" discussions from time to time.\n\nOnly complaint is a bug on the game that music and SFX went gone completely and when leaving the game PC gets blocked and have to reset manualy.\n\nFor me it's a GREAT game. and with a bro! even more fun.","March 5, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It actually feels and plays a bit more like Double Dragon 2 than 1 - faster combat and more responsive than the original. I'd say about a third of the jokes hit and the rest are cringeworthy. Combat is fun enough and the game is short but there are 2 big problems:\n\n1. The game stutters like crazy. I tried various troubleshooting, but to no avail. My system is powerful enough to play pretty  much everything on high settings, but this game stutters. Seems like a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port.\n\n2. The final boss requires grinding earlier stages to get upgrades. It's the only fight in the entire game that will give you trouble, other than maybe needing an extra shot at a couple stages. Basically, the final boss requires you to have upgraded a couple of your skills at shops on earlier levels. This kills the flow and creates a lot of unwanted padding in a game that should be a play-for-3-hours-and-forget kind of game.\n\nWhile I like the game itself, these 2 issues are deal-breakers for me in terms of recommending the game. A crucial bad design choice, and a game that should be playable on any system having bad stuttering.","March 22, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Combat is fairly intuitive and rewards you for using strategy and dodging attacks instead of just mashing. It's a bit sluggish however, even compared to many older coin op brawlers. Your move speed is slow, you attack slow , and even your run has a pretty lengthy delay on it. It's definitely not the smoothest combat engine out there. The game also uses way too many buttons, throwing and dodging could easily have been inputs instead of dedicated buttons. The slight rpg/leveling elements are also pretty unwanted, not doing much beyond forcing you to replay early levels to make end game stuff maneagable. Overall it's fun if you have an appreciation for beat em ups, but I would personally rank games like Alien Vs Predator, Knights of The Round, DND: Mystara, Sengoku 3, etc. a bit higher in terms of gameplay design and fun factor.\n\nCo op is fun but...the netcode is perhaps the most unstable I have ever encountered in a game. Enemies and even the players constantly teleport, sometimes to an absolutely absurd degree. It's often extremely choppy online. And even when these issues are not acting up, co op had horrendous input lag for me that made dodging and timing basically impossible. My connections with games are generally decent, and I've heard very similar complaints from others, so watch out if you're buying this to play with friends. If the netcode doesn't agree with one of you, it could be a traumatic experience.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game was pretty charming for me. It may depend on your tolerance for wacky voices, but I found it amusing and quirky. The music is also pretty great, parodying the 80's aesthetic while being legitimately awesome in its own right. Character designs (courtsey of Genzoman) are solid too, and come to life pretty well in game.\n\nDefinitely some enjoyment to be had here, just make sure you're down with coin op brawlers, like the aesthetic, have a good connection, and don't mind one or two quesitonable design choices.","June 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As expected, you play as the twins Bimmy and Jammy (Billy and Jimmy Lee) again, the humour really hits a sweet spot if you have a thing for the '80s or the franchise itself, it comes off less as pandering and more as a self-awareness that an older game needs to become accepted against newer titles.\n\nAlso, you can like dodge and stuff. That's a thing. It's probably good that they got around to adding that as a thing. Making it skill-based was also a good thing.\n\nWhile I despise the term 'Bro', it's used pretty well in the over-exaggerated '80s theme. You can high-five. Neat.\n\nIt's nice to have a sense of humour to help you get over any difficulties you might be having with anything, whilst I wouldn't expect a boss to tell me how to beat him when I pause the game because he assumes I'm googling the answer in Dark Souls because it wouldn't suit the theme, I'm glad that they do this kind of thing in Double Dragon: Neon.\n\nAlso, I was just pausing to get a drink, I swear.","February 10, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Why not? You also can't skip the ending credit scroll and since the last boss is a great source of resources to farm, this quickly detracts from the fun value.\n\nThere, that is the biggest and infact only gripe I could muster for the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/252350/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Double Dragon Neon is a pseudo 2D beat em up in where we play Billy or Jimmy Lee on a quest to save your girlfriend from a goofy skeleton called Skullmageddon . Starting off your girlfriend gets punched in the stomach and kidnapped, that's all the story has to offer. You are able to move forward and background into the level to avoid thrown items though in certain sections it becomes pure 2D in that you are only able to move left to right. Those sections are a little less enjoyable but a far better alternate to being able to walk forward to the foreground, falling and losing some health. One unique feature that separates this game from others of the genre is that dodging attacks temporarily grants you Gleam, which allows you to cause double damage so getting in close and risking damage is a very viable tactic, so you don't just end up kiting enemies. Unfortunately it can be very picky when it counts as a dodge and a lot of times I ended up with no Gleam, which is pretty annoying considering how hard this game is until you get the hang of it.\n\nFrom the get go it is clear that the game was built around coop and can be difficult to tackle solo until you upgrade or simply getting better at the game. There is even a dedicated high-five your button and a floating ball that appears at the ends of levels that grant money and items, in which you must attack it to keep it afloat but it is near impossible to do. Upgrades are earned via cassette tapes that sometimes drop from defeated enemies that allows you to access special moves or change your fighting stances. Fighting stances allow you to customize your character to suit your fighting style like allowing weapons to last longer and hit harder, increasing your magic or leeching health from your enemies every time you attack them. Special moves depend on your magic bar and allows you to shoot fireballs, throw bombs and summon a dragon to damage your enemies to name a few. Magic regenerates over time though by breaking objects you can usually find a battery to refill your magic or some soda to regain some health.\n\nMoney is used to buy tapes or lives from item shops that may sometimes be hidden around the level. Buying lives only lasts until the end of the level so be careful not to go crazy with buying as many as you can expecting to have a ton of lives throughout the game. Every level your life stock is reset back to two which I personally consider a flaw but does keep the game challenging. The more tapes of the same song that you have makes the ability stronger and more effective though the cap limit is 10 of a single tape until you upgrade the cap via Tapesmith. You upgrade by collecting crystals that bosses drop when defeated and each time you level up a song it increases it's cap by 10 but it does become more expensive each you upgrade. I found the addition of the Tapesmith to be unnecessary and quite frankly annoying. There was no real reason for him to be there other than to extend the replay value but it just comes off as a lazy way to keep you playing.\n\nGameplay is pretty slow paced and tactical. You can punch, kick, use a spinning flying kick as well as a few alternate attacks by holding down either the sprint or dodge button. It does feature a grab button that can be used to throw enemies but only when stunned. It's pretty basic combat and won't impress you but it serves it's purpose. There are also multiple types of weapons to spice things up like whips, katanas and boomerangs to name a few. Guns are also in the game but only enemies can fire them as your character refuses to  shoot anyone and instead uses it to pistol whip enemies. The game has no blood and is not all that violent instead opting to go for a goofy near cartoon like approach. I wouldn't know if I'd recommend it to a child though, so I suggest looking up some gameplay beforehand if you are looking for a game to play with your kids. After a couple of levels the game does introduce way too many gimmicks where you must do some light platforming, have arrows falling out of the sky or having to be careful not to be pulled into an air vacuum.\n\nThey massively overdue the environmental hazards and you will rarely have a normal fight again after the first few levels. I can't speak for everybody but I certainly don't play this genre to platform or to avoid obstacles instead of fighting people. Most of the damage caused to you will likely be due to the environments instead of a fight. I'm not saying they shouldn't include them but the amount of hazards get ridiculous further into the game you get. An example is that your character can't take a punch and will drop his weapon and be sent flying a couple of feet back which doesn't sound too bad until they introduce bottomless pits in the worst places. Fortunately it doesn't take away a life only damages you though it does feel like a cheap way of causing a lot of damage to you. Enemies will not jump over pits but will wait on the edge until you are forced to jump over which usually ends in you taking a hit and falling. It's not an enemy strategy though, the AI is quite sub-par and is only programmed to walk right to you, regardless of any hazards.\n\nFighting enemies is still fun though as every level they either introduce a new enemies to fight or make a few visual changes like adding space helmets or turning them undead. After finishing the game you can unlock two more difficulty modes to make the game even harder and increase loot drops. A  rather large gallery of concept art is also unlocked once you finish the game which is a nice little touch. Most levels include bosses which are the best part of the game. They are absolutely insane and you will not know what to expect next. This game does not take itself seriously at all so the bosses are very creative and odd fights. Three of those boss fights will be against Skullmageddon and as goofy as he is, he is certainly no pushover. Especially in your last fight against him. That was a very fun battle that has both of you smacking each other all over the screen in a epic fight. The only thing you gain from beating them is crystals to upgrade your tapes and access to the next level. One thing that I have not mentioned is that there are keys laying in some levels that allows you to open a treasure chest further into the level. Picking it up restricts your character from punching though and you will have to rely on kicks though you can always drop it if you are not interested in the extra cash and tapes.\n\nThere are only 10 levels in Double Dragon Neon so it is not a length game though it will take you quite some time to max out the tapes if you are inclined to due so. Each level is vastly different from another and usually full of color. One level did have foreground objects blocking the your view of your character but that only happened once.They are not the best visuals technically  but the artstyle for the backgrounds are stunning at times. Each level also has some new funny movements or quips from your character like seeing in enemy looking down a ledge complain about how he dropped his contacts and you can kick him off 300 style if you choose to. Kicking TVs in another level has Skullmageddon whining about how expensive they are which never fails to bring a smile to my face. Voice acting is over the top and goofy as well. Expect to hear some of the cheesiest dialogue in the history of video games. Music is simply amazing in my opinion and has a very “80's” vibe to it. Every level has a new track to show off and that became one of my biggest motivations to play level after level instead of taking a break and doing something else.  Even each Tape has it's own song which is well worth a listen instead of just picking the ability you want and quickly going back into the game.\n\nOverall it is a good game to consider for any fan of the genre and is definitely recommended for those that want a coop experience.","July 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Stuff ranging from the background music being rich with 1980s styling (courtesy of Jake Kaufman, a.k.a. DJ VIRT), to the attire and character designs (Billy and Jimmy talking like Bill and Ted while dressing more in the style of Fist of the North Star, for instance). The first is basically a remake of the original game's first stage, but every stage after is an awesome tribute to what people liked in the 1980s and surrounding years. Whether it is a boss who happens to be a blue combat robot with a Capcom style theme tune, a main villain who looks like samurai Skeletor, or just the songs that play on the second stage of an area... it's like an entire decade and the years surrounding it in one game.\n\nOh yeah it plays well too, having taken all the improvements of every Double Dragon game before it, improved upon them, and added it's own as well. It also has multiple difficulty levels and a growth system for upgrading the capabilities of Billy and Jimmy, which fits the difficulty levels perfectly.","June 12, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

If you're wondering whether you should pick it up: stop wondering right now and pick it up. This game is for sure radicool, and there's some obvious reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, there's this unofficial term going around regarding games called "game-feel". You know when you have this amazingly good looking game and you throw a punch at an enemy or slash it with your sword but it just doesn't feel that good? A meriad of reasons can be accounted to this: maybe the hitboxes are janky, the hit confirmation sound isn't that amazing, etc. This game just feels good, which as a beat'em up is incredibly important as the combat mechanics of a beat'em up are notoriously "repetitive".\n\nRepetitive, you say? Why yes, but this game does have a lot going for it that mix (heh) things up. There is a dual upgrade system, namely for a special skill and a "stance". The special skill ranges from fireballs to spin kicks to one inch punches, while the stances allow for special abilities like "lifesteal" or just an overal balance of your stats. Picking up mix tapes upgrades these and they drop generously, which is a good thing as they go up to 50.\n\nThe third and most amazing thing that makes this game so ridiculously good is the polish. Starting with the music, it's hard not to love this game's soundtrack. Every mixtape, be it a stance or a special skill, has its own little song or tune. Some favourites of mine are Bomb Toss and Training Wheels. The stage music is this perfect combination of keeping the Double Dragon feel and an amazingly good callback to the 80's. And there's just all these awesome little extras. Try pausing while fighting Skullmageddon, for example. Or pay close attention to the shopkeepers highlighted hints, they might lead you to some cool secrets and easter eggs.\n\nThis game just takes the best from every beat'em up and combines it into a fantastic product. Seriously, do not hesitate to pick this up. You'll love it. Also best credits ever, anyone?","February 8, 2014","true","7.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The graphics and music is awesome i loved them, but the controls are the stiffest controls i have ever had with a fighting game, trying to run and i have to wait half a second before i actually run, the dodge mechanic is flawed as you have to imput a direction immediatly after pressing duck ( which i also found to be stupid you only duck for less than half a second)  everything about the controls and movement felt so sluggish which is the opposite of what you want for a brawling game, you want fast responsive controls with a lot of fluidity with them.\n\nThe difficulty, like with all games i am playing for the first time i play on the easiest difficulty to get used to the gameplay and controls before increasing the difficulty.... i was killed after being hit 3 times, the amount of damage you take was crazy it made the need for health bar pointless they should of just used a health counter instead it saddens me that even this remake to me feels like its living up to its history of bad games","January 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

Bigger problem is distinguishing that which plane you are on compared to the enemies as you find yourself beating air as the enemy is five pixels lower than you are.\n\nThat said, the game is more about just having really great time with some bro so you easily forget those issues and are laughing your ♥♥♥ off to an Training wheels mixtape or character dialogue. But that's also where game falls short: if you don't have a bro, then you aren't going to get that much out of the game by yourself.

Se on myös asia missä peli hieman ♥♥♥♥aa lyhyelle: jos sinulla ei ole kaveria jonka kanssa pelata, et tule saamaan pelistä niin paljon irti itseksesi.

I found myself toe tapping to the soundtrack and doing quite a lot of laughing at the constant comedy provided. No spoilers but if you have had any relationships with Beat-em-ups you will be well aware that the story is most often an after thought and Neon is no exception. But, there inlies some of the comic gold, trust me on that.\nGameplay is, how do I say, a bit... heavy and systemic, which seems like a far cry from my memories of button mashing as a kid.  It is quite smooth I'll admit, but gameplay could be a little quicker. But where this game lacks in polish it makes up for in levity and humor which usually is a huge mistake from my own experience, yet, this does it flawlessly.

Bigger problem is distinguishing that which plane you are on compared to the enemies as you find yourself beating air as the enemy is five pixels lower than you are.\n\nThat said, the game is more about just having really great time with some bro so you easily forget those issues and are laughing your ♥♥♥ off to an Training wheels mixtape or character dialogue. But that's also where game falls short: if you don't have a bro, then you aren't going to get that much out of the game by yourself. Luckily game does have online coop (apparently bit buggy) but still you most likely get the best experience when playing on sofa locally.\n\nAlso the soundtrack - just ♥♥♥♥ing listen to it https://virt.bandcamp.com/album/double-dragon-neon\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nErittäin mahtava cooppipeli mahtavalla teemalla ja musiikilla 80-luvun viballa.\n\nKontrollit tuntuvat hieman jäykiltä, mutta samantuntuiselta kuin odottaisi joltain NES ajan peliltä, joten se ei ole niinkään vittumaista - enemmänkin hieman raskaan oloista. Isompi ongelma on hahmottaa että millä tasolla olet vihollisiin nähden koska välillä huomaat hakkaavasi ilmaa kun vihollinen onkin viisi pikseliä alempana kuin itse olet.\n\nKaikesta tuosta huolimatta peli onkin enemmän sitä että voit viettää tosi hyvää aikaa kaverin kanssa joten pienet pelilliset ongelmat unohtuvat helposti ja nauratte maha kippurassa Training wheels mixtapelle ja hahmojen dialogille. Se on myös asia missä peli hieman ♥♥♥♥aa lyhyelle: jos sinulla ei ole kaveria jonka kanssa pelata, et tule saamaan pelistä niin paljon irti itseksesi. Pelissä on onneksi nettimoninpeli (joka on kuulemma hieman buginen), mutta todennäköisemmin sohvalla pelaaminen voi antaa paremman kokemuksen.\n\nLisäksi pelin musiikki - kuuntele nyt tätä https://virt.bandcamp.com/album/double-dragon-neon","June 19, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

They wanted their game back. Again. I picked up the phone and said in the calmest voice I could “I'm not giving it to you. Please stop calling my home or I'll be forced to contact the authorities. I'm not afraid of you”\n\nPutting the phone back on the hook I admitted to myself that the last bit was a lie. As I trembled, holding onto the wall to keep myself from toppling over, I wondered what this bygone era want from me. Why did they feel so entitled to having Double Dragon Neon? The game clearly came out in 2012.Yet, it seemed trapped in the past in all the right ways. It seemed to exist to prove that what worked in 8 bits and dusty pizzeria arcade machines still works today. But does the great gameplay of yesteryear mean that yesteryear is entitled to having it? Our millennium earned this fair and square. I needed time to think.\n\nI laid in my bed, uneasy, shaken, crying. Fifty thousand questions and possibilities rushed through my mind. Maybe they wanted their culture back. It's a simple mistake to make, the game certainly didn't scream “2014” very loudly. Maybe it was upset that we accomplished what they couldn't. We'd made what they dreamed of but didn't have the buttons or the horsepower to accomplish, and drew too heavily from what they felt they owned. But it's ours... right\n\nI heard a knock on my door. Trembling, I grabbed the baseball bat from under my bed and slowly walked to the front of the house. I opened the door slowly, fearfully, and saw a beast right in front of my eyes. It was six feet tall, had a rad mullet the size of a man and held a boombox so close to it's head you'd swear it grew there. It's denim jacket blew in the wind and cassette tapes jingled on it's belt. It was the 80s, and it wanted my life.\n\nI swung at the beast as hard as I could. It's tubular mass flew off of my doorstep and onto the lawn. As it slowly limped away, I heard something come from my mouth I'd hoped I'd never hear. “Far out, bro!”. At that moment I realized that I was in far deeper than I'd ever expected I would be.","February 27, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall a very solid game and great entry into the Double Dragon series.\n\nSide-scrolling beat-em-up with power-ups, selectable "styles" (changes your stats and can level up) and special moves (can also level up). As you progress you gain cash which can be used to purchase lives, health, level ups for moves or styles. You also collect mythril from beating bosses which is used to increase the level caps for moves and styles. Once you beat the game, you unlock harder modes.\n\nOne interesting feature is the "High Five". There are four versions you can perform with the other player (up, down, left and right), each giving a different buff. However, unless you communicate to the other person which one your are performing, they won't know. You have to tell the other player which high five to perform (Up High!).\n\nRecent patches have fixed issues many were having using controllers. I've tested a PS3 controller using DS3(Motionjoy) and Xbox360 MadCatz TE Stick and both work perfectly.\n\nOverall, well worth it especially for the price.","February 8, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Amid the broken glass and tetanus we were like machines, searching through the garbage in the hopes of finding something tossed by mistake or otherwise unappreciated by whoever might have owned it prior. Among our best hauls was an NES and a box full of games, which is where I was first introduced to the beat'em'up classic Double Dragon. I was never even remotely good at it, but nevertheless I played that cartridge to death right up until our dog puked up something awful onto it and it found its way back from whence it came.\n\nFlash forward many years later and here we have Double Dragon: Neon, a loving recreation of the now several decade old original, decked out with a slick presentation and some much needed refinement to the now rather archaic mechanics that hold up much better in my memories than reality. Though with this remake comes its own issues, some exacerbated problems that have always existed in the series, and others born from attempts to add depth but failing to commit while hanging onto some of the less enjoyable aspects of the series. They don't completely break the experience, but for every moment the game shines there are a dozen more to remind me that it unfortunately hasn't grown up along with me.\n\nThis is no more immediately apparent than in the terrible portrayal of every female character in the game. Double Dragon has always been built on a sort of twelve year-old dudebro mentality, but it's never felt this intentionally demeaning toward the women that get sucked into the mix. Nearly every female character is dressed in such a way as to showcase their ample jiggling assets, be it g-strings, corsets, cleavage pushing kimonos, or nearly invisible pasties, as they skulk around bending over into compromising positions until you've beaten them up that they blip out (often with an almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic plea to "punish them"). I can't say that I didn't expect this in a Double Dragon game, but Neon takes it to a level far beyond the irritating punch to the gut Marion receives at the beginning of the game, to something that feels gross and certainly unnecessary. It was uncomfortable and pretty much immediately spoiled the experience that could have finally broken out of its misogynistic heritage.\n\nAnd it's a shame because there are parts of Neon that I really enjoyed. The fighting mechanics are satisfyingly meaty, providing a level of speed and variance to your attacks that allows you a welcome amount of options to how you intercept attacks and take down enemies. Being able to tie rolls and jumps into kicks and punches to create combos gave me a more technical aspect to consider when approaching encounters, requiring I lay off the button mashing and pay attention to enemy tells and environmental hazards.\n\nWhen you get a good flow going in Neon it feels amazing, possibly some of the most enjoyable fighting of any beat'em'up I've ever played, but the problem is getting to that point and managing to stay there. While enemies are generally obvious about their attacks so as to allow you to anticipate and dodge them, there are unpredictable invincibility attacks that will often make the enemy immune to your attacks for just long enough for them to land an attack and knock you down. This isn't a random occurrence, but something I experience in almost every encounter, and it severely breaks up the flow of action and feels like a cheap way out for the AI. Being locked into attack animations also prohibits you rolling out of the attack (the only way to dodge), which essentially means you're going to be taking a lot of punishment because the enemy inexplicably stopped being stunned.\n\nThe mixtape (read: upgrade) system as well ends up being something of a missed opportunity. The idea is each mixtape corresponds to either a stat loadout or a special attack, which you can slot in and in theory augment your combat abilities to your playstyle. The reality is that these only ever have a very slight effect on your overall abilities, constantly reminding you that they are there and you should be using them but never actually providing a benefit of disadvantage that I could discern. The most important reason I could find to pay attention to them was to make sure I stayed away from the majority of the special attack powers, as all but a few are almost entirely worthless save their flashy visuals. Perhaps the differences between loadouts become more apparent on your second or third playthrough when you've upgraded them even more, but if that's the case it still presents a fundamental balance issue that rarely caused me to pay attention to them as I played through the game.\n\nAnd boy, what a frustrating game this can be. There's a part of me that likes that developer Wayforward kept the arcade life limits and continue screen, but being forced to replay levels from the start after running out of lives right at the end is nothing but tedium that adds nothing to the experience but definitely took away from my overall enjoyment of it. With so many obvious locations for checkpoints to be placed (entering a new area, getting to a boss fight) their absence is all the more puzzling and frustrating. I can only assume the intention was to keep with the "pure" arcade feel of the game, but my time is more valuable to me now than it was when I played the original and Neon's intent on wasting it more often than not caused me to turn the game off and switch to something else instead of replaying the same level I'd just almost completed.\n\nI almost wish that Double Dragon: Neon was a complete trainwreck because it would make it less disappointing that they only just missed the mark with some really idiotic design decisions. The 80's vibe dripping out of every corner of the game is pure awesome, the music is synth rock and action movie bliss, and the main villain is a giant skeleton called Skullmageddon (if that doesn't put a stupid grin on your face I feel sorry for you). At times I was absolutely loving tearing through enemies, rocking out to Skullmageddon's arena rock ballad, and taking in the absolute absurdity that is most of the game's stages. But these stand out as highlights to a lot of annoying and unfortunate moments that more often than not miss the mark completely and just made me hope the next area would be better.\n\nIt's like a mixtape your friend makes you, that has a few songs you like interspersed between a ton of trash that you can't understand why its on their at all. You listen to it anyway because they're your friend and friends put up with other friends poor choices, but that doesn't make it any easier to recommend someone else bother to spend their time looking for the parts that don't suck.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 26, 2014","false","3.6"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","17","34","2","5"

Alyssa Milano. If these names next to each other don't ring a bell, you've missed out on horrendous, yet super fun (for a 9 year old) live action film Double Dragon. Released in 1994, Double Dragon was one of the trash cornerstones of my childhood. I've first got aquainted with the franchise with Game Boy game released in 1988 or 1989. It was and still is one of my favorite beat-em-ups ever.\n\nI somehow skipped getting Double Dragon: Neon because screenshots didn't resonate the right way to me. When I got it as a gift, I've had no excuse not to try it out.\n\nMenu is full of neon, bright flashing colors and pumping retrowave / synthwave / electro metal music which got me thinking: "Well, this doesn't look and sounds that bad... does it?". The first out of ten missions starts with stereotypical punk aesthetic baddie punching damsel in distress Marion right in the gut and taking her away, carrying her unconscious over his ripped shoulder. Her red dress is way too short and we can see why is Billy thinking of marrying the lady. Bye bye, political correctness, hello nineties. You're playing Billy Lee and if someone else joins, he takes the role of Jimmy Lee.\n\nMost of the times you will be using three-button system to punch, kick and grab. That's something we've all seen back in the day. Beside that, you'll have a dash button (ALT) and sprint button (Shift) at disposal. The heart of every beat-em-eup is the efficiency of beating where Double Dragon: Neon utterly fails to deliver. I understand this is love letter to arcade machines, but the difficulty in this game doesn't come from the waves of swarming enemies and inability to think fast when the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. This game is primarily difficult because it's fighting system is cumbersome and inefficient. How hard is it to create a good three button mashing system? Appearantly, very hard because in this game, you will die over and over again because hit detection is off and if you're 97% correctly aligned, you will miss your target because you're not standing in perfect line. Animations are also problematic, these are not fluid and they don't allow a good transition between moves which often leaves you in the middle of enemy attack not being able to get your way out. Recently I've also played Turtles: Back in Time on SNES emulator and that game really shows how it should be done. I will respect your opinion if you think game functions better when it's played with gamepad, but I also want to have a freedom to play with my trusty keyboard if the game allows it and the game is obliged to provide me with decent enough controls on keyboard as well.\n\nShop mode is an interesting addition to the world of Double Dragon reboot/remake. You are able to unlock additional moves which varies a game to some point. Integrating platform-inspired segments is a 'meh' situation - again, the idea is good, but the controls cause a lot of problems for a player, especially during the multiplayer matches.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, it is there and practically dead. Unless you're playing with friends, you'll be able to read a book or two while waiting for the system to hook you up with someone to play. And when it finally does, you'll endure the nightmare of netcode. Lag makes the game almost unplayable, especially when the screen gets overrun with the enemies.\n\nThe biggest problem that I had with Double Dragon: Neon is that it didn't feel like a Double Dragon thing to me. I'm pretty much stuck in my perspective of Double Dragon being that 1994 movie for me. Post apocalyptic Los Angels in 2007. Less neon, more burning trash and misery, Punk and radioactive waste. Billy and Jimmy of Neon fame look like two guys in blue and red and don't feel like Lee brothers. However, that being the problem doesn't mean I would be unable to get over it. if only gameplay was better.\n\nBeing the modern homage to oversexualized, hyper exaggerating genre, Double Dragon: Neon delivers awesome music and nods to the past. However, I am unable to recommend it to people due to its frustrating control patterns and artificial difficulty that in the end, when you beat the game, doesn't provide players with feelings of utter satisfaction.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review?

The original Double Dragon was nearly mythical in it's day, as it may well have been the first game to truly stir up controversy.  For the time it was very hard edged and violent, with it's gritty urban backdrops, menacing gang members and the most visceral fighting portrayed in a game thus far...  This wasnt just martial arts fighting - you mercilessly beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of people.  You beat them down with baseball bats, stabbed them with knives and gleefully punched perm-haired, spandex clad ladies in the face.  By the standards of the day, it was shockingly barbaric...  And my ten year old buddies and me were utterly and completely irrevocably enrapt.  Our parents however were aghast at it, forbidding us to play it for fear of it warping our lil heads and turning us into thugs and killers - further establishing it as forbidden fruit and making a couple bucks of allowance money spent in it's company all the more desireable.  This ♥♥♥♥er was beyond worth a good grounding over.  We'd play it, get rolled by our folks and then brag to our friends about it.  Even now It's iconic theme song and opening scene where you emerge from the garage with the red Trans-Am lurking in the background still get a few hairs on the back of my neck standing up...  It was almost like a ♥♥♥♥ing religion.  So here we are now...   27 years later, graced with this - Double Dragon Neon.  This to me is less of a re-boot and more of an homage, both to the game and the era.  The savage edge is gone, replaced with a sort of happy go lucky swagger, and loads and loads of charm.  The whole game is a tribute to the hokiness of the 80s, and it is glorious.  I swear to god, this thing makes you think "Man, if I had a mullet and a jean vest I would seriously be cool as ♥♥♥♥!"  The music is the perfect accomplice to this being an incredible collection of redone tracks from the original game drenched in synthesizers and electric guitars, and fresh tracks that fit in perfectly, sounding for all the world like vintage 80's pop-cheese.  The art is very good, with cell shaded characters with very nice detail and facial expressions that really give them personality, all set against backdrops liberally slathered in hot pink and electric blue (lest you forget this is the 80s).  The gameplay is pretty standard beat-em up faire, and holds up fairly well, if not intuitive on the level of say Castle Crashers.  Again though, charm is the strong point here..  Sure, you beat the crap out of folks, but this is silly and cute crap beating now...  The characters all spout corny one liners and make little quips as you exchange blows that can be absurd and hilarious and make it enjoyable to wade through wave after wave of these guys.  The game's villian, apparently replacing the fairly manacing Machine Gun Willie is.... Skullmageddon. (No, really - it's his name!) and he is a particullar delight.  He taunts and heckles you in this nasally Skellator voice while you fight him, making horrid puns and one liners all the while.  It's dumb, but by god I love that guy.  It's funny to think how this tongue in cheek kung-fu romp could be descended from the bloody knuckled brutal original, but indeed the world has moved on, and I think that it is all for the better.  The original game would be considered rediculously tame by today's standards anyways, and if they were to try and reclaim the crown they once held I think the result would be dreadful.  This is for those of us who remember the shock and awe of the original game and want to enjoy a little hot neon rose colored nostalgia.  It's like a high school reunion, where no one is still trying to be badass - we have jobs and families and we want to have fun, and share some slightly skewed, over-exaggerated memories...  Ten bucks very very well spent.   Also, the fantastic soundtrack is avaliable for free on bandcamp - nice little bonus there!","February 9, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you buy it, be aware that you're rolling the dice wether this games runs properly for you.\n\nThis game is an excellent reimagination of the classic Double Dragon series. Everything from the art and sound design to the gameplay design fits together really well and the coop mode is a blast to play with friends (couch coop).\n\nHaving said all this it makes me sad that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to new players, because of the, probably unsolvable, technical issues that they might run into.\n\nI have two machines that I play this game on. One runs Windows 7 the second Windows 10, both have Intel i7 CPUs and both have a GForce graphics card (GTX 560 and GTX 860M). On both systems Double Dragon Neon crashes after seemingly random amounts of time. I managed to play for several hours without crashes and I also experienced repeated crashes after a few minutes into a mission. I tried most of the fixes suggested in the forums, but none have really improved the crashes or the randomness of them occuring and since there is absolutely no technical support anymore that situation will pretty much never change.","March 23","false","22.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/recommended/252350/","yoshikawa","Venom Krulin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/","424 products in account","For the uninitiated Double Dragon Neon is a reboot of the old Double Dragon series. It is a game that takes itself much less seriously than the previous games. I will not compare this game to the older games because nothing will compare to the nostalgia of the old games. It would be an unfair comparison at best and I would advise you follow suit. It is a side scroller beat em up at it's finest.\n\nThe Good: The game mechanics are really good. The graphics look good for what the game is suppposed to be and the effects are really nice in my opinion. The game makes fun of the 80's A LOT. Which in my opinion isn't a bad thing. There isn't much to say about it past that. It's not that there aren't many good things about it, it's that it's not a super complex game.\n\nThe Bad: Glitches. Lots of glitches. Though nothing too terrible and nothing that I don't think could or should be fixed in a patch. Can't use pc gamepads without some sort of third party software. For the PS3 owners this is not a problem as MotionJoy fixes that. Xbox 360 owners also do not have a problem as the game started as an XBLA game. This is one of the few instances where I don't feel dirty after saying I played an XBLA on PC though (I'm not being an elitist when I say that. I just mean that a lot of XBLA games are gimmicky).\n\nThe Ugly: Nothing really.\n\nSummary: Buy it. It's very good if you like the genre and is even better if you have a person to play with you.","February 9, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/252350/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Double Dragon: Neon Review.\n\nIntroduction:\nChances are if you were born in the 80s your fully aware of what Double Dragon is, you’ve probably spent many a 10p on the arcade machine or had it on your NES. If your not a child of the 80s, chances areyou’ve never paid less than £1 on an arcade machine, don’t know what a NES is and never heard of Double Dragon.\nDouble Dragon was a side scrolling beat them up that took the arcades by storm, it helped invent a genre of games like Final Fight, Street Of Rage and even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to get in onit. Neon tries to recreate the 80s feel with a modern twist, but does it succeed? lets find out.\n\nStory:\nNow lets be frank, these games were never built on the base of a fantastic story. Generally anything that gives you a reason to punch someone in the street will do, neon is no different really. The gamewill see you travelling into space on a rocket powered Chonglou(Chinese layered house)for no apparent reason other than it gives you some cool backgrounds. There is no real story, but the game doesn’t need a story.\n\nGameplay:\nNow this is where Neon gets difficult, see one of the modifications that WayForward has implemented is an entirely new control system. This means there are combos galore to be had but also that to just survive past the first level you will need to learn to dodge. This new dodge move makes the game very hard while mastering it and very easy once you have, maybe too easy in fact. These new controls, while appealing to more modern gamers will no doubt alienate the many fans of the originals. Its not that its a bad system, just too far removed from the classic method to sit well with fans.\nIts funny how although they updated the controls they still don’t let you pick which brother you wish to be. It might have been nice to have a few secret characters too instead of the extra skins you can unlock.\nAs you progress you can unlock new special moves and stances, these don’t really change much. Stances give you a bonus in attack or defence, and special moves range from calling dragons onto the screen or even Bruce Lee’s one inch punch. These moves and stances are fine and dandy, but they don’t really add much. You don’t feel like your becoming more powerful or that your moving faster, like you would in a more traditional levelling up fair.\nIts not bad, but its so far removed from the original and I’m not sure all this change really improved anything.\n\nPresentation:\nWayForward are known for there wonderful 2D graphics, so why they chose to use 3D graphic on a 2D plain confuses me. That’s not to say there bad graphics, just I feel 2D would have sat better. What they have done though is create an atmosphere that reeks of the 80s in every way. It really does create a feeling of nostalgia and makes you feel like a kid again. There’s nothing here that’s going to push your system here, but the models are nicely done and though not 2D they capture that feeling well.\n\nConclusion:\nI would love to recommend this game as I really enjoyed playing it, even with its flaws. But I just feel WayForward tried to reinvent a wheel that was working fine before. There’s nothing wrong with updating a game and trying to modernise it, but nearly 20 years ago Treasure did reinvent this genre with Guardian Heroes very successfully and WayForwards offering to me isn’t nearly as accomplished or advanced as it was. Knowing that its really hard for me to tell you to get it if a game realised 20 years ago did it better, and the truth is I can’t. Its not a bad game, its just not good enough.\n\nTo checkout this and more of my reviews visit http://www.cyberusuk.com","March 31, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Enemies hit like a truck and your own attacks are ridiculously weak. Some of the enemies in the later stages are just ridiculous. I feel like the hit detection is bit of a miss in this game and something that seriously could be improved. The humour in this game is not even retro its just plain horrible. The main villains voice acting is one of the worst things about this game and when your own character utters the line "I double dragon dare you", your stomach kind of churns a bit and you vomit inside your own throat. With only 108 minutes played I probably will keep this just because I grew up with DD on the Nes, but yeah. I was really disappointed. Big thumbs down.

Run far, far away.\n\nThat said, onto the bullet points.\n\n+ Clean, crisp graphics\n+ Fun and lively characters/enemies\n+ Awesome 80's era imagery and dialogue\n+ Relatively straightforward beat em up, can't really go wrong if that's what you're looking for\n+ Varied power ups and abilities\n+ IF YOU DON'T PLAY ONLINE, 2 player coop is what makes the game shine. Alot of mechanics (including high five power ups and "resurrecting" your "bro") open up.\n+ If you're solo you can turn on a "bro bot".\n+ Challenging. This isn't an easy game.\n\n- ONLINE MULTIPLAYER IS BAD. At least, when it came to my experience. Stuttering lag, desyncing, disconnects every few minutes, crashes...everything you can think of, it happened. I bought this game for both myself and a friend, and I'm currently regretting it.\n\n- Online latency can basically ruin Adobo fights and those that need you to dodge quickly. One of their main things is interrupting your combo with a hammer fist like attack. This attack gives just enough time and just enough of a tell to give you a chance to dodge out of the way. But online....nope. You will get hit. Every time. You're forced to use other tactics and so far I haven't found one that works well enough online. Of course, keep in mind my meager amount of hours in this game. I could just be showing off my newbieness.\n\n- Battle mechanics are noticeably much different than the older Double Dragons.\n\n- Running is....odd. Your character winds up and then starts running, which can lead to completely messing you up in all sorts of ways. There are certain mechanics that need you to run away or quickly get under some sort of cover. If you time it like you would any other game with running mechanics, prepare to find yourself on the floor.\n\n- There is no grab and knee to face. Why did they not add this? That was a staple in many of the double dragon games. It feels as if a large chunk of the soul of double dragon was ripped out of it.\n\n- enemies can juggle you pretty much indefinitely. I do love a challenge but it can get obnoxious, especially since enemies do a considerable amount of damage to you per hit.\n\n- enemies are also invulnerable when they're swinging a weapon at you. So if you try to interrupt an enemy that's wielding a knife, prepare to get hit anyway, and watch 1/3rd of your life disappear in one hit.\n\nSo...yeah. I want to really really like this game and I guess if I play the rest of it solo, I probably will like it. But as stated in the beginning, the main reason why people are going to buy this game is due to the desire to play with friends. If it fails on that level, then the game fails almost completely in my eyes.\n\nPlay solo? Go for it. Play couch coop? Go for it (if you want two controllers you'll have to look up how to get that to work. Supposedly it only works with one controller by default). Play online? No. Nonononono. You can try. You might have a better time than I. But I can only go with my own experience, and that experience says...no.","August 21, 2015","false","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art style, music, controls, and fighting engine of all been replaced in this remake.\n\nI grew up playing the original Double Dragon series at the arcade and on the NES, and hold the originals in high regard.  They were simple, easy to play, fun games that you could play with a friend.  The original's graphics and controls were simple, but effective.  The gameplay had a solid crunchy feel, and was sometimes flawed, but always enjoyable.\n\nThe remake is intended to be an over the top parody of an already over the top game. It's meant to be funny, but the jokes fall flat and just become repetitive and annoying.  The art style is now flashy and high resolution, but it looks very busy, unappealing and headache inducing. The enemy animations feel very choppy and unnatural for a modern game. The voice acting is bad, and sounds like some of the voices were being recorded underwater.\n\nThe control system is way too complicated for a beat 'em up.  There are now 7 controller buttons that perform combat actions (and an analog stick dedicated to high fives). This is unnecessarily complicated and takes away from the fun of the game.\n\nThe game has introduced some RPG elements, such as player stats, active skills and passive skills.  These features require you to exit out of the game play to a separate menu where you can read about the stats and select the options for your character. This breaks the flow of the game, and does not belong in the beat 'em up genre.\n\nThe most cringeworthy, embarrassing aspect of the game is the female enemies. I understand they're meant to over the top / satire / funny, but I just didn't find them funny. They're so raunchy that I would be overcome with cringe if I had to play this game with someone else. Good thing the multiplayer is broken on this game...\n\nStay far away, folks.","December 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I grew up playing the NES Double Dragon, and other Beat 'em Up game, I still love those kind of games, Which makes it very hard for me to give this a bad review. No i'm not going to compare the older versions to this, nor am I giving this a bad review because it's not the older games.\n\nFirst off, i'm not sure if the Trading Cards for this game are real or symbolic, after playing around 90 minutes, i'm still waiting for the first drop.\nSecond, the controls while not hard to get used are overly complicated, Like I said they're not hard, but for what the game is and how few attacks there are you use way too many buttons/keys.\n\nSecond for some reason the view zooms in and out for very dumb reasons, it adds nothing to the game, and at times it actually prevents you from seeing aproaching enemies.\n\nThird, there are way too many logos/splash screens when the game starts, which is odd considering the game isn't that polished, and of course you can't skip it, so you gotta watch the whole thing everytime you run the game.\n\nForth, they left some of the old NES problems in the game, like when you're hitting someone and for some reason they take no damage, and if you die you have to restart the whole stage, which i always hated. I get they might want to have a retro feeling to the game, but that was the wrong way to go about it.","June 19, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But for those that have played it might want to hold off on getting it for pc.\n\nThe first level alone lags quite a bit when you are moving forward which could be due to Vsync or physx being on, But you have no settings to change them nor set the resoulution. Secondly when there are too many enemies on screen the framerate really suffers.\n\nIt is obvious that they have ported this from either ps3 or xbox360 & it really does show because a little game like this shouldn't have those issues.\n\nWith that being said is it worth the Ten dollars. If you haven't played it yet I would say even with the problems absolutely  it is worth the ten dollars.\n\nFor those that have it on ps3 or 360 & can wait to play it on pc. I would wait till they iron out the bugs & at least give us the settings to change. Because Phys X can cause more problems on a game & that is what also could be making Double Dragon act sluggish too.","February 6, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The ones like: Double Dragon, Return of the Double Dragon and Super Double Dragon? If so, then Double Dragon Neon will make sure to revive those pure gaming fun moments which you've experienced in the past.\nThe gameplay is smooth and although you basically need a XBOX 360 pad for this (if you don't want to use the keyboard) you can run the TocaEdit software in the background and use any controller you like.\nOne of the best features of the game is the Online Co-Op mode with integrated Steam Friends. This makes hosting and joining a bliss.\nMe and a friend of mine have been playing over the net for a good 2 hours without any bugs or connection issues.\nAnother thing to mention are the awesome graphics. They look fresh, vivid and just, well, Double Dragon.\nAnotehr special thing is the revive system (You've got to play the game to experience it) and the unlock system for cool powerups and special moves. It might not feel very "pure" Double Dragon, but it's a nice addition and it feels okay.\n\nConclusion:\nLooking for a good Co-Op Beat 'm Up game that's almost the grandfather of all "gonna kick you in the nuts" games; Don't look any further and spend those bucks. You won't regret it. Double Dragon just returned in full Neon Technicolor mayhem.\n","February 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/252350/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","Double Dragon Neon revitalizes the classic franchise, but a few missteps derail the silly fun.\n\nWhat would a magical skeleton want with an ordinary woman? The answer isn't important (and is most likely pretty gross), but the rescue mission that follows this kidnapping sure is fun. Double Dragon Neon is a smart update to the arcade classic from decades ago. By melding the iconic characters and traditional beat-'em-up structure from the original Double Dragon with an overhauled combat system that rewards precise defensive counters and clever skill manipulation, Neon is much more than a merry trip down nostalgia lane. Billy and Jimmy Lee do occasionally stumble on their way to vanquishing Skullmageddon, but Double Dragon Neon overcomes that clumsiness with style.\n\nThe opening scene sends shivers down your spine. The sultry Marian walks alone down a dark alley, only to be greeted by a gang of lowly street toughs. With one punch to the stomach, she passes out in pain, and the trio of miscreants march away with their prize slung over one shoulder. A garage door opens, and out walk Billy and Jimmy Lee, searching for vengeance. For anyone who has played the original Double Dragon, this situation should be familiar, and the remixed music ties into the 1980s hit. By the time you square off against whip-wielding Linda and the abnormally large Abobo a few minutes into your adventure, you might think that you have a good idea of how this game is going to play out.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. Although Neon makes many references to the original game, it doesn't take long for it to forge its own path. It's a side-scrolling beat-'em-up, so the basic left-to-right kickathon is kept intact, but the combat has layers of depth that make it exciting for anyone itching for a challenge. Your basic moves are punches and kicks, and you dole out flashy combos by alternating between these standard techniques. Once you pound enemies in the head a few times, they become stunned, and their vulnerability is your gain. Toss them into a group of enemies or into a bottomless pit if you wish, or you can deliver a crushing uppercut that suspends them in midair long enough for you to juggle them like a hacky sack.\n\nDon't leave me hanging, bro!\n\nMaking smart use of these core mechanics leads to satisfying encounters. A half dozen or more enemies often flood the screen, and you need to attack with precision if you're going to keep the crowd at bay. Mashing buttons delivers jaw-breaking attacks, but you won't get far if you ignore your defensive maneuvers. The Lee brothers have a handy duck technique that becomes the foundation for your success as the difficulty ramps up. By hitting the ground right as an enemy attacks, you avoid damage and you gain a gleam bonus. This makes you twice as strong for a few seconds. Mastering the gleam makes even the toughest bosses pushovers, but it takes practice to get the timing down. Sadly, finicky collision detection sometimes means you get hit even if you moved well in advance. Also, you earn the gleam bonus only by ducking. If you roll or jump out of the way, you still avoid pain, but there's less incentive without the temporary strength boost.\n\nThe avoid-and-attack rhythm of combat is strengthened by perks you unlock as you play. Called songs, these add passive and special abilities to your repertoire. If you're dying too quickly, you may want to imbue your character with more health, or you could add damage bonuses when you land successive attacks. Super attacks are just as specialized. A screen-clearing, flaming dragon deals out a ton of damage but drains your magic bar, whereas the one-inch punch doesn't deplete as much health, but you can pull it off more often.\n\nAs rewarding as it is to mix and match the perfect abilities for your style, the leveling-up aspect drags the adventure down. Extra songs can be purchased at stores or collected from defeated enemies, and the more you have, the more potent the ability. But unlocking the full potential of these buffs demands tedious grinding. You need to kill bosses to earn the precious currency needed to raise the limit of how many songs you can carry, so you have to repeatedly play through levels to make your character strong enough to survive. This isn't a huge problem in the default difficulty because ducking at the right time and then laying the smack down is enough to defeat anyone, but things become significantly more challenging on the harder difficulty settings. When only one or two hits can take you down, you need your abilities maxed out, and that takes hours of tedious busywork.\n\nBimmy and Jimmy never looked better.\n\nIf you want to conquer Neon, you need to spend a lot of time punching fools, but just having fun doesn't take any investment. The over-the-top atmosphere not only taps into your happy memories, but introduces a layer of ridiculousness that wasn't present in the original game. Billy and Jimmy Lee are unabashedly bro, and they wear that distinction with style. They dole out manly high fives, shout outdated catchphrases like they mean them ("Tubular!"), and wear skin-tight T-shirts that accentuate their PED-defined abs. When Jimmy smacks a goon with a baseball bat, he shouts "Touchdown!" without the slightest hint of irony. Neon is consistently funny and doesn't shy away from crazy situations. From a helicopter that hovers upside down, to the weaker enemies referred to as "cartwheeling cannon fodder," Neon is happy to make fun of itself.\n\nDouble Dragon Neon is a good update to the arcade classic precisely because it's not handcuffed to what the original started. By shifting the tone from serious to crazy and making the combat system rewarding for the most dedicated players, this is a beat-'em-up that fits alongside modern games. The downsides are noticeable. Grinding turns even the brightest games dull, and local-only co-op means you have to invite your friends to your house rather than partake in online shenanigans. But for the few hours it takes to reach the end, Neon is a satisfying brawler that's as deep as it is humorous. Double Dragon Neon doesn't quite live up to its prestigious heritage, but it's a well-made game nonetheless.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?\n\nTHE GOOD\nGoofy atmosphere with amusing jokes\nDefensive mechanics reward skilled players\nPassive and special abilities allow for smart customization\n\nTHE BAD\nTedious grinding in harder difficulties\n\n8/10","May 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Apparently its very difficult, this game is slow and hitting anyone is very difficult.  Even in areas where you cant move up and down, you may end up just punching the air like an idiot.  The enemies can just strike and hit you almost anywhere but to hit them you need pixel perfect accuracy making it feel like the computer is using cheats.  If an enemy starts an animation for attacking there is no way to stop it.  When an enemy appears on screen such as the geisha girls their invulnerable until they attack, leaving you to stand there like an idiot waiting for their attack, in a game about action, waiting is never fun, matter of fact it kills it with these silly rules the devs made.  Worse is enemies can move off screen where you cant see them, they can just stand there infinitely hurling things at you.  Often during a battle you will move somewhere to attack an enemy only to have a barrage of stuff come out of nowhere from the other side where an enemy appeared you didnt even know was there.\n*This game suffers from horrible crashes very often, with no save points it means starting levels all over.  Also the game runs real slow, devs have tried patching it but so far the problem remains\n\nMaybe for a game like this we need 3 or maybe 4 titan cards.\nRating:  2/10  Value:  $1.99","June 28, 2014","false","6.9"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/252350/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Double Dragon Neon tries to pay homage to the original Double Dragon but fails miserably; the combat is half broken, animations and graphics are poor, the upgrade system terrible and the bonus levels uninspiring. Let me try and explain:\n\nThe combat is broken because you'll be punching air sometimes, even though you're absolutely certain it was a direct hit. There are difficulty spikes that don't make any sense. Low life thugs will be hitting you from all sides without once allowing you to hit them back. And those are some of the easier enemies. And if you lose all your lives you have to start all over again. There are no checkpoints. Grrr... Rage building up.\n\nThe graphics are poor; the 3D models of the characters look bland and have no personality. The stages look alright, though, but they can't save this game from looking terrible. The characters lack animation which make them feel sluggish and unresponsive.\n\nThe upgrade system is a nice addition, if it was properly executed. You'll be collecting cards to upgrade your abilities, which works, but the upgrades, in addition to the combat, are useless and not worth the trouble of executing. There are a couple of moves that might you out in tight situations but after having tried several of them I decided to stick with just one that seemed to be working alright. So, good idea, poor execution.\n\nSame goes for the bonus levels, which are bland and just don't make any sense. There's nothing else to say here.\n\nAnd that goes for the entire game. I don't know why it exists but this game never should've happened in the first place.\nAvoid at all costs.\n\n[Rating: 51/100]","February 11, 2014","false","4.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","2"

Not only is the gameplay satisfying, but it also delivers spectacularly with the soundtrack, forged by the man Jake Kaufman himself. This game is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek while also paying homage to the earlier games of the series. Now, while I want to call this game perfect in every respect, it sadly isn't. However, I still feel very passionate about just how great Double Dragon: Neon is.\n\nNow as you all probably know, this game is a sidescrolling beat 'em up with co-op capability, and it's great. The gameplay has a decent sense of depth for a 2-D beat 'em up since you are given the ability to dodge and perform combos with a bro. The sound effects are all robust and clear and really give you the sense that you are beating the living daylights out of someone. The voice acting and kind of humor this game has are both delightfully silly. And to top it all off, the hype soundtrack is not only fitting for this game, but it's also available for a free download. This game is just bodacious-- and for only $10!\n\nThe bro-op really is just boss, by the way. Juggling your opponents together to utterly annihilate them, the high-five mechanic that allows you to split health or give each other double damage, and sharing (or fighting over) money and healing items. It's friggin' bro-op.\n\nNow I could go on and continue singing this game's praises, but it does have a couple issues. The netplay leaves much to be desired, and the game is capable of stuttering and crashing. I personally have not consistently experienced the latter, but they are definitely issues that have needed to be ironed out. Fighting Roxy, that jetpack girl, is also pretty bogus. That last part doesn't really matter, though.\n\nNow this part of the gameplay here you may love or hate, as it is quite different from the other Double Dragon games. As you progress through the game, you'll grab these nifty little upgrades called Mixtapes. These are, in essence, how you level up your Billy (or Jimmy) to make him stronger. You can equip two different Mixtapes at any time: One of your Mixtapes will be stance which boosts your stats passively, some of the stances having unique effect on gameplay. The other will be your Sosetsuken, otherwise known as your special attack. Grabbing more of the same Mixtape will enhance it, making it more powerful. In addition, you can actually upgrade the maximum strength of your Mixtapes at the Tapesmith. This all adds a sort of RPG feel to the game, which I personally have no issue with. If you feel like the Mixtape system cheapens the game, don't worry! The harder difficulties will still prove challenging even with a maxed out Mixtape.\n\nEven with this game's issues, I would absolutely reccommend this game.

Once you start getting into the swing of the game and its eccentricities, you'll know exactly why certain creative decisions were made. This game was clearly designed as a reboot which emphasizes on the martial arts craze during the 80s and 90s, the toy-advertising cartoons with cheesy villians with even cheesier voices, the prevelance of synthesized pop music and the visuals of 80s neon lights. Everything from the visuals, the music and the dialogue are brilliantly done to the point that you'll feel more than a touch of nostalgia from it.\n\nThe controls are solid, with the slight delay in attacking a nod to the original game's attack-lag, meaning combat needs to be thought-out. The old system of exploiting patterns to win battles is still there, but the difficulty is still intact, particularly for Double Dragon difficulty. The RPG system of building up stats and powering up special abilities and attacks is a great touch which gives players a few extra options in how they want to approach combat.\n\nI would highly recommend this beat 'em up to anyone looking for an entertaining jaunt through the 80s.","August 3, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is bro-tacular considering I paid less, for this updated remake, than I've spent playing the original in arcades.\n\nHowever, like many of these old-school remakes, they haven't added much to it or drastically modernised the control options. I know some people would say this is a good thing and get all butthurt if certain tweaks were made. Regardless, some things that really annoy me are that you cant jump and latch onto ladders, or press up to walk through a door. Simple tweaks which would make it a seamless transition into a modern game. I understand that is breaking away from the traditional format and/or potentially adding an unfair advantage. Still, it would be good to at least have these options available. It would be nice if some of these remakes thickened the plot a little; extra cutscenes or background. Rather than a nearly linear copy that throws you directly into the the brawl, just like those quickfire arcade machines. It would be amazing to see some FMV or walk around in the shops... To have a little den or even additional sub-challenges.\n\nAll in all, WayForward are putting out some awesome remakes. Something I'm glad is happening. I hope they can keep the classics coming and in time, have full reign to re-invent a true classic - rather than just remake them!","July 10, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an old classic that, while time hasn't been kind toward (slowdowns are almost unbearable in the original), it's still highly regarded and considered a classic in the genre. The game has been released on a wide variety of systems, and even saw a faithful arcade port released to the XBox Live Arcade (slowdowns fixed). In other words, you've had every opportunity to own this game in some form or another.\n\nWhen I first saw screenshotse for Double Dragon Neon, I immediately cringed and thought of the abomination that was Turtles in Time Reshelled. Upon firing it up, it was a relief that graphics were the only thing it had in common. Double Dragon Neon is a fun take on the series, with the 80s style turned up to 11 and an engine that actually makes it enjoyable to play. It's nothing ground-breaking, but it's still A LOT of fun to play.\n\nYou have a system that revolves around mixtapes, which grant you a boost to certain stats (such as power, defense, magic, etc), or allow your character to use special abilities, such as throwing fireballs, healing, or summoning dragons to crush every enemy on screen. You level up your mixtapes by collecting any that fall from enemies, or you can purchase them in store with money you collect from enemies. Once you max out your mixtape, you will want to visit a tapesmith to upgrade how many you can hold, which will further develop your stats.\n\nAnd you'll need it. The game, while not terribly difficult, can be unforgiving for players wishing to play it like the 1980s classic and just mash out buttons. You have new abilities, such as duck, dodge, and rolling that you MUST learn to use in order to evade enemies and set yourself up to kill them without being hit. If you successfully dodge an attack, your character will gleam, which grants a bonus to your attack. Learning how each enemy attacks and what the best method of disposing of them keeps the game fresh, and fun. You may want to switch your mixtape stance to offer more defense in a particular area, or you may want to boost your magic to fight at a distance. Half the fun is figuring everything out and grinding to upgrade your stats (although non-RPG fans may not find the latter very fun).\n\nIs Double Dragon Neon the best in the series? I think so (although the GBA versions are very good). Is it ground-breaking like the original? Not so much. But it's fun. Grab a friend for even more craziness.\n\n8/10","August 17, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The boss battles are also very fun, and make up for the a times monotonous game play.\n\nI wouldn't mind a sequel, but I expect much improvement.","August 11, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My system was fine, but my friend started randomly crashing constantly around stage 6 or so and we just gave up after the fourth time.

Having now played and beat Normal difficulty on Steam, with Online Co-Op, I love it even more.  The nostalgia I get from this game is great, with the level design, the enemy AI, the controls, and the superb soundtrack, this game easily takes me back to my favorite Double Dragon games: 1, 2, and Super Double Dragon.  I was thrilled I got to play Online Co-Op (with a random person), since the PS3 version left out this key element.  I guess I have to say thank you to whoever it was I played with, for helping to make the experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nIn my 2.7 hrs of play, I think I was fortunate to not have encountered any of the major bugs posted in other players' comments, though there was one bug in which the game froze while transitioning from one area to another.  I forget what stage # it was, maybe 8...?  But it was the stage where after Billy and Jimmy ride down a long slide in a plant creature's lower jaw, they land in a graveyard-type area and fight undead characters.  I had to return to the map and restart the stage, and the problem never occurred again.  There was also some brief choppiness on some stages, but only lasted for a second or two.\n\nHighly recommend this game to any hardcore Double Dragon fan, and anyone looking for that old school, fun brawler feel in a game.\n\n10/10 = Incredibly fun new take on a classic brawler, even with the bug and slight choppiness I mentioned above.\n\nSystem: Windows 8, GeForce GTX960","November 22, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

George Washington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ggw1776/","449 products in account","Neon gave me mixed first impressions. For the first few levels, I was treated to some pretty decent beat-em-up action that really reminded me of the original Double Dragon. The music is very 80's, the models work well with the artstyle, and the quips and general voiceover are great. The entire game has a great theme going on that certainly promotes the idea of "Neon".\n\nThere's some pretty interesting brawling mechanics, too, such as a sort of counter-attack system called gleam. It's certainly one of the most redeming parts of this game, and clealy raises the skill ceiling.\n\nOnly about 6 stages in, I started having issues. Hit detection technology has not advanced since the original release of Double Dragon in 1987; I often found myself standing inside enemies, mashing the attack button, only to watch my punches pass straight through.\n\nFurthermore, there is a certain boss with a platforming mechanic that proves to be extremely frustrating and not fun (to the point where I decided to stop playing). The game's mechanics, while solid, are not at all conductive to platformer gameplay. There's about a half second of animation before your character starts running, for example, making timed jumps pretty difficult to make consitantly.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, Neon is an OK game. I wish I could give this game a neutral recommendation, but it's at least passable in my eyes.","November 27, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worst of all, some buttons (M for magic) are awkwardly spaced away from the other buttons. Even with JoyToKey and a working gamepad, the controls are rather stiff and allow enemies to get in some cheap hits.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xaldy/recommended/252350/","Xaldy","Xaldy-san","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xaldy/","718 products in account","Double Dragon: Neon is an absolutely fantastic video game.\n\nDouble Dragon: Neon is everything it wants to be. Not only is the gameplay satisfying, but it also delivers spectacularly with the soundtrack, forged by the man Jake Kaufman himself. This game is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek while also paying homage to the earlier games of the series. Now, while I want to call this game perfect in every respect, it sadly isn't. However, I still feel very passionate about just how great Double Dragon: Neon is.\n\nNow as you all probably know, this game is a sidescrolling beat 'em up with co-op capability, and it's great. The gameplay has a decent sense of depth for a 2-D beat 'em up since you are given the ability to dodge and perform combos with a bro. The sound effects are all robust and clear and really give you the sense that you are beating the living daylights out of someone. The voice acting and kind of humor this game has are both delightfully silly. And to top it all off, the hype soundtrack is not only fitting for this game, but it's also available for a free download. This game is just bodacious-- and for only $10!\n\nThe bro-op really is just boss, by the way. Juggling your opponents together to utterly annihilate them, the high-five mechanic that allows you to split health or give each other double damage, and sharing (or fighting over) money and healing items. It's friggin' bro-op.\n\nNow I could go on and continue singing this game's praises, but it does have a couple issues. The netplay leaves much to be desired, and the game is capable of stuttering and crashing. I personally have not consistently experienced the latter, but they are definitely issues that have needed to be ironed out. Fighting Roxy, that jetpack girl, is also pretty bogus. That last part doesn't really matter, though.\n\nNow this part of the gameplay here you may love or hate, as it is quite different from the other Double Dragon games. As you progress through the game, you'll grab these nifty little upgrades called Mixtapes. These are, in essence, how you level up your Billy (or Jimmy) to make him stronger. You can equip two different Mixtapes at any time: One of your Mixtapes will be stance which boosts your stats passively, some of the stances having unique effect on gameplay. The other will be your Sosetsuken, otherwise known as your special attack. Grabbing more of the same Mixtape will enhance it, making it more powerful. In addition, you can actually upgrade the maximum strength of your Mixtapes at the Tapesmith. This all adds a sort of RPG feel to the game, which I personally have no issue with. If you feel like the Mixtape system cheapens the game, don't worry! The harder difficulties will still prove challenging even with a maxed out Mixtape.\n\nEven with this game's issues, I would absolutely reccommend this game. It really is a solid game that's even better with a bro. Or you could buy Nekopara, I guess. If you're a dweeb.","January 20, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know that's not a lot, but I want to make one thing abundantly clear about the genius design of this game.\n\n\nFirst, yes this is Double Dragon via Wayforward's goofy sense of humour. The moment you start the game up you are battered with screaming 80s nostalgia and Double Dragon injokes and a game which clearly refuses outright to take itself seriously. AND THIS IS IN NO WAY A BAD THING.\n\nLet's be honest, Double Dragon is a product of its time. It has no business being a modern remake. If Ubisoft or EA or whoever did this, it'd be trash. It'd be like Duke Nukem Forever. Highly anticipated, woefully disappointing and a slap in the face to our memories. Wayforward KNOW this. So they jacked the game up to 11. Neon is in no way just a fun catchword. It is the SOUL of this game. Everything from the music to the character designs to the one-liners and the first boss (and probably bosses beyond that!) SMACKS of 80s ethos and design. It's nostalgic in the best way: It reminds you of all that was great when you look at the past with those rose tinted glasses, AND pokes fun at how bloody ridiculous it all actually is. It makes you laugh at it and yourself and also warms your heart with the reminder of how things used to be, and the ACTUALLY FUN things about it too.\n\nThe second most important thing about this game's genius design is how SLUGGISH everything feels. I remember playing the Streets of Rage and Final Fight series and marvelling at how quick and responsive everything was. Moves fired off nearly immediately and combat was straightforward but detailed enough to be entertaining, especially as both series expanded.\n\nWhat struck me immediately upon playing this game was every movement has a lead-up time. Running, every attack, each attack feels slowed down and has a big tell, and more importantly, that it's GLOBAL. It affects EVERY character in the game, enemies included. Every attack still feels like it hits hard and has a lot of weight, mostly due to great sound design and the effects displayed, but everything was over the top and had huge tells to it. Then it struck me as to why this is a genius design decision. Because of the ducking/dodge mechanic, this means that you have time to counter-attack, time to know what's about to hit so you can react accordingly. Rather than it being a twitch-game, you actually get to think about how you're going to attack an opponent. You can learn their 'tells' and counter them effectively. It balances out the brutal difficulty with ACTUAL SKILL. You can no longer just face an enemy and hammer the attacks repeatedly and hope for the best. Now you can actually learn to dodge and counter opponents, stun them to lead up for throws which will topple other foes so they don't flank you, you learn new moves and special attacks which allow you to deal huge damage and counter other special attacks, weapons have their own unique abilities and are suitable in different situations...\n\nThese two points alone make Double Dragon Neon far more than just a cheeky, fun, silly remake, but turn it into a very well designed game IN ITS OWN RIGHT. If it wasn't Double Dragon, it would still be a fantastic sidescroller beat'em up. For this alone, despite the short amount of time I've played it, I recommend it.\n\nGreat fun, very much tongue-in-cheek, and if you are a child of the 80s the first boss will have you in stitches.","May 15, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few problems in the resolution department with multiple displays that do not share the same resolution. For instance, if your main display is like mine, and 1920x1080, with your old monitor as secondary and running 1680x1050 the game seems to only want to run @ the lower of the two. A few driver tweaks later and it's fine, but a better hook into DirectX would have been nice.\n\nGameplay:\nTotally awesome. It's everything you'd expect from a beat-em-up. Fluid control, keyboard support, and the XBox controller mapping is natural and fluid. Definitely a must-have for any user of Steam's Big Picture mode, and even if you don't, grab it anyway.\nGraphics:\nFor the style, it's perfect. You have detailed and stylized 2D backgrounds with 3D models and depth in the foreground. The art style blends these together perfectly.\nPrice:\n$10?? Great game, has replayability out-of-the-box, and for a measly ten bucks feels like a great value.\nHistorical ties:\nYes it is a reboot of the original Double Dragon on NES. No it is not a strict re-create, though SPOILER ALERT the story starts off when a baddie punches your girlfriend out and carries her off.\nTL;DR\nDecent game. Not perfect but possibly the best darn game in its genre available right now. For $10 (USD) it's very much worth it.

It brings new characters, stages, music, and moves to the brand new upbringing of the famous Jimmy and Billy duo.\n\nWith solid mechanics, an amazing soundtrack, and good enough visuals, this game is truly one of the most fun beat 'em ups I've played in years. I see many complaining about the control scheme, but I've finished the game with the keyboard and have faired perfectly fine. I've used a controller, but I genuinely prefer the usage of the keyboard as it feels more like a fight-stick/arcade stick.\n\nThe new mechanics such as the upgradeable mixtapes and super moves are interesting, but I went about half the game without using them until I saw them incredibly useful (and borderline game breaking) in the last few stages. They're fun, and provide a fresh take on the stagnant formula of side-scrolling fighters, but they don't quite feel like something I was looking for. The crouch and gleam ability rewards players for dodging last second and provides that risk-reward relationship, which I think is necessary for all action games. Crouch attacks are also a great option for ending (and sometimes starting) combos against walls.\n\nMusically the game is a masterpiece with the great Jake Kaufman composing this neo take on the 80s of past, providing parodies on famous names like the Beastie Boys and Rick Astley and also providing musical masterpieces like the second stage's BGM "Mango Tango"\n\nThe writing, for some reason, is absolute genius and parodies various 80s slang and terms with some really stupid saturday morning one liners. (For example, when you kill an enemy with the "Whip" weapon, your character may say "Release the Kraken!") The voice work is also fantastic with a parody of Masters of The Universe's very own Skeletor.\n\nVisually the game has FANTASTIC concept art and some pretty good character models for such a budget game. The visual style is so appealing and provides that sense of action and cartoon to perfection.\n\nTo be honest the only complaint I have for this game, and I've had this complaint with a lot of my favorite games, is that it needs more content aside from the meal given. Whether it be more playable characters or more stages, I do definitely think there needs to be more to this game... perhaps a sequel...?\n\nThis is an incredibly fun beat 'em up, and if you have a friend who's willing, you should definitely pick this up and spend a good hour or two knocking out this incredibly silly and fun game.","June 21, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Some of the same old problems are present - what seems like questionable hit detection in some spots, occasional frustratingly difficult jumps, etc. Maybe WayForward was just being slavishly devoted to the source material?\n\nSpeaking of which, the first couple of levels are straight nostalgia trips... and then things go off the rails. That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. Varied levels, persistent character progression, and a goofy sense of humor kept me coming back. I found it entertaining and well-executed.

I was not a huge fan of the Original Double Dragon. And it came out when I was the perfect age for it. With that being said, I do realize the role it played in video games at the time and how it stuck with my generation for our whole lives.\n\nI think this is a good redux. The music is great and really grasps the era when the game released. I like the fact that you can buy extra lives at shops. Its needed since the controls (much like the original) leave much to be desired. It drives me nuts that everywhere it should be responsive, its not. For example, running across the screen. Your character needs to squat, set and then run. Dumb. It would be fine if you only had to time the attack of 2-3 enemies. But thats usually not the case. And while you can time attacks for a couple of enemies, there are too many parts where it becomes too tiresome to just get pounded by low-level enemies. Can you jsut mash buttons? Sure. But then why bother having all the new features, attacks, special powers, etc? Its literally just suseful as eye-candy.\n\nWorth getting? Sure. The artwork is great and the soundtrack rules. Will it spark an unparalleled blast of nostalgia? Yep.\n\nWhats it worth? No more than $5. Get it on sale like I did","July 19, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that Aksys owns the Technos license, we can only pray and hope that Wayforward will be contracted out to do a proper continuance of Neon - Skullmageddon did vow to "antagonize" Bimmy and Jimmy again one day!\n\nOverall, the game itself kept the important classic feeling of DD while adding a new age touch of "mixtapes" (aka lvling up system) and natural difficulty progression and enjoyable post game grind. The story is simple but awesome - and I can't help at chuckle at parts of the dialogue. The ending credits is pure gold!\n\nI should also mention that the music is SPOT ON especially if you are a mega fan of the 80s like myself.

It's due to one reason, but it's an important one: it continuously crashes on a nvidia card every ten or so minutes (perhaps in combination with windows 10, but according to research, this is a common factor). Add in the fact that save points are only one per level (which isn't much even on a stable game) and you'll see how this is even more of an issue than normal.\n\nSo...nvidia owners should skip. The tragedy is that otherwise, it's a perfectly good, perhaps even great, beat 'em up.\n\nDD has quite a history, but while the genre didn't age well, this game certainly ticks all the boxes: easy to grasp concept, a decent number of moves and techniques, colorfull and fun environments...all you might want, really. There is a leveling system, but AFAICT, it's not very obstrusive. There's also money, but with stores being pretty much nowhere, it's not much of a thing.\nAt first glance, I was sceptical about the enemy variety: your standard thugs with cheesey lines and basic attacks. I can say that the variety both in looks and attack styles varies greatly per level.\nThe story is pretty much non-existant and filled with cheese and references to lots of nineties thropes. Then again, you don't play these games for that. And it's somewhat fun if you're into it.\nIt would've been an easy thumbs up if it ran stable. But at this stage, I can't even finish the last level because it's too long to hope to make it through without crashing. The fact that I keep re-trying says both the positive and the negative about the game quality.\nSo...beat 'em up fans without nvidia cards: get this. Those with those cards: do yer research prior to buying. Non-beat 'm up lovers...erm...if the trailers don't get you, this simply won't be your kind of game.","November 11, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't had this much fun in a side scrolling beat em' up in ages.  Now, for the muliplayer review:\n\nWhoever designed the co-op mode's connection system is an idiot of the highest order and I hope he or she has to suffer trying to play this hunk of garbage as Player 2 for eternity.  I bought the game for my friend even though I'm tight on cash right now since I'm moving, thinking it would be worth it.  Guess what?  It isn't.  All the fun I expected to have with my bro will probably never happen because I'm experiencing the worst lag I think I've ever experienced since I began PC gaming circa 1999.  Trying to revive him is a nightmare and he usually ends up dying because while trying to position myself over his corpse, I take three or four extra steps and end up elsewhere.  For a game series that has always relied on skill and timing and made you feel accomplished when you could get through the games with only one or two lives lost (or as is my personal case with Super Double Dragon IV for the SNES, zero lives lost - try it, it's fun!), this was a real downer.  Again, I recommend this game fully for its single player mode.  Great 80's feel, awesome music, and just the right amount of grinding to become powerful.... but if you happen to be reading this and you're planning on paying good money for the co-op mode, don't bother.

I will admit that it takes some getting used to, but once you do, you'll be that much more proud of all the crazy ♥♥♥♥ you can pull off just by paying attention.  For example, enemies have a tendency to swarm and aren't hesitant to use weapons frequently.  However, learning how to duck, roll, and counter will allow you to punish them quick and effortlessly.\n\nIt's a little different in comparison to most brawlers and yet it somehow manages to stay true to its roots while also being a ridiculous fun and funny over the top brofest.  Definitely recommended to play with a friend, but still damn fun solo.  And that soundtrack...oh, the glorious soundtrack...","December 31, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This may well be the game for you.\n\nI'm godfather to a 6-y/o boy. He loves games, and so do I, but there aren't that many games that we can play *together*. And there are fewer games still that hit that sweet spot. For example, he likes to play Metal Slug with me, but has trouble with the platforming elements (very minor in this game), and there generally isn't much I can do for him when we play, other than kill all the enemies quickly. The ideal game is one where I can help him out but he still feels like he's pulling his weight. And that's exactly where this game had us. With me playing just a little better than average, the two of us were able to finish the game together. You can share health and life points in fun but easy ways (in-game high-fives, he loves it). You can forgo taking any of the power-ups yourself. You can choose 1 special move (which you can then power up using in-game money, which is also shareable) and you can also choose 1 passive buff. In that way, you can find a combination that makes up for your kid's weaknesses. Give him extra health and defense, or an invulnerable spin kick. We had a lot of success with the combination of magic gambit (extra magic power) and the dragon swarm, which makes a giant dragon appear on the screen and hits all the enemies no matter what (but takes up a lot of magic power, hence the magic gambit) special. He loved doing this. We finished the game together on normal mode, and went a good distance into hard mode already.\n\nIf you want to have a good time playing with a young one that has a decent understanding of how different buttons consistently produce different actions, then this could be the game for you. I do recommend buying it during a sale, as I think it is worth closer to $7.5 than it is to $15. The pc version has crashed on me a few times during the final boss battle and ending scene, but that may have been caused by the latest nvidia driver, which was giving me some other problems as well. Seems resolved now.","May 27, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings new characters, stages, music, and moves to the brand new upbringing of the famous Jimmy and Billy duo.\n\nWith solid mechanics, an amazing soundtrack, and good enough visuals, this game is truly one of the most fun beat 'em ups I've played in years. I see many complaining about the control scheme, but I've finished the game with the keyboard and have faired perfectly fine. I've used a controller, but I genuinely prefer the usage of the keyboard as it feels more like a fight-stick/arcade stick.\n\nThe new mechanics such as the upgradeable mixtapes and super moves are interesting, but I went about half the game without using them until I saw them incredibly useful (and borderline game breaking) in the last few stages. They're fun, and provide a fresh take on the stagnant formula of side-scrolling fighters, but they don't quite feel like something I was looking for. The crouch and gleam ability rewards players for dodging last second and provides that risk-reward relationship, which I think is necessary for all action games. Crouch attacks are also a great option for ending (and sometimes starting) combos against walls.\n\nMusically the game is a masterpiece with the great Jake Kaufman composing this neo take on the 80s of past, providing parodies on famous names like the Beastie Boys and Rick Astley and also providing musical masterpieces like the second stage's BGM "Mango Tango"\n\nThe writing, for some reason, is absolute genius and parodies various 80s slang and terms with some really stupid saturday morning one liners. (For example, when you kill an enemy with the "Whip" weapon, your character may say "Release the Kraken!") The voice work is also fantastic with a parody of Masters of The Universe's very own Skeletor.\n\nVisually the game has FANTASTIC concept art and some pretty good character models for such a budget game. The visual style is so appealing and provides that sense of action and cartoon to perfection.\n\nTo be honest the only complaint I have for this game, and I've had this complaint with a lot of my favorite games, is that it needs more content aside from the meal given. Whether it be more playable characters or more stages, I do definitely think there needs to be more to this game... perhaps a sequel...?\n\nThis is an incredibly fun beat 'em up, and if you have a friend who's willing, you should definitely pick this up and spend a good hour or two knocking out this incredibly silly and fun game.","June 21, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The quality of the port, done by Abstraction Games, and published by Midnight City, is mixed at best and this will be the focus of my review. For a review of the story and gameplay, I recommend checking out other reviewers.\n\nFor one, I played the game primarily using the online multiplayer portion of the game. I can tell you that, having played the game on separate occasions and even perusing through the discussion boards here on Steam, that the port is plagued by constant crashes and progression breaks. One such example occurs during Mission 9, after Player 2 successfully completes the first area of the mission, the next area refused to load because Player 1 was dead. Crashes were commonplace and would trigger randomly throughout our playthrough. Much of my game time indicated on my account is just restarting the game over and attempting to reconnect to the host. The network code, at best, also doesn't hold up to current standards as it is prone to random lag and affects the frame rate dramatically at times. Publisher support has been little to none, which is sad because the game itself was solid on consoles.\n\nI highly recommend picking up the console versions over this one, unless you're planning to reverse engineer the game and spend time fixing the issues I've outlined for the community.","January 7","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few problems in the resolution department with multiple displays that do not share the same resolution. For instance, if your main display is like mine, and 1920x1080, with your old monitor as secondary and running 1680x1050 the game seems to only want to run @ the lower of the two. A few driver tweaks later and it's fine, but a better hook into DirectX would have been nice.\n\nGameplay:\nTotally awesome. It's everything you'd expect from a beat-em-up. Fluid control, keyboard support, and the XBox controller mapping is natural and fluid. Definitely a must-have for any user of Steam's Big Picture mode, and even if you don't, grab it anyway.\nGraphics:\nFor the style, it's perfect. You have detailed and stylized 2D backgrounds with 3D models and depth in the foreground. The art style blends these together perfectly.\nPrice:\n$10?? Great game, has replayability out-of-the-box, and for a measly ten bucks feels like a great value.\nHistorical ties:\nYes it is a reboot of the original Double Dragon on NES. No it is not a strict re-create, though SPOILER ALERT the story starts off when a baddie punches your girlfriend out and carries her off.\nTL;DR\nDecent game. Not perfect but possibly the best darn game in its genre available right now. For $10 (USD) it's very much worth it.

I also noticed that a friend on my list had this on their wishlist, so I bought it for them too.  I also asked a few others if they wanted a copy, so I got them that as well.  Anyhow, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and I feel it has the right balance of difficulty and skill ceiling, since it forces you to adapt to the game's mechanics early on, unless you wish to keep getting beaten on.  Plus the game has upgradable stance and technique "mixtapes," and these carry over in the New Game+, definitely increasing the game's replayability.  However, it is not without some issues, as I will detail below.\n\nI bought four copies of game, although it was on sale for a buck.  I want to say "Sorry WayForward!" but the game has two technical issues that make the game into a royal pain, and have never been addressed.  Typical of a "dump and forget" console-to-PC port.  One issue that's quite common is the game suffering from memory leaking, which in turn causes the game to stutter a lot as time goes on.  Since it is a 32-bit program, I've decided to use Large Address Aware and make it use more memory, should it start leaking again, and buy you some more time.  Alternatively, just exit the game and restart it, as inconvenient as it may be.\n\nThe second issue is that the game can and will randomly freeze at certain points of the game, in my personal experience it was in Stage 9, when the arrows were falling from the sky.  One fix people used was to open task manager as the game was running, and setting CPU affinity to only use one core.  I did this and encountered no freezing, though it could've also been a coincidence.\n\nI've also heard issues with the netcode/online multiplayer aspect, but I cannot comment on this since I have not played co-op with anyone yet.  And this game, while it supports keyboards, plays MUCH better with a controller, preferably an Xbox controller.\n\nAll in all, do I reccomend this game?  Well, considering these issues, I want to say "wait for a sale" since I can't guarantee what I did will also help others who may experience these issues.  But if the game had no issues, then this is easily worth the 10 bucks they are normally asking for it.","November 7, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrVariant/recommended/252350/","MrVariant","MrVariant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrVariant/","65 products in account","This game is fundamentally broken.  There is no easy mode which could have been good with checkpoints.  Furthermore, Wayforward has made broken games (without fixing, so we have to call them Way Backward) between level 3 crashing in this game and from what I heard, the final level in Ducktales (I got too disgusted by the enemy health to bother finishing that game). Onto the review of what actually works.\n\nThere is wasted potential in Double Dragon Neon. There are a lot of moves to unlock, but unfortunately, the interface is godawful.  There is no way anyone would know to press tab to shift between menus for customizing controls. For example, Space is jump and M is default for special moves (not explained in the horrible tutorial) whereas the other keyboard controls are on the left: Z-punch, X kick, Left Shift- dash, left ctrl to duck for dodging. I liked the music idea (of collecting cd's and hearing a song in that special moves/stances (stances are a customizable way for stat growth) menu by pressing T) though a soundtrack would have been nice to have in options.\n\nFurthermore, this game is Double Dragon 3 hard.  It was an accomplishment for me to make it past the 1st level.  However, it's because you have to master dodging. The risk/reward mechanic is kinda good but annoying to get past regular enemies sometimes, especially when enemies find themselves just outside your punching range, though kicks help fix that issue.  I felt it was nearly unplayable until I got the fireball in the 2nd level as these guys can take a beating and having to constantly gleam (dodge at the right time to get more attack) can be a chore if you prefer beat 'em ups where you can just button mash or rush enemies.\n\nNow at level 2 with the fireball, the game gets to be fun.  However, again they drop the ball by not allowing the stores to be accessible from the stage map. You have to visit the stores and buy extra lives and upgrade moves. I barely beat this level but it felt like I got a lot better.  Unfortunately, the game crashes at level 3 (on windows 10), making it a broken game only worth trying when it was on a $1 sale.","November 8, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's due to one reason, but it's an important one: it continuously crashes on a nvidia card every ten or so minutes (perhaps in combination with windows 10, but according to research, this is a common factor). Add in the fact that save points are only one per level (which isn't much even on a stable game) and you'll see how this is even more of an issue than normal.\n\nSo...nvidia owners should skip. The tragedy is that otherwise, it's a perfectly good, perhaps even great, beat 'em up.\n\nDD has quite a history, but while the genre didn't age well, this game certainly ticks all the boxes: easy to grasp concept, a decent number of moves and techniques, colorfull and fun environments...all you might want, really. There is a leveling system, but AFAICT, it's not very obstrusive. There's also money, but with stores being pretty much nowhere, it's not much of a thing.\nAt first glance, I was sceptical about the enemy variety: your standard thugs with cheesey lines and basic attacks. I can say that the variety both in looks and attack styles varies greatly per level.\nThe story is pretty much non-existant and filled with cheese and references to lots of nineties thropes. Then again, you don't play these games for that. And it's somewhat fun if you're into it.\nIt would've been an easy thumbs up if it ran stable. But at this stage, I can't even finish the last level because it's too long to hope to make it through without crashing. The fact that I keep re-trying says both the positive and the negative about the game quality.\nSo...beat 'em up fans without nvidia cards: get this. Those with those cards: do yer research prior to buying. Non-beat 'm up lovers...erm...if the trailers don't get you, this simply won't be your kind of game.","November 11, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, for the muliplayer review:\n\nWhoever designed the co-op mode's connection system is an idiot of the highest order and I hope he or she has to suffer trying to play this hunk of garbage as Player 2 for eternity.  I bought the game for my friend even though I'm tight on cash right now since I'm moving, thinking it would be worth it.  Guess what?  It isn't.  All the fun I expected to have with my bro will probably never happen because I'm experiencing the worst lag I think I've ever experienced since I began PC gaming circa 1999.  Trying to revive him is a nightmare and he usually ends up dying because while trying to position myself over his corpse, I take three or four extra steps and end up elsewhere.  For a game series that has always relied on skill and timing and made you feel accomplished when you could get through the games with only one or two lives lost (or as is my personal case with Super Double Dragon IV for the SNES, zero lives lost - try it, it's fun!), this was a real downer.  Again, I recommend this game fully for its single player mode.  Great 80's feel, awesome music, and just the right amount of grinding to become powerful.... but if you happen to be reading this and you're planning on paying good money for the co-op mode, don't bother.  Contrary to at least one article out there, the player 2 lag-a-thon has NOT been fixed.","September 20, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it's hard to compare this newest game with some of the classic beat'em up arcade versions (or even with the unique Streets of Rage), Neon surely has a charm of its own. As for the inevitable comparisons with the former games of the franchise, I'd just say that the OST from back then is still superior and despite the wacky story of this title, nothing can be as bad as Double Dragon 3. We've came across an annoying glitch during our gameplay, but overall we had a positive experience.

I remember playing in the arcade and loved it. When I seen they released the trilogy on Steam I picked it up to play with friends.  I just seen this version on there and though why not.  I am so glad I picked it up.  The graphics are done very nice, and the game stays true to its roots.  The gameplay is pretty much the same at the original with a few twists.  If you are side scroller fan that has never even played Double Dragon you will still most likely enjoy this.

This may well be the game for you.\n\nI'm godfather to a 6-y/o boy. He loves games, and so do I, but there aren't that many games that we can play *together*. And there are fewer games still that hit that sweet spot. For example, he likes to play Metal Slug with me, but has trouble with the platforming elements (very minor in this game), and there generally isn't much I can do for him when we play, other than kill all the enemies quickly. The ideal game is one where I can help him out but he still feels like he's pulling his weight. And that's exactly where this game had us. With me playing just a little better than average, the two of us were able to finish the game together. You can share health and life points in fun but easy ways (in-game high-fives, he loves it). You can forgo taking any of the power-ups yourself. You can choose 1 special move (which you can then power up using in-game money, which is also shareable) and you can also choose 1 passive buff. In that way, you can find a combination that makes up for your kid's weaknesses. Give him extra health and defense, or an invulnerable spin kick. We had a lot of success with the combination of magic gambit (extra magic power) and the dragon swarm, which makes a giant dragon appear on the screen and hits all the enemies no matter what (but takes up a lot of magic power, hence the magic gambit) special. He loved doing this. We finished the game together on normal mode, and went a good distance into hard mode already.\n\nIf you want to have a good time playing with a young one that has a decent understanding of how different buttons consistently produce different actions, then this could be the game for you. I do recommend buying it during a sale, as I think it is worth closer to $7.5 than it is to $15. The pc version has crashed on me a few times during the final boss battle and ending scene, but that may have been caused by the latest nvidia driver, which was giving me some other problems as well. Seems resolved now.","May 27, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not at all a button masher, which is something a lot of beat 'em ups unfortunately end up being.\nEvery move feels like it matters as you need to time your heavy attacks just right and dodge at the right time to increase your damage output.\nMashing the attack buttons will just get you killed quicker basically.\nSo the fighting mechanics are very welcomed as it feels very satisfying now that it's more difficult for all the right reasons... Well almost all.\nSee, this game also introduces very light RPG elements. You collect two types of music tapes: Special moves and Stances. The latter is what kinda rubs me the wrong way.\nIt undermines the importance of skill when fighting. If you have too few tapes of one stance, it's not worth it on the harder difficulties. Too many and it's a bit too easy.\nI like the tape collecting, but I wish that stances wasn't a thing. Or at least that they wouldn't increase or decrease stats with more tapes like like the special moves.\nIt's not that bad, but it's a slight annoyance when you realize that getting 10 more tapes for "Balance" made the harder difficulties much easier.\n\nIn conclusion: Awesome game which I think is the best in the series.

The quality of the port, done by Abstraction Games, and published by Midnight City, is mixed at best and this will be the focus of my review. For a review of the story and gameplay, I recommend checking out other reviewers.\n\nFor one, I played the game primarily using the online multiplayer portion of the game. I can tell you that, having played the game on separate occasions and even perusing through the discussion boards here on Steam, that the port is plagued by constant crashes and progression breaks. One such example occurs during Mission 9, after Player 2 successfully completes the first area of the mission, the next area refused to load because Player 1 was dead. Crashes were commonplace and would trigger randomly throughout our playthrough. Much of my game time indicated on my account is just restarting the game over and attempting to reconnect to the host. The network code, at best, also doesn't hold up to current standards as it is prone to random lag and affects the frame rate dramatically at times. Publisher support has been little to none, which is sad because the game itself was solid on consoles.\n\nI highly recommend picking up the console versions over this one, unless you're planning to reverse engineer the game and spend time fixing the issues I've outlined for the community.","January 7","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Double Dragon Neon is a reboot of the Double Dragon series.  It is artisically sound and the gameplay is a lot more larger than the older versions.  Never once did I feel that it wasn't a part of the franchise.  To me it felt like how a modern Double Dragon should be.  I give this a thumbs up for most everything involved from storyline to the 80s cinematic cheese they presented in with the neat little package of added features like songs(powerups) and the small variance on the classic Double Dragon arcade side-scrolling beat em' ups.  The negatives I noticed where small but do matter:  Multiplayer online seems to be a ghost town and I had to configure the .ini file to get the controller on player 1 working correctly.

It is a fun solid game as it starts for those first 5 levels...\n\nThe Negative: WHEN it freezes it does it so hard I had to restart my computer. You can't just shut off Steam or turn it off on the task bar, stream waits for the game to shut down (which it never does) before closing, and with the task bar option Steam keeps it running. This happened to me on levels 6, and 9, levels with falling arrows very much don't like it when the falling arrows hit something. The community has found a work around for this problem. You'll have to open your task manager and right click on the game > set affinity and set it to only run on 1 core, this should fix it. Thanks to the community, seeing how the dev team knew about this for quite a while with zero feedback on fixing it.\n\nRisk it if you want, it is a fun and solid game when it works, try applying the work around if you hit the freezing problem. You will have to do it after restarting the game but it might be the help you need.

The art style, music, and other elements are heavily inspired by the decade that brought us the original game.  One special move called the "Bro-Dozer" has a theme tune reminiscent of Kylie Minogue's cover of "The Locomotion".  The voice of the game's main villain closely resembles that of Skeletor from Filmation's animated MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE series.  The game even pokes fun at the concept of the "load-bearing boss".\n\nNostalgia aside, the game is fun, if a bit challenging.  Special moves and abilities can be acquired by collecting "mixtapes" (another nod to 80s music culture).  Collecting extras of a given tape increase the power of that special move/ability.  After several plays, you'll become powerful enough to beat the first boss and collect chunks of "Mithril", an ore that allows further upgrades of mixtape abilities.  This means that a little bit of backtracking and level grinding is needed to power up enough to survive the final battle.   Given the low price of the game and the humorous trip down memory lane it provides, it's worth a try.","January 30","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the Skullmagedon's song he sings in the end credits is actually a legit good song.

Which is long enough for this sort of game. By the end I was getting a bit sick of it.\n\nThe lag in the control is a huge annoyance aswell as the stun knock ups that become an even larger annoyance later on.\n\nRegardless its a solid game for a low price. A new beat em up game that takes heavy inspiration from the older ones and the style of the times. Its pretty alright. Not alright enough for me to play this game again, but one playthrough on normal was enjoyable enough. Would be better with friends as beat em ups always are but I still didn't get bored with this one. The vast majority of beat em ups I find to be extremely boring but this one kept me interested by adding content in as the game progressed and mixing things up, sometimes not for the better though.\n\nI liked it.","April 27","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My initial experience to the game was that it felt slow but what can you do? It's not exactly a traditional sprite based beat'em up with attack wind ups to make the attacks look smoother. Actually, the speed is appropriate for some of the gameplay mechanics to function properly (gleam).\n\nInitially, in the first difficulty setting you may not understand the game fully even with the in game tutorials. DDN encourages crouching an avoidable attack to gain attack bonuses so that you can take out enemies more efficiently. You'll undoubtedly acquire mixtapes from enemies to either have stat bonuses or a special attack that uses up meter. You'll get to have 2 tapes on max (one special attack and one stats booster).\n\nBy the time I reached the later difficulties my experience when playing the game was at its max. My character's stats were appropriate to the difficulty and the game became fair and less frustrating. It's up to you to get good at the game and enjoy its quirky 80's aesthetics. If anyone is further interested in the gameplay mechanics feel free to youtube Episode 24 of my "Beat'em up Dissection" videos.","May 10","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GENIUS!\n\nThe commentary made by the main villain as well as the enemies on screen are hilarious, such as "That's a plasma screen! those are expensive" really make this game something special, this is double dragon at it's FINEST!\n\nGameplay: 10/10 - Incredibly fun, even when grinding for tapes/money/mithril it still feels satisfying!\nGraphics: 10/10 - Very colourful and silky smooth, no framedrops whatsoever and the character designs are top notch! (RO-BRO! <3)\nMusic: 10/10 - It's called "Double Dragon Neon" what did you expect? outstanding soundtrack, it's like being in a nightclub back in '84 through the whole game.\nReplay value: 10/10 - Sweet so you beat the game, but did you beat it on all difficulties? with no magic? as Ro-bro? earning 50,000? no? then you better go back and do it!\n\nThis game got SO MANY THINGS RIGHT! and for the price you cannot complain! the only bad thing is it CAN crash on a Windows 10/Nvidia 900 series combo, but this can be reduced by patching it (Just look on Steam forums on how to fix it)\n\n10/10 - I've been waiting for a game like this for a VERY long time <3","June 4","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But everything else, not so much.\n\nA beat-em-up doesn't really need rpg elements, you just want to beat people up not wanting to upgrade skills all time. The combat also feels lackluster, grabs have no depth to them the original Double Dragon had more depth to the fighting. The counter move feels unnecessary, since it usually backfires getting punched by someone else instantly.\n\nThe humour feels forced, someone along the lines belong more in a Ninja Turtles game since the other Double Dragon games were dark in nature.\n\nOnline co-op doesn't work it's a laggy mess, fights feel more like your ice skating.\n\nYou can upgrade your skills, but after playing it once you won't feel like touching it again.\n\nMaybe for a $1 when it's on sale, if you're itching for a beat-em-up. Otherwise don't bother with this one.","June 5","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
