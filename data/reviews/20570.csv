"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/20570/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:\nWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II Chaos Rising, is the first expansion pack to the Dawn of War II RTS game by Relic Entertainment. Although it uses the basic principles laid out by Dawn of War II, it adds new and interesting mechanics to the formula which makes this expansion unique in itself.\n\nThe player takes the role of the 'Force Commander' from the original Dawn of War II along with his band of Space Marines. Here, one year after the Tyranid Invasion, the  capital planet of Aurelia, long lost in the Warp, has once again emerged. It is now up to the Blood Ravens to find out what vile things it has brought from the depths of the Chaos infested Warp.\n\nPROS:\n+ Old Formula with new Mechanics: - The expansion adds a 'Corruption' bar that measures how much your characters and soldiers are tainted by Chaos. The player will now have to be more careful on their actions since certain events carry consequences that may drastically alter the story.\n\n+ Carry Over Progress: - Rarely do I encounter a game that will allow a carry over of your save files with all (most) of your progress. Lucky for us, Chaos Rising is one such game.\n\n+ Fun new Toys: - Extended Skill Tree, New Wargear, new Squad Member(s), some new Maps (also a CON, see below), and an extended story to the Lore of the Blood Ravens will keep the players entertained as they develop new tactics and builds for their Space Marines.\n\n+ Squadmates Does not Die as easily: - This is just an observation on my part but it seems that the Squadmates of your Sergeants doesn’t die as often as they did on the original game. This is a huge bonus FOR ME, since I thought it was kinda 'wrong' that Space Marines died way to easily back in Dawn of War II.\n\nCONS:\n- Shameless Map Recycling: - Most of the maps from the original Dawn of War II game were heavily reused in this expansion where the devs just rotated the default camera angle 90 degrees and tried to pass  them off as new maps.\n\n- Uneven Voice / Sound Levels: - The OST was great as was the Voice Acting, but the speech sound levels were not properly leveled. Some voices play very loudly which hurts the ears, others play softly that it is drowned by the background music.\n\n- Too Short: - I found the campaign to short with fewer missions than the original game. Optional quest are a rarity which limits the possible enjoyment of Space Marine builds.\n\n- Heretics: - Filthy Chaos worshiping Heretics.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGOOD EXPANSION, I like this expansion and enjoyed playing its campaign. It has expanded the lore that surrounds the Blood Ravens Chapter by adding more mystery and intrigue to an already secretive Space Marine Chapter. The new Corruption Mechanic as well as the multitude of new Wargears and expanded skill tree shall keep the players entertained with new build possibilities and tactics.\n\nIt may be worth the full price for some people but seeing how short the Campaign was, I would rather have people buy it during a Sale. This is still a great game and should be bought at some point by people who liked the original Dawn of War II game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It adds another race (Chaos Space Marines) and another campaign. It takes place after the first campaign, in the aftermath of the Tyranid invasion. You are minding your own buisness when suddenly evil space marines show up and start killing everyone. It is your duty to stop it. Sounds fairly easy right?\n\nWrong.\n\nFighting against the forces of Chaos is no easy matter, and the campaign displays this perfectly. Different actions your strike-team does affects their mental status. Letting your allies die, failing to stop an invasion, and murdering your own people cause your troops to become corrupted. Become too corrupted, and you fall to Chaos, abandoning your former battle-brothers and embracing demonic power. You can also reduce corruption by helping out around the sector, but demon powers are cooler :)\n\nMultiplayer is basically the same, but with Chaos as a playabel faction. Overall, a very solid expansion. If you enjoyed Dow2, I would recommend the sequel.","March 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","41","46","5","0"

Both paths have their own perks that unlocks at certain intervals, and of course some gear can only be used by corrupted troopers, or ones pure in the eyes of the emperor.\n\nThis is a game for RTS fans, and even more so if you like Warhammer 40k.\nNeedless to say, I loved it.","April 20, 2015","true","26.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

Expect tougher and more cunning foes that requires better strategies and tactics to defeat. There's are new characters and a new enemy race to contend with. A new Corruption/Redemption system takes the stage towards Blood Ravens combat level advancement where the maximum level is increased to 30 from 20. The Strike Cruiser Armageddon is destroyed but the newer vessel, Retribution, will take you to view planets from its Bridge. Your squads may have special interests on certain missions. The unit customization has been improved upon, new skills and new Unique wargear written in Green, Blue, or Pink text are now added to the game. Wargear drops are random and dependent on your current level. GFWL has been removed and the game is now integrated into steam works.

No longer will you be fighting the same battles on the same maps over and over again. Now every single map is a unique entity, properly designed filled with story and gameplay triggers. Although this does mean the campaign is a good deal shorter than in Dawn of War 2 the trade-off is well worth it. Instead of getting only a couple of good missions and a ton of generic ones you now only get good quality missions. This also makes the storyline more condensed as you no longer have 5 generic missions in between every revelation and it keeps your interest up much more efficiently.\n\nThe campaign meta-game continues to use the RPG elements from Dawn of War but introduces a new one, corruption. As you play through the game you will find corrupted artifacts and face gameplay choices that result in your heroes slowly turning towards Chaos if you give in to temptation. Although this mechanic is not fully realized, you can't join the forces of chaos, it does give you some interesting choices along the way and a fairly significant storyline consequence towards the end of the game.\n\nPerhaps the most immediate impact of the corrupt mechanic is the various abilities your heroes can unlock as they give in the dark influences. Although many of the abilities feel like just filler a few of them are actually powerful enough that you might opt for corrupting one of your men just to grasp that power. The corrupted weapons work much the same way, some of them being immensely superior to their regular counterparts.\n\nIn terms of multi-player the situation is much as the same as in the main game, nothing has really changed except for the addition of a couple of new heroes in Last Stand. GFWL is still present as are the heavy duty matchmaking and connection issues.\n\nGraphically and sound-wise nothing has really changed either, the game still maintains a high quality in both albeit some of that might come from my infatuation with the general art and sound style of the WH40K universe.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it Chaos Rising is an expansion that improves significantly upon the main game and has taken several steps to correct mistakes made in the original. Although it is an expansion that focuses mostly on the single-player aspects of the game it still manages to feel like a total revival and come out looking superior in every way.","March 31","true","70.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Everything that was good about the wonderful original Dawn of War 2 is still here, along with a few tweaks, and the addition of the Chaos race.\n\nThis game's campaign, though admittedly rather short, was an amazing and engaging ride through and through. The corruption mechanic allows high replayability as there are several ways the campaign itself can go, and thus, several endings,  but also the missions are quite well crafted and varied. It ties in perfectly with the vanilla game's single player story as you guide the Blood Ravens into, or away from the allure of Chaos. And although Dawn of War II's campaign was interesting, it didn't wow me nearly as much as Chaos Rising's did, so much that I now strongly recommend playing both in order. Keeping your former squadmates is a nice touch, for continuity's sake.\n\nIt turned me into a fan of 40k. I want and crave more now.

The original Warhammer and Medieval: Total War are what pushed me down the deep rabbit hole of strategy games.\n\nIf you like intense, action-packed squad-based strategy games, then you will absolutely love this game. Warhammer (and Total War) are easily 2 of the granddaddies of real-time strategy.\n\nI have to admit, however, that I do prefer the original Warhammer more than the sequel because that one was not entirely squad-based - it was an RTS with building management like the Age of Empires series and Rise of Nations (make buildings to train units). In this game, you do not build any structures, you only need to worry about controlling your squad members.\n\nThe aesthetics are spectacular - lots of special effects and carnage. I love that your equipment is extremely varied and actually looks different when you change it with new loot you've acquired. The music and sounds are great and appropriate for the gritty theatre of war found in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.\n\nThe controls are not too difficult to pick up, however, if you want to be efficient then you need to become comfortable using hotkeys to maximize your micro-ing ability (you will need to rapidly use skills against your enemies and items to buff/heal you). The learning curve is moderate to difficult - you will have an advantage if you are familiar with RTS-games and/or the Warhammer franchise. If you are new, the tutorial mission is very good - and actually pretty fun even if you already know how to play.\n\nThe Warhammer 40,000 universe is massive, with so much lore coming from the books (much like Star Wars {before it all got retconned =( }), and the story is very good - it continues after your actions from the previous games (including expansions).\n\nYour characters level up throughout the game, and you can invest these points into different skills, unlocking abilities and perks at particular intervals. You can also outfit them with whatever (applicable) items you may find in your adventures. If you have lots of junk items, you can also trade them for experience, which is great for helping you level up faster.\n\nDuring gameplay, you will do a lot of micromanaging to keep your squad alive. You will also utilize cover, flanking, and many of the skills (ex: anti-personnel grenades, warcry offensive buff) to help you survive each level.\n\nIf you enjoy squad-based strategy games that offer a good challenge, give this game a try. You may also come to enjoy the expansions.\n\nDefinitely recommend.","July 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series.  Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.\n\nThe game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options.\n\nHas serveral multiplayer modes of play.  Adds Chaos Marine, Elves, and Tyranid avatars.\n\nChaos Rising is set one year after the events of Dawn of War II and the defeat of the Tyranid invasion (as well as the Eldar and Ork forces) of sub-sector Aurelia. The campaign marks the return of the Blood Raven heroes from the previous game, the Chaos Lord Eliphas from Dark Crusade, Derosa as the new governor of Meridian, and the heretical Vandis.\n\nNew to Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising is the Corruption System. In the campaign there are often multiple objectives which will complete a mission; depending on which one a player chooses to complete, they will become more or less corrupted.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Bo1Mgtuh4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ3lZDupjsg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XWwqtaFdzI\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-chaos-rising/pc-33018\n\nhttp://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/r2bu9f/warhammer-40-000--dawn-of-war-ii--chaos-rising-review\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War_II_%E2%80%93_Chaos_Rising","February 20","true","9.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Simply put, they are by far the best video game adaptation of the Warhammer 40,000 universe to date.\n\nIn diverging from the now stale traditional RTS game model, and integrating some elements from the RPG genre, Relic have created a masterpiece of strategy gaming. Fast paced but refined, it is a far better game than it's launch year competitor, Starcraft 2, simply down to the fact the design of its gameplay is over a decade more advanced in terms of evolution and innovation. By improving on the the original Dawn of War formula by blending its best elements and mechanics with those from Company of Heroes, Dawn of War 2 delivers an experience unlike any other on offer.\n\nWith DoW2, Relic once again demonstrate their repect for Games Workshops most popular setting, creating a 40K game with the love and care of the most dedicated tabletop fan. The story is the typical cheesy sci-fi goodness we've come to expect of 40K. The visuals are still incredible, and stand up very well compared with even new releases. Also, like always with Relic, the sound is flawless, drawing you completely into the setting and story with ease.\n\nBy design, DoW2 is more like three games rolled into one. The Campaign mode (which can also be played co-operatively), a PvP Multiplayer mode and a Co-op Multiplayer mode known as "The Last Stand". The three components are similar in feel, but differ slightly in terms of gameplay, offering a unique experience for each game mode. All three modes are extremely fun in their own right, and combined have provided me with months worth of entertainment.\n\nTo sum up, Dawn of War 2 (plus expansions) are some of the very best strategy games ever made, and if they even slightly peak your curiosity, you should buy them. Now. You won't regret it.\n\nFOR THE EMPEROR!","December 23, 2013","true","43.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's heresy not to play this game if you're into Warhammer (or it's heresy to play this game, if you're a Chaos player like me - whatever gets you to play it).\n\nThe core campaign was great, and the Chaos Rising expansion has added a lot to enrich it (while making one incredibly frustrating change to the way you resupply in battle). I haven't even touched the additional modes and I can say this is a great purchase for any WH40k fan, or for a lot of RTS players.\n\nOne caveat, though - you can buy Dawn of War II: Retribution and get all the content from the core and Chaos Rising, but I can't recommend it personally, as it won't run on my computer for some reason. There's been some funny business as these games are migrated from Games For Windows servers to Steam, and that's probably the problem, but as it is I only know Chaos Rising as a safe bet.","July 28, 2014","true","27.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

No longer will you be fighting the same battles on the same maps over and over again. Now every single map is a unique entity, properly designed filled with story and gameplay triggers. Although this does mean the campaign is a good deal shorter than in Dawn of War 2 the trade-off is well worth it. Instead of getting only a couple of good missions and a ton of generic ones you now only get good quality missions. This also makes the storyline more condensed as you no longer have 5 generic missions in between every revelation and it keeps your interest up much more efficiently.\n\nThe campaign meta-game continues to use the RPG elements from Dawn of War but introduces a new one, corruption. As you play through the game you will find corrupted artifacts and face gameplay choices that result in your heroes slowly turning towards Chaos if you give in to temptation. Although this mechanic is not fully realized, you can't join the forces of chaos, it does give you some interesting choices along the way and a fairly significant storyline consequence towards the end of the game.\n\nPerhaps the most immediate impact of the corrupt mechanic is the various abilities your heroes can unlock as they give in the dark influences. Although many of the abilities feel like just filler a few of them are actually powerful enough that you might opt for corrupting one of your men just to grasp that power. The corrupted weapons work much the same way, some of them being immensely superior to their regular counterparts.\n\nIn terms of multi-player the situation is much as the same as in the main game, nothing has really changed except for the addition of a couple of new heroes in Last Stand. GFWL is still present as are the heavy duty matchmaking and connection issues.\n\nGraphically and sound-wise nothing has really changed either, the game still maintains a high quality in both albeit some of that might come from my infatuation with the general art and sound style of the WH40K universe.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it Chaos Rising is an expansion that improves significantly upon the main game and has taken several steps to correct mistakes made in the original. Although it is an expansion that focuses mostly on the single-player aspects of the game it still manages to feel like a total revival and come out looking superior in every way.","November 16, 2012","true","323.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The campign picks up the story where the first ended, and this time it's chaos forces you are up against with your Blood Ravens squad.\n\nThere is an excellent corruption mechanism that really makes you fight chaos's corruption on a personal level - there are various sideobjectives that you can choose to do for usually a big item reward, for example choose to destroy the statue of a space marine hero. It also comes with corruption points, and those will slowly but surely take away your soul: your corrupting heroes and his fellow squad members will slowly lose their abilities (your saves carry over from vanilla DoW2 by the way!) and gather new demonic ones instead, along with their looks (chaos items have a corruption level requirement) and even their personality in conversations. Other side activities that are sometimes difficult, also come with corruption points - such as defending a temple the chaos forces want to destroy, and at the same time you are on a time limited objective in the other corner of the map. May you fail to defend the temple, your corruption level increases, so you are really fighting to stay pure and also constantly tempted by the power chaos offers. Because of this, there are 6 different ending to the campign that vary based on your corruption level, and the story can slightly change depending on which squad member of yours is the most pushed to the dark side.\n\nThe campign is way more linear, the endlessly generated sidemissions are also gone, the open maps are gone and you are usually given one or two way of approach, though your tactics with the added corruption changes add another layer to the already big pool of tactical and character build options. There is a new "support mage" type of hero joining you, the buffing fireball throwing Jorah. Personally I didn't like him at all, but it's always nice to have additional characters.\n\nFor multiplayer, you obviously get a new faction in the form of Chaos. Existing factions also got new units (free for all players who own DoW2 only and not this expansion), and obviously new maps with a new chaos hero for Last Stand.\n\nWHAT TO BUY CHAOS RISING FOR?\nIf you liked vanilla Dawn of War II's campign, this is a fantastic campign expansion for it definitly worth even full price. The corruption mechanism that lingers above every mission, every man, really makes you personally fight the temping chaos that offers great power, but costs yourself.\n\nWHAT NOT TO BUY CHAOS RISING FOR?\nMultiplayer and Last Stand. The game's multiplayer is entirely played in the last expansion, Retribution, and because vanilla DoW2 and Chaos Rising used Games for Windows Live ( it got removed years after relase, don't worry it's full steamworks title now, just like Retribution ), the multiplayer players are separated from each other (DoW+CR and Retri are the 2 groups). Also Retribution includes everything for multiplayer, including it's new faction, and Chaos aswell without the need to own Chaos Rising.","March 14","true","117.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played FPS games, and to a lesser extent third-person games, all my life and I never gave strategy games much of a chance because they did not suite me well. But the Dawn of War series appealed to me with its art work, story explanation, and user written reviews. I gave the series a good try and to say I'm 'just amazed' would not fully describe how much I enjoyed this! I find that because this is a standalone, you might want to purchase the original game first/along side this, but either way they both come with the co op game mode 'The Final Stand,' multiplayer (not very active), and an awesome campaign. I got to enjoy this and the original DoW 2 all day and all night during a free weekend. I fell in love with the game series <3 and planned on picking it up while on sale but I overslept after playing all night and missed it ;(\n\nv-v-v-__ (Rager's Review of DoW1 & DoW2 && DoW2: Chaos Rising) __-v-v-v\n( I wrote my reviews of DoW 1 // 2 // C.R. over the course of an hour, mostly nonstop typing. It may not be the best review of the series but it is an honest review and might convince you that the DoW series might be for you. Enjoy! )\n[[-_ DoW #1 _-]]\n-DoW1 is what you would think of a strategy game, meaning you build an HQ, barracks, generators, etc and then dominate your opponent (with the exception of some missions based on command one squad and infiltrate the enemy's territory)\n---The multiplayer was hardly alive, and I was unable to join a match the first and last attempt I made.\n[[-_ DoW #2 _-]]\n-DoW2's campaign is mostly command the Force Commander (the main character which you get to name) and 3 other squads and dominate the enemy orks, farseer, chaos, tyranid. Did I mention it is co op?\n---That isn't the only great part of #2 though! It also has a co op survival game mode called "The Final Stand" where you and 2 others work together to survive and progress through the increasingly difficult waves of enemy A.I. You get to choose your race and also level up each individually, earning new abilities, armor, and weapons. This game mode is still partially alive with players.\n[[-_ DoW #2 Chaos Rising (standalone sequel) _-]]\n- DoW2 Chaos Rising's campaign is based on an encounter with the Chaos Space Marines (for those who don't know; the Chaos S.M.s are "heretic rebels" to put it quickly). It was quite interesting but I did not make it very far into the story so I won't give it a full opinion. For me it was more appealing than the original DoW2's story because I had an experienced friend play co op with me.\n---A few features of Chaos Rising - Corruption meter (scroll to the bottom of the review for explanation), corrupted armor/gear useable by your corrupted space marine squads, and the same goes for those who go the way of purity\n---Chaos Rising is sometimes said to be dull or predictable; I cannot agree or deny this as I did not get too far into it\n----Thanks for reading/skimming through my review!! ;)\n-Chaos Rising - Purity vs. Corruption skill points\n---Purity; viewed as space marine devoted to his emperor; earned by completing the mission and no corrupted objectives\n( (10/10) - Would play all weekend long again (Except next time I'll remember to purchase it earlier!) )","September 30, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many wanted to keep the base-building elements of 1, even though they did not fit the 40K world at all. On the other hand, 1 became so perfect with the expansions and the patches that II was definitely a culture shock. The game is split sharply in two, with an isometric, squad-based action RPG in single player and a fast-paced RTS chess in multiplayer.\n\nOf those two personalities, the campaign was the weaker. The missions resembled one another much too much and posed very little challenge. Enemy squads could be taken out piecemeal before a slow, slow boss battle. The storyline and the Space Marine characters were interesting, however, and Chaos Rising completely fulfilled the promise of it's predecessor.\n\nIn single player, all the squads level up as you play, and since there are many more possibilities than resources in the skill trees, it pays to plan forward. You also get loot drops during and after missions, and choosing who uses what requires forethought as well. The actual combat is very intense indeed, with wave after wave breaking themselves on the Emperor's Chosen. You get to retry missions and keep the loot and XP, which is possibly too forgiving, but at least some missions have a turn deadline after which they fail. The campaign also has an interesting Corruption mechanic. The best gear is corrupted by Chaos, and using them or making certain other choices will take your heroes toward power and damnation, with boons and setbacks along the way.\n\nThe lore side of things is well-studied as always. If you find a powerful Heavy Bolter (a super-deadly machine gun, if you will), for example, it comes with a little lore blurb detailing how this master-crafted artifact ended the lives of hundreds of heretics and was then blessed by the priests of Terra. It is possible that lore professors are not happy but that is in their nature. The rest of us, whether it be ordinary 40K fans like me, or friends of good games in general, will enjoy Chaos Rising. Retribution perfected the multiplayer but those interested in a great single player experience should start here.","September 24, 2013","true","116.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though I personally find my own review adequate, certain individuals have brought to my attention the possible vagueness surrounding the review.\n\nI have constructed my edited review following a suggested format by a hard-core fan of mine. I understand my position of power makes my gaming decisions influential to those around me. I wholeheartedly apologize for the lack of depth in my original review - I hope my fans can accept my blunder and gain some insight from my revisions.\n\nGiven the number of repeated requests by an even larger number of dedicated fans, I introduce my more detailed review of Chaos Rising:\n\nGraphics: Wow. Where do I even begin? Let's just say that the graphics are exactly what you would expect from Dawn of War. I was absolutely thrilled that I was not let down. Sometimes when it is late at night and I've had a few glasses of wine, I sit there and ponder how the graphics of a game could be so epic. 10/10\n\nGameplay: If I've ever had an adrenaline rush in my life, this is where it's been experienced. The sheer excitement of the combat has truly knocked my socks off. The Force Commander is a Force to be reckoned with, hehe. Oh how I wish I could have his jet pack in my life. One can only dream. 10/10\n\nStory: From the first second of this expansion, I was glued to my seat and my fingers glued to my mouse/keyboard. Will I become corrupted? I still ask myself that very same question each time that I play. The plot is filled with twists and turns that give another meaning to the words revenge and betrayal. Every distress call I receive leads to a rapidly beating heart - this forces me to momentarily exit the game until I am able to overcome the overwhelming story. 10/10\n\nUI: The buttons look very button-y and things always happen when I click on them. I was sold from there. 10/10\n\nFun Level: I walk away from every Chaos Rising session thinking about how gratifying that last mission was. The only issue with the fun level in this game is it is so extraordinary that everything else in your life will pale in comparison. A wide circle of friends and acquaintances have attempted to bring as much excitement into my life by offering free sky-diving lessons or tours of Jelly Bean factories. I always have to explain to them that they should keep their parachutes and jelly beans to themselves - I am busy experiencing a game with endless happiness and pleasure. 10/10\n\n\nOverall Score: It was hella good. 10/10","June 19, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","5"

This is not a strict strategy game, its a MOBA+strategy, a hybrid. Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its real fun so for i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch  that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that. Its a minimized CoH 1 but its not Warhammer game. If yougonna play multiplayer DoW 2 Retribution then you MUST get Elite mod, if makes the game real good and balanced. The modding team even fixed bugs retail has. The single player sadly has no 4 player coop mode but 2 which is very bad. DoW 2 Retribution is poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont.

OK.\n\nIf you want more of the same campaign with the same characters as the original Dawn of War II game you should definitely give this add-on a try. However, there really isn't a lot else to this game except it lets you play as Chaos forces in the multiplayer modes and has multiple endings.\n\nThe single player campaign is nifty in that you can easily pick up your characters and their various customized skills and many of their items pretty much where the main campaign of Dawn of War 2 left off. On the downside though the final boss fight of this add-on's final mission is needlessly frustrating and very poorly designed. On the easiest difficulty, playing it twice I must admit I was unable to beat the game's final boss. The ending mission's boss fight is a LOT harder than any of the boss fights leading up to it (those I had absolutely no trouble with but fighting against Ulkair himself is ludicrously frustrating).\n\nPerhaps the signle best thing about this game is how the single player campaign also has several endings and which ending you get seems to depend heavily on how you did and what choices you made in most of the previous missions of the add-on leading right through to the ending. These endings range from your main character being executed to you and your squad being proclaimed heroes (an excellent variety of endings). These multiple endings and the manner in which you must arrive at them (through the decisions you make over the course of the entire add-on) are a very welcome change from how most games tend to work, and the manner in which this game executes its multiple-ending structure well done even when compared to many other games which do have multiple endings. Getting one ending versus another in Chaos Rising is not so simple or easy as deciding between flipping one switch after the final boss fight versus another (as was true in Deus Es: Human Revolution). in Chaos Rising, which ending you get depends on what objectives you fulfill or not and what items you choose to use and not all along the way, almost from beginning to end.\n\nAlthough the multiple-ending structure adds some potential replayability to this game, although the game itself, its story and which missions you have access to and what order they are arranged in is, for the most part, arranged in a fairly linear fashion and the frustrating final boss fight serves as a bit too much of a counterweight to this game's various strengths. Also, there are still no single-player campaigns which let you play as any force other than that of the Blood Ravens Space Marines from the original Dawn of War 2 and endings in the Warhammer 40K universe can be predictable due to the sheer implacability of the game's setting. Regardless of what you do, war is going to continue (and so sequels are going to happen) but this is true to the franchise.","January 12","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are able to import your save which is always a + in my opinion as you can carry over the xp, gear, and so on from the last game. There's also a corruption meter and depending on what you do you get more corrupt or less. To remain uncorrupted is hard and you gain no real benefits from it besides a good ending where as if you have become corrupted you gain many different special boons that help enforce your characters, but at what cost? It's game length however is quite short, but then again what do you expect when it's an expansion? If you have DoW2, I suggest getting this as your teams level cap is extended by 10 and you can bring over all your equipment, though your terminator armour is "damaged" until you get a tech to repair it.","April 27, 2013","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the things Dawn of War I (Escpecially soulstorm) had over other RTS games is the quantity of units. It had A LOT. This game however had less than the previous (even without expansions this game had less!). But units aren't everything...\n\nThe game did feature a new race not seen before, the Tyranids. They are quite interesting from my experience of the actual model game (They were quite easy to beat, that and they used the dreaded green dice of hell). However the new customisation of heroes is a nice touch and the graphics are amazing compared to Soulstorm so yeah. Get the game.\n\nIf you like RTS games involving squads and battles of aliens then get this game. If you like any of the Dawn of War games in the past, get this game. If you like apples get an apple. But overall I rate this a good game worth the money as well.\n\n7/10\n\nP.S.

Lets just say it'll mostly stay serious. Mostly)\nThe first expansion of Dawn of War 2, and continuing the story of Force Commander "Hairgel" and team, now as a new planet gets in, a new faction (for this game) joins the party and a new set of dilemmas get in.\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Campaign carrys over stuff from last time. YAY!\n+ As you fight the Traitor's the game pushes you to take a stance, stay pure to TEH EMPRAH or go traitor and fight Chaos with Chaos (and go rogue yourself. LONG STORY)\n+ New faction (well, new to this game of the setting. Nothing new otherwise), as the Chaos Sphess Merheens, lead by Tough as nails Plague Marines/Manipulative Sorcerers of Tzeetch/Psuedo-Araghast the Pillager (Master of Hounds, Lash of the Black Legion)\n\n+ Eliphas decided to do random stuff like (i dunno), take a WHOLE LEGION TRANSFER (to the Black legion, suffering from an incompetent leader called Abaddon, but hey, Araghast makes up for it, right?), succeed to a degree (ok not as much as SSSIIINNNDDDRRRIII!!! but still) and other antics.\n+Tarkus Betrayal will make you cry everytiem (mispelling intended). So does  Jonah	.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Final boss. Yeah, I know the Hive Tyrant from last time was too easy but this? Not cool, Relic, not Cool\n- Only 2 fun bosses, Araghast (yes, that's why he's popular. aside from the Large Ham) and the Traitor within (who is actually sympathetic). Everyone else is either too easy (2nd Avatar of Khaine) or unessecarily hard ( Ulkair	)\n\n- Still no Guard, yet.\n\nStill, fun game.

Then this game will not dissapoint you. With a well structured online system, campaign and horde mode this game is crafted perfectly by deveopers who care about the players and not just the money *Cough* EA!.\n\nAlong with the campagin and horde mode, it has the element of loot or geat, and also leveling up and choosing stats, to improve you squad and seperate charecters to make your gamplay suit you.

The story in DOW II was good, and Chaos Rising doesn't disappoint in that regard. The new chaos race is a blast to play as and the upgrades to the other races are very welcome. In the single player, 10 more levels and the corruption system add depth and more choices. So while the campaign is pretty freaking short, it's easily replayable. I guess the shortness of the campaign could be the only weakness in this package, but come on people, it's an expansion pack! A company with a more renowned name might have released something like this as a sequel. Accept it for what it is: an expansion pack. For half the price of a regular game, I say this is a good deal. If you liked Dawn of War II, you will love Chaos Rising!","November 28, 2013","true","52.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's also leveling and you add two stat points in any category each level.

Now certain weapons that you use or actions that you take will lead to increasing your character's alignment with Chaos, giving them new abilities in exchange for betraying their oath to the Emperor. This feeds into several different gameplay scenarios and multiple endings, based on how corrupt you are throughout the game. There are also new abilities (both passive and active) and a level cap of thirty when you carry over your characters from Dawn of War 2. Chaos Rising is a worthy expansion to its predecessor and if you loved DW2 then you'll see it as a welcome return to the Blood Ravens.","November 16, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this one, you get different types of supplies, rather than just a general ability refill, so tactical decisions are more challenging.

The Last Stand mode is also a fun survival-type mode that should keep you entertained for quite some time as you try out all the different heroes and level them up.\n\nI would also add that Dawn of War II is recommended if you buy this.

The boss battles are a test of patience and annoyance due to the ungodly amount of health that they get and the fact that hey will often ignore your tanks and go after the rest of your squad causeing a daisy chain of reviveals that ends in a unsatifying victory.

Dawn of War II is not as good as Dawn of War II: Retribution becuase in retribution you can choose who you play as and arent forced to play as the space marines even know the space marines are good, also in reribution you can call in reinforcments and troops to help you in the level. This game has a long story line and the multiplayer is really good with a lot of modes to play on line like last stand and you can play agiant computers in a battle or vs over players. the online communikty if nice and there is good sportsmanship. i dont not recommend this game if you arent this kinda person who likes games were you control a group of people around a map, this game is the same as Dawn of War II just with a diffrent story line and events\n\nOverall i rate this game, 8 out of 10 rubber chickens","January 19, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a gameplay that rewards smart play (though the same could be said about the old one), since in a small army every unit is important and the cover system allows you to use terrain to your advantage.  Each hero can be equipped with his own set of items, adding some variety to your play, just like each race special abilities.\nOverall, it's a good game, especially for those interested in w40k universe.

It has a gameplay that rewards smart play (though the same could be said about the old one), since in a small army every unit is important and the cover system allows you to use terrain to your advantage.  Each hero can be equipped with his own set of items, adding some variety to your play, just like each race special abilities.\nOverall, it's a good game, especially for those interested in w40k universe. Very different from Dawn of War 1 we all know and love, but still worth a try.","December 22, 2013","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a long story line and the multiplayer is really good with a lot of modes to play on line like last stand and you can play agiant computers in a battle or vs over players. the online communikty if nice and there is good sportsmanship. i dont not recommend this game if you arent this kinda person who likes games were you control a group of people around a map, this game is the same as Dawn of War II just with a diffrent story line and events\n\nOverall i rate this game, 8 out of 10 rubber chickens","January 19, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.\n\nLeroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?\n\nIt didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.\n\nBefore he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.\n\n----o0o----\n\nAs he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.\n\n'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.\n\n'...What's that smell?'\n\nLeroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.\n\nCiv 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.\n\nLeroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.\n\n----o0o----\n\nJust yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.\n\nAbout seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.\n\nLess than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(","May 15, 2014","true","76.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Loot fanatics wont be disappointed with all the choices in killing toys and armor at their disposal. They all compliment certain play styles which adds to the replay value immensely. Of course if your valiant heroes pick up an item off the battlefield corrupted by Chaos there will be a price to pay as the ingame meter shall start warning you of your descent to the..dark side for using such cursed weaponery and armor. All is not lost though for there are ways of resisting and purging the taint from your spirit.\n\nYour units feel even more alive and interactive with the CHAOS RISING expansion as they speak of what is going around you on and off the battlefield.\n\nThe forces of Chaos are truly terrifying and brutal in their entrance into the DAWN OF WAR 2 reality. Cultist are now fearsome in visual presence and vocal expression who are excellent frontline units that can take and deliever plenty of punishment.\n\nGraphics- The forces of Chaos look truly evil appearing as something out of a futuristic satanic inquisition. The Chaos Lord is like some great horned god of old. Cultist no longer seem demoralised masochastic slaves but instead show their strength in joyful slaughtering despoiling psychosis with a more serious side further enhanced by their much more powerful creepy body frames compared to the devious humorous but still fun demeanor of their counterparts in the original DAWN OF WAR.\n\nSound- I use headphones so for me the audio sounded very full and powerful. Combat effects are devastating with explosive effect and unit vocals bring out the heart inspiring heroic and mind searing horror of the forces at play in this gruesome world of unending carnage. Music is stunning and its because of games like RELIC's CHAOS RISING and BETHESDA's rpgs that my appreciation of classical music never fades but only grows stronger over time.\n\nWARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR II CHAOS RISING is a huge magically well done work full of top notch quality professional game design that delievers the goods in gameplay execution and graphical stimulation plus much much more. RELIC is also providing 200%+ support for their product already releasing one small hot fix patch for some reported crashing on some systems. I never had this problem but its great to see RELIC on target with keeping their work the best it can be. It was also great before CHAOS RISING for RELIC to include limited use of the forces of Chaos in the pre-release patch so fans could get a taste of the expansion without even owning it yet. Very nice there :)\n\nWARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR II CHAOS RISING buy it and ye shall know the unbound gaming joy which is RELIC!!!\n\n","June 5, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/recommended/20570/","hotax","WTF 3 finals 1 day PogChamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/","732 products in account","Chaos Rising continues the story of Dawn of War II. This time instead of the tyrannids the main enemy is the forces of chaos. The orks and eldar are present but they aren't really important at all. Two new locations are added; a frozen planet lost in the warp for one thousand years and a warp corrupted battle-barge. Corruption has made its way within the Blood Angels and it is up to you to find out who are the traitors. Unlike the original Dawn of War II, Chaos Rising's campaign actually features multiple endings and missions based on how corrupted the player's force commander and other squads are. Choices within missions and equiping chaos war gear will cause your squads to become more corrupted. However Corrupted wargear is much stronger than regular wargear and "redeeming" wargear (wargear that reduces corruption) is even worse than regular wargear. This actually makes trying to deal with corruption a very compelling game mechanic if you are trying to stay pure and loyal to the emperor. If you still have your save file for Dawn of War II you have the option to continue using it to keep your levels and gear in Chaos Rising.\n\nMultiplayer is pretty much dead but Retribution, the last expansion pack of Dawn of War II, still has an active multiplayer community.","November 19, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Compared to DOW II, it's as if Relic sold you an unfinished beta and then proceeded to sell you a full game.\n\nPROS\n1. Corruption System\nGreat idea. It melds very nicely into the game. Getting to choose who becomes corrupted is great, since they allow you to pick the highest corrupted member of the Blood Ravens as the traitor. I would have preferred a totally random one instead.\n\nIt lets you weigh the pros and cons of balancing super powers with the risk of corruption within.\n\n2. Less "Dhaka, Dhaka, Dhaka" missions\nDOW II sucked. It was just move to Point A, B, C. Kill everything there. Rinse, repeat. You captured shrines and astronomic arrays (telecom towers) for no real reason beyond achievement, intelligence and\n\nIn Chaos Rising, at least you have stealth missions where you avoid killing your fellow Blood Ravens, battles aboard the Judgement of Carrion where you gather gene-seed.\n\nThese examples make the game more immersive rather than the bland "shoot here, here and here and we're done" in DOW II.\n\n3. Choices\nI like how you can plan and choose. E.g. Like killing Captain Diomedes. I used an orbital bombardment to destroy the platform instead of killing the Captain.\n\n4. Predator Tank Combat\nVery, very good. Nice smooth movement. You reverse and turn nicely.\n\nNote : While I know that Relic Entertainment also did Company of Heroes 2, COH 2's tank movement was horrendous. To mimic World War 2 tanks in reality, they made tank movements slow, clunky and boring.\n\n5. Vox Chat in the Orbital Control\nI liked how you could talk to each character and get information. I liked how you could ignore some of the heroes and cause them to get corrupted.\n\nCONS\n1. Intelligence\nNot really useful. It should be default as such data can be gleaned from Google, thereby weakening its value.\n\n2. Bugs\nFew but annoying.\n\n3. Capture Points in Multiplayer\nVery dull. No narrative or objective. I would suggest using a minor benefit beyond the plain Requisition and Power. You have Shrines, Gates, Astronomic Arrays and Turret Generators. Why not make use of them to make it interesting?\n\na. Charging\nE.g. Captain Thule (Dreadnought) can't charge up a slope. He can walk up, but he can't charge up. He gets stuck at the bottom.\nE.g. Both the Force Commander and Captain Thule will charge right into a wall/friendly unit and freeze. It is most silly.\n\n3. Silly AI\nSame problem in DOW II. Melee units just stand around getting shot. Happens a lot with melee Force Commander and Captain Davian Thule.\n\n4. Vehicles\nSometimes, I find it quite odd that vehicles don't have good firepower. E.g. Lehman Russ Land Raider can't take down buildings. It only has a machine gun and flame throwers. For a large T3 unit costing over 600 requisition points, it can't take down buildings well.\n\n5. Logical Inconsistencies\na. Fighting only 1 side of the Planet\nYou only ever fight on one side of the planet. What about the other end? Or the North or South Pole?\nHow about underground? Do you ever see anyone fight only on one side?\n\nb. Land Battles only\nEveryone loves to fight on land for some reason. No water ever.\n\nc. Living Conditions\nThere's always enough oxygen to breathe with no viruses, there's always just enough gravity to walk like you're on Earth (Terra), everything just looks like home.\n\n6. Silly Powers\nTendrils for the Tyranids just break apart so easily. E.g. Carnifex could get stomp a tendril.\n\nSUGGESTION\n1. Random Traitor\nA random traitor would have made the game more interesting rather than allowing you to choose who the traitor is. Then the player would be on edge as he would never be able to trust his units. Making Captain Thule and the Force Commander immune to being the traitor spoils the whole traitor mechanic. The higher your corruption, the higher the probability that you are the traitor.\n\n2. More Hero Combinations\nMissing the Apothecary, Techmarine and Land Raider. It would have been interesting to play these heroes. I know that you can find them in the Multiplayer but it's odd that they can't be used in the campaign.\n\n3. Overlap Experience from Multiplayer with Last Stand\nLast Stand Experience will also unlock Multiplayer Experience and vice versa. This way you incentivise players when they play both games, instead of separate experiences.\n\n4. Last Stand Heroes into Multiplayer\nI believe it might be very interesting for the commander of the army to vary according to playstyle. Rather than the 3 standard Attacker, Defender and Support commanders, let the players decide how they want to play.\n\nDo they want a hero-centric army with an OP hero or do they prefer the power of the mass army ganging up on smaller sized armies? Do you like playing a Khorne strategy with big vlada-boom? Do you like Tzeentch instead, where speed, stealth and mobility are your trademarks? Or you do prefer Nurgle with a fortress like demeanour, capable of withstanding any siege? Or maybe it's Slaneesh, where you can stimulate your forces against overwhelming odds or demoralize your enemies with ease?\n\nDOW is not a competitive multiplayer strategy by far. So, why not make it fun to play?\n\nIt's also closer to the table top board game in this manner, where you balance a 2000 point army.\n\n4. Balance Issues\nIf you want, you could even add population cost to Wargear. In Chaos terms, that would be the equivalent of ritual sacrifice for better equipment from Khorne, Nurgle, Slaneesh or Tzeentch.\n\n5. 3 Buildings\nI think you need 3 different buildings in this game. 1 for T1, 1 for T2 and 1 for T3. Building all your units from one single building creates a major choke point. It makes sense that your production should double then triple. No need for 4 buildings.\n\nLets say your strategy is massing T1 units. Having the same production capability (of 1 unit factory) from start to T3 is just gravely against this strategy.\n\nAdditionally, you could even add in fancy animations for how each tiered unit is constructed or produced.\n\n6. Special Strategic Capture Points\nRelated to CON 3. In a multiplayer game, you could make capturing strategic points more interesting. E.g. You could capture an Astronomic Array that shows you where the enemy troops are.  A Gate that prevents the enemy from assaulting you directly, causing him to switch tactics to teleporters and jump jets. Shrines which gives you Blood  Points for your global abilities. Safe Points that let you reinforce units. Forges that doubles your production speed.\n\nRather than a boring circle on the floor, it makes sense that you would capture a point for strategic reasons. In reality, no one would take a point that has little or no strategic value. You shouldn't need to specifically click on the circle too, just standing within the vicinity of the strategic point should be enough.\n\nLook at it this way, it is part of the Warhammer Lore, it accelerates the game and it makes it more logical and real.\n\n7. Tactical Grass\nI enjoyed the campaign where you had to kill the Lictor Alpha hiding in the grass. A thought came to me where you could implement strategic grass into the game. I am thinking of the same type of grass in the MOBA League of Legends, where units instantly become invisible/inflitrated when they run into foliage.\n\n8. Tactical Woods / Swamp\nTo differentiate between the benefits of infantry and vehicles. I thought of creating wooded terrain or swamps where only infantry could enter and shoot from. Vehicles can't move through.\n\nThis way vehicles could be buffed up (they don't seem to be very explosive, no impact) as they are restricted from moving in certain terrain.\n\nRefer to a game called Etherium for more details.\n\n9. Weather Conditions\nI know that other Relic Entertainment games have weather effects. It would be nice to have some weather effects in the Dawn of War series.\n\n10. Envisioning DOW III\nI think DOW III would be like","October 8, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They kept everything that was good about the previous game, with some fixes to solve other problems.\n\n1) DoW2 encouraged you to keep the same party: Not here. Refusing to take some units to some missions will make them corrupted by Chaos.\n\n2) DoW2 wasn't very balanced: Sometimes, some weapons were simply better. Why bring a Missile Launcher when Thaddeus and a Thunder Hammer set-up will do it faster, quicker and safer? In this game, nearly every choice is equally good.\n\n3) Equipment was easy to sort in DoW2: Not so here. There tends to be a lot of equipment which requires a lot from you. A weapon may be much, much stronger than other weapons, but will corrupt you. Only a little bit at a time, so do you risk it for a mission or two? Other weapons will be unable to be used unless you're completely uncorrupted.\n\nThere are a lot of other good points, but if you like RTS, play this.","June 12, 2012","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you played DoWII, you have played this game.\n\nDO NOT think that this downplays your enjoyment experience! Everything that was amazing and fulfilling about DoWII is back, along with new strategic concepts, abilities, gear, a new stat to keep track of and perhaps earn new abilities from, and even a new character.  Your courruption (said new stat) also adds a new dyanamic of difficulty to planning in the game, as certain actions, gear, objectives, and even who you bring along on a mission will affect your corruption level.\nWill you be the uberbad guy for extra power, or stay loyal to the emperor? Both offer their own added challenges, especially since Corruption becomes harder to earn as you become more corrupt.\nCare to not be corrupt anymore? You can cleanse yourself, but the road to redemption is not an easy one. Redeeming gear makes you take more damage. Redeeming tasks will often make you hate life as you run off to complete them while facing an entire legion of armor.\n\nThe campaign is more of the same AWESOME. The abilities are more of the same AWESOME. Same said for characters, stories, and planning. You can make your squad into almost any focus, and you can do so CO-OP.\n\nIf you do not have this game, and you are on my friends list, BUY IT or I will disown you. If you do not know me, but you LOVE RTS games, Starcraft RPG maps, or anything that makes you think on your feet, GET THIS GAME. If you like MOBAs, GET THIS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/20570/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","Chaos Rising is much better than DOW II. Compared to DOW II, it's as if Relic sold you an unfinished beta and then proceeded to sell you a full game.\n\nPROS\n1. Corruption System\nGreat idea. It melds very nicely into the game. Getting to choose who becomes corrupted is great, since they allow you to pick the highest corrupted member of the Blood Ravens as the traitor. I would have preferred a totally random one instead.\n\nIt lets you weigh the pros and cons of balancing super powers with the risk of corruption within.\n\n2. Less "Dhaka, Dhaka, Dhaka" missions\nDOW II sucked. It was just move to Point A, B, C. Kill everything there. Rinse, repeat. You captured shrines and astronomic arrays (telecom towers) for no real reason beyond achievement, intelligence and\n\nIn Chaos Rising, at least you have stealth missions where you avoid killing your fellow Blood Ravens, battles aboard the Judgement of Carrion where you gather gene-seed.\n\nThese examples make the game more immersive rather than the bland "shoot here, here and here and we're done" in DOW II.\n\n3. Choices\nI like how you can plan and choose. E.g. Like killing Captain Diomedes. I used an orbital bombardment to destroy the platform instead of killing the Captain.\n\n4. Predator Tank Combat\nVery, very good. Nice smooth movement. You reverse and turn nicely.\n\nNote : While I know that Relic Entertainment also did Company of Heroes 2, COH 2's tank movement was horrendous. To mimic World War 2 tanks in reality, they made tank movements slow, clunky and boring.\n\n5. Vox Chat in the Orbital Control\nI liked how you could talk to each character and get information. I liked how you could ignore some of the heroes and cause them to get corrupted.\n\nCONS\n1. Intelligence\nNot really useful. It should be default as such data can be gleaned from Google, thereby weakening its value.\n\n2. Bugs\nFew but annoying.\n\n3. Capture Points in Multiplayer\nVery dull. No narrative or objective. I would suggest using a minor benefit beyond the plain Requisition and Power. You have Shrines, Gates, Astronomic Arrays and Turret Generators. Why not make use of them to make it interesting?\n\na. Charging\nE.g. Captain Thule (Dreadnought) can't charge up a slope. He can walk up, but he can't charge up. He gets stuck at the bottom.\nE.g. Both the Force Commander and Captain Thule will charge right into a wall/friendly unit and freeze. It is most silly.\n\n3. Silly AI\nSame problem in DOW II. Melee units just stand around getting shot. Happens a lot with melee Force Commander and Captain Davian Thule.\n\n4. Vehicles\nSometimes, I find it quite odd that vehicles don't have good firepower. E.g. Lehman Russ Land Raider can't take down buildings. It only has a machine gun and flame throwers. For a large T3 unit costing over 600 requisition points, it can't take down buildings well.\n\n5. Logical Inconsistencies\na. Fighting only 1 side of the Planet\nYou only ever fight on one side of the planet. What about the other end? Or the North or South Pole?\nHow about underground? Do you ever see anyone fight only on one side?\n\nb. Land Battles only\nEveryone loves to fight on land for some reason. No water ever.\n\nc. Living Conditions\nThere's always enough oxygen to breathe with no viruses, there's always just enough gravity to walk like you're on Earth (Terra), everything just looks like home.\n\n6. Silly Powers\nTendrils for the Tyranids just break apart so easily. E.g. Carnifex could get stomp a tendril.\n\nSUGGESTION\n1. Random Traitor\nA random traitor would have made the game more interesting rather than allowing you to choose who the traitor is. Then the player would be on edge as he would never be able to trust his units. Making Captain Thule and the Force Commander immune to being the traitor spoils the whole traitor mechanic. The higher your corruption, the higher the probability that you are the traitor.\n\n2. More Hero Combinations\nMissing the Apothecary, Techmarine and Land Raider. It would have been interesting to play these heroes. I know that you can find them in the Multiplayer but it's odd that they can't be used in the campaign.\n\n3. Overlap Experience from Multiplayer with Last Stand\nLast Stand Experience will also unlock Multiplayer Experience and vice versa. This way you incentivise players when they play both games, instead of separate experiences.\n\n4. Last Stand Heroes into Multiplayer\nI believe it might be very interesting for the commander of the army to vary according to playstyle. Rather than the 3 standard Attacker, Defender and Support commanders, let the players decide how they want to play.\n\nDo they want a hero-centric army with an OP hero or do they prefer the power of the mass army ganging up on smaller sized armies? Do you like playing a Khorne strategy with big vlada-boom? Do you like Tzeentch instead, where speed, stealth and mobility are your trademarks? Or you do prefer Nurgle with a fortress like demeanour, capable of withstanding any siege? Or maybe it's Slaneesh, where you can stimulate your forces against overwhelming odds or demoralize your enemies with ease?\n\nDOW is not a competitive multiplayer strategy by far. So, why not make it fun to play?\n\nIt's also closer to the table top board game in this manner, where you balance a 2000 point army.\n\n4. Balance Issues\nIf you want, you could even add population cost to Wargear. In Chaos terms, that would be the equivalent of ritual sacrifice for better equipment from Khorne, Nurgle, Slaneesh or Tzeentch.\n\n5. 3 Buildings\nI think you need 3 different buildings in this game. 1 for T1, 1 for T2 and 1 for T3. Building all your units from one single building creates a major choke point. It makes sense that your production should double then triple. No need for 4 buildings.\n\nLets say your strategy is massing T1 units. Having the same production capability (of 1 unit factory) from start to T3 is just gravely against this strategy.\n\nAdditionally, you could even add in fancy animations for how each tiered unit is constructed or produced.\n\n6. Special Strategic Capture Points\nRelated to CON 3. In a multiplayer game, you could make capturing strategic points more interesting. E.g. You could capture an Astronomic Array that shows you where the enemy troops are.  A Gate that prevents the enemy from assaulting you directly, causing him to switch tactics to teleporters and jump jets. Shrines which gives you Blood  Points for your global abilities. Safe Points that let you reinforce units. Forges that doubles your production speed.\n\nRather than a boring circle on the floor, it makes sense that you would capture a point for strategic reasons. In reality, no one would take a point that has little or no strategic value. You shouldn't need to specifically click on the circle too, just standing within the vicinity of the strategic point should be enough.\n\nLook at it this way, it is part of the Warhammer Lore, it accelerates the game and it makes it more logical and real.\n\n7. Tactical Grass\nI enjoyed the campaign where you had to kill the Lictor Alpha hiding in the grass. A thought came to me where you could implement strategic grass into the game. I am thinking of the same type of grass in the MOBA League of Legends, where units instantly become invisible/inflitrated when they run into foliage.\n\n8. Tactical Woods / Swamp\nTo differentiate between the benefits of infantry and vehicles. I thought of creating wooded terrain or swamps where only infantry could enter and shoot from. Vehicles can't move through.\n\nThis way vehicles could be buffed up (they don't seem to be very explosive, no impact) as they are restricted from moving in certain terrain.\n\nRefer to a game called Etherium for more details.\n\n9. Weather Conditions\nI know that other Relic Entertainment games have weather effects. It would be nice to have some weather effects in the Dawn of War series.\n\n10.

They kept everything that was good about the previous game, with some fixes to solve other problems.\n\n1) DoW2 encouraged you to keep the same party: Not here. Refusing to take some units to some missions will make them corrupted by Chaos.\n\n2) DoW2 wasn't very balanced: Sometimes, some weapons were simply better. Why bring a Missile Launcher when Thaddeus and a Thunder Hammer set-up will do it faster, quicker and safer? In this game, nearly every choice is equally good.\n\n3) Equipment was easy to sort in DoW2: Not so here. There tends to be a lot of equipment which requires a lot from you. A weapon may be much, much stronger than other weapons, but will corrupt you. Only a little bit at a time, so do you risk it for a mission or two? Other weapons will be unable to be used unless you're completely uncorrupted.\n\nThere are a lot of other good points, but if you like RTS, play this.","June 12, 2012","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is a ton of fun, with lots of loot to collect and abilities to unlock. You’ll want to tackle multiple playthroughs to try out different character builds. Deliciously campy and fun voice acting abounds. The multiplayer is terrific as well, plus the recent removal of the much hated Games For Windows Live makes it all the sweeter.\n\nGet the whole franchise package when it goes on cheap.

The new campaign is challenging and introduces the corruption mechanic which adds an interesting dimension to character and gear management. The story is a solid continuation of the original, involving new characters and exploring the 40k universe in more depth. As an added bonus, a second co-op option is added in Last Stand, which justified it's own independant release and pits 3 players against waves of 40k enemies horde-style.\n\nI would recommend buying and playing DoW II first instead of going standalone since you can carry over your squad and all the gear they earned, but either way if you enjoy one you are almost guaranteed to enjoy the other.","October 26, 2015","true","75.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chaos as a main enemy faction is a central feature here, which gives more variety to the battles you may have enjoyed in the original. Missions are more story-driven this time around, and they have added broader unit selection (Vehicles, Dreadnaught, Psyker) which changes things up. New "Corruption" dynamic in the game -- where there are minor advantages to staying clean, but quick and pronounced gear and character improvements if you are willing to give chaos purchase on your soul -- which adds meaningful change to the storyline and can have effect on the outcome. Several missions are much harder than I remember the original being. All in all, good purchase -- though I still advise buying the entire franchise during a sale, as the price-point by title is pretty high...

I have also DoW2: Retribution and if i may compare the two, even if it's the same game but Chaos Rising is an expansion, Chaos Rising has a waaaay better campaign than Retribution. The main reason: It's engaging. You get to really control if either your guys become good or evil by equiping them good or evil items. There's that sort of good/bad bar telling you where they stand kind of, which i think is pretty neat, it brings something more than just killing and defending or whatever.\n\nAnd if you're not into campaigns, well you can play online multiplayer but you'll be stuck with one and only faction, the  Chaos dudes obviously... There, to me is a lack of content for that kind of price, or the price back in the day when i bought it.\n\nAll in all, it may not be entirely my type of game or not entirely my type of RTS but it's still a pretty fun game, especially the campaign.\n","April 25","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/20570/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Dawn of War II was a nice surprise. Breaking away from the regular mold of RTS games to create something more action oriented was a bold move that paid off. The campaign had a lot of hectic moments and offered some interesting RPG elements to help build a sense of progression throughout it's missions.\n\nChaos Rising takes that RPG-lite system a step further and introduces some branching paths to the games various missions. Doing certain objectives (or failing to do them) may "corrupt" your squad, which can unlock more Chaos oriented abilities. You also have the reverse, which is Redemption points. It brings a further level of depth to how you can tackle missions, as well as introducing slight alterations to the story based on your choices.\n\nThe story is also dramatically improved over what the base game had. It deals with the uprising of the Chaos Space Marines and how one of your own may be a traitor. While you can't directly fail a mission, some of the scenarios are out of your control, in terms of victory. You fight unending odds and need to retreat, which ramps up the tension quite a bit.\n\nIt all ends with a twist that you shape based on your choices, but it's never directly stated how that works. It makes for a far more realistic take on the morality systems usually in place of RPG systems. Losing one of your finest squadmates to Chaos can be a devastating blow and knowing you could have prevented it makes it more agonizing.\n\nAs far as the general gameplay goes, there aren't really any new additions (aside from Corruption/Redemption). Everything functions the same and you still can collect gear to improve your squads. You have a new Hero in the form of The Librarian. He acts has a healer and a ranged caster, which can help tremendously in the more closed off environments in the campaign.\n\nThere are some missions reminiscent of the atmosphere that the Alien films made famous. You will be traversing through derelict vessels looking for Bio-samples and other materials. Ambushes are frequent and your squad is often outnumbered, so a strong emphasis is put on tactical manuevers more so than brute force.\n\nThe campaign is about half the length of the main game, which is a plus and a negative. While the main game became a bit repetitive towards the end, Chaos Rising seems to teter between being excellent and being bland. While the Corruption/Redemption mechanic does allow for different approaches to certain objectives, they almost always culminate in a boss battle.\n\nThe general difficulty is also much higher than the main game. It makes for certain missions that feel a bit cheap, as you often just don't have the manpower to overcome the odds. Since you can't build units on the fly, you're often forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements. It makes some missions take upwards of 30 minutes to complete, which just drags out the pacing.\n\nOverall, I think the campaign is better, but it does have more problems. It's not a bad attempt at expanding the groundwork set in Dawn of War II, but more could have been done to keep the consistency of quality at a high level. Still, more of the same would have been sufficient, so I admire Relic for attempting to mix things up.\n\nAs I said in my review for the base game, the multiplayer is practically non-existent. I believe that is more down to the second expansion, Retribution, being the first Dawn of War II title on Steamworks. Chaos Rising and the base game were added to Steamworks only 2 years ago, but that was 3 years after Retribution released.\n\nWhile I couldn't find any games for co-op or competitive, the functionality is present. That means the co-op campaign is an option for people who want to bring a friend along. It would probably mitigate some of the difficulty concerns I had, but it would also be cool to tinker with the morality system with a buddy.\n\nRegardless, I would call this expansion unessential. It isn't bad, but it's mostly for the more hardcore of fans. Dawn of War II provides basically everything this game has, save for the Chaos Space Marines. If you really want, you could just get Retribution, which includes a campaign for every race.\n\nYou could do much worse, though.\n\n7.5/10","April 16","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When this game came out I shoehorned a GT 8800 into an Emachine (which necessitated a new PSU, which lead to fresh RAM; which spiraled me down the dark path of building gaming rigs from the ground up).\n\nStill don't regret a red cent or a single moment spent on DoW 2 (entire franchise really). This game is a blast, a visible landmark in the evolution between RTS's and MOBA's.\n\nMany are polarized between DoW's contemporary RTS'ishness and DoW 2's smaller scale and squad based focus, but I have room in mah heart for both *doe-eyes* One tip would be: break out of your comfort zone on the campaign; beat the game, then replay it (on hard), using wargear and loadouts you normalled wouldn't, it's interesting and worth it.","May 30","true","187.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both games will share the same campaign and Last Stand levels, but multiplayer stats and achievements will be different.\n\n\n\nAbout The Last Stand\nBought this DLC a long time ago, because I was excited whenever I was watching the others playing the Sorcerer in The Last Stand.\n\nAnd I'm not disappointed, at all. I'm litteraly bursting every loyalists in my path in the name of the Dark Gods, and I love it.\n\nAbout the campaign\nYou have 2 ways to start a Chaos Rising campaign : either use the "New campaign" button to create a predefined lvl 18 Force Commander, or load the Dawn of War II finished campaign to keep some of your wargears and your hero levels. You can now reach level 30 (in the Dawn of War II campaign, max level was 20), and thus new hero skills have been added too.\n\nBut the campaign itself is really short. You can easily finish it in a day, as there's only about 15 missions or so, even if you do the few optional ones (whilst in the original Dawn of War II campaign, at the pretty end, you were flooded with optional missions). By the time your characters reach level 30, you're more than likely about to win the campaign already.\n\nNOTE : Davian Thule can now interact (thus he can revive downed heros) !\n\nTo summarize\nIf you want to buy this DLC, I suggest to buy it only for the 2 extra heros you can take on The Last Stand (Hive Tyrant and Chaos Sorcerer).","February 15","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
