For example:\n\nYou recover HP by moving around. Okay, that's pretty standard. But every monster moves exactly as fast as you, and they do not recover HP. So you can beat every single monster in the game by running in circles while they fruitlessly chase after you, chipping away at their HP when it's safe. This is unbearably tedious, but it's the "correct" way to play, especially since the game has no qualms with guaranteed boss monsters that two-shot you on the first floor.\n\nBetter games solve this problem (that, again, was established twenty years ago) through a variety of methods. Monsters that are faster than you, monsters that heal when you walk as well, wandering monsters that can show up and block your path, etc. Quest of Dungeons' developer has made a technically competent game, but he is a very poor designer.\n\nPro Tips for aspiring roguelike developers: read this, the design philosophy of the best roguelike out there. http://crawl.develz.org/other/manual.html#n-philosophy-pas-de-faq . I'm not saying every game has to be exactly like Crawl, but for the parts of yours that are different, you should be able to explain why you chose to make them that way.\n\nAnyway, that was a huge tangent for a very mediocre game. To sum it up: don't buy it.","December 9, 2014","false","2.3"," 215 of 299 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","215","299","12","8"

Whoever made this game didn't get that it was supposed to be a joke.\n\nPlay as one of four pre-defined stereotypes with no real character customization in a series of square rooms where you can either spam the ranged attack button (if a ranged attacker) or just ram directly into enemies until they all die.\n\nThen, once the orcs are dead, you get to run over anything in the room while spamming the "pick up" button, and occasionally run all the way back to a shopkeeper to empty out your pockets so you can carry more random crap.\n\nThis game's version of pies are largely uninspired.  You have potions, "food" that are potions in disguise, armor and weapons that just straight give +damage or -damage with very few exceptions, and you'll largely be fighting enemies on floor 5 the exact same way as you did on floor 1.  In fact, you'll probably be fighting the SAME ENEMIES, too, since this game palette swaps all the enemies.\n\nThanks to a lack of enough mana potions, if you play the mage, you'll be treated to a basic attack spell that takes 5 MP, enemies that take several bolts to kill, and needing to waste a dozen turns to get 2 MP back.  Enjoy the tactical depth of running in circles or smashing the wait turn button for hours to get your MP back after clearing a cramped room.  Since there's no hunger mechanics, you can waste infinite time, and are directly rewarded for doing so, with only the toll upon your own patience as a disincentive.\n\nBosses may be tougher than you, but thanks to the I-take-a-turn-you-take-a-turn nature of the game, you can simply walk away from bosses to prolong combat as long as necessary for your passive regen to put you back up to full health while the bosses have no regeneration.  As a bonus, "poison" type effects keep working, so getting a single lucky fireball to start tapping away 3% health per turn and then kiting the boss across the whole dungeon is easy-peasy boss cheesing.\n\nBeyond that, everything in this game is either scenery or a target for vandalism.  It tries to add "humor" by having random quotes put out there like Dungeons of Dredmor did, but honestly, that just reminds me of how Dungeons of Dredmor is a much, much better game than this.  The "jokes" are even mostly recycled, and I can't even be bothered to stop to read them, after a while, much like I can't be bothered to stop to pick up the bajillion coins that fall out of the hundredth palette swapped rat I just barbecued with my thousandth fireball.\n\nProcedural content is only as interesting as the effort put into making each area actually feel different.  This game is just the same room copy-pasted every single time.  Kick in door, kill orc, take pie.  Kick in next door, kill orc, take pie.  Rinse and repeat until your eyes bleed.  Few games manage to be as offensively boring as this...\n\nIn summary, don't play this game, it's a lazy knockoff Dungeons of Dredmor wannabe.  Play the real Dungeons of Dredmor.","March 16, 2015","false","2.4"," 114 of 149 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","114","149","10","8"

Music is super duper quiet though, wish it had some hot lute solos.\n\nGameplay is basic click attack, but there are right click power moves unique to the 4 classes.

Do not hesitate to escape, by closing the door that you opened a few seconds ago for instance, if you think that you will have a hard time killing a scary boss !\n\nYou will trigger quests (between 0-3 at each floor) that require to either kill a boss or find an item. You'll be rewarded with both money and xp. I think that you should clean an entire floor before triggering a quest (at least in Hard /Hell difficulties). The point I want to make is that if this is a boss quest, you might be in trouble if you have to fight a boss that you've just spawned plus some regular monsters.\n\nCleaning an entire floor will bring you everything you need : xp, money and items. You should get the best stuff you can and some potions before fighting the final boss. Regarding this final boss, I do not want to spoil people, but there is one thing I want to say : how is it possible to give him the ability to kill us with one skill and one shot ? If the skill "Death" hits you, you will die 10 turns later, no matter what you do ... You have to hope that it will fail :s\n\nRegarding the achievements, there are quite easy to unlock, except maybe for the one that needs you to beat the game in Hell mode. I might make a guide to give you some hints.\n\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I think this game is quite good, especially for its price (5€ at the moment). I hope that there will be some updates in order to add more contents (more floors, maybe a "survival" mode with infinite floors ? ...). If you like this kind of game, do not hesitate, buy it !","October 5, 2014","true","21.3"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","37","46","2","0"

Unless you are really stuck on the 8-bit art style, I'd instead go with Wazhack or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, both of which are excellent. OR try Hammerwatch if you want live-action roguelike as opposed to turn-based, which this is.\n\nHere are the pros:\n\n1) A little humor in the game which is mildly amusing.\n\n2) Scratches your 8-bit nostalgia itch, if you have one.\n\n3) The music tracks are cool if you like 8/16-bit MIDI tracks. I quite like them personally.\n\nHere are the cons:\n\n1) Waaaay too easy on normal difficulty. Only the boss fights are hard. The rest of the time you will rarely if ever need to use your special abilities. Overall gameplay is fairly simple compared to some of the other rogue-likes I've seen.\n\n2) Loot system and the game in general is not well balanced. You gain skills by acquiring skill books. These drop way too often, so by level 3 of the dungeon you've already acquired all the skills for your class.\n\n3) There are ONLY 7 LEVELS for this game. VERY short for a rogue-like game.\n\n4) Generally uninspired and derivative. Absolutely nothing new is introduced to this ancient formula. It's been done better many times before.\n\nBasically this game feels half-♥♥♥♥♥. The devs did not pour there heart and soul into this game. It is paint by numbers. And the painting is pretty sloppy at that.","March 30, 2014","false","4.1"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","45","60","0","4"

I can munch on my beefy-5-layer burrito while simultaneously pointing and clicking on bad guys and collecting loot! Imagine the most generic dungeon crawler possible, and you've probably imagined something similar to Quest of Dungeons. A loot-hunt, a maze of randomly spawned rooms, baddies that drop gold, hooded merchants who will buy everything you have without question ... Quest of Dungeons just might be a dungeon crawler in it's purest form. This game accomplishes it's intent save for a few exceptions:\n1- The bosses are slightly imbalanced throughout the game. On the first level, they will one-hit kill you, on the seventh, you will one-shot them from across the room. Somewhere in the middle you will encounter bosses at about the right level.\n2- The randomized levels have a chance of ruining your game. I finally made it to the last level on my third play-through, and what was immediately behind door #1? THE FINAL BOSS! I discovered later that the final floor has it's own unique bad guys and rooms to explore. So beware, lest the final boss is at the foot of the stairs.","May 21, 2014","true","9.0"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","2"

When you get stuck between a boss and its minions, and are lacking a health potion or two-- it requires ciritical stratigizing to heal up and return the damage without dying, and will hold you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the best way to go about a quest.\nSpeaking of quests, they are the one thing that I find lacking-- somewhat ironically, in Quest of Dungeons. The lore behind this game is very humorous, and I find myself laughing at the premise of the title-- which essentially is to kill an evil sorcerer/tyrant/thing, to restore the good in the land. The storyline is vague, and very satrical at it's own expense. However, in-game quests lack any real reason behind them-- ironic or otherwise-- and while they do provide an exceptional amount of gold and XP, I find them somewhat boring to complete.\n\nIn the end, I found Quest of Dungeons to be an excellent title that I would reccomend to anyone who doesn't mind restarting their game and thinking critically.\n9/10 overall score.","July 8, 2014","true","10.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Quest of Dungeons adds a few elements to the formula, some good and some bad, but doesn't really aspire to improve it so the few flaws that Fatal Labyrinth had are still here in Quest of Dungeons.\n\nThis game adds more loot and a store to sell and buy items. But most of the loot is just junk to sell anyway, and there is nothing worth buying except healing potions. Quest of Dungeons also tries to add personality to the player character and the monsters, but fails completely. The character says random things like "This game was made with C++" and "This game was made with OpenGL". The monsters say equally weird things, according to another reviewer they are mostly references to movies that have nothing to do with the context of this game.\n\nLike in Fatal Labyrinth, the only way to heal between battles is to run around a bit. In this game the healing is a lot slower so the running around just to heal yourself gets even more tedious after a while.\n\nI quit playing soon after I got to the 4th floor of the dungeon. There you encounter monsters who steal stuff from your inventory. This is another "feature" that was present in Fatal Labyrinth as well. But again, Quest of Dungeons makes an annoying feature worse. In Fatal Labyrinth the monster sometimes stole an item from you, in this game they almost always succesfully steal from you, so you see the few good items you didn't sell before going to the 4th floor disappear from your inventory at an extremely frustrating rate. And you can't get stolen items back from the monster after killing it. Within a few minutes I lost the three keys I had in my inventory (the most important items in Quest of Dungeons and not easy to find) and the better part of my gold. This is such a cheap mechanism to make a game more difficult (and Quest of Dungeons has a few of those) that it made me decide to quit playing.\n\nConclusion: the premise of the game is good but we saw that 25 years ago already in Fatal Labyrinth. And Fatal Labyrinth is still the better of the two games: it's longer, more balanced, less frustrating and annoying, it doesn't have the weird and even childish atmosphere and it has a "continue" system (if you play it via the emulator that comes with the Sega Megadrive Classics / Sega Genesis Classics collections, you can even save at any point). So I don't recommend this game but if you're looking to play a game just like it that doesn't have its flaws, I recommend Fatal Labyrinth instead.","November 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","44","67","2","3"

It's not a bad game, particularly in terms of polish. It's finished, it works, it has a proper structure... But it's very, very low on actual content and challenge. The game is easy, gold is utterly meaningless (therefore shops are essentially just an item creation menu, because you know you will ALWAYS be able to buy anything you want at them at all times) and it has no real storyline... though thats normal for this genre at least. You'll learn all your spells within about 10 minutes, your level doesn't really matter (there's no other progression either), items are all boring with no visual effects and they rarely even have extra stats making it a game where you just look at one green number to choose all your gear and by the end i didnt remember even a single item I had on.\n\nThe upside is the game is fast and you can finish it within 30m (so sayeth the achievements, I suspect faster is possible) so if you want something to play in short bursts its good for that. But with so little content I find it hard to believe you'd want to play this much. People are mentioning this being a port of a mobile game, if that is true it certainly would suit that format and I'd actually recommend getting it mobile if that's an option instead. It's a game for thumbing at on the bus or in the bathroom, not fullscreen sit-down PC gaming.\n\nSo don't buy it. Not unless it receives a big patch.

I recommend it.\nBut I find that all game elements this game does well, is done better in other games.\n\nIt is a humorous piece, with some funny quotes from the NPCs, with a now-and-then jocular atmosphere, and a tongue-in-cheek type of humour.\nBut I find that if it is the comedy that attracts, then games like Dungeons of Dredmore should be your go-to choice as they performs it better.\n\nIt has a nice graphical style, with a tidy, simplistic look, pretty animations and all put together, it looks really cool.\nBut there are many games, including roguelites, that fit this description and possibly even does it better.\n\nThe combat system is nice, if fairly generic, with a normal weapon-based attack, and several different spells to use, ranging from buffs to fireballs or bombs.\nBut, just like before, many games do this, and sometimes even better than here.\n\nThe looting system is good; it has its flaws (for instance, selecting what to pick up in piled up on the ground is not possible, but you need to go through all of them to reach the bottom one) but it still works pretty good and it's easy to adapt to.\n\nQuest of Dungeons also lacks in a few other aspects, which keeps it from playing like a finished game. For example, although I liked the available options in the options menu, it lacked some important things like sound control/mute, key schemes and rebinds, changing the resolution manually, etc.\nAnd if, viewing certain equipments (say, a helm) while not wearing any of that type (head armor), would have all stats glow green, just like they do when compared to stats of the current equipment of that type, that would be slightly handy.\n\nWhat makes this game recommendable is that, even though it does not have any single outstanding quality, it all still works really well together. The art style, the combat - everything just works well together, even though not always being perfect, and it ends up still being a very, very nice product.\n\nI don't usually rate titles, but this would be a strong 7/10.\nIt does not really have any amazing game elements that makes it an absolute must-buy,\nbut it is a good enough roguelite and is worth the money it costs for a fan of the genre, especially on sale.\nExcept for, perhaps, hardcore rogue-like players who enjoy deep and complex mechanics.","December 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

Instead consider playing Tales of Maj'Eyal or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.\n\nQuest of Dungeons is not a roguelike, it is a roguelikelike. It is a dumb, poorly made abomination that merely contains elements that an ignorant may ask and be told, probably from a bored and indifferent source, can be found within roguelikes.\n\nThis insipid program is a mannequin of a roguelike. There is next to no variety in abilities or items. Most gear is a flat upgrade, additional stats are rare and usually as significant as +1% crit chance. It has draped itself in the trappings of a roguelike but nothing more.\n\nIt lacks many basic features such as auto-exploration, travel to landmark, or rest till fully healed. And may the Good Lord in Heaven have mercy or your wretched soul if you should even attempt to make use of the click to move feature.\n\nClicking on a square causes you to move to that square, even distant squares that take many turns to walk to. In those subsequent turns you get to watch your character get mobbed to death without you being able to stop it. Yes, this game lacks the basic feature of stopping auto-walk when an enemy appears or you take damage. The first time I had a character die to this I had to immediately kill off a few more just to convince myself that yes, this game is just that badly made. Had the developers placed into this game any sort of love, care, attention, or to be frank, competence, then they would have caught this.\n\nNo love was put into this game, and I presume only minimal effort. Where are the random and unindentified potions, scrolls, and wands? Where are the whacky item egos and curses? Where is the innovation? Where is the fun? Where are the things that people who love games hold so dear that they want to dedicated a significant portion of their lives just for the chance that they can share them with the world? Where is this game's voice? Oh no, not That Friend's voice. But yes, it is, and we will discuss it.\n\nThroughout the game monsters will say famous quotes from pop culture. “Welcome to your doom.” You might open a door and see a walking tree that announces “I am your father.” No reason, no joke, no connection to anything. “The cake is a lie.” These things are just said and said and said, repeated constantly through the game. “Run you fool.” It isn't funny.\n\nSay you find yourself, despite all good efforts, alone in a room with That Friend. You know of whom I speak, we all know That Friend.\n\n“Do you remember Portal?” he asks, then guffaws. Using his thumb he counts down the greasy fat fingers on his other hand.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiagozak/recommended/270050/","Tiagozak","Tiagozak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiagozak/","466 products in account","Quest of Dungeons: a rogue-like that's both simple, funny, hard and addictive. This is one of the first Portuguese games ever to make it to a major videogame digital distribution platform (previous examples fall to A Walk in the Dark on Steam and Under Siege on PSN), and the results are positive. Let me explain the topics I've mentioned above: the game is simple. You only need the mouse to play it, but the WASD keys are also very helpful. The mechanics themselves are very simple and pleasant, and even if one hasn't ever played a rogue-like there will be no difficulty in adapting to the game mechanics. Funny, because the plot is based on clichés and ironies. The plot is not a big deal, of course, but that's the objective. Hard, because there is permadeath: you die, you're over. There is no respawn. You have to start from the very beggining. There are also random bosses that can bring instant death if they are found early in the game. Addictive, because of the very reason that makes games like Binding of Isaac addicting: every thime you die and have to start over, you reach further areas and advance a little more with each time you play. You discover new things, new techniques, new content and came, step by step, closer to finally reach the end of the game. So, I have written this review without finnishing the game, and my opinion might change a bit when I finally do it. If that proves right, I will edit this review in order to make it more actual. Now, if the game is worth the 5€: it depends. If you're a fan of rogue-like games, then buy it. If you are just looking for a game to relax, consider buying it with a discount. I usually don't rate indie games, especially indie games like this, but I'll advance with a score of 76 out of 100. Reccomended.","April 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

In other roguelikes, most items are unidentified at first, and blindly trying every potion, scroll, armor, etc., where may be dozens of different kinds, becomes a part of the game as well. But in QoD there are no such elements and thus there is little replayability. The skill tree for a character can be available half game. You keep leveling up but don't get new skills.\nSo, this is a roguelike you can finish. It is enjoyable for a while, but once you have finished the game with one character there is little incentive to keep playing other than to see the skills of the other ones (which, as said, can be done quickly).\nI guess I'll "recommend" the game, but don't expect much if you are familiar with other roguelikes.

And I'm glad I found it! At first, it may appear to be just a simple game, but there's a lot of depth in it.\n\nThe drop system is great, and you just drop gear for the hero you choose. So, unlike many other games, you can't drop an exceptional armor/weapon that you can't use. This helps a lot.\n\nSome people may dislike the skill system, because you don't learn new skills by levelling up, you have to drop books to learn them. On the one hand, it's a totally random drop and you may only find the skills you want later on in the game, on the other, you can never drop the same book of a skill that you already learned (only if you already have a book in your inventory that you didn't used to learn the skill, then it can drop the same skill book). I personally liked it.\n\nOne minor complaint I have is that I found the game to be kinda easy, even on the hardest level (Hell mode).\n\nOverall, Quest of Dungeons is a solid game.

It's not to be taken to seriously, but when you realize all of the subtle nuances of it, it makes it far more enjoyable. The level progression and procurring nice loot, weapons, and armor are taken into account, the game really comes alive. It's not for everyone, this game appeals mainly to the oldschool.

I'll give you guys a run down of some of the stuff I like and a few things that could be improved.  I do want to point out one thing though.  Since the release of this game the developer has done many updates addressing any and all problems found.  Always good to see a developer so passionate and eager about righting wrongs, tweaking things, or just addressing issues.\n\nIf you'd rather watch a video than read, I covered Quest of Dungeons twice in my Weekly Runs!!! series, so feel free to check that out as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq0YzEWydE&list=PLtzgP48ATFJCyragujwKghLrqOWk-2gZw\nand\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l_5XMYHPGk&list=PLtzgP48ATFJBrgM7ej0-UK-Y7y1_CTEZ9\nor\nhttps://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigums\n\nQuest Of Dungeons is an extremely fun turn-based dungeon crawling roguelike game.  You gain loot, experience, levels, skills and spells as well.\n\nIf you liked Hack, Slash, Loot, and wanted a little more out of it, or you are a big fan of Dungeons Of Dredmor, but feel it might be a bit TOO complex, then THIS is your middle ground.  The graphics are minimalist but not bad, the sounds and music are well done and the gameplay is very nice.\n\nYou get loot from killing stuff and opening chests and your skills are found the same way in the form of skill books or tomes.    No clumsy skill trees or crazy keyboard commands here.  Just a combination of mouse clicky clicks, keyboard movement (If you want it) and your skill.  Really fun game, I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nI was able to review/preview the game through a review/press copy of the game from the developer.  He's a super nice guy and I feel he did an amazing job.  All that being said there are still some things that need work.\n\n*** Please Note:  I left the below section in to show what I had said about the game upon release.***\n\n********************************************************************************************************************\nThe difficulty of the game (at least with the two heroes I beat it with) needs an overhaul.  The first floor or two can be relatively difficult and if you are just completely not paying attention bad juju can happen, but overall the game is a touch too easy.  I did beat the game on hard and I felt there should be a larger difficulty increase between normal and hard as well as the different floors.\n\nNot only that, you also seem to max out your skills well within the first two floors as well.  Now, I'm all about having options but it tends to make tricky situations a bit easier when you have your full array of abilities about 10-15 minutes into the game.  I suppose this could be the reason the game gets much easier after the second floor as well.  My suggestion would be to possibly lower the drop rate or spread out the skill books a bit more.\n\nYou gain a tremendous amount of gold as the game progresses, far more than you could ever spend.  Again, the first two floors of the game you are sort of skill/gold/gear starved, but after the second floor, little can touch you or at least do much damage before you kill it.\n\nNow that's not to say there are no challenges in the game.  The quest mobs and the boss mobs are still pretty nasty, but they really are the biggest challenge.  Traps and normal mobs really offer little challenge at best.\n********************************************************************************************************************\n\nThe developer pretty much addressed any and all issues I had above.  He added a new difficulty level, adjust the gold issues, and it seems lowered the skill tome drops as well.  It's almost TOO hard now.  So, if you like a challenge, it's here in spades with the new difficulty setting!  Well done Sir, well done.\n\nI still find the game insanely fun and quite enjoyable.  As I stated earlier the developer is updating and making changes frequently and I feel he has a solid game.  The tweaking and work done after release on Quest Of Dungeons has turned this extremely fun and enjoyable roguelike game into an extremely fun, enjoyable, and challenging GREAT roguelike game.  I highly recommend it, even more so than I did before.  Quest Of Dungeons is well worth the small $4.99 pricetag.  It's one of the few games I feel could charge more and it still be a great deal.","March 28, 2014","true","8.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

And when i started it, i did. It's repetitive, and the graphics are just generally unedited sprites from a Sprite Pack you can buy for use in your games, but it had a certain charm to it i suppose.\n\nIgnoring the graphics because of the aforementioned reason, the sound design isn't great. The music is cute, but generic. The combat has almost no sounds to it, which is fine if that's what you're going for, but it doesn't seem like that's what they wanted. The sounds for eating and drinking (which you will be doing a LOT because of shoddy balance, more on that below) honestly sound like wet farts.\n\nThe controls are intutive enough i guess. Move around with WASD/Clicking with the Mouse and attack by clicking with the mouse. Oh and loot by clicking with the mouse. Starting to see a problem? This is most evident when playing as the Wizard/Assassin, characters designed more for a ranged approach. Nothing is more infuriating than trying to attack an enemy, only to misclick and just run right up next to them and stick your face out to get punched. Same problem with looting, half the time if you aren't paying perfect attention to where your mouse is, you'll run PAST your loot. While not as much of an issue in the early part of the game, in the later parts where enemies are EVERYWHERE, you'll often run straight into one due to this issue.\n\nBut honestly, as a fan of roguelikes, i could've overlooked that. The humor of the game is definitely what kept me somewhat charmed, with such items as "Bottled Water" (Generic Brand) and the Moldy Cheese item questioning why you even have it in your pocket. And if those were the only issues, i could've ignored them. Honestly though, the balance is definitely the main problem with the game.\n\nI kinda glossed over the combat earlier for a reason. As i said, it's fairly repetitive. You click on enemies and hit them, you damage them, they damage you, etc. You have skills you can use, but it's effectively selecting the skill and then... clicking on enemies. Or yourself if it's a buff. As far as i can tell from my best run, there are no party members. Sidequests are practically nonexistant, generally they're just randomly generated fluff, either of the "go find this item that's randomly spawned in some room" or "kill this slightly recolored enemy that either you'll kill in two hits, or vice versa" variety. There's no visual indicator of progress, your sprite stays the same. But again; this isn't the biggest issue. That... is definitely the balance.\n\nYeah. The balance, of all things, in a rather boiled down roguelike, is ironically the main problem. You know how in most roguelikes your chance to dodge can be affected by equipment? Or rings? Or SOMETHING? Yeah, not so much here. In fact, i still have no idea what affects dodging in this as there is no weight system, and the only items i've ever seen have secondary effects are weapons which *NEVER* have +Dodge Chance or anything similar. This generally means that dodging for you is just a gift from RNGesus. For the enemies, it's a COMMON occurance. For cannon fodder enemies, that's fine. You know when it's not fine? With bosses. Bosses that can dodge all of your attacks and oneshot you at full health when you're already above the needed level for the floor you're on and can consistently oneshot the aforementioned fodder. The recolored enemies are guilty of the same issue. Equipment doesn't make a big difference really, as i said, only weapons ever seem to have extra effects, and they're generally worthless, so it's just a matter of seeing which item has a better main stat. Same with armor. Hell, even rings, generally the only thing in some roguelikes that have other effects, are just more Defense fodder in this.\n\nHonestly, i'd like to recommend this game. I can see a mobile port working well (which they're working on a 3DS port so that's probably closer than i think) but in it's current state, on a platform with so many better Roguelikes, i can't recommend it.\n\nOh and for you achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s like myself, it commits a horrible, horrible sin; the difficulty achievements are difficulty locked. Beating the game on Hard for example, doesn't unlock the Normal and Easy achievements, just the Hard one. There's literally no reason for it, other than either the devs didn't think of it, or they were padding the game.\n\nIf you want a good example of a roguelike that's almost the complete opposite of this in every way, go play Elona. This probably seems like Needless shilling, but i'm serious. It's freeware, and has a large modding community.","April 10","false","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The fight mechanics are pretty good, if not a little over-reactive with the mouse controls (I sometimes end up unintentionally moving when I click a tile with a monster on it as an assassin) but for 5 bucks it's certainly not a bother to me. This game is really well done for the price in my opinion, and I certainly hope this becomes popular. I imagine this as almost a turn based Binding of Isaac, with equipment you can switch out as opposed to just stacking more on or overwriting it accidentally. Having multiple classes is also a plus, though I have only played the assassin. My point is, if you have 5 bucks in your steam wallet thats burning a hole in your pocket; give this game a chance because you just may fall in love with it.","July 14, 2014","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are 7 floors to explore, each taking around half an hour to finish, making a playthrough last 3-4 hours or so. There are four classes to choose from - Warrior, Shaman, Assassin and Mage. I played through the game on normal with the warrior and enjoyed the variety of skills I acquired for him. Not a ton, but enough to add some strategy and keep a ~3 hour game interesting. I'm assuming the other three classes have their own set of skills, which adds some potential replayability.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind before starting a game is that 'normal' difficulty was rather easy for me and I never had any shortage of money. If you are adept at rogue-likes, you may want to play on a higher difficulty.\n\nThis game isn't amazing, but it is a fun and simple rogue-like that is very accessible. It retails at $5 so it would be a very reasonable purchase on sale.","August 4, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Why?\nBecause this game is still inbalanced!\n\nWhy collecting gems to sell them later for 12 gold each, when you just can hold on to those books with your skill spells? After completing half of floor 1 I had all my skills, but those books kept coming. So I collected them. With over 5.000 gold per book and dozens of them to sell I am rich now. And bored.\n\nBeing a completionist I killed all enemies in floor 1. Now I am so strong that I just rush through the rest of the rooms. I can't say what the game is like after floor 2. Because it is too boring to find out. Everytime the same thing. Go into a room, kill the enemies with 2 punches and then the fiddling with your inventory. Why should I carry so many items, when I can buy some potions (stackable). Compared to the food items (non-stackable and less health-giving) these are the best. But in the case of beeing -that- rich: Why having those stupid food items which just overload your inventory?!\n\nSo you try to keep vour inventory clean. Which is hard work! Why? Because if there are some items on the ground, for example 5 bottles of water and a piece of armour and you just want to collect the armour, you still have to pick everything up, when the armour is on the ground and the bottles above.\n\nEvery enemy has the same schematic of fighting, the A.I. is also boring as hell - Which isn't exactly true, because I think that being tortured in hell would be more exciting than playing a game which is very, very, very, very, very easy. Maybe you should call your "Normal"-Difficulty that way. Although it would be a very long button - but not as long as my annoyance will go on.\n\nI have played games with the same price and wasn't bored after 1h of gameplay, so I have a right to expect more than being bored and unimpressed after the first floor.\nDo better. Now. Or announce your little game as not finished. Or announce it as "Give us your money for nothing. Thanks.". What a great and fun title for your game!\n\nUsually I am not this enraged by anything, but since there are so many bad games in steam, people should be warned. I have no problem at all with low-budget games which are finished after 3 or 4 hours. I have no problem with games I can't finish because they are too hard.\nBut here are my problems: I can't enjoy the 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, because it's boring, unbalanced, unfinished and too easy.","March 26, 2014","false","0.9"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","1"

Quest of Dungeons is a rogue like in the most classic way. Sticking with the grid based movement and turn based combat the original Rogue had. Almost everything is randomly generated and different classes are available for every play style. The art is very nice with vibrant colors. Each floor is massive and you always want to explore the entire thing before moving on. You can also find books that will give you a random new spell giving you more options for combat. I prefer this method of obtaining new moves over the standard pick from a skill tree when you level up. One of the most unique things about Quest of Dungeons is the quests. When you find a quest it will be added to your journal which will tell you what to do. Some of the things you will need to do will vary from killing a mini boss type enemy to finding an item somewhere in the level.

It lacks the in-depth skill system of a game like Dungeons of Dredmor, and from what I've seen there's only one kind of trap, and what it does is spawn more monsters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when you're trying to grind out a little more XP. And yet, even though its simple, and at times just a tad bit bland I still find reasons to recommend it.\n\nPerhaps it's because QoD is so focused. You have four classes to choose from, and there's nothing in the way of stat points to allocate. You can loot and equip items but the stat system for the randomly generated loot is easy to read, and so for those who aren't theorycraft extraordinaires knowing how to build a character is as simple as making sure you have level appropriate gear.\n\nThe focus then becomes knowing when to use your skills and keeping a supply of food items and health potions to keep yourself alive. There is a quest system in the game, but there are only two types of quests: Kill enemy X, or Find item Y. There's a definite necessity to complete these in order to keep up with the escalating level of the dungeon enemies from floor to floor.\n\nThe game does feature four difficulty levels, and there is supposed to be an update soon which will add a new dungeon. The game is not devoid of content but much of what is there is grindy and similar. For some that will work (I like to play this game in between sessions of hardercore, more mentally taxing games) but those who seek something that will constantly crank up the Wowfactor and throw lots of curves at you might fair better looking elsewhere.\n\nI'd recommend this game to those who are new the sub-genre, or else can't stand the complexity that some of us masochists relish in the more hardcore rogue-likes. Those who have already defeated Dredmor a few dozen times and completed Nethack a hundred times over might want to wait for something more complex to come along.","July 8, 2015","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Addictive, simple, rewarding, easy to streamline into faster paced dungeon delving\nStory? Who needs it?\nPersonal Opinion? Working towards a powerful character with all abilities/spells feels great. It also provides a real sense of loss when you die and have to start all over again, though the game is simple enough that it won't take too long. So far I've not made it past the 4th floor, so restarting may not be as bad yet as, say, dying on the 10th floor (if it even goes that far).\nPro Tips\n- keep everything with you until you find a merchant. All that bad gear you keep finding? Sell it. You can easily make 20K gold if you sell as much stuff as you can.\n- once you have lots of gold, always buy keys from the merchants. You never know when you'll need them.","July 4, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fun one-liners from mobs. Shops are class-specific, always. Easy to pick up and play, although bosses are absolutely unscrupulous, and can one-shot you from full health to D-E-A-D. That said, it's a blast, and the dev is always open to improvements, comments, and helpful criticisms.

All abilities are extremely easy to get and blatently overpowered. But I expected the game would get more challenging and that the early floors where just some stocking up area, I was mistaken. I never had to use a single potion or healing item. Never play this game on normal. Just start on hard.

You're actually a little scared to see what you might come up against, you have no idea how strong you are in comparison to the monsters you know are there but are yet to see.\nNo idea what any of your stats mean or what any items do that you may have been fortunate enough to find early on, there are interesting looking tiles and things everywhere so here is the biggest thing you'll be doing off the bat CLICK EVERYTHING that looks at all different from the normal tile you see.\nIn fact in the very first room there's a signpost you might want to click on and check out... :3\nSince that's such a large part of the games experience (IMO) I won't say much more but, go everywhere check everything and be careful! You're sure to enjoy it regardless c:\n\n[Design changes I'd like to see]\nI love this game, but there are some things design wise that I think should be improved. You should be able to move your items around in your inventory at will imo since there are so many items that need to be sold at points, organising this would be majorly helpful. I also think that entrances to new rooms on the map should be marked as a different colour since its quite easy to miss if you aren't looking at it every 5 seconds. Only once you're looking back over a floor do you suddenly see you may have missed or forgotten about a few rooms.\nAlso I'm sorry but I have to question why you're only allowed one save file... What if I want one file per class/character? Can you not give us at least 4 slots? I don't want to have to come on and commit to one class every time and only be able to change it once I die :C\nAnd what about a 'graveyard' of sorts, or a 'hero's plaque' where you can choose to record your past characters exploits after death ^^\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI don't know if anymore will be added to the game but I'd certainly buy DLC if it were available X3, maybe I'm a sucker, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is like the same genre, and I was 100% addicted to it AND it's sequels, if there were more content in this... well I would love it at least <3\n\n9/10-MeGN ''It's decent''\n8/8-MeSpot ''Not perfect, but as close as any human can get''\n2/10-MeCritic ''We loved it!''","August 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Or to have to choose only one which we can use?\n\nApart from that the only thing I see as being super duper important is multiplayer, if you add multiplayer I would recommend without hesitation.

The game doesn't wow you with its retro style graphics, or overly complex game play.  You're given a choice of 4 heroes, each representing a different style of play (melee, magic user, archer, or fighter/mage combo), a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard), and you start crawling through a randomly generated dungeon.  Your goal is to navigate your character through the levels to reach the bottom and have a showdown with the final boss, the Dark Lord.\n\nThe character is controlled with simple arrow keys to move up, down, left and right.  The two icons on the lower right allow different attacks.  The "i" button allows you to pull up the inventory and character screen.  The "m" button pulls up the auto map.  The red and blue potion icons at the top left corner shows your current health and mana.  Your inventory is limited, and your goal is to stay alive while gaining levels and accumulating gold, healing items, and finding better equipment.  Every level has a shopkeeper to sell your excess or unwanted inventory for money to buy keys or items.\n\nThe main issue with QoD is permanent death.  Once your hero dies, you gotta start over with a new game.  And do expect to die a LOT while you figure out how to fight the various aggressive monsters that go straight for your jugular.  You have the option to save and quit as long as your hero is alive.  But once your character dies, you can't reload from that save point.\n\nThat being said, I was able to finish the game on easy mode with a mage in 3 1/2 hours.  For a gamer who manages to finish a game once every few years, that is an achievement.  I may go back and replay in a more difficult setting in the near future.\n\nFor fans of the rogue genre, Quest of Dungeons is five bucks well spent.","April 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

For example: Locked rooms full of chests, boss monsters, and the possibility of quests. There are 4 difficulty levels; Easy, Normal, Hard, and Hell. You play as one of four classes; Warrior, Wizard, Hunter, and Shaman. The bosses are quite challenging, especially at early levels.\n\nNow, while I recommend this game, I would have paid a lot more for a game with more features. I think for the $5, you get a great and fun time killer. It's interesting and intertaining. I think even with multi player, it would have added a lot more to the game.","October 25, 2014","true","13.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

To quote one Chuck Klosterman, "It's like reviewing a unicorn". QuoD is, essentially, the ultimate 'generic Indie game'. Given the range and breadth of the so-called Indie genre, this should be impossible. Nevertheless, QuoD manages it. It's like opening your library to discover a mythical creature: something that, fundamentally, should not exist.\n\nAt this point, I feel the need to stress, that is not a recommendation. The fact that it such a thing exists is marvelous, the game itself, however, is therefore not. It is the ultimate testimony to the fact that a great game requires more than a full range of acceptable elements.\n\nThere is a great misconception that, if you just throw together a bunch of tried and tested game mechanics, with a sufficiently pleasing 'Indy-pixel' aesthetic, and some decent music, and brief if moderately amusing story, and then polish it all up a bit, you will get at least a decent game. QuoD is this game, and it is dull. Every element of this game would prove perfectly adequate in another, better, indie title. Together, the result is far, far less than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe game mechanics are generic as they come. It's like someone took the mechanics from the original Rogue, and then threw in all the standard RPG sub-mechanics that players expect today. Oh, and removed most of the challenge. Upgrades are linear (and dull), combat is simplistic (and dull), level design is randomised (and dull), items are generic (and dull). You get the picture. There is not a single idea in this game that you have not seen before, probably so many times you don't even register its presence any more. Fittingly, the game does not see fit to provide a tutorial. Perhaps it sees itself as a sort of 'Wiki-learning' game, like Minecraft. Such delusions of grandeur are utterly misplaced, but fortunately you don't need one, because it's so damn generic.\n\nThe frippery is, similarly, so generic as to be barely worth noting. It's got cutesy pixel graphics. Gosh. In an Indie game. Someone phone the ♥♥♥♥ing press. I guess the execution's acceptable, but it's, like everything else about this game, utterly unremarkable. The music? Well, I guess it's got some. It's not chiptune, so maybe it loses a little bit of Indie cred there, but it's dull, repetetive, loops over and over again, and is repetetive, so I guess that's nearly as good. What there is of it is fine, and it isn't actively obnoxious for the first hour and a half, so I guess that's OK. And the game has seperate audio sliders, which is useful, when you finally get sick of it. Finally, the story. Um... Not much of that. There's a tiny opening cutscene, and, I'd guess, probably an ending cutscene. I freely admit, I couldn't be bothered to finish the game. I guess the story's adequate to explain why you're doing what you're doing, but Spec Ops it ain't.\n\nSo, the result? Look, I don't know if I've got the point across yet, but OH GOD IT'S SO DULL. This is proof that it possible to find an Indie game not merely lacking in execution but in heart. It's just utterly soulless. It's like someone took Realm of the Mad God and removed the elements that made it fun. The only reasons you should buy it are as a dire warning for budding game designers, and so you can get a really rare badge for your Steam profile.\n\nI can't hate this game. It doesn't have that much personality. I just resent the hours of my life I spent playing it.","May 29, 2014","false","2.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Even more objects in the world to smash, and almost everything will provide some kind of loot.

What it lacks is balance, in that you'll be cruising along in auto-pilot until a virtually unbeatable boss appears out of nowhere and either forces you to flee, or eats you alive. In addition, because of the nature of combat, and the fact that all creatures (including the hero) share the same walking speed, there really doesn't exist any room for a third option.\n\nWhile I certainly give this game a thumbs up for its sound execution of a simple concept, the concept itself is somewhat flawed. It's an excellent purchase if you're able to pick it up for a dollar or so, but it's certainly not worth the default price tag of $5.","August 27, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play 1 out of 4 characters at a time, each with it's own special skillset and specialities, in difficulties ranging from easy to hell. The game itself is played in a 1 try for victory style meaning if your health gauge reaches 0, you're game over. Most of the achievements are also fun to hunt for and the game is speedrunnable for extra challenges.\n\nDue to the retro style, difficulty and strategy needed in the later levels and boss fights, this game is very addictive and very enjoyable to play.

This has  been one of the most cookie cutter, lazy, bland roguelikes I have ever played. I feel like there was barely any effort put into it at all and there are SO many better options for this kind of game out there.\n\nFor one it has the problem of being at the whim of the RNG. "You looked through the whole floor and found one piece of gear? Tough luck.". Also the game punishes you for looking in objects for stuff. Every object you search has a chance to spawn in a ton of enemies. All the games mechanics work against you and want you to die so it can laugh at you when you fail.\n\nA roguelike needs more the a RNG and a bunch of enemies to be interesting. This game does nothing that other games havent done before. Take the 5 bucks you would have dropped on this and get Dungeons of Dredmor, a GOOD roguelike with some actual effort put into it.","October 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went through all the levels extremely fast and defeated the end boss with no difficulty at all. I felt way too powerful and did not feel challenged the entire way through.\n\nExtremely short. I beat the game in just under 2 hours.\n\nThe good:\n\nVery affordable.\nCasual fun.\nA smooth and forgiving entrance into the rogue-like genre of games.\nNice art and good music","March 28, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Where you are sent by your party to adventure randomly generated dungeons and defeat the bosses that lye ahead. The game was designed by David Amador and released back in March, 2014.\n\nReview\n\nQuest of Dungeons is not for the hardcore rouge like player but, the simplistic and average player that wants something to do for a couple mins because you have time to spare. The game has many features such as:\n\nRandomly Generated Dungeons\nFour playable classes\nComical humor\nMany different items\nChance to fight your own ghost\nAchievement system (Beta)\nUnlock-able content\nLarge inventory system\nReplay Value\nThe game lacks from a "real" rouge like dungeon crawler when it comes to survival. In Quest of Dungeons David got rid of the food system so you no longer need to eat to survive, larger inventory so you do not have to make those drastic choices of keeping an item or not.\n\nAlthough, Quest of Dungeons may not have everything a rouge like game would. It is fun none the less and would recommend this game to anybody looking for a fun dungeon crawler with much replay value. For $4.99 the game is worth the time and enjoyment you will get out of it.","December 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For $2.50, I have really enjoyed this game which is a modern making of a old school dungeon crawler.\n\nThe graphics are 16-Bit and the music creates a nice ambiance.  The game play is simple, kill mosters, explore dungeons, find some loot, get better gear and skills, and go down to the next dungeon.  Nothing complicated at all. The game doesn't take itself seriously and it the humor throughout the game adds a nice flavor.  My favorite taunt from the monsters is "The cake is a lie!"\n\nJust be warned, this is old school style.  I was exploring the last dungeon before I went up against the final boss when a mage froze me.  While I was frozen, a monster attacked me while the mage kept hitting me with spells.  I died and death is permanent in this game.  I've got to start all over now.","September 8, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It plays fast and intuitively and has catchy tunes and sound effects.\n\nGoal of the game is to get to the lowest floor (6 or 7), where you can defeat the end-boss and thus winning the game.\n\nYou gain experience by killing monsters and completing quests as you progress through the floors. Mana and hitpoints (depending on difficulty level) can be regained by either "wandering around" (avoiding the word "exploring" in this context, because it's effectively possible to replenish mana and health simply by running around in already explored areas), or consuming potions or food. When having explored all of a dungeon floor, your level and equipment will be good enough to proceed to a lower floor with more difficult monsters and boss(es).\n\nMagic books can be found in chests and monster-drops, which you can read to learn a new spell. Each spell has a short explanation and is easy to memorize. Every spell has a cooldown period and mana cost.\n\nGold is collected from monster-drops, destroying breakable objects, chests and or selling items at the shopkeeper. Equipment (weapons and armor) can be looted from monsters and bosses, found in chests or bought at the shopkeeper.\n\nQuests can be initiated by activating "quest poles", scattered around the floors. Basically, there are two kind of straightforward quests: "search quests"; which require you to locate and collect an object or "kill <name of boss> quests"; in which you'll have to find the boss' hideout and defeat him. While the overall approach of the game feels rather easy, the bosses can be tricky though... make sure you come well prepared. It's mostly the spell arsenal you possess at the moment that makes the difference between victory or defeat, this especially counts for the battle with the final boss.\n\n\nSummary\nFun, fast, easy to learn, easy to master; therefore making QoD an excellent beginner-roguelike, no more-no less. For experienced roguelike-players, this game is simply too basic and too easy to be taken seriously into account. Even the hardest difficulty (Hell) it is fairly easy to beat.  When having achieved a perfect game (100% achievements in 18 hours), you've about had it with the game. For me at least, i can see no further challenge and/or the need to play QoD again (soon), therefore offering little, to none, replay value.\n\nMy advice: get it if you want an introduction into the roguelike genre or if you're an achievement hunter and want to quickly add 18 achievements and a perfect game to your profile. If you own other roguelikes, play them or search for other ones, but definately skip this one.","April 28, 2015","true","29.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Simple gameplay, with simple graphics, and rules with basic rogue strategies.   The downside right now as on release, is the GUI.  It could benefit greatly from an overhaul, as there is a lacking of hotkeys, along with cluttered inventory management.  Spell, and Skill selection consists of several mouseclicks to use, so setting up defenses, buffs, and attacks is a matter of 5 to 20 mouseclicks of manually selecting.    Also, was the lacking of passing time by standing still, which from a strategic POV, hinders you in battle if there is 1 square difference between you and a foe.  Even on Easy mode, there was a large gap in learning curve between dungeon levels.  Almost as if it could use a tad bit more game balancing for one or two classes.\n\nIf you can get past some of the quirks, then it can lead to many hours of play.  Be warned, its a true roguelike, with perma death, so it may not be everyones cup of tea.   Its a simple battle of attrition to outlast each subsequent adventure.","March 26, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I started another playthough extremely confused and i clicked the sign again, died instantly.\n\n10/10 Insta-kill death sign.\n\nActual Review\n\nQuest of Dungeons is a game that doesn't require much skill to play as it is a point-and-click dungeon explorer, however, that does not mean it is an easy game nor is it a short game, the goal is to make it to the end of a certain amount of floors (seven I think?) and beat the final boss. You play the game in turns so everytime you move one square, attack or use a consumable that counts as a turn and your enemies can move or attack you in that time.\n\nOn my first actual playthrough on the easy difficulty it took me about an hour and a half to get to floor 5 after exploring every single room and doing all of the quests, i had some of the best gear i could find when i went up against the boss of the floor, got cocky and didn't drink a potion, he killed me, again that was on easy the difficulty goes up to hell.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good roguelike game that allows them to just sit down, relax and click the left mouse button.\n\nTL:DR\n\nSimple concept, fun game.","October 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But if you're at all familiar with roguelikes, just don't bother.\n\nThis game lacks any real depth or strategy. Enemy behavior patterns are drop-dead simple and can be trivially abused (if even boss-monsters don't know how to chase you around a one-square obstruction without making mistakes and going the wrong way sometimes, expectations have to be set pretty low). Monsters don't have different speeds, or different pursuit-patterns, or even different immunities (even skeletons and slimes and golems and vampires and, yes, boss-monsters can be made to sleep with 100% success); they DO occasionally have different ranges and special-attacks, but that's it. It doesn't feel like an effort was made to have the treasure progression make sense; a few floors into the dungeon, you can sell inferior gear for thousands of gold, but the increasingly high-quality gemstones you find are still hovering between 10 and 20 apiece, which means the only reason you would pick them up is to make sure there's not another item hidden beneath them. Selection of gear could have been interesting, but this is another missed opportunity; few pieces of gear provide any stats other than the primary stat always provided by the gear-slot, meaning that choosing the best gear means just picking the highest number rather than making meaningful strategic tradeoffs. Any difficulty comes purely from the fact that some boss-monsters or special attacks can remove half of your health or more, but that's okay because if you know anything about tactics in roguelikes you don't have to let them attack you at all, if you play a ranged character and have patience.\n\nGraphically, the game delivers on everything its trailers promise. There's good variety in learnable skills, incorporating status effects and areas of effect in ways that would force you to make meaningful strategic decisions, if not for the homogeneity and simplicity of the threats you face. The music is varied and enjoyable enough and fits well with the game's themes. Overall, the game's production values feel decent for its price-- except for the deep, gaping hole where game-design and strategic challenge should be.\n\nLong story short, if you're a halfway-experienced roguelike player, you can jump into this game on its hardest difficulty, win on your first or second run, and have no reason to go back, as was my experience. With all of the noteworthy competitors in this genre, don't waste your time.","March 15, 2015","false","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You select your class of hero, each recalling the 8/16-bit sprite design of Final Fantasy characters, and plunge directly into the evenly tiled and sparsely furnished dungeons. By selecting a a tile (all the control is straight-forward and quite standard), your character dashes there, revealing the surroundings and leaving the rest behind cloaked in the 'fog of war'. Battling is either direct (square-to-square melee), or ranged (archery or spell-casting), and no one battle lasts more than a few hits, besides the boss battles that is.\n\nThe dungeon maps are large but unvaried - this room connects to that room which branches on to two more, and so on. Occasionally you will need a key (or three) to access a room, and these can be tricky to find, or expensive to buy. Luckily, gold is left by almost every creature you kill, and also every wardrobe, vase or box you do away with. Items are given at just about the perfect timing, with the areas levelling alongside you nicely. Boss fights break this steady curve, and are often able to perma-kill you with one-and-a-half hits.\n\nThe game is pretty charming, but is quite repetitive. When you reach a new level, you see new surroundings and new enemies, but they will remain as such until the next floor. In essence, each floor is its own stage, and sometimes the stage tends to outstay its welcome. I put this down to a lack of meaningful discovery. There's little mystery and only slight threat in each of the floors, and as said above, it is only the bosses that will pose any real worry. The special music and on-screen warning helps you from stumbling onto them too suddenly, though.\n\nIt's a fun game, but quite simple and a touch repetitious. That said, the game is quite repetitious. Repetition is the game's burden. It's worth playing, but wait for a flash sale.","April 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

NOT EVEN WORTH $0.50 WHEN ON SALE!\nIf you need to know why feel free to read on...\n\nHorrible.  Turn based RPGs may be my favorite thing ever but this....  Beat it in an hour an a half and enjoyed about the first 10-15 minutes.  I have NEVER uninstalled a game so fast (not an exaguration I've play hundreds of games and it was a first).  It is clear that ZERO effort went in to this game.  I almost never write reviews but when a game is this bad you just need to.  I will list just a few of the billion complaints I can think of.\n\n1.  There are like 8 floors and I got every skill in the game for my class (yes EVERY SKILL) by half way through THE FIRST FLOOR.  Every skill book there after was pawned off for lots of gold which I don't understand cause they are worth like 200 pieces of chicken but I turn over a rock and 3 of these books come tumbeling out.\n\n2.  Balance is non-existent.  I only played one class but with how horrible the game is won't try the others.  The shamens first skill will kill almost anything anything by itself.  Goen are the days are combining skills with other skills for cool combos cause hell I can just use Terror and they wont attack for like 7 turns!  How my severaly underleveled shamen was able to scare death (the final boss) over and over, shank him repteadly and then when he would wake up put him to sleep (probably the most combo esque thing i ever did) while I wait for terror to come off cooldown in 3 more turns is beyond me.\n\n3.  Enemies are all the same.  Almost every enemy is exactly the same.  They move the same but have different health and damage ratings.  All they do is melee.  A few guys shoot but those are the only other type and they just act the same as eachother.  I dont remember if bosses were the same as I would just ♥♥♥♥ing fear/sleep lock them (and set them on fire for fun).\n\n4.  First floor i explored everything.  2nd and 3rd I was bored and just wnated it to end but figured if I dint at leats get the items the bosses and merchents had I would have no chance.  OH HOW WRONG I WAS!  See I guess there were 8 floors in my first complaint but I honeslty don't know because I would enter a floor and leave it for the next one just a few turns later.  Sure the enemies were much more powerful then me after I did this like 3 times but I guess I can just be glad the Vampire Lords and Mummies are so afraid of me that they can't even attack.  Oh and did I mention potions?  The best health/mana restore items stack and take only 1 turn to use!  Gj almost one shotting me Death due tot he fact that I skipped 6 floors!  *sleeps then heals to full health*\n\n5.  But items are procedurelly generated like levels!  It is like borderlands!  that is cool right!?  NO!!!!!!!!  They have random stats and random names.  The only procedurale thing about them is the names vaguly remind me of the way you might put english words together and the damage values tend to be hiigher on later floors (that requires a very advanced algorithum you know!).  I did love the VERY RARE stat adjustments on items though!  Wait what?  What do you mean there is no way to tell what any of the stats do!?\n\nI could go on but honeslty I feel like if I havnt convinced you not to buy it (and if you already bought at least dont install and/or play it as it isnt even worth that) yet then you probably were going to buy it no matter what you read hear.

The game throws you into the dungeon with no tutorial so you are going to find your self dying quickly but I think it this challenge of the game that make it so enjoyable unlike most games of today if you die you have to start again. there is a "save" but this is only so you can take a break if you die the save is deleted and you have to start again, This can be annoying but it also makes you want to play it again and again.\n\nYou start the game by choosing one of four characters warrior, wizard, assassin and shaman then you are in the game. from this point onward your goal is to kill monsters to get money to buy better stuff to kill more monsters  and repeat. you do all this so you can get further down in the dungeon in a wild hope that you might really beat the game. alone the way you find shops to spend your money, random boss's and the odd chest if you're lucky. then from you lose track of your health and die. then you press new game and give it another go  and after a few 100 goes you might really win and then you will do it all over again with the other three characters.\n\nover all I think this game is one of the rare case's of getting more than you are paying for because than game is simple fun and something you can sit back on a lazy Saturday and play for hours not caring about the world and for £3.99 I don't think you're going to get much better. The only thing that I would want to improve in the game in small thing like  customs characters and making it so when I equip armour it shows up on my character it seems a shame it get a cool new golden bow and it now show up in my characters hand, but apart from that I cant put the game down great fun small price the way a 16-bit game should be.","April 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sounds easy right? No. For some reason the "easy" difficulty is harder than most games i find difficult to play. You get two-shotted by bosses on Normal mode and the only good character is the ranged one because they can't directly attack you from afar unless they are mages or archers themselves. You spend two hours on a regular run and you probably won't finish the game in this time because you die by the bosses since a crit does like 60% of your HP for some reason- and in higher difficulties a crit would end your run.\n\nDo i reccomend this game? Yes, it's so much fun. But only if you don't mind having to start over again. Basic combat that everyone can understand sounds horrible, but it's actually not that bad as it looks on paper and fits the game very well. The graphics are very nice for a pixely game and the music really gives a nice ambience, even while it sounds so... stupid?\n\nTrust me, you will spend an hour, die, probably not play the game again for a couple of hours or even a day and do another attempt on it the next day. You will try your *ss off so hard that you will ragequit over and over again, but you still want to see that booty when you finish the game. You will get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you open a door and a boss shoots at you or uses magic at you and crits you, making you lose the game. But you will come back. And you will pick the archer 90% of the time since you hate the other guys being f*cking more hardcore than hardcore hardcore. You will deny your gf for sex because you you are so far playing this game and you haven't died yet...\n\nBuy it.. Buy it now..

You need to go farm the floor after just to get a few more levels before facing the boss of the prievious floor. Why?\n\nMelee characters are weak as fuuu compared to mage and rogue. Even rogue gets super weak very fast. I managed to get floor 8 with the wizard and died of a boss which was right at the door and managed a single lucky crit. Also, I don't know for the others, I had nearly one million gold before I died, and I never had anythingt good in shop beside once or twice I got a doom key (which are kinda rare) Otherwise, I always got mana potions because the mana regen ridiculously slow.\n\nMonsters in general are relatively easy to beat other than some floors where the difficulty increase very quickly (I think of floor 5 I think with the vampires)\n\n\nThere is too many little things that irks me. It could definenately be better. Like some others said, there are better roguelike games out there.

My first run I tried out the archer who can hit anything he can see while they slowly creep towards him. As soon as I figured that out, I never got hit again. The most difficult part of being an archer is finding shopkeepers to sell all your loot so your inventory isn't full anymore. Not that you need any loot, all you need is  the sleep spell, which as far as I can tell puts anything you want to sleep such that it cannot act until you kill it, which is how i beat every boss.\nI played again as the warrior to see what it'd be like to play something that couldn't just kill everything before taking damage. I still quickly became a god, though I had to use health potions at first. Luckily I found the warrior's version of "sleep" within the first 5 minutes. Only this version is an AoE shout wth a 95% success rate which paralyzes everything until you kill it. However, this time I did not succeed on my playthrough. This time I walked into a room and was promptly frozen by some random non-boss mob, I couldn't move or heal or do anything but watch it slowly kill me after hitting me several times. As far as I can tell, there is a random mob who can instantly kill you from any range no matter how strong you are. The only thing you can do is not be unlucky, or just play an archer.\nI didn't try the other two classes, but if they don't both have the ability to at least instantly kill everyboss for free then they are severely underpowered. If you still feel compelled to play this, probably try either the mage of the druid (though im sure the mage has something and wouldn't be surprized if the druid did all the same.)\n\nThe only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. That's actually what drew me to play again, something about them I us find very appealing. Even though the gameplay is terrible, at least it's fast paced enough such that if you don't think about it it's still kinda fun. I would however suggest you move along after looking at the screen shots.","March 30, 2014","false","2.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This game is as binary and dumbed down as a game can get as far as a dungeon crawler is concerned.  To me it felt more like a game you'd buy on a phone not a Steam game.\n\nYou walk your character into enemies and either they kill you or you kill them....eat what little food you have and if you are unlucky enough to stumble onto a boss room you are pretty much dead no matter what.   Theres no way to close a door or make a boss activate a trap and gain an advantage its either you are stocked up on large heals or you are dead.\n\nWhen i think of Roguelike games i expect difficulty but i also want experience and skill to also play a part in how well i do.  This game is almost entirely based on luck and nothing else and it irritates me that you just need to repetedly die until you get the right amount of luck for you to even have a chance of a "good run" to start.\n\nI was looking for a deep fun RPG roguelike and what i got was a tablet game for kids.","March 28","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeoneAlreadyHasMarsify/recommended/270050/","SomeoneAlreadyHasMarsify","Marsify","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeoneAlreadyHasMarsify/","264 products in account","I'll start by saying I'm a big fan of the rogue-like dungeon crawler genre and I could play some of these games for hours on end. Normally I don't really have a problem with games like this being simple since I only paid a dollar for it (Normally costing five) but even so I didn't enjoy it.\n\nWhen you first start the game you get to choose from four classes and I assume those are the only ones you can get. Your choices are warrior, wizard, archer, and shaman. Pretty typical choices. Be warned however that if you choose the archer the game becomes extremely boring and somewhat easy until you have to fight a boss. You simply stand at a very very large distance away and clearing rooms becomes a snap... Wizard normally uses abilities instead of melee combat which makes sense, but sometimes it takes a really long time to obtain any spells. And if it does then you're boned. Warrior and shaman are the two classes that make the game somewhat entertaining. Also I should point out that for some reason the game does not start you on easy or even normal, but instead hard mode. It took me a few play throughs to figure that out, but there doesn't seem to really be much difference between easy, normal, and hard.\n\nThe game is very simple and the absolute basic of these types of games with nothing additional added except for maybe the quests which can give you a major advantage for very little challenge. Perhaps there's even LESS than what these types of games normally has. I found out that there is no wait function, none at all. Perhaps I overlooked something but the only way that I found to wait for enemies is to open and close the doors. When I say there's nothing redeeming about this game I mean there really is nothing. It has no uniqueness to it. It does have really lame and terrible humor that they sort of just throw in to make the game have some appeal, which it doesn't do.\n\nAnd another thing is the music... This is literally the most unfitting music I have ever heard for a video game. When I first started playing it sounded like the background music for a rain forest, not a dark dungeon. It's not that the music is necessarily BAD, it does get really repetitive after a while and there's not a very wide selection but it's somewhat bearable. Except for the shopkeeper music. If you manage to find a shopkeeper somehow it plays this annoying loop that repeats over and over until you leave the room. I had to mute my computer while I was in the shop as so I wouldn't go insane.\n\nThe last function that I'm going to complain about is the sign in the starting room. I got pretty far in through the first dungeon and I was doing exceedingly well when I accidentally clicked the sign. It killed me. Instantly. No warning, nothing saying 'This sign will kill you!' and no explanation. I just died. I thought maybe it was a bug or maybe I wasn't paying attention and I was poisoned or something, but nope. There's just a sign that if you click it it will kill you for no reason.\n\nOverall this game is very boring, not unique in any way, the music is unfitting, and it is very unbalanced. I wouldn't call it worth a dollar, definitely not five. Maybe if this were on app store for the iPhone or google play store then I might pay 99 cents for it. Maybe.","December 21, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played a few rounds with different classes and my success with a character was entirely dependent on if I got a good spell or weapon within the first floor. Otherwise I found that as soon as I encountered a boss my options were reduced to dying. What really upset me was a play through as the archer. I got to floor 8 and I was essentially a god. I was mashing former bosses into pieces, and I one or two shot everything, and I was generally untouchable. Then I run into some weird mage, and it ♥♥♥♥ing one shots me! I'm fine with a bit of diffaculty, but that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. A one shot should never happen in a game like this where your ability to react to such things is minimal at best.\n\nI guess to sum up if you've got a couple bucks, and a couple hours to kill go for it. It's not bad, but the game doesn't seem to have a consistent diffaculty curve, and you can easily find an entire hour wasted because of some random one shot.\n","December 28, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am going to go ahead and give my review because I don't really want to spend more time on the game unless it is fixed. Maybe with the beta that is out, but I could care less.  The game looks great and it has great appeal. The classes are fun to play, and the skill books throughout  the game give the characters a good edge. The main disappointment about this game is that the bosses are extremely overpowered, and do a good double the damage that you do to them. You also have minimal health compared to them. But they are also easy to kill because all you have to do is run around the sides of the room with them following you, so that you can heal. Pointless. A good solution to this would be that the only way you can heal would be a wait button, you hold it to heal and you stand there while stuff happens around you.\nAnother bad thing about this game is that NOTHING happens around you. You leave the room, everything stands there with their thumbs up their butts. Come on, make them do something.\nWhile playing my first character I looked at the sign with the skull on it, and it killed me instantly. Pointless?\nI played a second character and walked around for a good while, beat the first floor with the boss run-away technique. Tried to go to the second floor and the game crased, erased my data. Just my cup of tea\nMade a third character, a warrior. The game gets pretty simple when you get the roar attack that makes enemies scared, because you beat on them all you want. I got to floor four I think, and then stepped into the stairs on accident, game crased and erased my data. Dandy.\nEdit: I have mad numerous more characters, almost all of them have died the same way, wizards freezing me continuously. This is absolutely ridiculous and there is almost no way to counter it.\nNeedless to say, this game requires A LOT of work.\n1.) Fix the healing run, or make bosses easier.\n2.) Fix the crashing.\n3.) Make inventory stuff stack, it's annoying having 8 chicken legs in your inventory.\n4.) Stop the intro crap. I don't want to look at that every time I start a game.\n5.) Fix the spam freeze.\n6.) Make characters change with different gear. Maybe even make it more complex, instead of seeing the same art for two different swords.\n7.) Some sort of auto-save, cause the crashes cause erasing of data\n\n3/10\n\nBut as far as I see it, the game is unplayable because of its unbalanced combat, freezing, and general annoyances, and I don't see myself coming back to play it anytime soon, and would classify it as an unpolished turd.","January 11, 2015","false","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's pretty cheap. It's a pretty small download, and launches very quickly, and uses mimimal CPU and pretty low RAM. And it works on Linux and Mac as well as Windows.\n\nOn the minus side, everything else. I can't imagine why anyone would recommend this game unless they'd never played another roguelike—and if you've never played a roguelike, there are much better ones to start with, including free ones, so don't buy this one and inflict it on other people. This is basically a roguelike, minus all the things that make roguelikes fun. I'm not expecting every game to be Nethack or Zangband, but it should at least have as much depth as the original Rogue, or why waste your time?\n\nThere are effectively two kinds of monsters: the ones you can kill without blinking, and the ones you can't possibly beat head-to-head, but can kill 100% of the time if you circle around an obstacle (or make a bigger circle with teleporters or stairs) healing after each blow. And, since there are no status effects and no actions besides attack and 9 skills/class that you will mostly not use, that's pretty much all there is to the tactics.\n\nAs for larger strategy--well, there is none. Min/maxing your character is as impossible as it is pointless—yes, there are a ton of stats, but you can't even _see_ them, much less influence them, whatever they do is opaque and largely undiscoverable, and they don't even seem to affect the game much anyway. Exploration is straightforward, because there are no real choices—there's always exactly one path between any pair of rooms, no cycles anywhere; there are no wide vs. narrow corridors, or different kinds of entrances to deal with; the only real difference between any room and any other room that matters is whether they have something to circle around or not. I suppose there are keys, and sometimes you won't have the key you need, but it's not like the key will be somewhere interesting on the level (which would at least make it as complex as Doom…); you just have to slog your way back through the previous levels hoping one of the shopkeepers will have randomly gotten the key you want, so that's just annoying, not challenging.\n\nBeyond the basic control scheme, some things are incredibly tedious (like selling most of your inventory to a shopkeeper—mouse to the item, click, mouse to the Sell button, click, repeat 30 times). There are some keyboard shortcuts, but not for any of the parts where you'd want them.\n\nAlso, the graphics aren't really "16-bit", except for the title screen. Yes, the tiles are the same resolution as late-80s sprites. But they aren't particularly SNES-looking, or inspired in any way. And they're just static tiles; you don't get the cheesy step animation, multi-level parallax scrolling, different-sized sprites on the same screen, palette animation, or other effects that define the 16-bit look. What it _does_ look like is one of the early tilesets for the old roguelikes—and if you want that, you can play one of those games.\n\nAlso, while the game does a pretty good job keeping its resource use low, on a laptop with switchable GPUs (at least on Mac or Windows) it'll force you onto the discrete GPU and burn through battery power anyway. Not the developer's fault (I'm sure it runs just fine on a typical Intel integrated GPU, but both OS's are overzealous about switching…), but still a shame.","April 11, 2015","false","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has the monotony of bad dungeon crawlers paired with the permanent deaths of roguelikes resulting in a boring game that you will have to grind through each time you start over. It's really dull, there's no clear cut objectives or incentives to really do anything. Occasionally you'll get a quest but all the quests  I've encountered have pretty much been "Find X room in a randomly generated map." So, yeah, the quests are basically hide and seek, usually finding an item or killing a boss.\n\nThe weapon and armor system, class and combat systems are all a joke. Just the most generic randomly generated garbage being offered to you. Whether you're a knight or a mage, the combat is still the most generic and lackluster thing ever. Like, it's really hard to find a dungeon crawler that has exceptionally boring combat as that's the case with pretty much all dungeon crawlers, but this game just feels the worst out of anything I've ever played.\n\nThe end result is a game where you walk around in circles and fight random monsters. Sometimes you find stairs to go a new room to walk around in circles in. There's no incentive to do anything. You don't really change except getting slightly higher stat numbers and occasionally new abilities that don't really amount to much. The fact that this is being sold for $5 is an insult. This doesn't even feel like a game, it feels like a school project that someone didn't finish and got a D+ on.

Getting through the game even on easy can end up being based entirely on luck, especially with the shaman and warrior classes.  It's possible to kill every monster, complete every quest, and acquire all weapons/armor along the way and still end up getting one-hit killed by bosses.  Which suggests using skills should tip the battle in your favor so you don't get critted, but if you're unlucky your skills won't hit with their special effects, and then you're hosed.\n\nThe weapon/armor system is pretty stupid too.  You constantly receive "cracked" and "broken" items.  I don't actually recall seeing an adjective that implies the item is in good condition.  There's no correlation to how 'cool' the item looks and how much it helps you.  You might be wearing a blood sword one minute and find a wooden stick that's +25 damage the next.  It makes no sense at all.\n\nThe differences between easy and hell modes are pretty much nonexistent.  As others have said,  you  can just outrun your enemies until you heal/gain mana/ etc.  You can also lure  enemies on  to traps, so if you're out of mana and don't want to risk being attacked, you can just lure them onto traps over and over and over again until they die.","June 6, 2015","false","29.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Every floor, the mechanics are the exact same - same keys, door, quest, loot, destructible types. Every monster acts the same, can move only one tile (which makes any strategy void, as you can kite anything till your health, cooldown, mana, et cetera recharges) and uses no strategy, not even using range advantage well. There are only regular monsters which are downright boring and uninspired, and never pose a challenge (and only about 2 or 3 types per floor) and boss monsters, which are variations of the same monsters. Either you take them on and hope you have high enough equipment/stats to beat them (using a few spells when available) or you just kite them and use the health regen/cooldown system ad nauseam. That's it. That is the entire game. Nothing more. Despite the low price, I actually feel cheated out of my 2 euro's.

There's still rough edges but the game is heading in the right direction.\n\nThings are changing so fast that I've tried to reduce my review to a set of bad points and then marking them when they are fixed. This way people can see what the original release was like and what steps the dev has taken so far to rectify the situation.\n\n\nThe game itself doesn't teach you how to play or tell you the controls.\n\n[FIXED] No manual\n\n[FIXED] You can't redefine the keyboard controls\n\nWith keyboard you can only pickup from square you're on not around you like mouse\n\nStairs are bump to go up or down them\n\nMap gen can block rooms with stairs\n\n[FIXED] you can bump to smash pots and things, but you can't bump chests to open them or bump little grave like things that give quests or bump shopkeepers to begin trading.\n\nHave to use the mouse to examine objects in your inventory and to use them.\n\n[FIXED] Unclear where the hotspot of the pointer actually is.\n\nYou have to click on items to see their stats. Tooltip would be better\n\n[FIXED] Have to use the mouse pointer for ranged combat\n\n[FIXED] When you open the minimap it obscures the middle of the screen. would be better top right corner\n\nWhen you damage a mob, its lowered hp doesn't show on its hp bar until after it's taken its next turn\n\nResting gives you hp and mp back but there's no rest until full option. You can hit skip a turn (enter) but that doesn't auto repeat, so you would have to spam it far too many times (I'm talking hundreds of times). The best way to get your hp and mp back after fights is to run from side to side of a dungeon over and over again\n\nAlso above means that in boss encounters you can just kite melee bosses in a square and take no damage. Giving bosses diagonal attacks would solve this but would make them a lot harder so it's probably not something you would want to do.\n\n[FIXED]  movement keys auto-repeat almost immediately which I think he's done so people can treat it as a real time game although it's turn-based. This leads to moving twice when you only wanted to move once though.","March 25, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","7"

In normal, sane games like this, you can read the sign for basic controls and such. But in this game, clicking on the sign instantly kills you. The sign doesn't actually say anything. The game doesn't explain what happened. It isn't a brutal early lesson about examining things carefully before risking your character - there's no trap or curse on the sign, it just kills you for NO REASON. Other rogue-likes are prettier, have better interfaces and while they may be random and unforgiving, aren't STUPID like this game.","September 30, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I feel that it lacks any real character of its own; the random qoutes that the enemies say are mostly well placed, but some of them don't fit into the game at all. I found the 'The princess is in another dungeon' qoute laughable, but something like 'you should have taken the blue pill' didn't make sense. I know what it's from, but how does that coincide with this game?\n\nAnother big thing was, no matter how I went about it, I was always killed by something rather stupid. Being hit by a status effect I didn't even know was on me, or be it that stupid sign at the first floor, these deathes were unjustified.\n\nIf this game were to change these sort of things, and scale things better, so I don't run into over powered quest bosses on the second floor, then I'd certainly reccomend this, but as it is, I wouldn't reccomend it to any of my friends.","July 25, 2014","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Clicking anywhere means you run to that location, with no way of stopping it if you misclicked and a boss is coming after your booty.\n\nKeyboard controls aren't very viable for ranged characters, and it's much easier to use the mouse in this case, but you again run into the aforementioned misclicking problem.\n\nObjects like traps can't be clicked on for context menus. Though you can disarm a trap by running over it, it's more of a save roll than an actual attempt to disarm.\n\nItem drops and money are very sketchy. Most of the drops are crap, as is somewhat expected, but then at the same time, you'll get stupid overpowered items more than seems likely. Money drops in 10-40, while items start off in the 2000s range.\n\nAll in all, this is the worst roguelike I've ever played. Don't waste your money.

I get it, it's a rogue-like/retro/classic RPG with a snarky attitude. It's also just plain bad. The original "Rogue" and its character based followers are superior to this game in every respect. But I'm not going to try to wax poetic about why this game stinks. Let me just give a clear list of points that illustrate, very plainly, why this game is deeply flawed.\n\n1. You and everything else have the same move speed. That means that you each move (or preform one action such as attack, open door, drink potion, etc) per turn. The problem with this system is that when you are facing a fight you know, mathematically speaking, you cannot win, you may as well just restart the game then and there. Why? Because you aren't going to be able to out damage what you're fighting and you cannot run away either. Because everything else has the same movement speed, anything that you fight will follow one space behind you... forever. They will chase you through the entire dungeon, always one space behind you (did I mention there is no actual animation in this game either. Just sprites moving along in linear motions along a grid? Yeah. Even NES RPGs had some semblance of animation, but not this "retro" release. But I digress) and when you stop, guess what? You're gonna get hit and die.\n\n2. Health and Mana slowly regenerate on a per turn basis. What this means is that after you've cleared a room, you can just spam WASD (moving one space=one turn) and pace around for a little while, to get your health back. It will regenerate to full, if you are patient enough. It doesn't take long enough to be a great nuisance to do, but it's not so quick either that it's not annoying. The main issue with this though is that it completely makes the inventory system, complete with food, health and mana potions, totally useless. You don't need to drink or eat anything because you'll always just be able regain health and energy after you've completed a room. As for actually using the potions and such in combat? That too isn't really practical because anything that you're fighting that you'd need to drink a potion for is going to kick your ♥♥♥ regaurdless of how much you drink. That's the biggest problem in this game. You're either gauranteed success or failure the moment you walk into a room. Either way it's just as boring.\n\n3. The actual combat is really boring. For the wizard you're always going to be better off using your spells but your mana runs out. But, again, that doesn't really matter because you can just walk around for about a hundred turns (so about 20 seconds) to get all the mana and health you lost back. The knight is just awful. All you can do is hit stuff and then let it hit you, walk around, get back health, repeat.\n\nI think I've made my points very clear. There are still a few bugbears though. For example, there are bear traps scattered throughout some of the rooms. Why? No reason. The player can easily avoid them, the enemies can't knock the player into them nor can the player use them to his advantage. Why are they there? No clue, but it's just a little aspect that really shows how little thought, effort, play testing, and just plain common sense went into this game.\n\nThis is an absolutely boring, cliched, uninspired game that still somehow thinks it has the right to mock the player on death (such as flashing "Seriously?" and "Let's just pretend this never happened" in red when the player dies) and ask "leaving so soon" when trying to quit the game. Yes, I am leaving and I will not be returning. If this were just a little flash game on Newgrounds or whatever, I'd take it as a budding game maker spreading his wings and getting his barings in. But charging actual money, no matter how little, is rediculous. Take those couple of bucks this game costs, go to a McDonalds, and get something to eat off the dollar menu. Trust me, that alone will give you far more joy and satisfaction than this game ever could.\n\n1/5, the only redeeming value is that the music is not totally ♥♥♥♥.","September 8, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Bosses are about the only thing that require any thought or effort (and the ones I met still never came close to killing me - they just required the use of skills).\n\nRandom dungeons? Sort of. Yes, the dungeons are random, but they ALL follow the exact same pattern of hub and spokes. If you go out a 'spoke' you won't find any way to connect to the spokes next to it - except by going back to the hub.  You will NEVER find a circular route.  So, explore north, come back to the middle along the same path, explore east, come back to the middle along the same path, explore south, etc. You will NEVER find a path that connects from center to north to east back to center.

The difficulty level is high and this game will punish you if you don't take it seriously. Since it’s a rouge-like, or perma-death, you start with a new character each game.\n\nCons/Changes id like to see\nThere are only four characters. Also they should have called the assassin an archer and just added rouge in place of the assassin (just my opinion). The classic character classes are covered, but I’d like to see more. Possibly characters rewarded for beating bosses (reaching a lower floor) or a character tree for each class that unlocks the more you play. You could add strengths balanced by weaknesses to fine tune the character (basically character creation).\n\n\nAll in all this game is amazing, and I would have happily paid more for it.
