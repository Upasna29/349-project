"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigblindguy/recommended/425720/","bigblindguy","BigBlindGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigblindguy/","143 products in account","Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a game that I bought excited about a multiplayer game that you just pass the HMD to the next person. That is not in the game yet but will be coming with a future update. I still enjoyed the game although I don’t really have the patience for it and some of the holes are frustrating.\n\nPros:\nAfter hitting the ball you can press the trigger button and instantly warp to your balls current location. This is perfect and necessary for a game like this.\nControls felt good, after a couple test swings I felt like I knew exactly how hard I need to hit it. The haptics on the controller were spot on as well.\nGood course design. I personally like the simple wholes like you would find at an actual minigolf place but if you are a fan of wacky and difficult this game will cater to you as well.\nGraphics are well done.\nCons:\nFrustrating at times, I played hole that had a Par of 42??? It was fun for maybe the first 5 or 6 hits then it was just annoying and I was swinging like a madman trying to finish it. It may be I don’t have the patience for it, I am sure some people will love it.\nNo spectator mode: If you have people that are trying to watch your game on the TV/Monitor it will only show what the person playing is looking at so it ends up being really shakey and not enjoyable to watch. I am not sure how they could fix this maybe incorporate a 3rd person spectator mode.\nTLDR:\nThe game is fun don’t get me wrong. I recommend it on a sale, but personally I only like about half of the holes. The simple ones are a lot of fun but holes that are just crazy and have par 42 were not enjoyable and made me lose my patience. There is not a whole lot of content as of writing this review but I hope with future updates and free DLC more content and courses are added. I think if the Devs made the courses more like 3D Ultra Minigolf it would be fantastic, I think it would be cool to have multiplayer where you could use powerups and such it would make it an insane party game.\n","April 6","true","0.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room. The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons. rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend. It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player. It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this.","May 12","true","2.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There are a lot of great VR games out there but Cloulands has the highest replay value thus far.The controls feel spot on, although, staring down at your feet can start to give you a bit of a neck cramp if you play this game in long sesssions. The game has an online mode but at the time of writing this it is a ghost town, so don't expect too much competition. I'm looking very forward to the course editor which should add even more replay value to this game. Bottom line is, if you're going to spend $20 on a VR game this is the way to go, a lot of games for the same price out there feel more like a proof of concept and not a complete game.\n\nWarning to any achievement completionists out there, this game has a few bugged achievements that I cannot get to unlock no matter how many times I complete the criteria.","May 3","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Boasting a solid put mechanic, intuitive room-scale and click-to-teleport locomotion, this game is definitely up to par. I have not tried any user generated content yet, the official course has kept me more than happy. The gameplay feels very realistic, though getting your stroke down can be a bit trying as you don't have the weight of an actual club. This game delivers on the familiarity of minigolf while adding elements only available in a digital format- such as moving blocks, cannons, fans, and other obstacles that would be either impossible or impractical in the real world.\n\nPros:\n+Great headtracking, room-scale, and click-to-teleport locomotion.\n+Official course is very well designed and a pleasure to play.\n+Feels like the real thing.\n+Pleasing visuals.\n+Putting is consistent once you get a feel for the motion range.\n\nCons:\n-Local multiplayer is workable, but a hassle. Not really recommended as a party game since you're going to be constantly having to adjust the straps. God forbid someone is wearing glasses and you have to adjust the lenses too.\n-My localisation appears to be broken. I get random chinese characters on some menu elements and buttons. This is not a gamebreaking issue though since the menus are intuitive enough to guess and get by.\n-Would be nice if they could introduce a control mechanic to ghost/materialize your club. Theres been times where I've accidentally hit the ball while I'm just trying to look around.\n-Casual players can become frustrated at the difficulty of some holes, bringing down the mood of the group. Nobody likes failing infront of their friends.

The local multi-player works by trading the headset off with the other players after you have completed your hole, so it doesn't require you to trade off the headset after every shot which is good because it would likely lead to a lot of fatigue and annoyance trying to put the headset on and off. Only downside to this is that you can't hit your friends golf balls when they're in your way (since the hole is finished for them) on the course which I'm sure would lead to some funny situations. The online multilayer is not available yet so I will update my review later when that is released.\n\nYou can set up the course for a full 18 or a random 9. I'd recommend going for the random 9 if you have 4 people playing because it takes a long time to get through 18. We stopped after we got past the 9th hole because it was getting late (it took an hour and a half.)\n\nI haven't had the chance to check out the course editor.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that you can accidentally hit your ball if the club hits it as you're switching the controller over to the next player. Only advance to the next person's turn when they are fully ready. Devs: perhaps add the option to make the club semi transparent and unable to hit the ball unless you're gripping one of the grip buttons on the side of the Vive controller. It would increase the presence because you have to 'grip' the controller in real life as one would do with an actual putter.\n\nThat being said, even without the online multilayer being available and without trying the course editor, I think this is worth the price especially considering a round of mini golf in your local area would likely cost a lot more just for one round if you and 3 of your friends all wanted to play (not to mention all the possible parking fees, crying babies, allergies, loud noises, falling into stagnant ponds, and alligators that you'll have to deal with.)","April 15","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The ability to move your head and look around the course is extremely immersive.  After you hit the ball you can take a few steps to the side and watch the ball navigate the course... that is so cool.\n\nThis game is like playing Mini-golf in The Witness environment, I really like the visual style.  Hitting the ball and swinging the club is extremely polished and feels great.  I love how they implemented the club in your hands.  The levels are great, I want more but I also want to replay the Full 18 dozens of times to perfect my score.  There were plenty of places where it felt like you were just taking random skillless swings but that is just like real minigolf.  And your neck will get sore staring down at the ball which is just like real minigolf!  You will even get frustrated with your shots and continually bat the ball forward just like real minigolf!\n\nThere are some bugs, primarily I don't know why it shows the floor grid even after I select "Don't show the grid" from the options menu.  Also when you center the player on the ball it seems like sometimes it doesn't place you centered on the ball.  I haven't figured out what is happening there.  The music is also extremely repetitive.  Is the music sample only 1.5 seconds long placed on loop ("dut dun dun dunnn DUN" is repeating in my head over and over and over)?  Maybe add an option where you can't swing unless you are standing above the actual course (versus floating off-course), this would add to the challenge associated with landing a shot near the walls.  You could implement it the way The Gallery does when you walk out of the game area.\n\nWith these minor issues the game is still fantastic.  This is one of the small handful of VR games that I will come back to every day.  I highly recommend!","April 18","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even worse, sometimes it records a stroke even though the ball didn't move.\n- Often you hit the ball out and instead of dropping the ball where you last hit it, it puts it at the location prior to that.\n- In my last game, the ball became lodged in a barrier.  I lost 5 or 6 strokes on the last hole just to get it unstuck.  What a great score I would have had. :(\n\nAlso, I wish there were more courses, but please no more like hole 11.

If you hate Minigolf, you'll hate this game. Nuff said...\n\nLong Review:Cloidlands: VR Minigolf is as close to playing real Minigolf as you're gonna get (hence the short review).\n\nPros:\nIt's Minigolf in VR.\nThe distance the ball goes relative to the power in your swing feels accurate.\nGreat graphics. The pics on the steam store page accurate.\nBetter than real life Minigolf in the sense that if a ball is close to a wall, you can wack the ball through the wall instead of having to nudge it away.\nThere's local and online multiplayer, a rare feature in VR games. For local multiplayer, you give the headset to someone else when it's their turn, and online multiplayer just works.\nNice variety in the holes.\n\nCons:\nThere's only one course of 18 holes (as of the time I'm writing this). Because of this it doesn't take long to go through the entire game and there's very little replayability.\nNo voice chat in online multiplayer. The Vive has a mic, so there's no reason it shouldn't be in there.\nThis isn't the Devs' fault, but it's a bit odd using the Vive controler as a golf club, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, it works. It's just doesn't feel like a golf club, probably because it isn't.\n\nIn Conclusion:If you love Minigolf, go ahead and buy it. If you hate Minigolf, don't buy it. If you're in the middle, I'd get it on sale. I don't think it's worth the $20 in it's current state (as of the time I'm writing this). If they add more than one course I can see people paying full price for it, but untill then I'd wait till it's on sale for $10 or so.","April 25","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I watched the videos and read the reviews, then decided to try it and it's a great game!  It was way above my expectations.  I've got a 980 TI, a subpar i5 and I've got my Lighthouses way too far apart (close to 20 feet) and I had no stuttering or anything.  The gameplay is actually really fun and a lot of thought and time was obviously put into the courses and the environment.  This isn't a slapped together game, it's pretty polished.  In my opinion, the complaints about the club are more in the nit picking range.  It should probably have an option to ghost the club so you don't accidentally hit the ball, and sometimes the hit registration is a little off if you move the club around too much near the ball (which are easy to avoid once you figure out what causes it), but whether these get fixed or not (Update - It's totally user error, I just played three rounds and never accidentally hit it once, I think it's just that when you start playing, you don't control the club properly), the game is still a great game.  Definitely worth the $20.\n\nUpdating my review.  Just played multiplayer and it's awesome!  So far this is my favorite Vive game.  If you've ever played mini golf and enjoyed it even a little bit, you'll love this even more because you don't have working cannons in regualr mini golf.  If you're a serious golfer, then you probably won't like this because it's mini golf and I'd guess serious golfers wouldn't like mini golf out of principle.\n\nAnother thing too, the game actually looks a lot better in VR than it does in the videos.","May 14","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the maps need to be CRAZY. This is vr minigolf, not actual minigolf, go crazy with the maps. Also the visuals need improvements, I mean the main wall texture is crap. Why? Why not better image effects? Unity has tons of assets to improve your game.\n\ntl;dr; enjoyable, but needs more crazy maps.","May 19","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The future ability to ceate courses should fix some of this...IF we are easily able to d/l the communities work.","May 15","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it connects, other times it just passes right through the ball.  Makes it very difficult on the hills.  Otherwise pretty cool and looking forward to more courses.","May 22","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leoking/recommended/425720/","leoking","Human Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leoking/","212 products in account","This game would be great if it worked. It doesn't work. The club passes right through the ball, or the ball bounces off your club when you haven't made a swing. This happened to me many times due to tracking problems, but often the game teleports you with your club already touching the ball unless you remember to always hold it in the air before teleporting.\n\nIt's doubly annoying when the club passes through the ball because many shots must be timed perfectly and hit hard to clear a ramp or moving obstacle. So you wait... and wait... and then swing, and the club passes straight through. Over and over.\n\nAlso, the sound design. I'm not kidding, I think this is genuinely the worst music I've ever heard in any video game. I mean that. And it's not just the music. The sound design all around is painfully bad. It's literally painful, as in it hurts your ears to play this game, and the volume cannot be adjusted. The music can be disabled but there are no sliders to adjust ambient sounds like constant loud chirping noises, interface sounds like sudden loud door slam when someone leaves a multiplayer session or KNOCK! KNOCK! when someone joins, and so on. It all just sounds bad, and the volume is not balanced. All of this coupled with the actual golfing failing to work more often than not, and what you get is not a relaxing experience. It's horrible.\n\nNow, it seems that development is still taking place on this game. If by some miracle they do change the music, in fact redo all of the sounds, fix the bugs, and add some courses that are maybe more like actual mini-golf, then yes there's the potential for a great game here.\n\nIn fact this is my second time purchasing the game. I first bought it the day I got my Vive, and not long after I got a refund. Incidentally this is the only game I've ever refunded. It was just too broken. But then I heard there had been some patches and I really want to play VR mini golf, so I bought it and tried it again. Mistake. I won't refund it agian: fool me twice shame on me and all that. But, for now at least, I definitely recommend you do NOT buy this game.\n\nTLDR: The sounds are horrible and you can't hit the ball half the time! Ugh!","May 9","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
