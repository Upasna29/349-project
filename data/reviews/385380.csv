"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asuthegeek/recommended/385380/","asuthegeek","AsuMagic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asuthegeek/","20 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been following this game's development for a while now and I have to say a couple things (TL;DR on the end) :\n\nPros :\n- The art is awesome. I didn't see much games with as smooth animations as Planet Centauri. Overall, there is an unique atompshere in Planet Centauri and you won't find it in Terraria or Starbound. Every biome feels different especially thanks to the excellent color managment.\n\n- The engine has a LOT of potential. It can run on toasters and it's not even optimized yet. As a hobbyist developer, even in an early state, it is pretty usable and well designed. Come back in a couple months (/years more probably), and you'll probably get pretty neat modding. Something more evolved than the minimal/nearly useless Starbound modding at least. If it is as nearly moddable as King Arthur's Gold, I'm spending the rest of my life modding this game. Well, probably not my entire life (hopefully).\n\n- The music isn't in a chiptune style, so the game doesn't really fall in the "retro" games box and that's good as it is IMO. The ambiance really matches up what the biomes should give. They're not so much matching my music tastes, but I really like some of the pieces - Shadow Forest is my favourite.\n\n- The developers are really dedicated. I think the lead coder forgot any definition of "holidays" or "week-ends". Don't bother them with such really strange words. Just give a look at the count of their answers (onilink's and Planet Centauri's). There's also an IRC channel on irc.mibbit.net:6667 #centauri if you want to talk out to the lead coder or to some other players (the channel is nearly unpopulated as it is now, come!)\n\n- Planned features. Just look at them by yourself. Even the electronics part, if done well, could be a whole game by itself.\n\n- Multiplayer is coming very soon.\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay is pretty much empty right now. It's being improved over releases, but the game relies more on being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ against enemies (i.e. when locking yourself up somewhere you can attack enemies but so they can't attack you). Some weapons get also overpowered at some point so there will be basically no fun at least until the 2nd underground layer. Pretty sure improving it is one of the devs' focus right now.\n\n- The game lifetime is limited. You can reach up the "end" of the game (i.e. get the dragon scale armor right now, pretty much) in only a few hours. This will improve over releases, of course. But right now, there's nothing interesting apart of building good-looking stuff and making hugefreakingfarms after you've reached a certain level in the game.\nThere's no story right now and when there will be, it won't be the biggest interest of the game. If you're only playing sandbox games to get feels, look for another game.\n\nTL;DR : The game has lots of potential. It looks beautiful. It has an unique ambiance, and is very coherent overall. Don't play it if you want advanced combat gameplay, or a story, in the state as it is when I'm writing this message. If this review is a few months ago, please verify the facts I'm stating - They're maybe not true now.","June 3","true","22.6"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","39","40","3","5"

Have you seen how a tree falls ? To the right, and the logs separated into rows. Unlike Terraria, which logs fall from above.\n- TOO HARDCORE.\n- Many promising upcoming features. (I hope we'll get a map since locating way back home was really hard.)\n\nCons:\n- The speed when walking backwards is slow, maybe devs will increase it ?\n- When having 1 block taller than the default ground, you can't automatically step on it without using Space (Jump) ?\n- Underfined items ?? Give them names already, devs ! D:\n- Remember when you Zoom x2 and the GUI got bigger, and you wouldn't be able to read all the words ? And opening Inventory when Zoom x2 is enabled takes up alot of your screen ? Yeah I hate that too Devs need to update the settings to tweak freely.\n- The default Key Binding (Controls) is really frustating. Usually you have to re-enter the keys since you're not used to them.\n- When changing a key, Skill UI stays the same. I change my control into WASD but some skill stay as Q+Q; Left Mouse + Q. Which confused me alot. Took me awhile to get used to it.\n- Let's not forget about the resolution settings, shall we ? At the first time running the game, it glitches the fcked out of my screen. Auto-detected or something.\n- Fullscreen borderless means nothing if you don't also tick the Fullscreen option. I ticked F.borderless and no fullscreen.\n-You can't move the borderless window. What the hell dev ?\n\n- This probably is a bug: No matter how much time you spend to customize your character, it'll always look as same as the Default male/female avatar. (Top left) My character has blonde hair yet the avatar displayed it blue.\n\n- Probably another bug: Stuck at Magic quest 33% (Gather 8 wood, 6 wisp dust, craft enchanment book, make "Fireball" spell, etc.) I completed these above and yet no reward. Still stuck at 33%.\n\n- Crashed while browsing Completed quests.\n\nI'll continue to update this review, since I've only experienced the game for less than 20 hours.","June 3","true","10.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","27","31","4","0"

Other positives are Pet taming, rescuing NPCs and manually setting them tasks/Jobs at your home, and small randomly found challenge portals.\n\nThe Developers have been consistently adding new content to the game, and now that it is finally in Early Access release I am very eager to see the further developments and content.  The biggest issue that seems to persist is that it's an "Alt+Tab wiki" game.  Just like similar games of it's ilk you will find yourself alt tabbing to search for information and instructions on webpages instead of from within the game.\n\nIs this better than Terraria?   No.  Terraria will always be number one to me.   But this game easily earns second place and does it with Style, creativity and just plain (familar) fun.\n\n\nRecommended.","June 3","true","30.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saiyer/recommended/385380/","Saiyer","Saiyer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saiyer/","298 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I first saw this game on Steam it looked like a copy of Starbound and/or Terraria. But unlike some people, I'm okay with a game using elements from other games I like. Instead of waiting for Starbound 1.0 or Terraria 2, I get to play a new game with a different team of devlopers taking it to it's own direction.\n\nOut of the Early Access games I have (see my profile)  this is one of the most polished ones in terms of bugs. It isn't perfect but it's very much playable with very little interuption.\n\nCombat is pretty straight forward and basic until you get transformations and tamed creatures. The transformations work like you'd expect, you gain the traints of that creature (including flying) and taming creatures is very similar to Pokemon in that you need higher tier capture items to capture certain ones (well pokemon is more RNG but it follows a similar concept on creature power vs. capture power. Oh, and there are custom spells. I'd love to see more 'types' added to how the elements work but the spells are indeed custom where you craft them with different stats like "Speed, size, direction, damage, etc..." all of which change the level of the spell and thus require higher gems you must find and craft in order to create the spell.\n\nContent is still pretty lacking (when compared to Terraria and Starbound which have been worked on for years) but it's still enough to dig a solid few hours in and have an idea of where this game wants to go.\n\nI'm really looking forward to see where this game goes as it feels like Terraria with Starbound's fancy elements. Both of which are things I like and want to see more of.","June 3","true","9.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajunj/recommended/385380/","cajunj","Cajun J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajunj/","18 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHonestly, Terraria never "stuck" with me when I tried it. But for whatever reason, this game is more to my suiting. The fact that pretty much everything is readily available to unlock at your own pace and starting up has a healthy amount of options makes this pretty nice to pick up and play. Of course I expect there to be much more once this game picks up, but I like it nonetheless. I have to say the game feels pretty robust in terms of controls and movement especially.\n\nRegarding that, this game has peaked my imagination with possibilities. While it's far too soon for such an ambition, I'd would absolutely love some sort of mode where you can edit and create your own biome, through a grid-based system. This game is already a good survival-builder game, but it could also be an amazing Metroid-vania esque creator. Imagine building an entire world-wide dungeon to share with others. It's something I wanted from Minecraft, but I feel could be perfected here and really set it apart from other games.\n\nAgain, it's too soon and ambitious but I hope you guys take it into consideration. Either way I look forward to this game expanding in the future and I hope it rises to top. It's got real potential.","June 4","true","10.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

If you are a fan of the genre its a no brainer and even if you are not usually a person that takes to these type games then this is the one to pick up and start playing.

You might come across a few things you don't know but they are generally pretty easy to figure out.\n\nThe features that are in it currently are pretty fun to play with but are definitely works in progress.\n\nIn its current state, there are still bugs to be squashed and you'll find more than a few as you play.\n\nAll in all, this game has quite a journey ahead of it to get to the glory the Devs have promised. As it is, it's very much enjoyable and if you like games such as Terraria, Starbound, or Crea, or even if you've never played any game similar to this, I highly recommend this game.","June 5","true","47.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's great and all, but I've seen a few bugs/things that should be fixed:\n-backspace key doesn't work when naming character or world\n-no need for a hoe\n-flowers can be placed on wood platforms\n-when breaking rocks, they're labelled as "A rock", even though multiple are required\n-speaking of rocks, rocks grow like grass, which is something that is just too unrealistic, even for a game\n-when breaking blocks in the background, the auto-break function will primarily target foreground blocks\nI found all of these in the first 50 minutes of gameplay, but I can see this game being a huge success in the future","June 3","true","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There's some feature of both game with many more that you don't have in any of those game.\n\nIts really nice to play this game, lots of thing to craft already, many cool monster, some taming that look nice (But did not experimented it already), Some NPC to save to asign them for a job in your village (Not experimented yet), You can transform yourself into a monster (Look cool, not experimented :P)...

I understand that this game is in early access and I would definitly reccomend this game if this was as advertised because personally the video and screenshot are awesome. Sadly as of now at the current state this game just does not meet the expectations and I am thankful for the steam refund system.

I would recommend this game to friends but in current state I would not. This game is as it says early access. Combat in this game is only running forward and slashing hoping that you don't die. It moves too fast and it takes skill to stay alive for more than a couple seconds at night. I don't like the lack of a good crafting menu. It takes forever to scroll through all of the items and the alternative ways to craft them. The automatic cursor mode has problems. When you are breaking blocks ahead of you on a slope it takes some finagling and the blocks will not break the way you need them to on the first try. The resolution setting is buggy. This game's camera positioning is far away and everthing is small. When you change the resolution the game sometimes crashes. The skills that you attain with souls are a little too reachable. I unlocked them all in only a couple hours. Though I would have to say the thing that bothers me most is the way that you plant seeds You throw them? This is awful. They've already patched the game on the day of release. I see a dedication to a growing community from this company and I look forward to what this game will be. The seed thing won't kill me. I just wish that it was more accurate. The spouts are nearly impossible to see. So I can't tell if I skipped spaces until they start growing... The game is still playable and I could probably go on about little things wrong with it and what can be improved forever. This game is still enjoyable. This game definitely needs work but I think that with time this game can and will improve... I would give this game 3 stars... Not great... Not awful...","June 3","false","7.3"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","18","46","2","14"
