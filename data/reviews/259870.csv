No joke.\n\nI discovered OMG Zombies! on the PSP, which only has a screen size of 4.3 inches. I am 47 years old, which means my eyes don't work as well as they used to. I should have known better. This game is so addictive that I literally spent somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to ten hours playing it. Continuous. I finished the game, deleted my save, finished the game, deleted my save, and kept right on playing. As a result, I had a massive headache, and the inner lining of my left eye separated, as the ophthalmologist put it, "like peeling off a sticker." My eye filled with thousands of tiny,  black dots (which were actually quite beautiful and which, I later was told, was blood inside the eye). It required laser surgery to repair, and I was told to avoid using the eye and not to lift anything. Two weeks later, it separated again (because I was being foolish and started using the PSP again). I told you all of that in order to tell you this: I regret nothing.\n\nNothing!\n\nOMG Zombies (which I've just found on Steam in a bundle that did not interest me, but which I had to purchase just in order to share my opinion of the game) is one of those games that offers amazingly simple mechanics, but creative, open-ended strategy (okay, strategy-lite). You are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, you only have three bullets (to start), and you need to completely clear the area of dozens --sometimes, hundreds-- of zombies. Sounds impossible, and it would be were it not for the fact that there are many different types of zombies, and each type behaves differently. Some explode, some shoot rounds off upon dying, some dissolve into pools of acidic goo that, in turn, dissolve any zombie that steps into said pool. Clearing each area awards a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum medal and, with it, different monetary bonuses that allow you to upgrade the zombies, yourself, or the environment (such as exploding barrels).  As the levels progress, zombies gain hit points (requiring more damage to kill), and different combinations of zombie type, as well as environmental hazards, appear.  You can replay each area to try to gain a  higher award.\n\nLet me tell you this: There are few things more satisfying than selecting one specific zombie, firing off a round, and watching it set off a chain reaction that decimates every (un)living thing on the screen.  So powerful was the need to do this, that I kept resetting after completion to see if I could handicap myself.  How far could I get in the game without purchasing a single powerup (pretty far, as it turns out, although killing every zombie in the area is all but impossible)? Could I successfully complete the game upgrading only soldier zombies? What if I played the game while only upgrading my weapon?\n\nDigital crack, I say. Blind in one eye. BLIND in one eye!!  And still, I played.\n\nThe Steam version adds three more zombie types (the Mortar, Runner, and Zapper), and the graphic novel story presentation, which offers some beautiful artwork, has been expanded. All of that said, the Steam version unfortunately suffers in its execution (no pun intended). The design of the PSP version is one of the most elegant and sleek I've seen; it's intuitive, and virtually everything you need to see is on one screen. On Steam, it's clunky, waaaay oversized, and confusing. Not only that, but the display resolutions are extremely odd (640x362, 1024x580, and 1920x1088, to name a few), resulting in a level select screen that you can't completely see, no matter the resolution, no matter if the game is fullscreen or windowed. On the PSP, it was easy to tell what upgrades did; here, it's difficult and unintuitive, and that's coming from someone who's played it before (have I mentioned I've played this before?). (EDIT: I've discovered that you can click and drag the level select screen. Maybe a mouseover tooltip would be appropriate for the next patch?)\n\nStill, confusing layout aside, this is a must purchase if this kind of quick-to-pick-up-but-hard-to-put-down game play is your thing (and I suspect you already know if it is). The price is right and, as I said at the start of this review, it's currently bundled for much less. Either way, I'm playing.\n\nUntil I lose both my eyes.\n\n(Just a quick note to give the dev peace of mind: My eye is almost completely healed now. :) No lawsuit is pending, and you have my eternal gratitude for creating such a great game.\n\nYou b*st*rd.)","November 25, 2014","true","25.4"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","88","61","69","30","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hush404/recommended/259870/","hush404","Hush404","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hush404/","532 products in account","In OMG Zombies you take the role of a survivor/shooter, perched on top of something higher than the Zombie horde below you on a 2D single screen, encompassing the various obstacles and challenges of each map. Armed with just a sniper rifle and 3 bullets (which you can upgrade to 6 as you earn cash by completing levels), you are tasked with taking out the entire screen's worth of undead. An impossible task if one bullet equaled one zombie death, but this is where OMGZ's strategy comes into play.\n\nEach and every zombie in the game has a chain reaction ability which helps take out other zombies around it. Some explode, some fire off gunshots of their own, others run through the level screaming (taking out others at their destination), some even melt into acid; all of which helps clear the screen and earn you the higher ranking, providing you with more cash and allowing you to beef up your abilities.\n\nEach level has a Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum medal to acquire, each earning you more cash for upgrades. Don't get discouraged if you can only pull off the lower medal awards at first, it'll become easier once you've spent some of that award money on upgrades. Better medals open up more and more of the 100 levels included and you can go back any time to any level and try for a higher score; some levels being clear-able in a single shot if timed right.\n\nThankfully the mouse is the most precise tool for the shooting, giving you an advantage over it's previous versions (on PSP/Vita). The game runs wonderfully in windowed mode and goes along at such a pace that you can continually go back to it between browsing and chatting if you prefer (which I liked during my play for this review).\n\nWhat unfolds is a game that feels a little over-powering at first, as you clamor to get even a silver medal, then opens up and gives you the upper hand as you progress, only to keep challenging you with levels that make you wonder how even 6 bullets will help you be victorious. Sometimes timing is key and you can sit there with hand on mouse for what feels like forever, trying to line up the perfect chain reaction.\n\nThen when you've completed all 100 levels on platinum, you have the choice to start all over again in a prestige mode, in which you lose all your upgrades and must start from level 1 again. Reminding yourself just how hard it was starting out. If you're brave enough and have some serious time to dedicate to it, the game has an achievement for prestige-ing 20 times over.\n\nThe game isn't a super action romp and you shouldn't get it thinking it is. It's a strategic game that employs a very well ramped difficulty curve which makes for an engaging and addicting experience. I've enjoyed my time with it and feel it's well worth the asking price.","February 13, 2014","true","52.9"," 64 of 88 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","64","88","0","4"

Under normal circumstances, this would make clearing the streets of drooling beings rather simple, but this is video gaming we're talking about. Since when is anything straightforward?\n\nWith all but one of your team having been wiped out, you arrive at the epicenter of the outbreak inexplicably short of ammunition. What this means, soldier, is that you have three bullets to deal with the undead horde, and have to set off chain reactions to rid the streets of this menace.\nNot all zombies are created equal, and some have more explosive energy, while others loose off a few rounds of their firearm in their death throes.\n\nThe upshot of a good performance is money, and once you've got enough of the stuff you can set about buying upgrades that, for example, give you more bullets or inflict more damage. Others, meanwhile, grant you more explosive zombies, or increase the radius of their acidic ooze, which generally makes it easier to make a big bloody mess.\n\nAll of this adds up to a monstrously addictive quick-fire affair that utterly nails what on-the-go handheld gaming should be about.","March 7","true","15.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

The game is surprisingly slow and plodding, even given the genre, and it looks absolutely terrible. It's supposed to have your standard indie pixel graphics, but instead it just looks like it's been stretched way too far to look even remotely good.\n\nThe same premise has been done countless times, for free, and in better fashion, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/259870/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","OMG Zombies! is a puzzle game where the idea is to create chains of exploding zombies by firing your weapon at them. Each zombie has a different ability that has a different effect on the chain. Players need to work out the positioning of the zombies, the type of zombies in the level, the layout of the level and the upgrades they may have earned to create the largest chain possible and hopefully rid each level of 100% of zombies.\nThe concept whilst solid does leave a little to luck as well as judgement. The biggest frustration is that a level will have a slightly different layout of where zombies are, so there is no way to work out the best possible combination of shots across various attempts. This means that whilst aiming in the same area may clear 55% of zombies in one go, the next time it may clear 91% it adds an element of randomness that does away with the puzzle element somewhat. That said, it is a minor frustration and replaying levels doesn’t tend to bother you, as you’ll soon find you have lost a lot of time whilst trying to clear each level.\nDepending on how well you do on each level, you are awarded with a bronze, silver or gold medal and a cash prize. Medals earned open up new levels and money can be used to buy upgrades. The upgrades really work well in OMG Zombies too, as not only can you upgrade your weapon, to give effects such as more power, but you can also upgrade barrels so the explosions are greater and affect more zombies. You can also upgrade the various zombie types so that their abilities have better effects.\nThere are loads of levels each with slightly different themes and layouts, so despite the simplicity of the concept there are a good few hours of gameplay here, especially if you plan on getting 100% on each level. Doing so isn’t easy either, as there will be times when you’ll hit a massive chain, have two bullets left, but have three zombies to kill who are not even close to each other.\nOverall OMG Zombies is a fun little time waster. Despite the randomness of layouts on levels, when you hit a mammoth chain the feeling is great. The fresh undead types and overhauled visuals will offer something new for seasoned slayers, while the sheer satisfaction of the core gameplay loop will delight newcomers.","June 29, 2015","true","8.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I wasn’t entirely thrilled to feature another apparent mindless zombie game on Steamified. The genre has been done to absolute death – pun semi intended. Then I saw the entire first page of reviews were thumbs down (at least to me) and I thought “Oh, great… Here we go again.” For someone who really tries not to go into any game to be featured on Steamified without too many preconceptions I knew that I was going to be full of them this time around. And yes, I had heard of the game prior to the creation of the site.\n\nThe game starts with a comic book style presentation that introduces the game, its story, characters and the setting. It’s actually pretty neat and a very nice touch. It certainly immerses you into the game in a smart manner. The action then gets underway and we discover a game that is easy to learn and pretty difficult to master until you’re very comfortable with how the plethora of different zombie types splatter. The object with each shot is to create the greatest chain reaction. Every zombie that you kill does a different thing upon death. For example, you might have a police zombie that will fire bullet(s) in different directions and for each bullet that hits another zombie will cause that zombie to perform its splatter pattern which may be creating a pool of zombie matter that destroys every other zombie that touches it, etc. In order to advance further into the game you need to kill a certain percentage of zombies on each level.\n\nThankfully to aide your zombie killing spree there are upgrades. Each level that you successfully complete will give you a reward in the form of cash that you can spend on getting upgrades. You can upgrade your weapons or you can upgrade the different zombies and have their damage increase over total damage, time, distance or even increase their population, Upgrading your weapons allows you to even have more bullets at your disposal. It’s a good upgrade system and one in which you will have to strategically plan for which upgrades will benefit your playstyle the most.\n\nI really enjoyed the time that I spent with OMG Zombies! It’s not the greatest game in the world but it’s certainly one where given it’s level structure you can spend a few minutes just firing away on zombies and have a bit of relaxing fun over a short period. In that respect it’s a pretty solid game. It achieves what it sets out to achieve and on that basis I can recommend it.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and curation please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","true","4.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

And it wants you to do this as efficiently as possible. Your bullets ricochet off of zombies and the zombies that get hit will explode or emit lightning, or shoot bullets, for example, killing other zombies in the process. So it involves some strategy, but also luck, because the zombies walk around freely. This makes it hard to hit enough other zombies sometimes.\n\nThere are 100 levels in total and each one rewards you with a medal and money. Money that can be spent on upgrading your gun or zombies (that's right, you can upgrade the zombies; awesome !). You can choose to upgrade your zombies so that bullets from cop zombies will hit more zombies, or that explosions will be bigger and timers will be extended. Your choice. In the end you need to update them all if you want to platinum every level.\n\nAnd even though there 100 levels, most of them can be finished within minutes. So completing the game will take just a few hours.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best in the world. In fact, I wasn't impressed by them at all. The 2D artwork isn't all that attractive, and the levels are too crudely drawn, as are the zombies. The animations for the zombies are also fairly basic.\n\nBut graphics is not what this game is all about. It's all about the kills. And it feels very satisfying to kill all of the zombies with just one bullet, or see that last bullet kill the last couple of enemies.\nOMG Zombies is a game I'd definitely recommend, even if you had enough of all these zombie games lately. This one is worth it, absolutely.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","February 20, 2014","true","9.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Games with chain reactions can be very nice to play, but you shouldn't waste money on this one. There are way, way better similar zombie games and I was expecting OMG Zombies! to be even better than one of the best out there: Infectionator Dominator (which is free!!).\n\nIt is boring way too quickly as there isn't much progression. What's the goal of the game? Escape the zombies. But most of the time, you fail and die in various ways, until finding the happy ending.\n\nEach level is much the same and most levels are beaten just by sheer luck. Somtimes you use all of your bullets not even getting 50%, even if you wait and wait for the perfect shots. One the next try, you can finish the level Platinum with 1 bullet.\n\nOf course you can upgrade your character and yes, you can upgrade your zombies. Seriously? Isn't this the other way around?\nUpgrading can only be done in a forced order.

The game itself is pretty unique, and has a few interesting ideas...\nOn the other hand, it's very unpolished and often has contradictory mechanics that end up making the game very tedious.\n\nOMG Zombies! is almost like a puzzle game, as it has been said by other reviewers. Each level has a certain layout (there are 100 levels, but much fewer layouts), and a set of zombies. There are several types of zombies, each with a unique destructive ability. Once you kill one, that ability activates, killing more of them around him. It makes for a pretty neat chain effect!\n\nThe most succint way to describe this game is one with very loose mechanics, but very tight objectives.\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, each level has quite a bit of room to breathe, since the zombies start in random positions. Exploding barrels do as well. This makes each restart almost a different level.\nThe game hasn't been carefuly tailored for you. While that has its negatives, it can create some pretty surprising situations and chains that one couldn't predict!\nAnd I like that a lot!\n\nOn the other hand, you unlock level by getting Gold medals on specific levels. These gold medals are awarded for killing 90+% of the zombies in the given level. That's where the randomness and "breathing room" creates a problem. It's often very unlikely to achieve that goal without some starting positions.\n\nAnother problem is how unclear it is the chain that you'll create. Each zombie is moving randomly, and their range isn't very clear. So, it's nigh unpredictable.\nAll of this boils down to luck, in the end.\n\nYou restart until you have a good starting position, and then you try to judge which shot will have the biggest effect.\n\n\n... Then, there's the upgrade system. You upgrade each zombie  with credits you earn from medals. The shinier the medal, the more money you get. This could have been a cool feature, but it fell short for a simple reason:\neach zombie has 3 stats to upgrade, but you don't get to choose which! It's automatic. This stops any possible creativity in upgrading certain zombies in a certain way to develop your playstyle.\nIt's also very grindy in the late game, since you need to perfect almost every level to upgrade everything.\n\n\nThe biggest problem, perhaps, is that there are 100 levels. This is far too much. Simply because the game is pretty repetitive. Lots of similar zombies exploding. The levels tend to get dilluted pretty fast, and instead of creating interesting situations, it's simply tedious to grind through them all.\nNot to mention how perfecting a level often end in you waiting up to several minutes for the 2 remaining zombies to align so you can explode both of them with your last bullet.\n\n\n\n...\n\nAside from this, there are other technical problems that don't help. Visually, the game is really weak.\nIt has a solid aesthetic, it was what appealed to me at first! But the actual quality is poor. The game is just a set of backgrounds with poorly aligned blood pools. If an enemy dies in a set of diagonal stairs, the blood is still horizontal and just looks off. Resolution is low as well... It's not good. And it's unfortunate, since it had potential!\n\nThe grayscale also affects perception a lot, often missing a zombie because it blended with the background. Of course, there's an option to color zombies (just get some green paint on top of it), but that ruins the aesthetic. So yeah, another problem not solved.\n\n\nFinally, I'd just like to say how awful the interface is. Jesus Christ, the level selection was infuriating. I can't even describe it. You basically have a sort of grid that doesn't fit on the whole screen, so you drag it to all sides. But it has acceleration, so it can sometimes get off the screen for no reason.\nCome on, use pages, ou a smaller grid... anything but this.\n\n\nAnyway.\n\n\nThe game started out very nicely! I enjoyed the concept a lot, and chains were cool, at times.\nBut the game dragged on for far too long, and the tight objectives didn't go well with how free the mechanics were.\n\nSo yeah, interesting idea, poor execution.","September 26, 2015","false","6.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Though its not just the standard zombies casing a threat there are different type of zombies out there for example one type zombie when killed shots a gun and if that bullet hits any zombie they then get killed crating the chain . to help with this you can press the v button and see all the different types of zombie By Colour this helps in making strategic moves .\nOver all I find the game a very fun time killer (pun intended) and at the time of writing this review it is very hard not to recommend at the price but even at normal price i would highly recommend OMG Zombies! but be warned  it wll eat up your time","November 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

When you clear a level a percentage will show on how many of them you killed/were left to kill. It is wise to always aim for the 100% as you will want it to unlock further levels. At the start this is going to be very hard, the reason is, you only have 2-3 bullets to shoot and not only they do low damage but the Zombies are on level 1. You can level up you enemies, yes. The more you level them up the more splash damage they make or the bigger the impact is, etc. Different zombies have different effects. The can blow up and and provide a chain of explosions, shock others, melt as they walk by, shoot others (some of the zombies have a pistol or a assault rifle) and so on.\n\nYou will repeat earlier levels but this time you will be more prepared once you start to level zombies up (or your gun, or making barrels more powerful). Because the gameplay mechanics are rather simple and easy getting into this game it shouldn't be a problem but it can become more and more addictive because I found an odd satisfaction with the fact that, with just a single bullet I can kill them all from all those reaction shots and other effects from the zombies.\n\nThe time to completion I posted above was gameplay only. No idling. Took me that time to finish all the 100 Levels at 100% in every single one of them, and it was worth it. The only achievement I have left requires a major grind and time spent in the game.\n\nRegarding the ending you can have more than a different ending and you can have a" good" or a "bad" one. The Story itself is presented in a Comic Book style which is a nice thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/259870/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","First of all, OMG Zombies! is a puzzle game. A bit crazy, random-generated, puzzle game where winning is based on a well-calculated and timed click and the ensuing chaos. Your success is ultimately dictated on that crucial first click and statistics. Oh, and there are a lot of zombies too.\n\nThat tickles your interest? Basically, in each level you find yourself somewhere high, surrounded by zombies and with limited ammunition. Each zombie has a special power triggered on their death, like explosion or acid pool or shooting a weapon. With just a few bullets, you have to kill as many zombies as possible, preferably all of them.\n\nThis is difficult at first. Then you begin to see patterns within the horde and also accumulate money from winning levels, so it gets easier as you can upgrade your weapon and the zombies. It's left unclear how the zombies can be made stronger, but somehow that happens when you pump enough money in them. Whatever really, as it surely is surprisingly addictive. Several times I decided that the next level would be the last but then kept on playing regardless.\n\nThere's also a story. No, it's not very detailed or good, but it explains where the zombies came from and why you find yourself in this dire situation. Also, it's told in an artsy comic manner, so it's cool and it works well for this game. The whole game is drawn in greyscale, except the blood that's (you guessed it) red and everywhere. The unique style works well. Sounds are repetitive and uninteresting, but the cacophony of them can be amusing when you pull a great combo.\n\nFor me it lasted 8 hours for the first playthrough (100% completion until first prestige). That brings me to the one thing that kind of bugs me: there's a bad case of "that achievement" in this game, as to earn the last achievement you have to (you get to?) beat the game completely (100%) 20 times. That's going to take a while. I'd recommend the game regardless as it's cheap and fun. It's also a good game to go to when you're waiting for something but only got a few minutes to spare as it's fast to play through just a few levels.","October 9, 2014","true","65.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's ok in some ways, in the beginning it's not so boring and it's fun to see zombies explode in big chain reactions. The problem, at least for me, is that there's no thought process. The only thing you can do is shoot a zombie you judge as the best one and hope for the best. You can only hope that the random positioned zombies and random positioned explosive barrels will trigger a reaction between them, and that the zombies that randomly shoot when killed will hit the right random zombie that randomly will shhot again... and so on... you can buy upgrades to have more bullets, more range for exploding barrels and zombies, more damage etc... in the end it gives me no sense of accomplishment, and the levels that are hard to complete with a platinum medal are hard for all the wrong reasons, your skill will not influence the outcome in any way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/criticalcomposer/recommended/259870/","criticalcomposer","CriticalComposer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/criticalcomposer/","980 products in account","OMG Zombies is a great example of a fun puzzle game that was ported poorly. I have played this game to completion(Platinum Medal on all levels) on both the Playstion Mini version and the Playstation Mobile version. The PC version is practically the same game but with 3 new zombies thrown into them mix. The core of the game is shooting a zombie in hopes that its "power", or death action, ends up killing the zombies next to it. With practice and a little bit of luck(a lot of luck at the beginning) you'll be creating huge domino effect chain reactions using a single bullet. Points are earned at the end of each level that are used to "upgrade" the zombies or your rifle. Upgrades consist of increased range of power, increased damage of power, or a larger population of that zombie on the map(this is good as it creates more opperatunities for the chain reactions). There is something great about clearing an entire map with one well placed shot.\n\nThe issue with the port is the GUI, both for the menus and the gameplay. The entire game seems to have been ported line for line from the Vita version, which is touch heavy. Unfortunately, the HUD is sized for a portable system(leading to buttons that are way too large for a PC) and the level select screen is navigated by dragging, a feat that isn't exactly natural for the mouse. Hopefully Laughing Jackal sees this an works towards creating better menus and HUD for the PC crowd. Other than this slight oversight(seeing as the game is still extremely fun and rewarding) this game is well worth the $4 that it launched at.","February 14, 2014","true","7.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I picked this game up because it looked like a good game to play while I'm watching a movie or something like that and I can't put it down. 18 hours played and prestiged twice in one weekend? Yup, it's a little addictive. If you don't mind replaying levels (there's 100) to get 100% kills and working towards upgrades which make that easier then this game is highly recommended. There's no story, poor graphics, simple concept but it pulls it off well. The randomization of the levels artificially adds difficulty but when you get that massive chain that clears the map with one bullet the feeling is fantastic.\n\nAnyways, I'm heading back in, 18 more prestiges until final achievement is unlocked...","February 17, 2014","true","125.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Al though i do not recommend keyboard at all.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou have to shoot on a zombie, the zombie will die and they will have a dead animation. Each animation depends on the zombie, So if there is a cop zombie, he will shoot a bullet. if there is a civilian, he will just die, if there is a runner, well i think he will run first and then explode around him.\nand so go on.\n\nThere are medals in the game "Bronze, Silver, Gold and platinum". The more zombies you are to kill the better your chances are to get a medal.\n\nA higher medal will also unlock more levels and a more cash.\n\nYou need cash to upgrade your stats. Like doing more damage, more ammo, Zombie does more damage, Bigger radius, effect last longer and so go on.\n\nThe better the upgrades become, the easier the levels will be and getting Platinum medals.\n\nThere is a Civilian zombie, who just explodes in a small radius with relative high damage.\nThere is a Bloat zombie, Who explodes with mininum damage but high radius.\nThre is a Cop zombie, Who shoot 1 straight bullet (Will be penetrate after upgrades).\n\nThere is a soldier zombie, Who shoots randomly a bullet in any direction infront of him (after upgrades the bullets will bounce and shoot more bullets)\n\nThere is a Bilious Zombie, That drops a pool of small acid on the ground.\nThere is a Mortar Zombie, That shoot his brain and lands randomly on the level and damage nearby other zombies.\n\nThere is a Runner zombie, That charges into a straight forward line and after some moment, It explodes and damage nearby zombies.\n\nThere is a Zapper zombie, that shoots an electric Straight line in a random direction, Once hit against an other zombie the straight line will be there for awhile. The zombie is dead no matter how high his health and if any other zombie touches the Electric straight line they will take damage.\n\nThere are Explosive barrels, Once destroyed by you or a certain zombie, all zombies nearby will catch on fire and maybe will burn to death.\n\nOther things.\nIF YOU ARE AN ACHIEVEMENT HUNTER, PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THE GAME: There is one annoying achievement where you have to beat the game 20 times 100%!\nand there are 100 levels. Which means you will all the levels at least 2000. but you should easily double this to 4000, because at early stages you can't get a level on 100%. Not without enough upgrades. If you do want to get this achievement, prepare yourself by wasting more then 200 hours into this game AT LEAST.\n\nThe best way to get fast money is going all the way to the top with the pyramid, Even if you can't complete this in gold or higher. You still get money and top levels are easier then the ones at the bottom.\n\nI Find Level 64 the most hardest and annoyiest level in the game.\n\nUpgrading the eletric zombie is not really important, So try to upgrade this the last.\n\nI had this sometimes, that i am clicking on the wrong zombie with the first bullet and this turns out to be a success!

I didn't really pay any attention the comics that appear at the beginning of the game and later levels so I'm not sure of everything that's going on but I don't feel like it matters. What matters is this: all the zombies explode.\n\nYes, that's right, they explode in "a gush of red foam" (to quote Bloodbath's song Buried by the Dead; or think of the scene from Army of Darkness). I feel like that's the only appeal of this game: seeing tons of zombies exploding in big chains (there is a problem there though, I'll get to that).\n\nIt's not the most interesting or fun game, but I think it's fun enough to play for a few hours or so. I like simpler, casual games like this as something to play while doing other things.\n\nUnfortunately there is a lot of randomness in the game. Each time you start a level, the positions of all zombies and barrels are randomly generated. So sometimes a level can work out really well getting you high %, other times it goes horribly. You just have to keep trying.\n\nThere are upgrades for all zombies, your weapon, and the barrels. You can't pick and choose which upgrades you want when you want them, they are in a forced order. The first time I played this game, I upgraded zombies whose first upgrades were population, not damage or range, and ended up started over because I actually made things harder.\n\nWith 100 levels and not many level designs (and some are very similar to each other) it could be too repetitive for some people. And either because of this or because of the whole game, it could be too boring.\n\nBut I am easily amused by some things, and zombies exploding into blood is one of those. If this sounds like fun to you, I recommend you get this game on sale.","February 25","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why? Because they're ONLY good for Steam, only good for games, only good for an escape. OMG Zombies! was something I never picked up because I figured it would be just like every other shoot-zombie run-around eventually-die game that's already out there.\n\nI was entirely wrong. I normally write extremely long reviews that cover everything about a game from length to fun factor to soundtrack to graphics. Literally everything. I can't speak for the music. I've played this game exactly once. My playtime? One day. The game is very huge. It's extremely addictive. I would make a long review for it, but I'm afraid if I don't play it through to 100%, my brain might literally explode. I also used some of my Steam card funds to buy it for several funds. Why?\n\nThis is the best indie Zombie killing game on Steam\nOMG is right. Whether you're in for sitting at a game for hours or for a few minutes, this fits the bill, and is so friggin' addictive.

Don't let the votes fool you.\n\nGeneralWhat can I say? OMG Zombies! is an addictive game until you reach Prestige level 1. Play dominos with Zombies by watching them explode, shoot other zombies, scream (causes wide spread damage) and other crazy effects. You start off as an officer that appears to have gotten himself into a bit of a pickle. The way for him to survive is to down as many zombies as he can to proceed to the next areas in your journey.\n\nAlthough you don't lose any health and you have no health for that matter makes the game too easy. You're basically on top of objects in the game, sniping zombies to try and cause a massive widespread train wreck. At first you only have 3 bullets, but upgrading let's you increase your clip size. The upgrade system is pretty fluid. Upgrade zombies, barrels or your own weapon.\n\nAnnoyanceThe in-game comic that spams is quite annoying since it spams after every game at 80-100 levels. Don't get me wrong, you can skip it. It would be better if it showed different comics but it doesn't until every 10 or so levels completed (as far as I remember).\n\nOverallDo I recommend this? Well, if you want to waste a bit of time it might be worth playing as a time waster or if you just want to farm achievements it might be worth it (beware of 20th prestiege achievement). However, if you're looking for a game to play well over 30hrs, OMG Zombies! isn't that.\n\nRating: 4/10","March 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unlike most zombie themed games (that don’t feature snowball spitting flora) OMG-Z is a single screen, mostly black and white affair that will test your puzzle skills far more than your agility or ability to perform a head-shot, and is much more akin to Bust-A-Move than Left 4 Dead.\n\nThe allure of the game is in its simplicity – shoot a zombie and it blows up. If another zombie is in close enough proximity, it too will explode and so forth – creating a chain reaction that coats the grey tones of the hand drawn backgrounds a pleasing pixellated red.\n\nThe portable roots of OMG-Z make for a fast paced game with each level taking anywhere from a few seconds to no more than a few minutes. Gamepad support is there for traditionalists but after utilizing the added keyboard and mouse option we can’t see playing it any other way. It also sports a windowed display option that’s great for getting in a few levels between tweets or writing paragraphs for a video game review.\n\nWhile it isn’t perfect, OMG-Zombies! is a bloody orgy of viscera and strategy that engages and rewards your tasty, tasty brain. If you only get bitten by one zombie game this year, this one comes highly recommended.\n\nRead my entire review of OMG-Zombies here - http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/02/omg-zombies-review-pc/\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I get to figure out the best way to clear each level it throw at me and sometimes it's hard! I welcome the challenge though. Any game that exercises my brain in a fun way is fine by me.\n\nStoryline is plausible as well. There's a plant that explodes and if it does, whatever it explodes near r on, becomes infected. Scientists discovered and were trying to do away with it but... well, just watch the intro short to know how everyone one wound up. It's much more exciting than me explaining it. Anyway, you are assgned the task of killing zombies with x amount of bullets to hopefully produce a chain reaction of death. There are different zombie types that help you create death chain which means you have to strategize who to shoot. Do you shoot the Soldier zombie who can shoot its gun a few times in different, random directions? Perhaps the Runner who will run and then explode? Maybe the zombie that when shot, turns into a puddle of acid? Depending on the level you can have all these, some of these, none of these or these plus more.\n\nThere's also an upgrade system. Want more bullets? Want zombies you shoot to do more damage? Earn cash by clearing levels satisfatorily (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and buy the upgrades you want.\n\nIt's a great little game and I highly reccommend it.

In this case, the triggers are gunshots that draw from your tiny pool of bullets, and the chain reactions come from zombies that erupt when killed (and various special zombies with differing effects).\n\nWhile this game is cheap I would caution against buying it unless you're cool with a lack of polish akin to something you might find on various free flash game index sites. Rather, it plays like a freebie mobile game (and if memory serves me right, this is in fact a PSP port). While it is passable to start with, it quickly becomes about the grind for cash to upgrade the zombies, to allow you to get the same kind of combos on later levels. For instance, early on you are fine with standard zombies which have a small eruption radius, but as you progress so too does the zombie health bars, meaning that they won't erupt until hit several times by upgraded zombies.\n\nThe grind doesn't fit in a chain reaction game at all, and given the behaviour of the special zombies you will rely upon to create these chain reactions, you can end up force-restarting any given map a crazy number of times just to get workable zombie positions. While all the zombies do stagger slowly around, there is no fast-forward, and the special zombie effects are directional or range-limited. Then there is the issue of your own clicked gunshots being approximate. If there are three zombies stood close together, and you click directly on the head of one of them, it may simply decide to damage one of the other two by virtue of hitboxes and layers, rather than what you actually clicked.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game, but if you really must, I would suggest looking for it on a mobile platform or waiting for a steep sale.","September 7, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So to set it more clearly:\n\nThere is only limited bullets with which to try and kill as many zombies as possible on the level by setting of chain reactions. There's different zombies that each does something different when killed. The zombies move around alot, so you must time the shot perfectly while also considering what zombie to shoot.\n\nFor example the normal zombie will only explode when shot, damaging other zombies around it. Not all zombies explode, based on what the other zombies are they will either explode if a normal zombie, melt and create a shortly timed acid pool, fire a bullet in the direction they're facing, or run and explode when they collide with something. These are only half the different zombies and as can be seen you must also take into account the facing of the zombies. As the levels get harder the zombies get more health, so it's better to shoot a weak zombie and have it's effect chain to other zombies.\n\nThere's also upgrades that allows you to increase your ammo and the potency of zombies when killed. So this makes for a very fun little game where you must think before you act, time it perfectly and try to kill as many zombies as possible with the limited ammo.\n\nThe levels are short and fun and alot of replay value as you buy upgrades and try to reach the 100% zombies killed mark!\n","June 24, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/St_Anger1/recommended/259870/","St_Anger1","St_Anger1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/St_Anger1/","341 products in account","Unexpectedly fun casual puzzle game. The gameplay consists of a rather simple point and click control mechanic, where the goal is to create chain reactions of violently dying zombies. The levels are made of varying types of randomly spawned zombies placed within a rather open arena artificially inhibited by obstacles. The goal is to clear as many of them as possible with the limited ammo and properties said zombies have. Additionally, there are upgrade paths which enhance favourable characteristics of the enemies and the player for easier perfect completions of levels.\nSince it's a PC port from a mobile platform, the on-screen menu system is a bit awkward, and the graphics look like they're from pre-millennium era, which would have been forgivable as a stylistic choice, but most likely is a side effect of poor upscaling.\nReplayability-wise, getting 100% on all 100 levels amounts to about 6h-10h of playtime, including replaying some of the stages after getting all of the upgrades. However, the achievement suggesting fully finishing the game for 20 times is down-right ridiculous.\nAll in all, considering the game has trading cards, it's worth picking up for it's addicting gameplay and relatively cheap price, especially if it's on a sale.","May 28, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Five dollars is a bit much for this game, in my opinion. If you are thinking of trying this game out, get it while it's on sale.\n\nI'm really surprised at the amount of negative reviews on here for this game. I've personally enjoyed playing it so far; it's a nice game to kill some time with when you don't feel like immersing yourself into a less-casual, more attention-consuming game. But you have to keep this in mind - it's a much more casual game than most other zombie-themed games out there. While it's hard to describe exactly what genre OMG Zombies! fits into, it's clear right from the beginning that you are going to have use strategy to plan out how you will complete each level. It's something of a puzzle game, forcing you to carefully plan out each shot that you take (as your ammo is extremely limited). The zombies all have unique attributes that allow them to set off chain reactions with other zombies upon their death, giving you the ability to take out 10's of zombies at a time with a single bullet.\n\nThere is something of a skill tree in this game, in which you spend money that you earn from each level to power up not only your own weapon and ammo, but also the attributes that the zombies possess, allowing each zombie to deal more damage, or deal damage for a longer duration. It isn't the greatest application of a skill tree that I've seen, but it could have been far worse. The one contention that I do have with it is the complete lack of variety when it comes to weapons; you have one gun for the entire game (unless I'm mistaken, but it doesn't look like it so far).\n\nThe levels themselves are ok. Visually, they are pretty bland, but I feel that it actually goes well with this game. While the layouts change slightly, the gameplay remains virtually the same. You may have to occasionally alter your tactics very subtly, but not by much. The difficulty rises at a good pace, I feel. Some levels prove to be fairly challenging, but once you finally kill off most of the zombies and get a gold medal for the level (or all of the zombies, on a rare occasion, securing you the platinum medal), it brings you quite a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn short, OMG Zombies! is a good game if you can get it for the right price. It's not a game that I can see anyone pumping a hundred hours into, but you can get a decent amount of fun out of it for the price of a candy bar.","February 8","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How can one come up with a title so great and yet so stupid at the same time? Laughing Jackel found a way.\nIn OMG Zombies!, you play as a unnamed riot armour clad police officer who is the sole survivor of a zombie apocalypse in the city of Redfield. For reasons unexplained in-game, the zombies in OMG Zombies! literally explode when shot, showering their zombie brethren with gore and causing chain reactions of showering zombie gibs with just a single bullet. Your cop is going to have to learn to use his rifle to it's fullest potential if he's going to escape Redfield alive.\nThe game is a good stratagy game with great gameplay and graphics. The spritework is incredible, and it has a lot of gore. It also has a ton of unlockable secrets and secret comics that are just incredible. However, overall, OMG Zombies! is a time waster, but it is a very good time waster. If you like stratagy, you should try this game out. If you don't, I wouldn't recommend OMG Zombies!.","January 30","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laerx/recommended/259870/","laerx","Yeah, Barry.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laerx/","300 products in account","Strategic and similar in nature to Infectonator, you have a limited number of rounds to fire at zombies, creating a point of origin for a chain reaction as each type of zombie suffers its own on-death effect which can rapidly spread.  Advancement to other stages is unlocked with a sufficient clear, but better clears result in higher scores and more money unlocked.  Money is spent upgrading the range/damage/density/whatever of the varying types, adding a feeling of progression beyond clearing rooms.\n\nI bought this during a halloween sale three years ago with leftover change from selling cards and it's still the best 99 cents I've spent on Steam.  There's something immeasurably satisfying about firing a single bullet and watching a perfectly timed chain reaction clear an entire map.  It's probably worth the five dollars, honestly, but there's no reason not to buy it if you find this in a sale.","December 22, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I'd rather wish there was a "maybe" recommendation. On one hand, I liked the game because I just HAD to get the dang gold medals. I also liked that it is a simple (yet frustratingly) easy game (that may take HOURS and HOURS to beat). On the other hand, there is a lot of work to go through getting the final achievement in this game. A LOT of repetition and failures. It is not fun. I wouldn't mind it so much if the requirement for it wasn't so high, but it's just a pain...\n\nHowever, like I said, it's not a bad zombie game. If you can get it cheap (or free), I'd say go for it. However, I don't recommend buying it for full price. Also, be aware that MANY hours are required to get all the achievements (unless you cheat).","May 3","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
