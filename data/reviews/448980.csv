However, it also leaves more to be desired.\nWhile characters do look at you while reciting dialog, outside of that they don't interact at all. Like if you get right up in someones face they don't care at all and just continue on their scripted animations.\nCons:I had lots of edge artifacts (Like when you play a game with no anti-aliasing on).\nFPS was also an issue, any moving objects seemed to lag about every 3 seconds or so.\nVive controllers were assigned to the wrong hands. I checked the home screen, and I did have them in the correct hands. I also tried the game three different time. It happened every time. Also after I closed the game and launched a different game the controllers were in the correct hand.\nPoor animation transitions. It's a bit immersion breaking when a character suddenly goes rigid, then goes into it's next animation.\nOn two different runthroughs I had black screen crashes where I had to restart my computer. No other VR experience has done this to me.\nFor what it is I can't harp on it too much. It's a free, quick experience to show off the Vives capabilites. Bonus if they're a fan. But I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.\n\nRig: Intel Core i7-5930K, 32GB DDR4 2800, (x2) EVGA GTX 980 SC (one dedicated to PhysX), 500GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD, Win 10.\n\nUpdate: After disabling SLI and setting my secondary card to only PhysX my screen and object jitter completely went away. No black screens since the switch. Edge artifacts are still present however (no tweakable AA settings that I could found), and in-game hands are still flipped sometimes too.\n\nEven after I now have it running properly I'm still not going to recommend it. I will admit that I'm much closer to neutral on it now. However, I'm still sticking by that unless you're a fan, it isn't a "must play" kind of experience.","May 18","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/recommended/448980/","mercury7elite","Game Cooker US Rocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/","169 products in account","This game is a "must play" free game. This game shows a lot of potential in what other VR games can bring to the table. I don't really care about the graphics quality at all. It could be better and I am sure if this was a full title it would be better rendered. Other than that it is awesome to be in the "movie" so to speak. I am not really a fan of the series but the overall gameplay and game concept is what I want out of VR. I am there right in the middle of everything. Any negatives in VR right now is just plain stupid in my opinion. The only thing I won't tolerate is blocky old school looking games because we have graphics cards that can do better now.Overall I say try it. It is free. Any free VR game is worth trying so that developers have feedback from us: the VR community. I played this game with the VIVE and it was just short and fun to be in. Yes we can say "be in" now. We are actually immersed in games now. Yay !!!\n\nOh yeah it will act funny if your space is not quite big enough or won't play at all so make sure your play area meets specs. I actually cheated and measured my space a little larger than it was so I can reach over my desk tops for extra space and play the game. Trust me I have a large area already so I was surprised that they required such a large area. Enjoy.","May 19","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
