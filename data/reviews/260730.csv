However with latest hardware, and operating systems, it has rendered this epic game completely unplayable (laggy mouse, low resolution, and crash to desktop every 5 minutes). This should have been re-worked, and re-patched, before being allowed on to Steam.\n\nAs mentioned on even the positive reviews, Desperados does not work on Windows 7/8/10. At least, not very well. I have reported this to the developers, but my thread(s) were completely ignored, and we have never received any acknowledgement that these compatibility issues even exist, even though they clearly DO. My current issue is a complete freeze up of the game after 5 minutes, followed either by a crash to desktop, or a BSOD.\n\nIt's a BRILLIANT game, but you will likely be put off of it by the performance issues before you have a chance to appreciate it's brilliance. Save your money, and just pray that the developers fix the issues with W7 and W8.\n\nUpdate 1st Dec 2013: There is a "directdraw" fix available in the forums which fixes mouse lag, however the crashing is still ongoing. It seems that patching has stopped for this game already.\n\nUpdate 25th Feb 2014: There appears to be an unofficial work around for the crashing issues available in a stickied forum thread. This is not developer supplied, and edging on the side of caution, I would prefer NOT to download random ".dll" files off of the internet - especially those hosted on rapidshare. I am unlikely to ever try the fix for myself, and the "Negative" review stands, as long as the developers fail to patch these aweful compatibility problems.","November 20, 2013","false","3.6"," 221 of 278 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","221","278","0","14"

Good story, good gameplay with a mix of action and stealth, good atmosphere, good locations and the characters have a nice voice acting (In Italian).\n\nAnyway, if you have Windows 7/8, I suggest to DON'T BUY this game, because it doesn't run pretty well. Most players say the game is unplayable for who have the newest OS, because there's a drop of FPS + laggy mouse and multiple crashes during the game, but there are some ways for fixing part of those problems if you read the threads in the community hub.

It may be a copycat, but a copycat with great levels, good mechanics, and memorable characters, easily earning its rightful place among all real-time tactical game fans.\n\nLong version:Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive is the proof that you can create a copycat that can be on par with the original. In our case, it is a clone of Commandos: a series of WWII real-time squad-based tactical/strategy games, where you control a group of highly trained specialist through a set of mostly stealth-oriented levels.\n\nThe core mechanics are the same: your task is to clear each level from enemy guards and bandits to reach your current mission mark. To do so, you take control of a colourful cast of Western stereotypes, all with their unique abilities. They are maybe a little too unique, as even mundane tasks as tying a knot or saddling a horse need their own specialists.\nAnother similarity is that diversion tactics are the bread and butter of gameplay. This is where Desperados outdid Commandos: you can pre-record a set of commands for all characters to execute a complex plan with the push of a button. Thanks to the devilish enemy placements, this feature is almost essential after a while.\nThe setting makes one big difference though: we cannot have a Western without some shoot-outs, so Desperados puts a smaller emphasis on sneaking to give way for some old-fashioned gunplay instead.\n\nThe story is built from spaghetti Western tropes: a mysterious bandit leader pulls a few high-profile robberies, which attracts the attention of a veteran bounty hunter, who then collects a few outlaw buddies to get to the bottom of the events. After this, the plot runs into a few dead ends on purpose, which may be a little tiresome, but eventually it reaches its typical adventure-oriented Western movie conclusion.","November 6, 2015","true","32.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","6"

I got a copy of the demo on CD from a cereal box. I was instantly hooked on the game although it was very challenging. Sometime after that a friend of mine had received the full version of the game. We spent countless hours with the darn thing and we couldn't get past level four. But at that time, fooling around with the game was enough for me, so we started over many times and took turns playing. It wasn't about victory at all.\n\nAnd now, more than ten years after the first glimpse, the game has landed on Steam, and I am eager to buy it. I got the game and I was instantly fulfilled with memories from the past. This is such a great game, there is no other like it. Commandos 2 and Robin Hood are close relatives, but there's something very special about this piece of art. The game features absolutely gorgeous graphics even with today's standards and the voice acting sounds more than professional.\n\nIf there's one thing they could have altered with the re-released version, it's the aspect ratio. There is no native widescreen support for the game, so you're stuck with 4:3 ratio. This however, isn't as big of a problem as one could think.

In Desperados you control group of characters with their own strengths, abilities and uses. Game has rather enjoyable art style, with great, detailed environments. Characters have different abilities, weapons, items they can use to accomplish mission goals. Most of the time you have to use multiple characters to complete mission. There is a stealth element in this game, and in most missions you can complete it by silently knocking out, killing enemies, sneaking around undetected. Or you can raise hell and shoot everything that moves, but doing that you have low chances of survival. Game has some humor here and there, voice acting is decent. Game may not work on newer computers, running windows 7 and 8. Other than that it's fun game. If you enjoyed Commandos series, then you might like this.","August 15, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I read everything looking for the fixes, but it in the end Desperados worked perfectly without any patches or modifications. I'm guessing the developers cleaned up this release over the last 3-4 months so credit to them.\n\nIf you haven't played Desperados before, it is essentially Commandos 2 but set in the wild west with hilarious cliches to the max! Very fun, lots of character, beautiful artwork (although it has obviously aged quite a bit), excellent story, and lots of tactical variety.

Horrible ♥♥♥♥ing game, almost nothing works as it should (and everything happens slooooooooooooooooowly), the game mechanics are downright broken. No wonder Spellbound went under.\n\nThere's only one thing I don't understand: the good reviews at the time. Has any reviewer even completed half of this game? The first few levels are charming but then the flaws start coming out more and more to the point where the whole thing becomes a barely playable mess.\n\nLet's take the supposedly 3D environment that would let you take advantage of the height differences. The idea is great, hell, it's even more realistic than what you have in Commandos... but the developers just forgot to program it 75% of the time. You're crouched behind a small wall? Doesn't matter if it's not programmed to make you hidden, guards will just spot you even on a night mission.\n\nTo make things worse the game is just full of great ideas that simply doesn't work as they should. It was awesome to see that Sam can take control of gatling guns... then I got the chance to use one in mission 9 to find out that it's absolutely useless.\n\nDynamite? Have fun spending half a minute with getting it to the right position with the trajectory display before you throw it instead of you know, having it work in the obvious way (you click on a spot that's in range, you throw it there and it explodes but nope, that would have been too "casual" I guess, too logical for a game like this).\n\nSleeping gas? Again the idea is great but the Doc can't throw it above a ♥♥♥♥ing wall. The first time I managed to make myself go to sleep instead of an enemy I laughed by the 5th time I was furious. The worst part of this is that it just makes reactive gameplay non-functional, you can't just lure a group of enemies to a corner and throw some sleeping gas at them because it's just too slow and the trajectory is too random (sometimes you can throw it well enough, sometimes you can't and the 2D graphics makes it hard to judge without waiting for the trajectory to be displayed - why isn't that instant btw?). Also it's sleeping gas you know: a guard shouldn't just kick a gassed collegue out of it, it's a chemical substance that makes you sleep.\n\nThe 2D graphics btw? They get in the way too much. You know why Commandos very rarely made you do things outside of your field of view? Because that's bad game design. I shouldn't do stuff blindly, ever.\n\nThe worst thing however? This game simply doesn't let you make even the smallest mistakes which is again horrendous game design. I should be able to make a mistake and correct it by reacting accordingly (you know, like in Commandos) but here? Nope, you make a mistake, get shot in the face and it's time to reaload.\n\nHorrendous, just horrendous.","February 28","false","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Strategy goes a long way as shooting your way out usually does not end well.\n\nLike several people mentioned though, this game do not work to well with Windows 8, although I cannot confirm this as I have Windows 7 64x. With my play though, the issue I ran into the most was crashing, anywhere from 1 - 4 times a mission, but it wasn't enough to ruin the game as it loads fast and easy to continue from where you crashed (If you quicksave a lot).","July 8, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of the most rewarding strategy games I've played, with an engrossing movie-like atmosphere. The AI is quite advanced, with each (kind of) enemy reacting differently to the player's tactics, and can be quite punishing when playing stealthily.\n\nSadly, though, it hasn't aged well. While there are wide-screen patches available, this DirectX 7 game runs poorly on Windows 7 and later, so keep that in mind if you're considering buying it.\n\nOn the other hand it runs almost flawlessly on Linux under Wine, so it is a must buy for strategy/western Linux gamers!","November 2, 2015","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
