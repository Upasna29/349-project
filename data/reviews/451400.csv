As you get closer to the enemy’s HQ the harder the maps are. There are around 100 territories, give or take a few dozen, you can do as much or as few as you want to reach the main target. However the more maps you do the more samples you can collect.\nAdditionally there’s a fourth tech tree available in conquest that give you extra benefits.\nAny excess points can be spent to ‘auto-win’ ‘Hard’ and ‘Very Hard’ territories to make it quicker and less of grind to get through.\nThe map generation is a little restricted in design.\n\nThe second one is Squad Missions, not yet available, but the name suggests extra missions you can do that’s not part of the campaign.\n\n\n\nFor those that have played Meridian: New World here’s a few changes:\n\nGraphics and animations have taken a large step forwards and also includes camera rotation and zoom.\nMore units are available and introduces naval units too but customising weapons isn’t possible anymore\nAI and Path-finding has been improved and less hassle.\nCommander’s abilities and research have been merged.\n- Abilities have been altered to use cooldowns instead of using up energy. There are less abilities. Heal also repairs structures.\n- Research are carried on through missions instead of building a new research lab each time.\n\nAnyone that has played and liked it should probably like Squad 22 even more.\n\n\n\nDuring closed beta, the developer listened to all feedback and many changes were made, lots of AI balancing and better performance.\nHe’s always active on the forums for all his games.\n\n\nWorth a try for anyone that likes RTS games, particularly campiagn and a challanging AI.","June 2","true","57.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

Ede made great progress with Meridian Squad 22. As you know it's linked with Meridian New World and Ede made great progress.\n\nThe game is not one of those AAAs but its the work of one man and he did a hell of a great job. I can say that the voice acting is impressive, graphics are good, the game offers a lot of cutscenes (which help with better understanding the campaign and what's going on), the HUD is very cool and very optimized and last but not least the game loads extremely fast, which is WOW, you double click on the icon and Meridian starts instantly!\n\nI have only positive things to say about Meridian Squad 22 since I appreciate the work of Ede, but of course there are some minuses and I should point them out: there are hotkeys but some essential ones are missing, for like queueing buildings or when you give order to units, combat doesn't involve much tactics and there is no multiplayer.\n\nThe campaign and the story is worth for playing the game, it's gonna catch you!\n\nLooking forward for the final product! Eventhough it's in Early Access it's much more stable than many other fully released games! :)","June 2","true","7.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Personally I've enjoyed my experience so far and if you've got 8 bucks I doubt you're be upset with your purchase. That being said, it doesn't stand out in some major field gameplay wise, but it's pretty fun regardless.\n\nI'll give a better review when I can sit down and play a bit more!","June 2","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gothicdeer/recommended/451400/","Gothicdeer","Moon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gothicdeer/","643 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nI couldn't put an hour into it...\n\nThis isn't a "quick review" or whatever. I had this game for about 4 or 5 days. I never played New World so going into the sequel I have no bias.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIDvKOml2E\n\nSo right off the bat here is the TL;DR\n\n+It's an RTS, I always welcome new RTS games\n+Achievements\n+Conquest mode. It's your basic capture the terrorities. You pick a terrority, invade to capture, get the resources for research that carry over.\n+In my short time, no bugs experienced.\n\n\n-Graphics are okay but in the desert everything is much brighter. It makes everything fuzzy. I guess they were going for that effect where you see a haze in the distance when its super hot outside.\n-Singleplayer only. Don't get me wrong, I love singleplayer focused games. This is an RTS though, so many people will not buy this due to no multiplayer.\n-One playable faction.\n-From what I read the campaign is short. Like 4 missions short.\n-AI gets incredible advantages in conquest mode. For example, you start out with 3 units, they get 5-8 with some already built buildings.\n-The maps are tiny. It takes literally 5 seconds of exploring to find your opponent.\n-No skirmish mode\n-Naval units are awesome but all the bodies of water are tiny...like I'm talking smaller than a pond.\n-Cannot zoom camera out too far. Camera always feels too close.\n\nAll in all, the game feels like a heavy grind. I "ugh"-ed everytime a new fight started because the battles act all just about the same. Even in Age of Empires where I do the same things in order as far as management goes, the AI on harder difficulties remain pretty unpredictible.\n\nThe game is in early access so maybe things will change for the better and I will update my review. Considering I can't put an hour in this game without immediately wishing I was playing something else...I am downvoting","June 2","false","0.9"," 10 of 49 people (20%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","20","10","49","4","0"

It still amazes me that this is the work of just one man.  I have RTS games in my library that cost me three to four times as much (that were developed by teams of dozens) that are not as polished as Meridian: Squad 22 already here at early access launch.\n\nIf you like RTS games with classic playstyles of base building I highly recommend this game.   For the price it is already worth the money in my book.","June 4","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
