You've been invited into an underwater complex, where dreams can be reality. Unfortunately for you, it seems that you may be the  key to stop an evil spirit...\n\nAs usual, Artifex Mundi is a master to pick the games they didn't developed for publishing in their catalogue. True, some of them are a bit behind of what they can deliver but they're always above average. That's the same here. The Emeral Maiden is a real nice written story, even if some plotholes exist.\n\nThe gameplay is as usual the standard one: pick items, solve puzzles, find objects in hidden objects scenes (list and shaped) and advance forwards. However, here, you can travel in dreams with cards you find. I think that five dreams aren't much, I would have preferred many of them, but they're representative of the life of your parents (safe for one). And I think it's nice to find items there that you'll need in the underwater complex. Also, you have a little helper, Atome in French, a little robot that can open specific locations. However, it's kinda underused for me. Anyway, the puzzles are quite easy safe for one or two where I took a long time the first time, and the HO scenes are usually simple except for one object I seem to miss during long minutes.\n\nIf anything, the graphics are also nice and the dreams are a nice way to take a break from the architecture representative of the '50. You've been abandonned in 1957 and while we're now nearly in the '80, the underwater complex never changed from the time of your birth. Besides, you understand it quickly given the notes found that dated from that time.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is nice though I didn't really had a WOW effect this time.\n\nThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams is really a nice casual adventure game. I will not say it's a must-have but it's a very enjoyable game that is worth the purchase.","February 20","true","5.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

The Emerald Maiden is waiting for you and your dreams are about to become a reality in this fantasy themed hidden object game. Sometimes even the most beautiful of dreams can turn into a nightmare, could your invitation under the sea really be a trap? If so, can you escape before it’s too late? Time to find out!\n\nThe story of The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams follows an unnamed female protagonist who was orphaned as a baby. She finally has a clue to her heritage and ventures below the waves to a lavish paradise made for aristocats -you have 5 adorable kittens to rescue! It would seem someone had the bright idea to mix science and magic and as you might imagine it went horribly wrong. A mystical entity is after our heroine, seeking to use her to empower itself and take over the world. Search around The Emerald Maiden for clues as well as travel into the dream world to solve the mystery.\n\nI enjoyed the real world and dreamworld mechanics in this game. Actions in both worlds affected one another, having to solve puzzles in both realms to progress. The dreams also became more detailed as you played, some requiring multiple trips to complete. The game was slightly easy, great hidden object scenes and rather simple puzzles, nothing too challenging, That being said, it wasn’t so easy that it was boring, the game keeps you thinking. I found that as the game went on, the level of difficulty increased which was a nice feature.\n\nAesthetically the artwork is lovely, crisp and clear very easy on the eyes. As someone who wears glasses, I really appreciate when hidden item games have good artwork. The scenes aren’t blurry and the items aren’t too small. The character designs are also well done and are well animated. However, the voice acting for the characters isn’t the best. While not bad, some of the actors seem to lack much enthusiasm for the script. Thankfully, the soundtrack is good so a few issues with voice acting isn’t a huge deal.\n\nThe game is fun, it has achievements that are not hard to collect as well as trading cards. The length of the game is also decent, the main game along with the bonus chapter took me about four hours to complete which is a good length for a hidden object game given the price. My main issue with the game were the kittens. Rescuing the kittens was fun for me but then when the game ends you don’t know their fate, this made me sad on a personal level. The ending seems to hint at a sequel, he’s hoping the kittens are alright in that game!\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","February 29","true","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","3"

Check. Wander through pretty environments? Check. Kittens? Check. Cute helper? Well, a little creepy but it was useful so it gets a check. Also, I didn't spot the villain early on this time, which is frankly a first. Surprise? Check.\n\nCons: Expected symphony. Recognised some of the music from other games. Music was ok but not symphonic. The puzzles are getting a little predictable but at least they're still presented well. The achievements showcase was just a list. I didn't get reactions when I clicked on some things, which felt a little flat when it was someone I'd rescued.\n\nIt would get three out of five stars but it's not every game that will just throw a half-lobster man at you with no explanation. I was so surprised I dropped a star so I guess this game can have that one too.\n\nDude is half a lobster.

And you do not get the soundtrack this time - too bad as it contains several nice tunes. Polish language version has some major errors, for instance translating "compass" as "kompas" (the devidce indocating north) instead of "cyrkiel" (the device for drawing circles).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/recommended/429610/","Bechstein","Bechstein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/","296 products in account","GENRE\nThe Emerald Maiden has been on Steam since Feburary 2016, developed by GOGII Games and published by Artifex Mundi sp. zoo.o. If the publisher sounds familiar, it's because they've published many other hidden objects games on Steam, with titles such as Eventide: Slavice Fable and Demon Hunter: Chronicles from Beyond being available for purchase thanks to them. As with many hidden objects games for the PC over the past few years, it follows a very familiar formula: Lengthy pre-rendered CGI cutscenes with voiceovers to explain the story, exploration and fairly linear item collection for elementary puzzles, and a lot of dialogue from anyone that's interactive, and monologues for anything that's interactive. You can currently buy it on Steam for $9.99 USD.\n\nSTORY AND OBJECTIVE\nA young woman who was left for adoption by her mother in London 1950 has only a small amulet as a namesake. Years later, she has received an envelope with clues as to her mother's whereabouts and an invitation to the Emerald Maiden  an underwater attraction for aristrocrats with bars, theaters, and the fantastic mysterious Symphony of Dreams. The shadowy Director promises magical secrets and wonder, but there must be more. By solving simple puzzles, clicking on objects and navigating through labyritnsh of lush scenes laden with high-resolution stock images, the player must learn the truth behind the Emerald Maiden, and its Director.\n\nCONTROLS AND INTERFACE\nThe game is, appropriately for a hidden objects game, controlled exlusively via mouse. The in-game interface is typically just a bar on the bottom of the screen indicating which objects are in the inventory and need to be found, and buttons for the menu and for hints. The options are sparse, as to be expected with hidden object games: The ability to toggle sound and music volumes, full screen and windowed mode (the latter being fixed in 1220x780), graphic detail quality, the option to toggle voice overs, and the option to change the game's difficulty at will. The only significant differences between difficulty are penalties for mis-clicks and whether interactive objects sparkle. The controls are interface are quite standard for a casual hidden objects game like this. Or a difficult one, should the player select the Difficult setting instead of Casual.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe game's cutscenes are nicely detailed and rendered with a mix of 2d and 3d graphics, while the in-game graphics are flat yet high-resolution images with stiff animations. There's nothing too eye-grabbing, but nothing's ugly to look at. The character art is actually very nice compared to that in many other hidden objects this reviewer has played while babysitting. In fact, an extensive artbook or comic book from this game's artist would be quite a treat. If you can find out who did the illustrations for this game, please comment the artist's information below!\n\nAUDIO\nThe cutscene music is actually very majestic for something in a hidden objects game, and the music is subtle, relaxing and thought-inducing. Nothing about the music or sounds are too exciting, and they facilitate focus. The voice actors are lively and believable, and there were no signs of audio distorition or skipping. Even though many hidden objects games shine through their audio and graphical qualities rather than through their gameplay and storytelling, GOGII Games did a fine job of making the former aspects shine more than what's usually expected from a game like this.\n","March 14","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, I'm fairly comfortable with the amount of attention paid to the game, and that this review will be fair. So, let's get to it!\n\nEmerald Maiden is the story of a woman in the 1980-something receiving a ticket to a mysterious undersea hotel. The woman in question is an orphan, and she has reason to believe that the preposterously-constructed vacation resort will have some clues as to what happened to her long-lost birth parents! Which is true, but there's so much more to discover as well!\n\nOn to the Hidden Object Criteria!\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nIt's fairly crude this time. The abandoned undersea facility isn't a new setting - Artifex Mundi already published a fairly naked rip-off of Bioshock, after all, but the Emerald Maiden resort just isn't in the kind of terrible condition that would justify the stacks of garbage strewn everywhere. It's a little more excusable once the player starts venturing into lucid dreams which don't necessarily follow real logic, but even then the game leverages dishonest design far more than is acceptable. There's basically every type of HOS cheating a game can do on display in Emerald Maiden - size, transparency, colour, placement - the game never encounters a type of cheating it doesn't like.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nIt's about 50/50 here. While the game is blessedly free of item placement screens, there are plenty of 12:1 screens, where the player is tasked with grabbing a load of garbage to find a single item. There are also a number of much more interesting 'item assembly' screens, in which the players has to gather a series of random items to construct something on the same screen. It's a refreshing change of pace that fits the setting really well, and is impressive here as it was in Clockwork Tales.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nVery well, actually. Emerald Maiden's puzzles are generally environmental in nature - finding items to interact with the world in concrete ways that all make perfect sense. Every now and then a discrete 'puzzle' pops up, asking the player to solve a game of pipe dreams or move symbols around a board - but they always make sense within their setting, and are never too aggravating. While Emeral Maiden certainly has a fantastical setting - undersea motel and dream machine, all in the year 1980 - but its developers have gone a long way to making sure that it's all internally consistent, and the game works well because of it.\n\nAgain, my fondness for this game may have been affected more than a little by my state of inebriation while playing it, but I must say that, beyond some sloppy HOS construction, this a solid and engaging adventure, one that doesn't wear out its welcome across the 3-4 hours it takes to beat. Would it have been nice if the developers had put in a little more work on the hidden object screens? Sure, but that does little to hold back an otherwise stellar adventure.","February 25","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their recent games have all been great. This was one was Ok. No serious gameplay complaints but there were a lot of polish issues, for instance the English texts had a lot of typos. As other reviewers have said, if you're an obsessive Artifex Mundi hoarder, you'll recognize a lot of elements in this one. Not just the usual reusable puzzles, but some of the plot ideas. Wraith of Eden's underwater world, waking-dreaming stuff from Dreamatorium...\n\nThere were some clever new mechanisms I liked, like the key-card access to the dream realities. Some of the character art was exceptionally beautiful. Rescuing the kittens actually kind of stressed me out, which I admit with some chagrin. Zombie attacks? No problem. Rescuing kittens, though? I'M DISAPPOINTING KITTENS!\n\nExcellent voice acting in this one, and it was really nice having the female protagonist's mother being the hard core scientist in the plot line (thank you!!!) In fact, there was a lot of subtle girl nerd stuff in this one that made me happy. Watch for some of the background posters throughout.\n\nI would've loved more backstory on the kitten-loving human-cephalopod-lobster dude; I felt like I should've recognized him from the Nightmares from the Deep series. Why oh why does he have a lobster claw? Who is this guy?\n\nNot Gogii's best, but good.
