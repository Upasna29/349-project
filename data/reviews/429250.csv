I would say its your typical dungeon crawler..except that the story changes every time that you play the game, literally.\nSometimes it's pretty whacky, sometimes..its pretty grim, but it's a nice change of pace, adds to the replay value of the game overall.\nIt takes a bit to get the hang of, but once you do its pretty damn fun and you want to play it a second time, and then a third.\nA few characters to unlock, powers also (although you can get any power at "random", once you unlock it you can equip it manually).\nI am including a video of a full playthrough with the " bad " ending, since there is  a good and a bad. The good ending is on another video, but even though I have seen " both " , I know I'm still gonna give the game a few more playthroughs just to see what crazy story lines it goes through. Some spoiler warnings, I suppose...at least for this story line.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UjnWzs0k_0","March 11","true","7.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The dungeons are fun and interesting.  The music is appropriate.  The bosses are a challenge.  It even has random cut scenes to view when going between dungeon types and starting the game.\n\nYou can play as several different classes, customize your character, and even customize the classes skills.  Changing the color of the character's... everything is fun.  Your character's skills can alter what you can find in the game based on what the skills do.  The differences between the different dungeons are as different as night and day.  The random dungeon crawler has taken major leaps in the past few years, and this game has added a new chapter in its evolution.\n\nIf you like randomized dungeon crawlers, random spells, being able to choose between spells, different classes, a list of interesting aspects, and an easy to use style of gameplay, then you'll love this game.  If nothing else, you can play with the bodies of your enemies.  Kicking a dead rat down a hallway can be fun, especially if it bit you before you killed it.","March 11","true","4.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I really enjoy the fact that the melee in this game is just as useful as the magic for when you need to use it in order to save your hide. This game is a challenge and you will die a lot. I enjoyed it but I was unable to get past the first boss because it is difficult get health for your character and there is no permanent health powerups for the game as of yet. Also the fact that you start the game out with random magic until you earn the choice of magics at the opening of the game makes this game unique but extremely hard. I really like this game and look forward to improving my game play so that I can make it further into the game.","March 11","true","1.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The spells you start with are randomized and are improved in random ways as you progress, but once you die - that's it. Ideally you play well with the random spells, earn mini-achievements, and unlock them to use at the character creation, but some of them will take a pretty long while. I'd wager around five hours of gameplay you'll have unlocked all of the spells and classes to ensure a decent start so you can have an honest go at beating all of the worlds. I might just be really bad (can almost guarantee it) but I found the second world particularly difficult lest I had a specific skillset. Regardless, the challenge is satisfying and I look forward to pressing onward in hopes of unlocking more stuff and things.\n\nEdit: Recently an update was pushed out that added a difficulty modifer. While the game's on "easy" the leaderboards lock but achievements are still attainable. Quite nice for the first couple runs until you get used to the game!\n\nWhile the game's only $5 USD, I feel there's not much in the way of spells. It'd be really great to see another several spells added to the game to spice it up as now there's only about a dozen total. It might be something for down-the-road as it's only just released not long ago.\n\nMy first impressions and beginning attempts at the game can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oFcwZJRS8o\n\nThe power mode, first person mode, and the good ending are also uploaded. Feel free to head to my channel or check out the playlist linked below. Obviously it's a bit spoilery, but for those who don't mind here you go:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1IU-H0hU1b7HYkhagaIeaq1KKy-E5_","March 30","true","3.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Sometimes the controls are not so good and you die becouse of it. But still I recommend it a lot! If you want to know how it looks like, watch me playing it. https://youtu.be/BVMDl56Qbm8","March 15","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlCheddah/recommended/429250/","AlCheddah","Al Cheddah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlCheddah/","34 products in account","To be honest, I was a bit disappointed in playing this. The Trailer looked fairly promising. Not to sat this game doesn't have an interesting premise,b ut some of the mechanics need to be tweaked:\n\nActually HIDE the secret chest, so they can be accessed w/o needing a fire spell to light torches to unlock\ndial down the number of mobs on the 1st floor or up the damage on some of the spells (ie Life Drain is too slow)These can be easily fixed.\n\nThe MAIN issue holding this back is the ENVIRONMENT.\n\nIf you think of games like Dungeon Souls (another game published by Black Shell Media), the Music, Dungeon Design, Items, Mobs, and Bosses have a dynamic look to them; despite the games dark atmosphere/premise. This game sadly has a boring look and feel to it. The mobs are generic and killing them gives no satisfaction. The music is just a carry over from the opening credits and is too bland to enjoy. Mostly the dungeon is just a collection of black wall that reveal themselves as you move closer.\n\nDon't get me wrong! This has a chance of being a really good game, but the devs would have to do a rehaul of the game environment to bring out it's potential. Now if the first dungeon is just something to gt the player used to the game mechanics, fine. Judging from what I've played, I wouldn't recommend it to others as is.\n\nYou can see my run of it HERE!","March 25","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls for movement are kinda clunky.\nHowever The idea of movement around in a maze fashion works well here.\nI like the super powers and how they change when you die that was a huge plus.\nI also like that the levels seem to be generated randomly?\nThe Intro screen is cool, as is the the similar death screen.\nI like that "Workshop" is on the menu, even tho greyed out, it shows you guys really want to make this a community game where we can all build levels, so thats a cool plus.\nGame reminds me of a more modern version of gauntlet.\nGame is kind of hard.","April 12","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
