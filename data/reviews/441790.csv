"http://steamcommunity.com/id/honkymcgee/recommended/441790/","honkymcgee","Starman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/honkymcgee/","49 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I went into Fragmented expecting more or less nothing. I've seen a lot of Ark and Rust-like games and they rarely bring anything new to the table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually pretty enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n-Crafting is reasonably complex, but not overly so.\n-Resource farming isn't overly arduous, drops and locations are predictable and markable on the map.\n-Ranged combat is decent, gunplay is smooth, responsive and quick.\n-Heavy focus towards group/squad-based play.\n-Building system is solid, with a reasonable variety of structure options of various types/appearances/purposes.\n-Graphics are excellent for this stage of development.\n-Survival aspects make themselves constantly known.\n-There's no really bad choice when it comes to skill focus (except maybe melee).\n-Raiding/pvp/base defense are reasonably balanced (but still skewed towards the defenders). You're not likely to lose your base in a 30 second offline raid.\n-Game's pace is pretty well thought-out and progression is steady and rewarding no matter what style of gameplay you prefer.\n-Developers are very open to feedback and discussion, actively engaging the community. (after reporting a bug at 8:00 AM EST, I received a reply from a developer in less than 15 minutes. Now that's service.)\n-Monsters have some cool features like adaptive behavior (passive/aggressive/etc) based on who/what they kill and when/where/how often.\n-Experimenting and testing new skills and content is fun and finding new uses for things is actually very enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n-Some content isn't yet fully supported by the game at this point. Vehicles are temporarily disabled, and player pets don't have fully implemented AI (or so it seems, though they will defend your base).\n-Gameplay is addictive at first, but slowly wears down into the endgame due to lack of endgame content.\n-Raiding in PVP is exceptionally difficult right now, due to weapon damage against structures. (The devs have stated that this is a work in progress).\n-Graphics are nice but some are clearly incomplete with placeholder textures. Certainly not what UE4 is capable of at its peak.\n-Monsters are limited in type. There are currently about 5 different enemy types.\n-Survival can be absolutely brutal sometimes in Normal mode where your items drop on death.\n-There are still some fundamental bugs with the game (losing your armor on death, monster AI, etc)\n-Currently a very small playerbase, especially on PVP servers where guilds are a central focus.\n-Melee combat is lackluster. Ranged combat is fun against players, but repetitive against monsters.\n-Monster combat AI is still very basic with even most boss monsters easily confused by terrain, other monsters, or shiny objects.\n-Crafting, while well thought-out is quite kludgey still. You'll find yourself clicking the craft button a lot (or holding enter). (Update: It's been stated that this will be addressed very soon)\n-No in-game voice chat (yet).\n\nOverall, I like the way this game is going and I'm going to keep an eye on it as it progresses. I wholly endorse supporting these guys and my only concern for the welfare of this game is that the developers might burn themselves out from their rapid development process, or that it might simply get abandoned when "The Repopulation" makes its comeback. I don't feel that either of these scenarios are LIKELY, but these sorts of things are always a concern with any Early Access game. Regardless, it's got my vote.\n\nThumbs up, guys.","May 16","true","227.9"," 71 of 73 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","71","73","0","0"

They respond to just about anything in a professional and timely manner. Had an issue on a Sunday evening at 8pm Est. and a dev answered the topic within 15 minutes and fixed the issue. Amazing professionalism and detailed responses.\n\nThis is an amazing addition to EA if you love the survival/Sci fi aspect, it has tons and tons of things to gather from wood, stone, berries, twigs, an assortment of food from npcs, gold, diamonds from stones, three big biomes, one desert, snow, and forest with nice amounts of land mass.\n\nThe leveling system has alot of depth, 50 levels of choosing what you want to spend points on to make your character craft more items, like Melee, guns. Electronics, construction and more.... Really huge amount of items to craft and build.\n\nThe music is also really great, an easy to listen to sound track while in the world, really well done. I am more of a PvE player after a long days work to relax and enjoy my time. Met some great people already.\n\nThe building is a work in progress and another couple patches hopefully will see snapping together items. It does have a nice amount of foundations and items to interact with. More in base items would be nice like candles, torches in the base, tables, chairs, trophy cases of npcs killed, etc to fill out the bases.\n\nYou have bots that can follow you around however are a work in progress and disabled at this time, but can still be placed on ground, for example medical bot is awesome, it heals you as you come back to base...\n\nVehicles will be implemented shortly, should be a nice addition.\n\nDefinitely recommend the game, one of the best EA games I have played ever... Loving it....\n\nUpdate 111 hours into the game now....\nMay 22, 2016\n\nReally nice patches and mini patches not only adding features, items but the devs are still very much communicating with us daily at all hours of the day...\n\nStill having a best and the first draft of Genetically engineered Pets is awesome, you can make several different pets that you can craft at a genetic station and they will follow you around, help you in battle. The building mode got a new patch this week and is going in the right direction snap building will be icing in the cake and is something coming to the game...","May 16","true","117.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

I recommend this game! The game is similar to other survival type games with crafting, hunting, gathering, and also house/town/city building options. This game also offers us an RPG style leveling system as well as a skill tree with ample options to choose from.\n\nThe developers have impressed me during my play and testing time. These developers are responsive to community needs and wants, and they take care of bugs far quicker than most online game development teams. I see updates and bug fix patches almost every single day, and if a major bug surfaces, they often patch a hotfix in the same day.\n\nThe only downside I see currently is that after 60+ hours into this game, I have done most of what there is to do. The flip side of that coin is that the game developers have much much more planned.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who like the survival or sci-fi genre.","April 26","true","71.4"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

Early Access (at the time of this review) is not yet a week old. My hope is that the users experiencing issues post in the forum instead of (or in addition to) "GG Uninstall" reviews.\n\nAs far as content goes, more is being added in terms of Art, mechanics, and new features.\n\nThere will be modding possibilities and other user-centric items / features beyond the already-planned updates. Check out the official forums for more information or to voice your input.\n\nSome reviews I've seen refer to this as the game they were backing and ABT is making a cash grab. To this: Fragmented is not the game you were backing; That's true. Fragmented is a separate project that former Repopulation backers coincidentally get for free while The Repopulation is being made. It's a survival-type game with a Repopulation theme (simpler crafting, not as deep as Repop will be, etc.).\nThe Repopulation will still be a MMO; It will be its own game. It just needed to get off the Hero Engine which had issues unrelated to ABT. Development was stopped once ABT saw issues coming up with HE's development.\nIf ABT was trying to make a cash grab, they would not give backers copies of this game and would not continue developing The Repopulation. I haven't seen any indication that they've gone back on their word on anything they've promised so far.","May 1","true","44.1"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","0"

I wouldn't have bought this game if I hadn't gotten it for free because I, like most people, am sick to death of survival games.\n\nHowever this game seems to be quite different though I'm not sure why. I started playing this about 8 hours ago, not intending to play it for long, and somehow the whole day has gone by without me noticing.\n\nI enjoy exploring the world, I enjoy crafting all the different items this game has to offer (more housing items please!) I enjoy helping people as they seem quite friendly (PvE server that is).\n\nHowever on the negative side; I am constantly plagued by lagspikes, the interface needs a lot of work (I had my rifle equiped, I change over to the knife, but because my inventory was full it decided to fling the ♥♥♥♥♥ rifle halfway across the map never to be found again), items like houses etc cant be rotated moved or picked up once u've placed them down, just removed altogether. Little things.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to seeing where this game will grow from here, I've already clocked more hours on this than I ever did on the Repopulation. And giving this game away for free to those who bought the Repop, I feel is a masterstroke and unbelievably generous in this day and age, almost makes me believe in Early Access again (almost).\n\nAnd if you enjoy arbitrary numbers, I award a 7.5/10 to Fragmented.","April 28","true","11.1"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","30","39","3","1"

I have asked a handful of questions on Steam discussions, and each one was answered by a Dev to the fullest in minutes. In addition, The Devs have been communicating non stop with the community about their progress, future plans, Issues, and giving updates frequently. You can tell they really care about their playerbase and their game. They also patch every day or two as of right now.\n\nThe game is fantastic. Very similar to Ark many say. Loads of content. It has a nice balance of PVP/PVE unlike most survival games. I am running 60 FPS on lowest settings (graphics still look nice) with an 770 OC and I5. So the game is def playable with lower end PCs. I like the RPG element of the game. Simiar to Ark, your character levels up and each level you gain skill points which can be used into many unqiue skills.

Exploration, crafting/base building and guild creation are the main features this game offers with many unique forms of animals to hunt.\n\nAfter being involved in gaming for many years, this type of survival game that has been created by Above & Beyond Technology has proven itself to be something that is quite unique in a minefield of developing survival games that are stuck in their own development cycles.\n\nFollowing an encounter in 2015 which had derailed the game that the developers had produced, the end result required the team to find a new gaming engine to continue their work. Regardless of certain commitments made by the team, they decided to provide their new project free of charge for players of their previous game "The Repopulation".\n\nUsing the backstory from their previous game, they built this game from the ground up with the Unreal engine and utilised a group of testers (players from their previous game) to ensure that their product was developed to the highest standards and they have certainly achieved this.\n\nNot only have they provided the highest level of communication with their players but they continue to listen and implement idea’s and suggestion, regularly providing updates and bug fixes so that they can continue to provide the best product to players that they can which has become almost unheard of in recent years.\n\nFragmented has moved on to achieve its successful release on Steam and with further plans to develop more games in the future, the development team at Above & Beyond have quite an exciting future ahead and I really look forward to being involved in whatever projects they embark on.","May 11","true","237.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

In the first half hour of the game I spawned in some snowy map wearing only my boxers picking berries & gathering wood & stone, literally freezing my ♥♥♥ off and not having a clue as to what my next options were. I gradually came across two more players who were fully armored & looked very threatening. I tried reaching out to both of them thru the in-game chat & told them that I was freezing. One of them was kind enough to light a campfire near their base to help me. All the while, the other player continuously slashed at me with his dagger & shot at me with his rifle quite a few times just enough to barely stay alive. It just goes to show you how much people can differ from each other even though they're in the same tribe, just like in the real world.\n\nLearning the mechanics of the game took me a couple of hours with some help from the chatbox, but I finally managed to get some clothes on my back & some decent weapons in my arsenal so I started getting brave & started exploring new territory & scanning for harder beasts to kill. Overall this game was a good experience & looks very promising. There are quite a few survival games out there to keep you busy but I do recommend you give this one a go with a few friends. It does have a lot to offer for an early access release.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=674134407","April 30","true","2.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","2"

The game overall is really beautiful. They changed their engine from Hero Engine to the Unreal engine and Hero I'm sorry but you are seriously lacking the new engine creates a much smoother environment.\nFrom what I have read Above and Beyond were legitimately blindsided by a contract issue dealing with financial renegotiation. Money... always comes down to money. I see high hopes for Fragmented being a very very popular survival game if you have played repopulation you will be greeted by some graphically upgraded creatures of repopulation.\nLike all Early access game there are still some glitches here and there but very easily navigated around. The size of the flora and fauna do not regulate a number of drops you will receive. All flat RNG based. The inventory is a bit small but you are able to craft bags to help upgrade and manage the inventory space, however, they do not expand the inventory slots themselves but merely a click and open.\nIn this game, you go from a caveman stick and stone user to a bad ♥♥♥ Tech Armor and Laser shooting bad ♥♥♥. The buildings are stand-alone base images cookie cutter placements. However, they do have a very high quality look to them and quite spacious for all you're crafting machines. '\nThe crafting system is based on points gathered through leveling. Your character level and specific craft level are different. Each level of the specific craft obviously uses an increasing amount of points so if you have your heart set on a specific item make sure you''re building up correctly and saving those points!\nFrom grouping with others for PvE or PvP, single player explorer play or excessive base builder you will not be disappointed.\n\nSystem Requirements as follows:\n\nMINIMUM:\nOS: 64-Bit OS Required, Windows Vista 64 Bit or Newer\nProcessor: Dual Core Processor\nGraphics: DX10 GPU with 1GB VRAM: NVidia GTX 460/ AMD Radeon 5850\nDirectX: Version 10\nStorage: 10 GB available space\n\nRECOMMENDED:\nOS: 64-Bit OS Required, Windows 7, 8, 10\nProcessor: Quad Core Processor\nGraphics: DX11 GPU with 3GB+ VRAM: NVidia GTX 970/ AMD Radeon 390\nDirectX: Version 11\nStorage: 10 GB available space","May 21","true","13.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

From casual players to hardcore. From PvP to PvE. The casual ruleset is sime enough if you die chose a nearby respawn point and be on your merry way, carebare winning(Not a bad thing IMO options are essential to a games success). Normal ruleset is the following you lose you equiped items and keep all levels you've gained/recipes learned). Hardcore is just that ..... if you die you start at level 1 with your base gear essentially a new character :P you do maintain anything you've built of course but alot of the highlevel crafting stations are useless at low level so get grinding.\n\n\nNow for the current state of the game. Yes it is early access, but it's done an amazing job for being in such a raw state. Very little game breaking bugs in comparison to other games of this genre. The servers are remarkably stable and there are GM's that appear from time to time who will help you on the spot if possible. The graphics are on par with the average survival/crafting game.  Updates happen frequently enough to see the progress being made. And as for community input... well not many early access games have listened to their players as well as this one has.\n\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game as an "Early Access" title. Be aware of what that means. As with any Early Access game there are bugs, and hiccups along the way. Dont expect a super polished game. But it's pretty close... maybe a little more tweaks here and there and this game is golden. But Since it is soooo new I can honestly say I cannot wait to see what's to come.","May 2","true","12.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

The one thing I would improve about the game currently is the combat. It doesn't feel like I am attacking a creature, nor does it feel like I am being hit. Sometimes I cannot tell something is hitting me until I realize my health is almost empty! Usually this would happen if I was in a bush and can't see anything inside of it.\n\nI actually love the map soley for the fact that you can add markers so you know where your base is and certain creature levels, minerals, etc. It is very useful, something I wish ARK had. I am hoping for many, many, many improvements and changes, but as of right now it isn't completely trash.\n\nI also don't like how you have to wait about 2-3 seconds when switching weapons to be able to use them. I would prefer to switch and be able to use it instantly like you can in ARK. I also think the UI needs to be improved, but I am sure it will improve over time.\n\nOne more thing that actually kind of bothers me is the building placement, expecially walls needs to be improved. You can't snap things together, such as walls, to make a straight line for example. It would make it much less of a headache if they would add snapping, like every other game of this type has.\n\nKeep up the good work!","May 10","true","12.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It is EA, so there are enough bugs around, if you can't deal with those, wait a few more months. The developers are very interactive with the community and they fix most issues in a flash ... the patchnotes are usually pretty impressive.\n\nCrafting in this game is fun and a heck of a lot easier then in ARK. While I also love ARK, i prefer being able to build a complete product, instead of walls, ceilings, etc. I was always placing walls wrong places ( and damn you water pipes!) :D\n\nCombat is still a bit ... underwhelming. AI needs some work, as well as some more mob diversity. Surely they will get added later on, which is standard in game development.\n\nSeeing how feature reach Repopulation was, i expect some cool features to be added to this game as well. I already picked up noises of hoverbikes, jetpacks!! Also I hope to see more pet-activities like taming/breeding/etc.\n\n\nPerformance wise it does good, very good even for an EA. Optimisation is usually something for the last iterations, so i assume it will even get better.\n\n\nWhile rough when starting the game the first time ( there is no tutorial) , it's not hard to figure out what to do.

The analogies with Ark are plenty, up to the point where you can use your knowledge of Ark to play this game.\nI'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. It is a better product now, but it's also kind of redundant. If I want to enjoy this gameplay I'd rather play Ark.

It is the serendipitous game that was created after the Repopulation game was put on temporary hold whilst being transferred between game engines to the new and amazing engine that is the Unreal Engine.\n\nAt first glance, people may look at this game and say "wow... it's looks like a sci-fi clone of ARK: Survival Evolved," HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY THINGS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN THIS GAME;\n\nJust to list some:\n1. Game doesn't require a beefy computer rig to run at decent performance/graphics.\n2. The game is in early access with ACTIVE COMMUNICATION AND FEEDBACK between the players and the game developers.\n3. The basic mechanics of the game much less confusing to figure out early on (at least they were for me)\n4. This game has alot more potential with broader horizons to expand on rather than just being a Jurassic Park simulator (not knocking, huge fan of that saga.)\n\nWhile the game populations are low right now due to lack of media attention, the devs have said alot about putting Fragmented up for a nice price in the upcoming Steam Summer Sale, and I highly recommend buying this game. Even in it's early access stage, you can still enjoy the game quite a bit, either solo or in the growing official servers, playing PvE or PvP alike. There are casual servers, for those not wanting ot be tied down to a game, and then Hardcore servers, for those looking for more of a challenge than the native species that roam the alien planet Rhyldan.\n\nThere are some minor bugs, but nothing major yet that's game breaking. Lots of fundamental game mechanics are always being patched and tweaked on a regular basis. What's great about this is the active community involved in the creation of this game-- you're free to be a part of it! Your ideas can become a reality in the tundras and jungles and barren pits of Rhyldan, and you get a front row seat to see it come to life and functionality!\n\nIf you're struggling to get started, pelase don't just give up and ask for a refund. There are plenty of friendly vets who have been here since day one to help you out and get started on the right track. The forums are pretty active, it shouldnt take more than a few days to get an answer if it's not already answered on the developer-run wikipedia page.\n\nThis game offers a fairly well balanced survival experience, with level-tiered crafting and that is ever explanding to keep players new and old alike interested. It's not too overwhelming to learn jsut to play once in a while, but is involved and developing depth to it constantly to keep you building and seeking that ultimate base-security and  defensive superiority.\n\n","June 4","true","54.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

First, I have to say overall it's a decent game. I also started on solo offline play. It reminds me a lot of minecraft. I never played the previous one so that's what I see in it. It's the adult version of minecraft. XD\n\nHere's what I think so far:\n\n~Pros~\n\nVast crafting system where almost everything is usable in some fashion\n\nRealistic nature in the fact you have health, hunger, thirst, temperature  (which is borderline annoying), and stamina\n\nCan create basic recipes on the go (bandages bandages and more bandages)\n\nAdvancement is quick and painless with the fact you get experience from just about everything\n\nLots of skills to upgrade but not too many to be overwhelming\n\nUnless you're playing with permadeath the penalties for dying are good for beginners. You keep all your stuff and are force respawned at a named location you pick\n\n~Cons~\n\nLimited inventory space with the need to make multiple pouches to store items in which I have not found a way to look in the pouches\n\nNo direction.....at all....none....you are dropped in the middle of nowhere. YouTube videos are the only reason I had a grasp on basic concepts and could advance as quickly as I did.\n\nThe tide in the lake. I dunno if this is a glitch or built in, but the lake will slowly pull you out to the center. Yes, lake. Odd.....\n\nGetting killed in my cabin. I mean seriously attacked through the walls.\n\nOne stick from a tree that dwarves my character then twenty items for a small bush. It needs to be more realistic drop ratio to size. It's completely random.\n\nI have no idea where I'm at and where I need/want to go. There is a map but it's a separate window you have to activate to see. I would love love love love love a mini map. Or at least a compass.\n\nLastly, and maybe the biggest problem I have is the system requirements. I have a decent laptop, but my computer was struggling to run it. On lowest settings with rendering distance close as I can get it the game still is clunky, but tollerable. This is why I cannot make comments on graphics. I can tell a tree is a tree though.\n\n\nOverall this game has amazing potential. If implemented correctly I could see this being a very good game. I'm excited to see what will come out next after reading about how far it's already come.","May 18","true","5.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

Repopulation i actuallyed thought i could get into the aliens were fun although i wish we had more, and i wanted more community interaction from other players when i first entered it was cause a friend of mine invited me to play since then he ditched me and i ditched the game and requested my money back  so i could purchase another title in steam and uninstalled the game from my library. Fragmented made by the creators of both games Ark and RePopulation its actually fun for me on a solo play i play offline and i am ejoying it thus far and also wish they would ad more i highly recommend you get this game as it is free so it wont hurt your pocket and the mom and dad who made Ark and RePop are involved so this should be a decent game in time.","May 2","true","54.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","7"

Plus there's a lot of work being done and the Devs are amazingly responsive to feedback.  That and no silly dinosaurs or poop throwing... the community thus far has been the typical Repop groups which is to say very helpful and non toxic.\n\nBiggest issues right now is that it's short on content for end game but that should take a decent amount of time to get to and the rate these devs are working I'd imagine we'll see more content for then before most users get to it. However, and one of the best things i've seen is they seem to focus more on bug fixes than just pushing content which is a nice difference compared to other games.\n\nKeep in mind it is still early access and there are some nasty bugs still being found, but USE the bug report system they actually pay attention. It's easy to do it in game just hit TAB to see the commands I believe this one is in there (was last I checked haha).\n\nThis IS NOT REPOPULATION or It's REPLACEMENT! It's a second project the Repop team has been working on that is set in the Repopulation universe it's also a great testing ground for them to work on porting over to the engine with Repop!\n\n\nBIGGEST CON to date: The inventory system... while it's limiting as a part of the "difficulty" you get screwed using the pouches, backpacks, and storage boxes when the game bugs out and you lose hours of farming because all of those additional storage containers empty after a crash. I enjoy the game but being based on resource gathering and having main inventory be a limiting factor this is a very bad bug to see.

This gives me great hope for what the new version of Repop will be like when its coded for UE4. There are minor glitches with weapons but that is to be expected from an early alpha release. The lighting is great and makes many of the familiar creatures look much better than they did previously. There is always room for improvement but they are on point for today's Survival Game standard.\n\nSurvival\n________________\n\nThe basics are all there, food, water, health, energy. Resources were not super abundant, nor were they overly scarce, I was able to survive without dying at all on my inital playthrough of the game. There are a number of food items that can be upgraded into better food items or even drinks, at higher levels there is a farming system in place for growing sustainable crops for a settlement. The NPCs were easy enough to dispatch with the help of bandages and I reccomend stocking up on them because they are a life saver when you are starving or dying of thirst.\n\nCrafting\n________________\n\nCrafting recipes are aquired as you invest points into a number of skills and the recipes get stronger as you advance. Right now even in the early stages there are lots of items to craft from basic refined resources all the way up to off road vehicles and large technological buildings. I have spoken to the developers and they plan on adding an in depth crafting system similar to the one that is being developed for their MMO The Repopulation. This  is huge news as it will make the crafting the most advanced and in depth crafting system of any Survival Game to date. I look forward to seeing this develop.\n\nCombat\n________________\n\nCombat felt fluid and the animations were nice as well. There are ranged and melee weapons from basic rock knives all the way up to Laser Rifles and beyond. Cities can develop defense Turrets and force fields and all player structures can be destoryed on PVP servers. I ran into no desync issues or lag issues that made fighting difficult and the swings and blocks were all real time. This is exciting for full scale PVP and even higher end PVE fights down the road.\n\n\nBases/Building\n________________\n\nThere are a log of prefab structures you can place on base platforms that you craft of varying levels of durability. You can make everything from small huts to large cities based on how many resources you have at your disposal. The interiors have easy to use placement for items you wish to craft for decorative or use puproses. The developers also mentioned they are importing a lot of interior items for both functionality and RP purposes.\n\nMy overall opinion of the game is high and it has lots of promise in the future. I look forward to following the development as it grows into one of the top Survival Game contenders.","April 26","true","33.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

It was at that point I learned of the current news for The Repopulation. I decided to check the game out and see what this was all about.\n\nAfter messing around for a bit in the game and just sort of getting my bearings (as this was just before it was officially released) I decided to table the game and come back to it as I saw a good amount of potential. And yes the potential is very much there.\n\nWithin the month or so I was away (mostly due to real life) the game updated dramatically. Many of the early bugs and glitches were quickly fixed. The developers keep in quick and continuous (almost inhuman) contact with the player base and help quickly address, duplicate, test, and fix problems that arise. Watching this game develop is like watching an interactive trailer for The Repopulation.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes: It is a toned down MMORPG leveling system. 50 total levels with 8 skills that each max out at rank 10 requiring an increasing number of points to upgrade. Each level unlocks new recipes and some skills offer passive bonuses. There is a degree of specialization due to the nature of the system meaning you can not unlock rank 10 in all 8 skills. Unlike other survival games base construction follows a different formula, and honestly it is one that for the game and the lore makes sense. Buildings are prefabricated with only foundations and walls being individual structures. Unlike Rust or ARK you are colonizing a planet. In other words the foundations are for multiple structures with which to build entire settlements, not single fortresses. This allows for the development not just of a major base but entire cities if properly constructed. This moves the clever design of a single base into the clever design of an entire settlement area, which I find to be a unique and interesting touch.\n\nThe planet has the typical biomes: Forest, Desert, Artic. Each biome offers similar and specialized resources. The fauna in each biome alters as well as their levels. Some creatures are found all over, other mostly in one area, some in certain spots of all areas. The Flora is the same way. All flora and fauna has their uses in some of the recipes making each useful and not just pretty filler to look at.\n\nWeapon progression also makes sense. You go from simple melee weapons to more complex melee weapons (if you desire to) to ranged weapons. While there might need to be a slight balancing relating to beam pistols and rifles, the progression is appropriate. There are explosive weapons as well that are mostly used for pvp encounters and base sieging.\n\nArmor, while useful for combat and looks, is not a major necessity aside from climate conditions. This I find to be absolutely great. While most people will opt for some form of armor. The armor with the best protection might not help you so much in the desert environment and cause you to overheat. This creates some sense of diversity in the armors allowing for there to be some differentiation.\n\nCombat can be somewhat clunky in the sense of animations. There are some graphical errors when equipping ranged weapons that can easily be fixed by zooming the camera out and back in. Without knowing that trick, though, it can be frustrating to deal with at first.\n\nWhile games such as this are always going to be easier with a group. Fragmented allows the individual to be able to play the game. Both casual and hardcore players can both handle themselves alone on this hostile planet. With various server styles as well as a single player experience, there is no segment of the gaming populace that is left out.\n\nAll in all the game still has its rough edges but is light years ahead of other titles in similar stages of development. The communication between the developers and players alone makes this title a should buy if you are interested in survival games and MMO's. The similarities between Fragmented and Rust and ARK are only superficial in the sense that they occupy the same genre. The underlying mechanics and stylizations in both level progression and settlement management bring this game into a new area. While Rust and ARK are individual survival games, the quarks in Fragmented shift the game to the survival of the entire species. The resetting of the narrative into that framing alone moves this game away from Rust and ARK on all but surface levels.","June 5","true","57.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Within seconds of login I was greeted by holyAvengerOne community manager for Fragmented, It was nice to play and chat with someone involved with this project and get the needed information to actually make a go at this game. So many of these early access games lack any sort of direction or even a guide to understand what to actually do in the game.  There where tons of people running around on the US east PVE server the 1st one on the list and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We all started gather various resource and working on leveling and our crafting skill as well as forming a guild.\n\nLooking forward to voice chat or interested in getting a TS or VENT server to play this game, thats how cool everyone was.

So this is a review from your "average joe".\n\nLike a lot of people, I was shocked when The Repopulation went down, the game had such potential. I was really happy when they announced that the production was not stopped and that they would move everything over to the Unreal Engine, creating another game at the same time. Not only that, but that game (Fragmented) would be free for anyone who backed The Repopulation.\n\nThis game really sums up to one word: Potential.... and it has a lot of it because it is still very early. As a survival game, the skill system that allows you to unlock different item creation is great. It forces you to choose carefully what you want your character to have as skill to survive the savage world of Fargmented.\n\nThe various items you can craft based on your skill selection are fun to discover. As of the Alpha, there are quite a lot already, but I hope that there will be even more in the future. The map is beautiful, you can feel the power of the Unreal Engine behind it, but it can quickly feel a bit generic. Let's hope that future builds will bring more life to the map, new ecosystems, new critters, new monsters. But for an Alpha built it is more than great already.\n\nAll and all, if you are looking for a sci-fi survival game that looks great, as a good difficulty also has a good community with involved devs, Fragemented is for you.\n\nIf not, you should still give it a try and see for yourself!\n\nDone right (like it has been done so far), this game has an amazing future in the survival game space for sci-fi enthusiasts.","April 28","true","7.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I'm probably slightly biased just from the fact that it was free (for me).\n\nIt's like Ark: Survival Evolved, only even more of a sci-fi theme and no dinosaurs. It runs considerably better as well, though it's extremely rough at the moment. Drop rates and material costs likely need tweaking as well, so read some other more in-depth reviews that played it more than I did (I played it long enough to see "This is basically Ark, cool) before making a decision, ultimately I'd say grab it if it interests you, it's lacking a lot of polish and is in a pretty early state, but given time it will probably turn out pretty good, if a bit generic (there's only so much you can do to stand out as a survival sandbox game).","April 26","true","0.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Devs are extremely active and responsive and are working tirelessly to fix problems and further develop the game.  The game itself has a great sci-fi ambient feel to it.  Music is awesome and the sounds really add to the immersion.  Armour looks cool, and weapons look and sound cool (pew pew laser sounds which I'm a huge fan of in sci-fi games, so many sci-fi games now use ballistic weapons which I find mundane).  Playing on a PVE casual server and the community has been extremely helpful and friendly.  Everyone works together to build and survive the elements.\n\nThe team gave this game free to owners of The Repopulation which was an extremely classy move on their part.  As they port The Repopulation to Unreal 4 they're using this game as a test bed of sorts to further improve the MMO.  I think that's a fantastic idea personally.\n\nOf course it's EA and there are your typical EA bugs, but so far this has been a very positive experience and I have a lot of faith in the team.","April 27","true","3.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

This is a prequel to Repop, where you play a colonist/survivor on an as of yet uncolonized planet.  You start with nothing.  You can harvest resources and make clothing, weapons, tools and structures.\n\nFor a survial game, this one is beautiful.  The game itself is quite functional, I've yet to encounter a game mechanic that was so disfunctional that it caused the game to be unplayable.\n\nOn the downside, the game is quite simple at this stage, the main goal being to survive, which is easy.  There are bugs but the developers are actively fixing them.\n\nI'm recommending this game because it's playable and has the potential and backing to be very decent, and it leads into The Repopulation, which will share many of it's features and backstory.","April 27","true","61.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

In case newcomers aren't aware, these developers left their previous server host, Idea Fabrik, over hosting issues and Idea Fabrik also running out of funds.  The whole story is a circus, but you can read up on it online.  Anyway, AaB decided to leave Idea Fabrik and go their seperate ways.  Since they need more funding, they came up with the idea of a survival game set in the Repop universe.\n\nSurvival games are THE thing right now.  Steam is saturated with them.  Fragmented uses the UE4 engine .About 90% of the game are the same asset's you'll see in the new Repopulation MMO. Fragmented needs alot of work on the animations and crafting list.  Right now, it's just a list of stuff whereas games like Ark and Rust, have departments you navigate to for crafting certain things.\n\nFragmented is a mix between Rust and Ark.  You can tell by the name of some of the food items.  They are pretty smiliar to Ark.  The big difference between these games, is that Ark is actually fun even in early access.  Fragmented is short on the monster department.  You have to actually go and look for mobs to fight in Fragmented right now.\n\nEarly on, you find plenty of materials to craft clothing and weapons.  This is a great move on the dev's part, but there aren't enough monsters to fight.  This makes the gameplay drag on for awhile.\n\nHow the crafting works is, you have a level system.  Every time you collect materials you gain xp, just like in Ark.  When you level, you gain skill points.  You have about 9 or 10 skills to level, and when you level those with skill points, you learn new recipes.  So if you want to be a combat character, you level up melee or ranged, and can craft better weapons.\n\nSeeing as how Fragmented is just a catalyst to make more money to eventually finish Repopulation, I don't see the dev's putting in a lot of polish on this long term.  They will push this out of early access, hopefully sell a few thousand units, and make enough cash to finish Repop. That's what I hope anyway. I really don't care for Fragmented, I just want to eventually have a working Repopulation game that I paid $100 for.","April 26","true","2.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

After reading and finding out i got it for The Repopulation being canned (LAME. No other game would let me be a Robot-building Stripper/ Dancer... Seriously.)\n\nFirst thoughts when seeing the video in the store page: Oh great.. ANOTHER survival game...\n\nFirst thoughts when launching the game: Damn, is that a steady 60 fps? I doubt it, on my system, but it does run really smooth.\n\nLots of crafting to be done. From Stone axes all the way up to using Nanites ( no clue as to thier purpose).\n-EDIT 4/28/16-\nAfter playing a few hours of forraging and gathering logs and branches and fiber, and many Metimucil jokes later, I was able to start crafting a base. Heres where its broken. I spent the better part of 30 minutes chopping down all the trees i could see, only to make a giant "base", or a giant platform that you can build on top of- supposedly... I placed the base down and afterward was unable to build directly upon it. Walls dont link to edges, nor do they place directly next to the previous wall. They tend to always give the "Item is intersecting with another, cant place" error message. The most frustrating part other than that is the item has 3, yes THREE, colors when in placement mode. Green for yes place here, red for no you cant do that, and brownish yellow for no you cant place that here and let me tell you why, followed by the message of why you suck at life. The third color, being the most prevalent when making your base.\n-End edit-\n\nYou start off in your underwear (cause thats how i would load up into an escape pod... in my skivvies) as in most survival games. This one Is more Sci-Fi based than most games, though i did have a feeling for a while that i was playing ARK, if only due to the Ambient sounds making me feel like there was a giant something just around the corner, looking to smash my face in.\n\nThe scenery is nicely done. Most of the environment can be harvested and used for crafting. Its a nice breath of fresh air to see more than just ONE type of item drop from any one type of harvestable (I.E. A bush will drop Sticks, Twigs, Berries, Fibers, Etc.).\n\nIt being just released out of Alpha, there are a bunch of things, I'm sure, that are not working/ in place. Like the base building.\n\nWhat i noticed, from the hour i've put in: Creature animations are stiff, if there at all. I was smashing an "elk" type thing over the head with my pointy stick. It was just standing there looking at my health get lower and lower. The next one i killed actually attacked me, but then after a few kicks to my face, it too just stood there and watched my health deplete. I lol'd.\n\nSome of the character animations are a bit funny. The pointy stick being the best/ funniest animation. Its a pointy stick, but you bash things with it instad of stabbing. Well, at least most of the time.\n\nAs long as you have an item equipped to the hot bar and have that number selected, but sheathed (hit the button once to pull out selection, again to put it away, Hands come back up), you can literally punch ore out of rocks, logs out of trees, Etc. This basically lets you harvest anything you want, even with a broken tool in your hotbar.\nMy favorite thing, for some reason, id to go into third person mode, and look down. Watching the characters wrists bend like they do... Its funny (hands are still tethered to the camera even though its now behind your head, so they bend a bit oddly).\n\n\nAll in all, i cant say i found anything too terrible in the time i ran around. It was a bit confusing to figure out that i level up and have to spend skill points in the inventory to unlock new skills/ craftables; without a tutorial of sorts. Some sort of exp meter would be nice on the HUD as well as the minimalistic one in your inventory.\n\n-EDIT- 4/28/16 A little explanation of the leveling sytem skills: Every couple hundred exp you earn (early levels, thousands later on), you gain 4 skill points. These points can be used in the following catagories (Copy-Pasta'd from http://wccftech.com/sci-fi-survival-game-fragmented-launching-april-26-on-steam-early-access-the-repopulation-back-in-testing-in-late-2016/) :\n* CONSTRUCTION allows you to create buildings, props, storage containers, and various types of crafting stations\n*ELECTRONICS includes the creation of Electronic Devices, Turrets, Medical Scanners, or Robotics.\n*MELEE provides bonuses in melee combat, as well as the creation of melee weapons and tools.\n*RANGED provides bonuses in ranged combat, and allows creation of ranged weapons and grenades\n*REFINING is used to refine raw materials, unlocks harvestables, and creates tools\n*SUBSISTENCE reduces the effects of hunger and thirst, and allows the creation of foods, drinks or medical compounds. It will also include genetic engineering on the high end\n*SURVIVAL increases your health and allows the creation of traps, torches, and campfires\n*TEXTILES is used to create armor, clothing, and backpacks\n-End Pasta-\nAs you level up, the amount of skill points required for the next level skill is the number of level youre trying to get to, I.E. you want to learn level 3 melee, you need 3 skill points for that, 4 for level 4, etc.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nGood game. Good graphics. Good sound. SO FAR\nIf youre a fan of survival games, you may like this.\nNot going to give a score, since i have maybe an hour or so playtime as of the first night it was released to us Repopulation owners; which gives me little to no knowledge of how the game really plays, and lets face it: giving a "score" to an early access game is like a blind person driving a city bus....

This game is going well. I run the graphics settings pretty darn low and it still looks very nice to me. The devs have been quite active with updates, bug fixes and the like so that is quite exciting. I enjoy the crafting system and survival aspect very much. It is fun and not impossible.\nSince game comparisons are being thrown around, I'd like to use Unturned by Nelson Sexton. There is crafting, building, harvesting and wellness management which I think are all very good at this stage of development. I'd like to recommend this game if one enjoys the features I mentioned AND doesn't have a habit of negatively reviewing F2P games that are still under development after only playing it for seven minutes. If you want to wait, then wait. You know if you are willing to put up with an early access game or not. I imagine the price tag to be questionable to some, so there is that. I think it's fair but then again I recieved this game for free as I had already purchased The Repop.","April 28","true","16.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

I hope the devs will be bringing in more features in the future.\nCrafting is much simpler that the Repop but still fun.\nGraphics are better than the Repop.\nThe game has a different style than the Repop, you are really starting from scratch in Fragmented, you have literally nothing to begin with. You have to start off by creating stone tools...Whereas in the Repopulation you had basic weapons, and a bit of knowledge of what is going on- thanks to NPCs and easy missions. Here there is nothing, no helpful NPCs, no missions.\nIt is still a fun game and worth looking at if you like survival games, however in it's current state I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it.\n","May 4","true","16.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

You will be using futuristic weapons and armor later on in the game, instead of taming dinosaurs.\n\nMost of your time when you start will be consumed by not freezing to death, and eating and drinking, but I found after you get your feet under you, the exploring is pretty fun, it is a great looking world imo.\n\nI'm not usually a big fan of survival type games, findin them too simplistic to really stay enjoyable, but with the added leveling and recipes and loot in Fragmented, it really does feel a little more MMOish and more depth/things to do then most survival games.\n\nThe game is a little laggy/buggy atm, but pretty stable for how quickly they got it out, and since the assets are being used for the MMO they are making, I expect there will be plenty of updates and additions as they progress on the MMO and add those items to this game also.","April 26","true","41.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Other than this the FPS was good and the servers never went down or crashed once for me at all.\n\nAsside from the great leveling and crafting system, the base building, enviroment and  creatures you face are all unique and different finding yourself in a strage world. This makes the game very interesting.. I've never been a sci-fi person but exploring this alien planet is somewhat captivating and you never know what you are going to find (some supplies you can only fine in different biomes, forcing you to travel away from your home). The base building definetely needs work, at this state it is very good but you cant "UNDO" something once you place it.. you can remove your own structures instantely which is very great but you dont get it back and are forces to make or have another when correcting placements. The structures are very cool though in this game, the buildings are futuristic and look like stuff out of startcraft.\n\nAt the end of the day this game has its unique twist on the genre and the untique autmophere to go with it, the game is an EA title and requires more work, but even since I've played today there has been a 3rd update in the couple days. The community is good, the crafting is good and the survival aspects as well as the foes you face are enjoyable. I will say the combat seems a little clunky and as I said things need to be worked on but this game holds great promise and I look forward to seeing what the devs have instore for us, the game is fair for the price and in my opinion is deserving of the 25$.\n\nPS. Forgive me if I missed important things or layed that out really bad.. like I said its 5am and I just wanted to get this up so I  didn't forget to give this game the positive vote it deserved.","April 28","true","5.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

What was most unpleasent is that the creatures you can meet in fragment look ok, but the animations feel like from times when Deus Ex (the very first title) was released. When you get attacked its just a creature standing in front of you repeating a very unfitting attack move over and over again. It just doesnt feel like there is a threat, it feels like there is a computer animated thing doing stuff in front of me.\n\nCurrently it is a world which i can't fall in love with, i always have the very strong presence to play a computer game from the past.

Regardless of how weak base structure was, the fun was relocating, rebuilding & striking back.\n\nDuring the time base structure damage was disabled, I spent over a week farming to gather/harvest materials for defensive turrets.

Unless you are willing to deal with losing your stuff randomly, desyncs, graphical glitches (when you crouch holding anything the animation is of you holding a gun), poor video optimization with framerates all over the place even on a very high-end gaming rig and wonky mechanics (you glitch like a madman and spin/warp all over the place if you step onto a dropped loot package for example), you should wait before throwing any money at the title.\n\nIf you dare play on PVP servers, exploiters and glitchers will be griefing you constantly. For instance, you can be shot anywhere inside of your base by someone glitching their gun through the door of whatever building you are in (unless you've played non-stop since it was released with friends and have enough combined resources to "secure" your inner base).\n\nYou might want to give this title a bit more time to "mature". It is very much like other generic survival "sandboxes" just in a sci-fi setting on an alien world. Many of the skills seem underpowered and I scratch my head looking at the trees wondering "what were they thinking?". They just don't make seem to make sense and good luck surviving as a crafting character on a PVP server. You'll get rekt by the guy who puts everything into Ranged with just enough into the other skills to build the guns and healing stuff he needs.\n\nSo far, from my experiences melee seems pretty useless while guns are OP because of the crappy netcode and bugginess of the game. It is WAY, WAY too easy to get guns also, BTW. Unlike games like ARK where there is at least some form of a logical technological progression and you require certain kinds of toolbenches to craft things this game requires it for some things but not for others and does it in such a random way that it seems to not make much sense. A gun should require some kind of advanced toolbench, at least a basic forge, right? Nope. Not in this game. You can make an assault rifle without needing any kind of advanced tools at all.\n\nIt's one of the few games I have seen where I have to say that it really isn't ready yet even for EA, I don't think. It could have used a bit more time in the oven before releasing it instead of, what seems like, a quick copy-paste job of existing assets from The Repopulation into the Unreal Engine. The really rough state of the game right now will only wind up hurting their sales as it compares poorly to similar games also in EA that are in a much more advanced state (like ARK).\n\nI will give some credit to the developer for being quick to release patches, which is the only real positive thing I've seen so far.\n\nEDIT: I want to say that the developer has been better than many with acknowledging and fixing issues. If this continues, I'll gladly change my review to be more positive. It still has a ways to go though.","April 28","false","80.4"," 16 of 41 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","16","41","0","2"

On loading up I noticed the graphics weren't anything like what they were showing in the screenshots, everything from the ground textures, to the trees and alien creates looked like they were very rudimentary in their design. What NPCs I did encounter just seem to kind of wander around and attack you when you get close enough, and then if you're just starting out they usually win. There was nothing in the game worth writing home about and it seems strange to me that this has been released to early access for around $20, in it's current state it is clearly not worth that much. Maybe things will improve, but to what degree? There's nothing here you haven't seen before, and it's usually been done a whole lot better in other games.\n\nThe Forest for example is a very similar game, you crash in a forest and must forage for survival and often you're at odds with the indigineous population. But the AI in the Forest is incredibly advanced, and the forest looks like a forest, not an experiment in hodge-podge textures and shaders like Fragmented.\n\nI'm giving examples of other games for perspective reasons but I don't really want to compare this to other games because the development team may take things a whole different direction. There are a lot of survival games out now and as it's one of my new favorite genres I tend to look very closely at each of them. Many are being abandoned by devs due to a lack of interest in players, I wish buying an early access game contractually bound developers to releasing a game with every feature they promised during early access.\n\nI tried Fragmented, I installed the game, fired it up, took a look around and decided that they had a long long road ahead if they were serious about completing this title. But unless they add something unique and spectacular between now and then I don't really see a reason to play this over other survival titles that have been out longer and have achieved more.","May 11","false","0.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","14"

And the map is pretty small. (you run like in 15mins from one end to the other)\n\nCombat: Hold left mouse button and spam bandages is a bit boring. Being able to outrun every mob is a bit boring too.\n\nCrafting: Overall pretty nice and i like that there are more kind of recources then in the typical survival game. But it's kinda frustrating that everytime you unlock something new (like a building, weapon, etc.) that you need a component of much higher level then the thing you want to craft. (for example bed is lvl5 but components require a lvl7 thing)\n\nLeveling: Somehow it feels wrong to me to combine stat leveling with unlocking crafting. Would be much better when we could decide stats to increase and independently from stats have a techtree for crafting.\n\nPlacing structures: I'm missing the freedom to build my own houses by placing walls, roofs and so on. You just craft a prebuilt house and place it.\n\n\nIn the end, it's a nice typical survival game with decent graphics but totally missing it's own innovations to stand out from the crowd of other survival games.","April 28","false","4.0"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

I make basic tools while leveling my character, and continue to explore. I go for a swim in the water, and as I try to leave I find myself stuck in the swimming animation on land, unable to perform any action. In this state I am set upon by a blue creature with an axe.\nI try to walk (swim) away from the beast and manage to return to water. the beast follows me into the water and proceeds to attack me in a normal standing animation, despite being under water. I die and my resourses are scatterred all over. I respawn and return to my death site, only to be chased again by a buggy blue beast that first ended my life. desperate to reclaim what I lost, I ignore it and attempt to gather my belongings. I then am set upon by yet another unusual goat looking animal. This too attacks me while in the water. Again I perish...\n\nMy controls were not particularly easy to set up and then were reset to default after the patch. and the game only looks pretty on the surface. The animations are clunky and the movement is erratic at best.\nWhile the game may be in pre-alpha so far it is simply not worth the £18.99 price. there are many other pre-alpha games that are in a much more stable state and cheaper too.","May 12","false","5.1"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","7","23","0","2"

If the thread is still at the forum, you can search for that statement. That worried me and, after trying the game, i'm even more worried for the future of this. Not saying that it won't improve and maybe end being a great game (in a long future) but the rushed feeling and the apparent lack of direction and a simple planning is worrying, in my opinion.\n\nWhat i liked/disliked about the game:\n\nLiked:\n\n-Crafting content. There's a lot of items/tools/constructions to build here. Various levels of tools with different materials, melee and ranged weapons, various levels of buildings (from an ugly wood shack to big high-tech steel buildings, i was just able to craft a small iron building that was very nice, much more than the shack) and, in general, a mix of low tech things with high tech things (a wood fence vs a forcefield, for instance) that gives you a good amount of options in crafting.\n\n-For me, game was very stable and without any big bugs (well, in those 2 hours i played of course)\n\n-Playing offline, fps were stable and without any drop (playing all maximum, Epic graphic options)\n\nMeh:\n\n-Graphics are just ok, in my opinion. The terrain is way better than the plants and enemies, that are just...meh. Not impressive at all.\n\nDislike:\n\n-Since the start, i had to config X-axis at minimum (too much sensible) and Y-axis at maximum (much more slow movement). It was really weird to almost have sickness while looking horizontally and at the same time, feeling the Y looking so sluggish.\n\n-Harvesting is...horrible. Either if you punch with key or with left mouse button, prepare to be constanly doing that to harvest any resource. If you craft an appropiate tool, it's even worse because then you can harvest more resources (but not at the same time, 1 on 1 with each click or press). Harvesting it's also random from plant, rock or tree to the next one: sometimes a big tree disapears with just 1 click and gives you 1 fiber (that's ridiculous) and sometimes you need to click 30 times to collect all resources. And the hitbox of trees and some big plants feels weird, also, so you need first to find it exactly at that point of the camera.\n\n-Too much grinding. I'm sure at least 75% of my first 2 hours was just grinding materials to test crafting and building.\n\n-Combat is simple and boring. Most of the time, i don't know if i'm hitting or not because the lack of animations. I need to look at the health bar of the enemy to see if i'm doing well. Also, at the start, you do more damage with a stone axe than with any other specific weapon/tool so no point in crafting some things.\n\n-Map is repetitive and have too much visual distractions because the plants and their colors, so very confuse also.\n\n\nIn general, although i saw no big bugs, seem to be hundreds of little things to re-design, to polish, to create or to destroy in the game, speaking about development. That leaves me with the feeling that this game will need not only a lot of time to improve, but also a lot of success to be able to keep its own developing plus the other game they want to redone (Repopulation).\n\nAlso, and maybe this is a bit unfair, i got the feeling that all the amount of micromanage for your inventory and the crazy amount of things to craft just to start was a distraction for the 2 hours limit to be surpassed. At least, it almost did it for me (look at my played time lol 10 mins more and...) and all i did was testing and trying to craft a good bunch of things.\n\nI'm sorry but i think this don't have enough of anything to be a good game (yet, of course): lacks content, lacks polish, lacks really good graphics, lacks good harvesting and combat systems, lacks good animations and movement, lacks anything that beats/improves other survival games out there and lacks even a developing plan, which is more worrying given the circumstances around this game and the other game. Oh, and talking about anything this has compared to other games: all i did was almost the same i can do in The Ark. Crafting, levels, building, harvesting...i can understand that a lot of this games share some general ways to do actions in game, but the feeling was that i already played the same in other game.\n\nI recommend not buying and waiting at least a few months (5-6 or more depending on the speed of development) Anyway, i wish good luck to devs and i hope this will change (a lot) so i can come back again one day and play again.","April 28","false","1.9"," 13 of 36 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","13","36","0","2"

This time in a Sci-Fi themed world. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThe long version: Sad to say I'd be more inclined to recommend this title if it stood out in any way. Its graphics are on par with most other genre matching titles, It's crafting is nothing out of the norm, NPC combat doesn't feel good, the animations are stiff, and in most ways it just ends up as another Day-Z, Rust, or ARK clone, the only distinction being set in a different (Alien world) setting.\n\nGames it's like: It's a prettier, less rough around the edges version of the game Planet Explorers with a dash of The Forest, or Rust thrown in.

That's probably based upon the fact that I'm not a real MMO fan and the ruleset with Fragmented feels just like that to me.\nI'm grinding away to get certain stuff done, but I don't feel any motivation to achieve something ingame.\n\n\nFragmented,\n\nIs a game in very early access. Does that mean it's unplayable?\nNo, as a matter of fact it's very playable, but you have to deal with some things that might be kind of frustrating in the beginning; or might feel unlogical.\n\nThe game does certain things in a different way than for instance Ark: Survival Evolved, Empyrion: Galactic Survival and Creativerse. And I mean the part about crafting.\n\nExample:\nAt this moment when I want to create an object that requires a campfire or a mortar and pestle then I just stand next to the object and enter my personal crafting menu to create the object straight away. I don't access the required object's inventory as to speak.\nIt's not hard to grasp, but feels, I don't know, a bit off when you ask me.\n\nBesides of that, things run smooth. Graphics are okay and nice although I expected the trailer quality which doesn't 100% reflect ingame when all is cranked to epic and above. But, alright, I can live with that.\n\nOfcourse, I probably just scratched the surface of this game, but it does feel and breathes early access, so you should be willing to accept that if you decide to buy this game.\n\nAt this moment I do recommend the game, if you're okay with early access, but I don't recommend the game for the following reason:\nThe developers of Fragmented canceled/put on hold the "Repopulation" game which uses the Hero engine. As a result they came up with Fragmented which uses the Unreal engine.\nSmart choice you might say, well, I'm not so sure.\nRight now when I'm playing the game it feels like they where forced to choose this path to keep earning money.\nTo me it doesn't feel like they will actually put out a better, bigger version of Fragmented in the near future.\nThe over all quality of the current state of the game doesn't reflect that.\nI do hope for the best, but expect the worst. Pessimistic, maybe, but with todays game developers quiet realistic I would say.\n\nWhy buy now?\nEarly Acces in general tends to be cheaper. Games that get out of early acces tend to increase in price upon launch. (Well, just wait a couple of months after launch to buy it at a reduced price. So, there's that as well.)\n\nWhy shouldn't you buy?\nIf you're not sure if the developers are able to deliver, don't buy. Did you watch the trailers and read some other reviews? Do you still have that feeling: "Hmm, looks cool, might be okay, dunno; but I want a new game(?)"\nDon't buy this just yet.

The envoirnment is not really that great to look at and the devs use the same tricks like random glow from underneath that was used in Star Wars Galaxies. I hope no one wastes their hard earned money on this. Only price i'd reccomend this game at is a 4 pack for 10 bucks.","May 1","false","0.4"," 13 of 40 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","13","40","2","2"

First off I have been trying at different times to connect to a live server for the majority of the time played.  Today was the first day I could connect and stay on in game.  The Graphics and animation are not very impressive and are just plain assests with nothing that really makes it stand out or even customized as their own. With no guidence it is not that hard to figure out game play and not very challenging overall.  The hardest thing about the game is lack of space/Items taking up to much space in inventory and the boring harvest,harvest, and more harvesting.  Followed by no compass in the UI you have to open up the map to see where you are going.\n\nMovement while swimming needs to be worked on.  Granted unless you get up to go make dinner or watch a movie you wont run out of breath while swimming but you can either swim or dive/rise you don't swim on top of water and you can't have forward movement while trying to swim up.\n\nFood is very important in order to survive and I understand this. However, if I ate the ammount of steak you have to eat and as often as you have to eat my cholestrol levels would be through the roof.  the other items I have found so far berries don't provide much to you at all and the constant foraging until you can start harvesting meat tends to become to repetitive.\n\nCombat is kinda boring click,click,click.  with the lag it can be a bit difficult to target something and the lag to the server I was on made several of the local Fauna Cha-cha.  With the Lag I got bored killing very quickly and unfortunaly you have to keep killing critters in hopes of harvesting what you need to make explosives..ect.  once you make a waterskin the best thing you can do is keep working towards building you base because you need to stay hydrated.\n\nYour cold, Your hot, it does not seem to matter as far as what you are doing at the time or the enviroment.  While I was in game we all (everyone on USEAST2) would get the same message at the same time.  "Your Hot" it was raining and I was swimming at the time.\n\nDeath: When you die due to thirst, Hunger, falling off your wooden base, being turned into kibble for one of the critters you have 15 seconds when your map pops up showing where you died and giving 4-5 choices of where you want to respawn.  If you do not choose then you will respawn randomly somewhere on the map.  while playing off line I respawned way down south? in a frozen area that had an abundance of fruit to pick as I tried to make it back where I was before.\n\nAnd I know that people are going to say this is an early release and yes I do understand that it is not going to be a finnished product and you get what you pay for, Buyer beware, there's a sucker born every minute take your pick as to how you want to bash/defend this game.\n\nPros:\n1)  it was cheap I got early access because of supporting Repop.\n2)  When you are able to get in the other players are talkative and helpful.\n\nCons:\n1)  Slow game play very repetitive.\n2)  Very laggy servers.\n3)  No Compass function.\n4)  Meh.. graphics and animation.\n5)  Little real customizing of your character.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone else at this time without a major overhaul and some real work put in to it.","April 28","false","8.8"," 6 of 27 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","6","27","0","1"

I know this game is in early Alpha but please, the graphics are terrible, and the game is completly boring. I can put up with bad graphics if the game is amazing to play or at least has you on edge. Or if the graphics are mind bendingly amazing and there is very little to do. This just looks horrible and has nothing amazing to do unless you think running around for an hour hitting plants with a knife is enthrawling gameplay.\n\nAt £14.99 for early access I expected better but the best I can describe this is DAYZ without any decent weapons, and at its absolute basic. I was under the impression this game was suppossed to have a similar gameplay style to SWG, a game that I played for 5 years over 10 years ago, this isnt even close, and lets face it, its not Star Wars.\n\nFor the record I play on a very good PC, games like TheDivision, StarWars Battlefront look amazing on my rig, this does not. I honestly cannot see how anyone is giving this great reviews and can only asume they are devs. There are many survival games out there and for me this is bottom of the pile, its nothing new, its not ground breaking and it does not look good, in fact if this had come out on PS3 10 years ago, i could understand it being the way it is.\n\nThis is 2016 and we are stuck in this cycle of developers putting out complete rubbish for low prices that players will forget about after a few weeks, I would not be surprised if this gets dropped after a few months, just like its predecessor.\n\nWhole heartedly cannot recommend anyone spend anything over £3.99 for this, as there are better 10 year old games on steam at this price.\n\nGo ahead and see for yourself. Luckily for me steam has a refund policy, I played 41 mins and submitted my refund request. If this game was anything decent or i felt it had any potential to be better, i would not have submitted it.","April 27","false","0.7"," 18 of 56 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","18","56","2","1"

To be more exact, it's nothing more than a gutted & reskinned version of it, sans dinosaurs.  Which, as you may recall, was the very thing that made ASE interesting.  All the grind and none of the satisfaction of someday owning a pet raptor.  But what else?  There is no "what else."  That's it, folks.  Bollywood does a better job of intellectual theft than this game did.  I would suggest Studio Wildcard et al sue these guys if I thought for one moment that the latter actually had any money left to claim.\n\nTo put it metaphorically, if ASE was original, arcade Pac-Man, then this is the Atari2600 version of the same.  Chunky, clunky and bland.  To call it uninspired would be an insult to apathy.  The creatures are dull, the crafting is dull, the exploring is dull.  There's over dozen other survival games out there and I'd recommend any of them over this mess.\n\nBut what else could one have expected this time around from that same used car salesman who already blew all your money on Hot Pockets and ziplock bags of oregano?  That's right, folks, J.C. Smith (the guy who makes Derek Smart look like Sid Meier) and Above and Beyond Technologies (the company that makes Digital Homicide look like Bioware) has managed to fart out another soon-to-be-dead-in-the-water crapsterpiece in another desperate attempt to avoid having to get a job more suited to his talents (read: traveling toilet inspector for McDonalds).\n\nYes, the exact same conman who dumped "The Repopulation" onto Steam years ago, wasted everyone's money and then blamed his failure on the server host company is back again to deliver even more failure.  That original game was launched under the oft toted claim of being "The Spiritual Heir to Star Wars Galaxies" even though it had less in common with it than Pokemon.  But that wasn't about to stop him from making that claim anyway because he knew that by invoking SWG's name he could con a lot of people out of their hard earned cash.  And so it that's what he did.\n\nAnd now we all gasp in awe as Steam's biggest diaper jockey returns with even more grandoise claims about all the stuff that they just might one day dream about adding if, y'know, they had any clue what they were doing!  Watch in complete non-amazement as they proceed to deliver nothing but another round of excuses and failure once again!  Brace yourself for another batch of blame-deflecting articles as they once again deny all responsibility for those failures and try to pin another disaster on someone else once again!\n\nRevel in the deja vu of "Didn't I already play this before, only with more fun?"  Find yourself pining for a parasaur herd, or at least something to read, as alien imps (poorly imagined and even more poorly rendered) randomly appear to test your might in combat so flat you would have to evolve six steps to make it to "boring."  I've played deeper, more well made games on the Commodore64 - and sadly that's not an exaggeration.\n\nMost of all, enjoy the army of J.C.Smith alt accounts that parade around the forums & review sections to tongue polish another turd that can only barely justifiably called a "game" while simultaneously using those same alt accounts to harass anyone that he can't convince Steam to ban for him.  Because that's just the kind of troll he is.\n\nWhen all is said and done, bow your head in lamentation as you realize that we live in a world where people with the maturity of a two year old & the intellectual capacity of a deep sea tube worm are legally allowed to grant themselves the title of "game developer" and con people out of their money on Steam without any reprocussions not just once but twice.\n\nYes, dear reader, beware for any criticism of him, his company, or his games will be met with emergency calls to Steam for the nearest wambulance.  Why?  Because, as you've probably realized by now, truth & honesty are J.C.Smith's mortal enemies.  Those things get in the way of the all important profits of the cash grab & bail mechanism that is his entire business model and therefore they must be silenced.  Anyone who says anything negative will be permabanned and their comments deleted.  If he can't do it himself he will petition Steam to it it for him.  When Steam says they have better things to do than pander to his childish temper tantrums then he will pull out his alt accounts to harass the person in question himself.  At least now you know why there was an NDA attached to this pile of digital vomit for so long.\n\nSo kick back and enjoy the maggot that hath sprung forth from the rotting corpse of "The Repopulation."  Feel free to place bets on how long until this second confidence scheme pretending to be a game fails to keep the pepperoni flowing into his pie hole and goes belly up.  Because once agian, the gap between the promise and the product can be measured in whole other games.\n\nIt is kind of funny, now that I think about it, that the one Star Wars element that J.C.Smith ever did copy successfully was the worst one of all:  Believing that when your "technological masterpiece" turns into a ball of flaming fecal matter that the solution is to just build another one, only bigger and with even more glaring flaws in the design than before.\n\nThank you for reading, dear Steam consumer, for your amusement is what made doing this review worthwhile (it sure as heck wasn't the game, that's for sure).\n\nAnd thank you, J.C.Smith, for being foolish enough to send me a free copy of this dyfunctional heap of mercfifully soon-to-be-dead shovelware.  You should be flattered, in fact, for as you can see I've already invested sixty four minutes more playtime into it than it's worth.  Now I must go and remove the USB drive I transfered it onto, place that drive inside a vial of holy water and toss them both into the Marianas Trench lest some poor soul accidentally unleash this ghastly abomination upon the human race at some point in the unforseen future.","April 26","false","0.0"," 23 of 70 people (33%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","33","23","70","12","3"

Really, down to assets like sounds and animations. For 25$, another Early Access.\nSo, as a backer, what you've gotten so far was an early Alpha game, and another Early Alpha of a ripoff of a game.\nWhich they're trying to sell.\n\nYou tell me if that sounds like a healthy business to you. Or promising.\nFore me, it doesn't. For me, this is just another crowdfund train wreck.","April 26","false","0.6"," 23 of 74 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","23","74","3","16"
