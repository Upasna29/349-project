It doesn't have an in-built music player, I played it by putting on some music using Itunes in the background, then starting up the game. I also tried this successfully with Spotify, so it will probably work with your preferred streaming service too. If you start the game up without some kind of "audio output", the game will give you a message which instructs you to "play some music".\n\nSound Shift has two modes; Arcade and visualiser. Arcade is a simple game where you shoot at moving white blocks with your ship at the bottom of the screen. Firing is automatic and hitting blocks generates credits of various values. Your ship also powers up over time and when full, it fires a larger bullet, emptying out your reserves. All the time, your music generates visuals on screen.\n\nThe second mode is a traditional music visualiser, generating patterns on screen to the beat of the music you play. You can change how it looks using the Function keys on your keyboard.\n\nThe credits you earn in the shooting game can be spent in the mods section to unlock changes to how the visualiser works.\n\nWhen you start up the game, it gives the impression that it can only be played using a gamepad but it does have keyboard support (WASD or Cursor keys, plus F1-F6).\n\nSound Shift is something to do whilst listening to your music but game-wise, Audiosurf or Beat Hazard are currently much more diverse and engrossing examples of this kind of game. I enjoyed listening to some good music while playing around with this. Has potential and is currently cheap.","August 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/394140/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","Sound Shift is quite a difficult game to share my thoughts on. I don't dislike it by any means, but if you're looking for a new and interesting game to play, I honestly wouldn't recommend it. This is the only game Matthew Brown has ever put out that I had to think about recommending.\n\nThe game is like a mixture of two other popular rhythm games, Audiosurf and Beat Hazard. Alone they are both great games to play as they take advantage and create unique experiences based entirely on the strucutre of the music you chose. Sound Shift uses this concept itself and feels like a mixture of both of the forementioned games, but is less interesting in terms of it's execution.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes: Arcade, which is a simple shooter, and Dodge, similar to the dodge mode in Audiosurf. Both modes can be fun in short bursts, but the feeling is more or less the same regardless of the music you chose to play along to, I guess my biggest gripe would be the lack of variation when it comes to the actual gameplay, it gets repetetive very quickly so there isn't much to go back to.\n\nOne positive factor though is that the visualisations and modifiers are excellent, it's really the most unique and interesting thing about Sound Shift and would be great to have set-up for house parties and such. I'd see this as more of an interactive visualizer than I would an actual game.\n\nFor it's price, I'd say it's interesting enough to pick up and give it a try, but I just don't think there is enough gameplay here to recommend it to rhythm gamers.","September 30, 2015","false","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Targets pop up, your little square automatically shoots them as you move around. The thing that got me to buy this, though, was the fact that you could use your own music. Sure, a good soundtrack is nice, but there won't be many occasions where you can jam to Dragonforce and shoot things at the same time. The backgrounds all look beautiful and match up with the music perfectly, dimming when the music gets quieter and slowing down. Essentially, this game is a pretty rhythm-based light show with a little arcade diversion thrown in. Definitely worth $2.99.","August 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

It has nice video backgrounds that synchronize to whatever audio is coming out of your speakers, and you can add some effects and filters like bloom, motion blur and color filters to them.\n\nThe playable part of this title only serves as a mean to unlock new videos, effects and filters for your visualizer. Once you finish unlocking them all, there is no reason to go back and play.\n\nIf you want a pretty VJ visualizer for your party, this might be it! Specially at this low price.\n\nNote to the author: please use your knowledge to create a "VJ Visualizer Creator" that allows the users to import their own short video loops. You could also sell some "video banks" and effects as DLC. Think about it! ;)","January 23","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But to call it a game is a stretch.  Heres my breakdown.\n\nThe Good:\nLightweight. Despite being pretty to look at, it's not that intencive.  This is Unity at it's most streamlined, I think.\n\nUses external audio, so you can literally use anything.  Go for it.  Literally any website, format of audio/video, or anything like that is usable.\n\nThe Bad:\nMovement controls. What made Audiosurf so playable was the quick, mouse-based controls.  It made moving left to right easy, sharp, and accurate.  This is simply clunky in comparison.  Even with a gamepad, the analogs just don't feel "good".\n\nUses external audio.  While it can use anything, it's also not user friendly.  Being lightweight isn't an excuse to force the player to use another program to play music/media.\n\nThe Ugly:\nFiring controls.  Firing is music-based.  And the special secondary weapon is time-based.  Everything is automatic.  Which means theres no chance to actuallly use skill, because the only thing you can do is go left or right.  Sniping blocks or even destroying all of one block becomes a chore as you pray that this riff causes enough shots, and hoping that you don't "run out" when you have a strong on 10c blocks.\n\nZero consiquence for missing blocks.  This makes some sense as firing is automatic, random and skill-less, but theres literally no insentive to play this.  Just fire up a random playlist and let it play itself on repeat while you're at work and sleeping.  I bet you'd have all the upgrades in a few days or so.  Idle games can be fun, but this could be so much more...\n\nUses external audio.  Yes.  It's greatest flexibility is it's greatest weakness.  Being able to read off the audio output is a nice feature, but it shouldn't be the ONLY way to play.  It ruins immersion, and really makes it feel more like what it is; Not a game, but a semi-interactive visualizer.\n\nI'd recomend it simply because it is pretty, and makes music fun to watch... But as a game, it's kind of a flop.\n\nVisuals: 11/10\nGameplay: 1/10","September 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
