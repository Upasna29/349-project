"http://steamcommunity.com/id/levelleruk/recommended/369580/","levelleruk","leveller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/levelleruk/","1410 products in account","To be very clear - you might not like the game.\n\nHowever, I spent ¬£0.49 on it, and I've had my monies worth after 20 minutes. I didn't expect it to be good, and it is not great, but it is good (for me). It has been witty, funny, clever, and made me really smile at moments.\n\nIt has a jerky type of movement that reminds me of the old games before smooth animation was invented. However, it feels responsive, and the character moves where I tell it. So the jerky movement is a great recreation, spot-on in fact. The artwork is a mix of acceptable bad mixed with some pretty good art for a top-down game. The sound effects ... or rather the voices and vocal recordings are exceptional. There is a lot of speech involved which adds a lot to the simple experience.\n\nWhat attracted me to the game was the price of course. However, I thought the ranting discussion threads created by people with nothing better to do than find an object to attack (love the internet!!), were too drama-like to ignore.\n\nI bought the game to see what the fuss was about (bearing in mind most of the ranters might not have actually played the game). And they were wrong. It is not a bad game. It is not a great game. A great game would be the original GTA, Or other top-downs like Prison Architect. However, is it worth supporting an indie with ¬£0.49 of my money? Yeah, I am happy. If the ranters keep publicising the game I reckon the devs will be very happy too!!\n\n---\n\nTL;DR --- To sum up, the game costs ¬£0.49 and ¬£0.49 buys me 25% of a tub of cherries from Waitrose. I can eat 25% of the tub in 5 mins. This game has been played 20 minutes and after this review I am going back to it. After a full tub of cherries at ¬£2 and 20 minutes later - I get rampant farts and stomach ache. Take my advice - buy the game (if you like different styles of games) and do not eat a full tub of cherries in 20 minutes!!","July 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 57 of 77 people (74%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","74","57","77","31","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/369580/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewNotGTAV is indeed, not GTA V. This short game was made in the course of a week by British developer team NotGames and is basically a satirical comedy game that pokes hints at GTA, but that adds it's own elements of comic relief. Gameplay wise, this is nothing more than a game of snake.\n\nThe Pros: It's fun(ny) - While the game of snake can only get so good, due to the nature of this game, it is quite fun to play. This mainly consists of the mouth-made soundtrack of the game and the accent-driven voice-overs you can hear when nearing your targets. Every time you play it, you listen more closely and discover a new joke.\nCharity - Besides the fact that this game comes at a very low price, all the profits go to charity, so you know that your money was well spent for this funny little time waster.\nDifficulty Setting - The game offers you several challenges with the different difficulty levels, which may actually prove frustrating and should be attempted only by the bravest of casual gamers. These modify things such as movement speed, time limits, and the use of checkpoints.\nThe.. uh.. Graphics? - Normally bad graphics and production value of a game should be treated as a con, but in this case it is a feature. The hand-made textures, choppy or nonexistent animations and mouth made sound effects are what makes this game even more enjoyable and truly brings the parody effect to life.\nSteam Features - Games with good steam integration always get bonus points from me. I'm pleased to see Trading Cards from a game such as this, as well as a decently long list of fun and relatively easy achievements. Other features like Steam Cloud are not applicable here, as the game is short and does not have progression that needs to be saved.\nThe Cons: Short - Understandable for a game made for amusement and in a weeks time, so don't expect any length from this. The game can be beaten in about 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of it, and it has three stages with 6 levels each, the last one having two variations.\nNo Level Selection - The game does not have a level selection menu, so if you enjoyed, say, the Lidl level, you will have to replay the camping one first. This would have been an easy to add feature that I'm disappointed is missing.\nHorrible Menus - The game does have mouse controls, but no cursor, and the menus are poorly drawn and are controlled via hotkeys. I presume they made it on purpose, but a few extra options and the ability to use a mouse would have been nice.\nConclusionThis game is for people who want to support charity and have a chuckle for a few minutes, as its replay value does not equate for more than two or three hours tops. Buy it if you like Snake and are bored out of your mind.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

You look at this game and especially at the graphics and then you look at the reviews and say "WTF?! How can this game have 89% positive reviews? I mean, ok the developer might have paid SOME people to create a positive review, but not over 2.5k people..."\n\nI can tell you why. Because it deserves a positive review. It really is a good game, don't let the graphics or even the title fool you.\n\nIt slightly is a parody of GTA V which you can see (and hear) in some scenes, especially in the beginning an in some phases of the game (for example concerning the GTA-stars)\nBut at the end of the day it is like the solid old Snake-game for your mobile phone, but only funnier and way faster.\nIt is totally addicting and it becomes extremely hard by proceeding. The hard mode really deserves the name here.\n\nAnd for the achievement hunters: Most of the achievments u get by proceeding with the "Story" (which doesn't actually exists, but I guess the crazyness is just another part of the GTA-parody). But some are not that easy to get; for me, I won't go for a perfect game this time.\n\nConclusion: It's a good solid game, which doesn't need any super-awesome graphics or great story. It is all about cleverness, reaction skills and maybe a little piece of luck.\nMight not be worth 3‚Ç¨ though, so I would grab it on sale. I got 2,4h on my steam clock and I am almost through the hard mode (only last phase of last stage left).","February 20","true","2.4"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","23","27","5","0"

Ever.\n\nVery rarely am I compelled enough these days to buy a game as soon as I see it (even though it was only 50p so it doesn‚Äôt really count) but even rarer do I actually buy a game then boot it up as soon as I can. I‚Äôm that person that buys games 3 years late when they are deduced to 75% because everyone already bloody has it, takes another 3 years to actually play it and then wonders why no one else is hyping with me when I finally get around to seeing why it was a popular game in the first place. In all honesty, it‚Äôs a stupid routine I have. My point being for once I actually outright bought and played a game out of curiosity.\n\nI am British, so the humour of this was what appealed to me most. That and the fact I have been craving a snake-like game recently. It looked pretty funny and I didn‚Äôt want to be starting any games that would take me too long to finish, so this was perfect for the mood I was in.\nI think when it comes to the humour of this game, only British people are going to find it funny. There is a very drastic difference between English and American humour in my opinion. A lot of the references in this game are kind of ‚Äúinside jokes‚Äù amongst British culture. AKA, if you are not from the UK, you might not find this funny at all.\n\nThis game is extremely poor quality and I love it. It looks like it was drawn by a child, the voices and sound effects are terribly stereotypical and the game is just generally ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. In the best way!\nIt‚Äôs a short game, I completed it fairly quickly. According to Steam I spent 51 minutes on this game. I completed the game and got 56% of the achievements. So this isn‚Äôt something you are going to be sinking a lot of time into.\n\nI do expect I will be going back to this to try and collect the achievements (of which I will likely update this review if I do).\n\nI personally think it was a fun little quirky game that really shows what sarcastic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• us British people are. It makes me proud to me British (I think).\n\n\nTL;DR : NotGTAV is a quirky, sarky little game that I think British people will enjoy. It‚Äôs extremely poorly done in the best of ways. It‚Äôs a light little snake-like game that I thought was a bit of fun. I like the general concept of it. It‚Äôs short but sweet, buy it if you are looking to kill an hour.\n","July 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","35","50","5","7"

If Gta V, Crysis 3, and Metro last light had a baby.. it would be absolutely nothing like this game. Take notes crytek, this game proves a game can be not only stunning, but have intuitive gameplay to match.\n\nSound\nHere's where the game really shines, this game is truley "NotGTAV" in this regard. From the sound your shopping cart makes as it bursts into flames, to the agonizing cries of hippies as you run them over, this game pushes the boundries of realism in every regard. The game even features an ingame radio, with all the latest chart topping hits. This game has atmosphere, and you will feel like you are there, best played with headphones.\n\nGraphics\nHere's where the game really shines, this game is truley "NotGTAV" in this regard. In todays world of shady motion blur techniques being used to cover up poor textures, along with bloom and depth of field being used, its obvious devs just do this to make their poor work less noticeable. Well fear no more, this is not in "NotGtaV", you will see nothing but raw handrawn art on everything in the game, no smoke and mirrors here. Heres to a first person mod rolling out soon and dare I say oculus rift support?\n\nControls\nHere's where the game really shines, this game is truley "NotGTAV" in this regard. I have to say when I heard the devs were ditching console support because of the hardware limitations I was a little sad, not because I wanted to play on one, but because I felt this was a game that needed to be experienced by as many people as possible. Looking back now I feel really dumb, because this game is 100% optimised for pc now. The game feels so good with a keyboard and mouse I felt like I was driving. This game is tighter than valve's grip on the pc market, tighter than russia's grip on the ukraine, tighter than..tight.\n\nSex Appeal\nTell me you aren't aroused.\n\nGameplay\nHere's where the game really shines, this game is truley "NotGTAV" in this regard. This game has a vast variety of missions to keep the game fresh. Along with the 4 lengthy included heists, the games missions will have you doing all kinds of crazy things, while still holding realism. Each objective has multiple means of completing them, want to go in guns a blazing? Check. Want to take a more non chalant approach and infiltrate the area without making a sound? Check. This game has it all, along with multiple difficulties and ng all the way too ng+++++++++++ Heres to seeing some future mods and dlc.\n\n\nIn summary NotGtaV is not Gta V and I cannot not say that its not not Gta V.\n\n\nknot","July 3, 2015","true","7.3"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","66","33","50","32","0"

My opinion is based on the bugginess and issues I had with the game. The achievements would repeat and keep repeating. Achievements that I got already would pop up and cover parts of the screen I needed to see.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/369580/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","NotGTAV is pretty much Snake if made by a team with no talent but decent humor. If you are not familiar with Snake well the point of it is to collect pieces to grow larger and avoid crashing into your own body. In this game your body is made of hobos, animals and other odd things. In levels you either walk around, push a shopping cart around or drive a car but the controls are exactly the same so it doesn't really matter. Thrown about the levels are obstacles to avoid and objects to collect or run over. And that's pretty much all you will be doing throughout the game though with different environments and jokes. The humor is the best part of this game though it is very hit or miss.\n\nControls are barely passable but the animations and the sense of speed make telling when to turn difficult. You may get used to the rhythm but  overtime you start moving faster causing you to lose your flow and hope that you have gotten used enough to the awful moving animation to survive. Levels also become harder to navigate as the game goes on but it does it in a very cheap fashion. All the while the most terrible music and sound effects I ever had the displeasure of hearing played. Most of the sound effects are made via mouth and the voice acting is just as bad. It was probably meant to be humorous but it is extremely irritating in my opinion.\n\nIn a few sections you can choose whether to go sneaky or brutal but going sneaky is a massive pain due to how the level is designed to be so small and touching a person kills you. Going brutal is more tolerable but it adds a bunch of people to run over and you must get every single one of them. That sounds a lot more fun on paper than it actually is due to the level design meant to annoy you and subpar controls. Even the options menu is annoying to read with how the font is written. Naming this game ‚ÄúNotGTAV‚Äù while not really having anything in common with GTA or even reference it all that much is a scumbag way to promote your terrible game. It wouldn't be a big deal if they made a fun game but this is quite possibly the worst game I have played on Steam and feels like a cash grab.\n\nYes, I am aware they stated 100% of the profits will be given to charity and if that's the case simply cut out the middle man and donate if you are inclined. This is an awful game and promoting this type of cash grab with a purchase is not something I would recommend to anybody. This is a sentence from their Steam page ‚ÄúBy buying this game you can help us pay something back.‚Äù. And to that I say, well either start a fundraiser of some type or make a decent game instead of trying to pity people into buying rubbish. I know this may seem harsh to a lot of people but this is a really bad game that I probably wouldn't even recommend if it was free.\n\nThe trailers are probably the most entertaining part of this product and even then most of the footage is from Grand Theft Auto V. When low brow humor and terrible animations are your only talents you would be better off making a Youtube channel instead of utterly failing at making a Snake clone. Moving on from that, this is really a title with a very certain type of audience. That would be the people that are curious about this title and are willing to risk it for the small price or those that want to prove how edgy they are. If you are looking for a fun game or a decent clone of Snake you won't find anything to enjoy here. If you are looking for dark humor then you might find it here but would still have to play through the game to reach the jokes. Overall I can't recommend this to anybody.","July 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 158 of 289 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","158","289","10","16"

At first I found it annoying that somebody was trying to make money by dropping the name of a AAA title into their game.  Though I was much less annoyed when I discovered that they are giving the majority of the money that they make to a charity.  So this will be a short and sweet review.  It's snake, you know that old arcade game?  These days people can play it on their calculator, but this version has a bit more character, and if you have actually played GTA V you will probably enjoy it a bit more.  There are 3 different areas, each one includes a starting area and then a heist afterwards, for a total of 6 levels.  I'd say the funniest thing about this game is that all of the graphics are hand drawn with either crayon or colored pencil and all of the sound affects are done by voice, which is entertaining.

It's almost as if it were drawn in MS Paint, but it wasnt! As an artist myself, I have been trying to perfect this brilliant eyepopping art style for the past 4 years and haven't come close!\n\nThe music and sound effects are unreal. If you love British voices then you'll love this game! All the vehicles, NPCs, and animals are fully voiced! The sound effects for killing people, picking up items, everything is just so well done. My favorite would have to be the different radio stations. I wish there was a download for them so I could listen to them while driving around town. As a musician myself, I haven't heard music performed/recorded better then in this game!\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly challenging. I often found myself struggling with levels and frustrated more then Dark Souls, but would feel better achieved from overcoming the challenge then from any game. This game had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing! I would put the gameplay here well over GTA V's gameplay style. They are differnt of course because this is not GTA V. As a gameplay designer myself, I have been struggling to work hard on how to create the best user experience in a game and I think that NotGTAV has just given me the breakthrough idea of a lifetime!\n\nI cannot wait for NotGTAVI to release. Perhaps we could get a prequel, NotGTAIV ? I would love that! As a NotGTA myself, I have been working hard to release a new version, but I know that these dev's can do it.\n\n11/10 - Would have payed 60$ for this instead of GTAV.","July 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Repetitive dialogue. They're funny the first time, hearing it afterwards is just irritating. The game is basically glorified snake with an attempt to parody GTA V, which, seeing as the game takes place in the UK, doesn't make very much sense. It probably makes more sense if you view the name NotGTAV as a marketing tactic that piggybacks on another popular game. The difficulty levels are just the game sped up, there's nothing else unique about them to warrant a replay other than the sake of completion. On the plus side, the soundtrack is decent and complements the hand-drawn style well enough. It's great that all the proceeds from sales are going to charity, but that's one of only a few redeeming qualities this game has. It's almost like an excuse for making a half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. That should not be the sole reason for you to buy it, though. You can always donate to charity on your own volition.\n\nIs it worth the 74 cents I spent during the sale? Well, I enjoyed it more than a $1 can of soda, so yes. If you want a few laughs, buy it when it's less than a dollar, then sell the trading cards for most of your money back.

Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.\nFinishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there‚Äôs no need.\nGetting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.\nFlipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.","March 5","true","2.4"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","53","24","45","24","0"

However, nearly instantly upon starting the game you realize it has nothing to offer. Humour is so poorly executed to the point where I wonder if other raters were payed off to kick this game up to "Very positive". Only positive thing about it is that it claims that all of the profits are going to charity, which honestly I feel it should be no other way at all.\nHowever, just choose a charity and donate money directly.\nSkip this title.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGraphics: 2 / 10\nPoor, choppy graphics. Art at the level of elementary grader.\n\nSounds: 1 / 10\nOften confusing and poorly optimised sound containing not really original or funny jokes. often just random noises and gibberish.\n\nControls: 0 / 10\nGame does not utilize mouse controls at all, suggesting really poor, begginer level programming. Controls themself consist of pressing movement keys to move the snake in a tile-per-tile pattern.\n\nGameplay: 0 / 10\nGame itself is only about 20 minutes long and at the same time very repeatative. Nothing than the few icons changes (you are either a car, or a cart).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. for developers.\n+ From the game and appearance of the same on steam I understand that the developers realize most of these things already. A project game that used the GTAV hype to get on steam but in reality has not much to offer takes all the profits to charity. That is a nice gesture that I do support.\nAll developers (including myself), have started low, with similar projects that try to make the learning curve more fun for themself and I support this. You gathered experience in programming, art style, working with steam and with people. However, when it comes to my rating of the game, please also have in mind that these are intended as a quality check for a market. Only objective thoughts on the game.\nBest wishes for the future!","August 9, 2015","false","3.2"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","18","34","4","6"

Not even really that good snake. Just snake. But funnier.\n\nShould you buy it?\nYeah. While it's still 74 cents, yeah. For 3 bucks? Meh. Probably not. But for 74 cents?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cavcavthesatnav/recommended/369580/","cavcavthesatnav","A Right Royal Hunt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cavcavthesatnav/","112 products in account","When I started up the game, I was greeted with a message. This message was displayed on-screen in white letters scrolling quickly down a black background and being read at a fast pace ‚Äì how could this not be funny? What it explains is what the game is, why they made it and, most of all, politics. Yes, politics. Because this game was made for charity, and all proceeds of this game go to charity. There‚Äôs even a joke in this start-up speech about how, if you pirate the game, you‚Äôre so morally low that you should have Somali pirates come into your house and cut your gaming fingers off to teach you the real definition of the word ‚Äòpiracy‚Äô. The narrator then goes on to attack David Cameron for letting bankers off the hook whilst not caring about charities like the one this game is funding. This made me fall in love with the game before I even got any gameplay.\nAfter the game actually started, I was treated to several achievements for just browsing the options menu and altering some values. As soon as that was over, I went into the main game and played as the first playable character, Dafydd. His story is set in Wales. There are two other playable characters in the game too, but these only come into play later on. These are Darren, who is supposed to be a ‚Äòchav‚Äô from Swindon and, of course, David Cameron. All of these characters are supposed to be funny, and to me they are hilarious. From Kenneth‚Äôs accent (Kenneth is the manager of Lidl Swindon and the ‚Äòenemy‚Äô (if you will) of Darren) to the way in which the David Cameron character says lines which we all know the real David Cameron does off of the camera, this game‚Äôs attempt at poor writing and bad jokes is what, in a way, makes the writing and jokes all the more fun!\nNow, of course, one of the big things in Grand Theft Auto V is Heists. And I know that you‚Äôre asking ‚ÄúAre there heists in NotGTAV?‚Äù The answer: yes. But they‚Äôre not quite what you‚Äôd imagine. To be honest, I‚Äôve only played the first two at this point and I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a David Cameron heist (but I assume that there is and that it is entertaining), but what I got is this ‚Äì you do something stereotypical of the character that you are playing as and, like in GTAV, there are two paths that you can take: the loud or the quiet. And, in short, they do what the GTAV ones do ‚Äì the loud one makes you massacre everybody, the quiet one makes you become a Sam Fisher wannabe. Both are equally entertaining, and both are worth replaying the heist to see pan out.\nAt the end of the day, NotGTAV is a parodic game, made to spoof the real Grand Theft Auto V poorly and also made to entertain you. Now, does it do that? Most certainly! In fact, since the game does this so well, I love it all the more! I may have only played a little over an hour of it as of me writing this, but I still enjoyed it massively ‚Äì and would recommend it to anybody who has seen it anywhere before. Sure the graphics are shoddy and the sounds were all made by people making noises into microphones, but that‚Äôs what I love about it. This game does exactly what it is meant to do, and is deliberately poor in audio and video whereas most AAA games today do that by accident.","August 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

This is essentially a clone of the old flip-phone game Snake, with a GTA-esque twist. The gameplay is simple, using just a couple of buttons to turn left or right and try not to run into the stuff you're not supposed to run into, and run into the stuff you're supposed to run into.\n\nIt's the kind of game that you can play for three hours and have fun the whole time, or play for five minutes and be satisfied. The art style isn't that great, basically it looks like someone drew it on a piece of notebook paper, which fits with the "Not GTAV" theme as if someone was doodling this game in class at school.\n\nIt's hard to write an in-depth review of a game that has no depth. If it looks fun, you'll probably enjoy it, but if you don't like Snake or GTAV, don't get it. It's as simple as that. I had fun with it, and if you can't afford GTAV then this is the next best thing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

I mean what's not to like? It has the best graphics of any game to date, NotGTAV runs at a constant 69fps and has top notch animation that will make your eyes water from a mile away. Good graphics mean nothing without good sound of course and NotGTAV has that to. All the sounds were recorded with the latest technology and can cause extreme ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s while playing so keep a towel nearby. The gameplay is top notch featuring some heavy real life themes and addictive missions that will keep you occupied for hours.\n\nI think i made my point: NotGTAV is the best game of 2015 and will be on the top of almost every top 1337 games of all time.

As a pastiche of many types of games is it succcessful as a game in its own right or is your money better spent elsewhere?\n\nThe Good\nThe graphics in this game are superb. Unlike GTAV, a game which NotGTAV itself claims is "immeasurably superior" (notably, not a qualified statement), I could run this game on max settings with no fps lags. This in itself is a remarkable achievement considering I am running the game on a low end laptop, but the graphics themselves are independently fantastic. The accuracy of the Lidl Swindon is far greater than GTAV's relative accuracy of Los Santos (which is based on Los Angeles of course): having been to Swindon and many Lidl's I can say that the game conveys their shitness very accurately, whereas having been to LA, GTAV does not portray the shitness of Los Angeles very well at all.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced and thrilling, and the pacing of the story is excellent. At no point is one bored of the current task, nor do you ever feel that the story has lulled in its development. Playing 3 characters and their own stories in parralel is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction and is done in a far superior manner compared to GTAV. Rockstar could learn a lot about storytelling from Notgames, considering the trite that they came up with for GTAV's "story" mode.\n\nThe radio feature is also far superior to that of GTAV. Changing the stations is quick and easy, and the selection of music is much, much better.\n\nThe Bad\nUnfortunately, not every game is perfect, but this one comes pretty darn close. The only negative I can think of is the voice of David Cameron - while the game portrays the shitness of other aspects tackled by the game, the voice actor here does not do a very good job of portraying the shitness of David Cameron.\n\nNonetheless this is a solid entry in what I hope is a long series, and I wholeheartedly recommend this game, while eagerly awaiting the release of NotGTAV 2!\n\n9.6/10","July 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","50","18","36","11","0"

As a pastiche of many types of games is it succcessful as a game in its own right or is your money better spent elsewhere?\n\nThe Good\nThe graphics in this game are superb. Unlike GTAV, a game which NotGTAV itself claims is "immeasurably superior" (notably, not a qualified statement), I could run this game on max settings with no fps lags. This in itself is a remarkable achievement considering I am running the game on a low end laptop, but the graphics themselves are independently fantastic. The accuracy of the Lidl Swindon is far greater than GTAV's relative accuracy of Los Santos (which is based on Los Angeles of course): having been to Swindon and many Lidl's I can say that the game conveys their shitness very accurately, whereas having been to LA, GTAV does not portray the shitness of Los Angeles very well at all.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced and thrilling, and the pacing of the story is excellent. At no point is one bored of the current task, nor do you ever feel that the story has lulled in its development. Playing 3 characters and their own stories in parralel is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction and is done in a far superior manner compared to GTAV. Rockstar could learn a lot about storytelling from Notgames, considering the trite that they came up with for GTAV's "story" mode.\n\nThe radio feature is also far superior to that of GTAV. Changing the stations is quick and easy, and the selection of music is much, much better.\n\nThe Bad\nUnfortunately, not every game is perfect, but this one comes pretty darn close. The only negative I can think of is the voice of David Cameron - while the game portrays the shitness of other aspects tackled by the game, the voice actor here does not do a very good job of portraying the shitness of David Cameron.\n\nNonetheless this is a solid entry in what I hope is a long series, and I wholeheartedly recommend this game, while eagerly awaiting the release of NotGTAV 2!\n\n9.6/10","July 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","50","18","36","11","0"

Also, was I the only one who understood the Llanbobl thing on the tour of the M4 corridor? Thank you Rhod Gilbert :3\n\nHonestly I have bought this game as a total joke and the game has taken a few hours of my life, which I am never getting back but I laughed through most of them hours at the jokes.\n\n11/10 I have been recommeding this to my friends, will carry on doing so too.

It really captures the essence of GTA V, but it isn't GTA V. If you are looking for a great, cheap alternative to GTA V without multiplayer, and real-time action combat. Then Not GTAV is for you.\nThe story of Not GTAV is amazing. You are constantly in the action, running ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• over with a tractor, cart, or car. I really feel like I am a part of the story and I become deeply emmerssed in the gameplay. Whenever I am looking to unwind and have some fun, I always find myself gravitating towards this amazing title.\nThe gameplay is smooth and highly optimized for PC. The controls work perfectly with no delay at all. The voice acting and music is what really takes the cake though, the time that went in to composing and performing the music in this masterpiece is astonishing.\nOverall I rate this game an 8/10.\n9/10 for gameplay\n7/10 for story","July 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(And kill david cameron over and over "Were all in it together just some of us in the shallow end")\n\nIndie developer>Money suckers\n\nIf an older game has issues the indie developer goes back to fix them out of genuine care unlike rockstar that completely abandoned RDR on Xbox when the servers crashed and flooded with hackers despite having all their gamer tags and not having to sift through a community that only had roughly 500 people.\n\nNotGTAV doesnt make you sign up to some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t social club that makes it seem like Rockstars going to slowly become another EA\n\nNotGTAV doesnt take fifteen bloody hours to get you into the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game it takes all of 2 seconds\n\nNotGTAV makes you feel bad and cry if you quit like a lil ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• which encourages immature ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s to nut up or shut up this game is a catalyst for puberty its scientifically proven, because I said it\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It really captures the essence of GTA V, but it isn't GTA V. If you are looking for a great, cheap alternative to GTA V without multiplayer, and real-time action combat. Then Not GTAV is for you.\nThe story of Not GTAV is amazing. You are constantly in the action, running ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• over with a tractor, cart, or car. I really feel like I am a part of the story and I become deeply emmerssed in the gameplay. Whenever I am looking to unwind and have some fun, I always find myself gravitating towards this amazing title.\nThe gameplay is smooth and highly optimized for PC. The controls work perfectly with no delay at all. The voice acting and music is what really takes the cake though, the time that went in to composing and performing the music in this masterpiece is astonishing.\nOverall I rate this game an 8/10.\n9/10 for gameplay\n7/10 for story","July 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I only wish I hadn't of bought this when it was on sale but maybe my gameplays can persuade others to help support NotGames and PeerProductions.\n\nThe Positives\nHand drawn graphics\nThe graphics are handdrawn which adds to the creativity of the game in my opinion.\n\nAcapella Sound Effects\nAlong with hand drawn graphics are the home recorded sound effects.\n\nHilarious dialog\nThe dialog of this game is quite simply hilarious. This again adds to the creativity aspect\n\nNegatives\nControl Response\nSometimes it feels like the controls don't respond in time and I end up crashing. I was starting to wonder if the David Cameron level was mean to never end due to the paranoid delusion that the game was engineered to allow run cameron's car into ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• thus killing him.","July 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a great attention to detail, and you can even see street names on the map. My favourite street was Old Kent Kunt Road.\n\nGameplay and story are fantastic. The plot is well thought through and complex and you can play as a wide variey of characters. My favourite character was the liberal-democrat-hating David Cameron.\n\nThe audio part of the game is astounding. All sounds are mouth hand made by the developers. I especially enjoyed the well written soundtrack.\n\nOverall rating:\nBig Ben out of one","July 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I instantly noticed how superior NotGTAV was to GTAV. The well-drawn graphics are a true work of art, as compared to Rockstar's computer generated nonsense. From the very second I pressed start, I was informed about the very simply controls and settings. The game also offered challenging but fun objectives that I really enjoyed.\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes. For $0.74 you cannot go wrong, you will get far more enjoyment out of NotGTAV then you will ever get out of $60 GTAV.","July 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay-wise it is essentially Snake. But if you are British or have enough knowledge about Britain to appreciate the satire, I'd say it's worth picking up for the sale price of 50p especially since all profits go to charity. If you do pick it up for the full price of ¬£4, you will need to think of it as a donation to charity because it is not worth that much.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I got a few laughs, I ran David Cameron into a wall at least fifty times and gave 50p to charity.

I especially enjoyed the radio.\n\nThe negative:\n- The format of the game is like that snake game where you have to eat things to get bigger. (It wouldn't have been a problem if the maps didn't cause the difficulty to spike to painful levels. )\n- Sometimes the controls don't respond well.\n\nOverall: This was pretty fun at first, and even if it did get painful during some levels, it was mostly enjoyable. If the NotCOD is serious, I really think that it should have a more open area, and the eating snake game aspect is removed.","July 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I only wish I hadn't of bought this when it was on sale but maybe my gameplays can persuade others to help support NotGames and PeerProductions.\n\nThe Positives\nHand drawn graphics\nThe graphics are handdrawn which adds to the creativity of the game in my opinion.\n\nAcapella Sound Effects\nAlong with hand drawn graphics are the home recorded sound effects.\n\nHilarious dialog\nThe dialog of this game is quite simply hilarious. This again adds to the creativity aspect\n\nNegatives\nControl Response\nSometimes it feels like the controls don't respond in time and I end up crashing.

There is a great attention to detail, and you can even see street names on the map. My favourite street was Old Kent Kunt Road.\n\nGameplay and story are fantastic. The plot is well thought through and complex and you can play as a wide variey of characters. My favourite character was the liberal-democrat-hating David Cameron.\n\nThe audio part of the game is astounding. All sounds are mouth hand made by the developers.

My grip isn't with the gameplay, it's a fun little spoof of GTA. My problem is the dialouge! Here, let me quote the disclaimer:\n"...Unless you're under 18, in which case you'll have to make do with this game until you've grown some pubes and can get a credit card"\nI know this is a spoof game, but with cringy dialouge like this, it's hard to play. Now, the money earned off this game goes to charity, which I'm all for! Right now NOT GTAV is 74 cence, so look into the charity and see if you feel like donating.
