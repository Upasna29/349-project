London, 1880 and the streets are not safe as a ripper is roaming and killing young women and no one feels safe, but a private detective is on the case to figure out who is the person behind the murders.\n\nAs stated previously the game is a point and click adventure game where you solve puzzles to advance the story. You pick up stuff and solve puzzles with the stuff you find around the streets of Victorian London. If you played a point and click adventure game you pretty much know what you are getting into.\n\nThe game at first captivated me with the very interesting story and I was surprised when I started playing that the start of the game is a bit slow, but don't be afraid as it very quickly picks up the pace and you thrown in a very interesting story,\n\nThe puzzles are very smart as well, there's nothing too cryptic, but there's still a lot to think over, because some of the puzzles are very well thought out. There was one puzzle which kind of seemed stupid, but apart from that the puzzle design is great.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding, the style and the colors are fantastic, it's fun just to look around the world you're in and explore a bit. The music which is also outstanding helps to build the perfect mood for every scene in the game, from silly to disturbing it has it all.\n\nThere were a few things I think could use work though and I will list them out, but these are very minor suggestions.\n\nThe game could really use a cancel action button cause it's quite annoying when you click on something you didn't mean to and have to walk over there, see the dialogue and then you can click on the thing you wanted to click in the first place.\n\nIn same places the inventory located at the bottom of the screen get's in the way of interacting with items, so you have to carefully try not to put your mouse cursor over the inventory.\n\nThe game has a few bugs, but I listed those out to the developer and he said he fixed them, so if you do find anything I think you don't have to worry cause those will be fixed quick.\n\nThe game lasted me 4 hours and I think that was just the right amount of time for it and I think it's worth getting this game at full price.\n\nThis game is very good. It has a great story, fun puzzles and it's just overall a really decent adventure game, so if you want a great detective story look no further The Slaughter Act One has you covered.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10 - Great\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\nPlease also check out my Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 28","true","5.9"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","44","54","3","1"

I worry about whether the studio will actually be able to deliver the rest of the episodes. Also, the episodic adventures that I have tried were too short for me to really engage with the story. Act One of this game is about 1-2 hours long, but everything is really well done and I'm really intrigued with the story. The writing in this game is excellent and probably the best part. The protagonist is a great character, a very complicated person. Not your typical adventure game hero. The music in this game is really good too, even though I didn't like one track.\n\nThe drawback of the game is that it's very easy. Now, I don't like it when puzzles are frustatingly hard, but I just flew through this game. Not only are solutions pretty clear in general, NPCs also drop some big hints (& this is a little hypocritical, but I *do* like how Sydney will drop a hint about an item's usage if you examine it in your inventory. I kinda wish other adventure games would do that too). The puzzles do get a bit more complex towards the end, but I kinda get the feeling that's just coincidence. I think the UI could be improved. OH! And the mini-game, ugh. It just slows everything down, takes forever, and is too hard. Luckily it's the only mini-game.\n\nI really hope this story continues to the end! In fact, I think releasing a full adventure game like Wadjet Eye does would have been the best way to go. The Slaughter is like playing a Lucasarts adventure because it is funny, but it's also really dark at the same time.","March 14","true","3.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Compared to most recent adventure games, this harkens back to the old school Lucasarts game, and it succeeds under most aspects.\n\nSTORYYou play as Sydney Emerson, a private investigator who is trying to discover the true identity of a Ripper that is causing trouble in Victorian Era London.\nThe story blends very well the time period with noir characters, giving the genre a unique spin. The dialogue is sharp and fast paced, and there are rarely any dull moments. However, some of the characters are a bit too cartoonish, and some elements are kind of cliched, but it still is a solid story that keeps your interest throught the game.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is developed with Construct 2, and it looks very good: the environments (from the dark streets of London, to its park and pubs) are all detailed and varied, and the character sprites are well animated. However, I frequently had some glitches like text randomly disappearing or skipping, pathfinding didn't always work properly, and in some areas there were some problems with the colors. Other than that, I never had framerate drops or crashes.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is like the old-school Lucas Arts adventure games, focused more on puzzles than dialogue choices. The gameplay is very simple: talk with NPCs to find new informations, pick up and combine items to access new areas and so on. It really is as simple as that.\n\n\nCHALLENGEThe game's main challenge are its puzzles, and some of them can be pretty hard to figure out, but they still aren't as convoluted as the Infamous Goat Puzzle from Broken Sword. If you ever get stuck, you can ask the game for a hint that manages to be helpful without spilling out the answer to you. I still got very frustrated with one puzzle, but it wasn't all that bad.\n\nSOUNDWhat it lacks in voice acting, it compensates with good SFX and soundtrack that has both noir music and tracks that make you feel like you are in 1880 London.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are no achievements, no extras nor secrets, and not even different choices to make in your playthrough. Once you have finished it, there isn't a good reason to come back other than enjoy the same game you already played.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty damn good point-and-click adventure that has simple but effective gameplay, challenging puzzles, good music and decent graphics, albeit a bit glitchy. Highly recommended to fans of old Lucas Arts games, as well as to those used to Telltale Games' adventures. Looking forward to the next two chapters.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7.5\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","January 28","true","6.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mwpk/recommended/356390/","mwpk","Mike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mwpk/","180 products in account","https://youtu.be/UHuQbeFVKNY\n\nThe Slaughter is a noir point-in-click adventure game from Brainchild, which is a one man team I might add. It's reminiscent of old adventure games like Monkey Island or Full Throttle, and more recently, it reminds me of The Blackwell Legacy (which also took inspiration from those classics).\n\nIn The Slaughter you play as Sydney Emerson, a down on this luck, behind on his rent detective-really is there any other kind-living in London in the East End in 1880. The story opens with Sydney on his side in a dark alley getting beaten by a large man named Sallis and his diminutive employer Mr. Finch. You luck your way out of that situation and you soon get a case to work on. There is a serial killer roaming the streets and a client is paying you for you private detective services.\n\nFirst off let's talk about sound and visuals:\n\nThe Slaughter doesn't have voice acting and its sound effects are reminiscent of an old adventure game as is its pixellated aesthetic. This may not be to everyone's tastes. Personally, I have some pretty strong nostalgia to those old adventure games and I just think this game looks good in general. The animations look nice and characters and locations are well detailed with foreground and background objects and characters easily distinguishable. It's a nice looking game.\n\nIt doesn't have voice acting but that didn't hurt the experience for me. The writing for The Slaughter is definitely a high point. For a noir game about a serial killer and murder there is plenty of humour and lightheartedness; like Sydney falling on his bum or the barman quipping at you when you examine his liquor behind the bar. The characters all have a lot of personality and it clearly comes across while interacting with them. Sydney himself has a lot of noir elements to him, like a pulpy down on his luck detective would, but things don't get too dreary and his dialogue is filled with humour and wit.\n\nMusic is another strong suit. The different locations around London each have their own music or ambient sound playing from a more upbeat song at the pub to the eerie crow squawks and ambient city noise of the dreary area in front of the pub.\n\nLike most adventure games, The Slaughter is mouse driven, you control your character by clicking around the screens and interacting with hot spots as you mouse over them; the left mouse button is your interact or talk button, and your right being “examine.” Outside you move between areas by clicking on a hotspot at the edge of a screen which will bring you to a map that allows you to traverse to other areas in London. Double clicking at the edge of a screen, or on a doorway, will instantly move you to the new location. Sydney has a rather slow walking speed and it would be nice if you could make him run by double clicking around an area. This is a minor nitpick as most areas are rather small so it isn't a huge issue.\n\nYour inventory is located at the bottom of the screen and mousing over it expands it showing the objects you're holding. You can use objects from your inventory by clicking and dragging them onto a hotspot or combining objects in your inventory in a likewise manner.  You can also examine objects in your inventory and is a good idea to do so when you get something new. Another minor nitpick, and this is not a problem in most areas but the position of your inventory at the bottom of the screen is slightly annoying in two areas where you are moving from north to south as you'll expand the inventory by accident instead of moving Sydney. Most screens are oriented east-west so it isn't an issue.\n\nThis being an adventure game, you solve puzzles by using objects on things and people and also by talking to people and running through their dialogue. You'll often have multiple places to go and multiple things to interact with but the puzzles are logical and it will be fairly obvious what you need to interact with, or do, to move the story forward. This isn't a game where you'll need to be using everything with everything.\n\nThis is a welcome change compared to older games, and some newer ones, where you had dozens of places to explore at a time, and multiple pages of inventory items.\n\nThere is also a minigame you play partway through where you shove pennies across a board called...shova ha'penny that nicely changes things up. Also, if you hate it, or suck at it, you won't have to play it a million times to get past that obstacle.\n\nMy two major complaints about the Slaughter are:\n\nIts pacing is more than a little uneven. There are these symbolic dream sequences where you're in a room with a fish and I feel it breaks up the flow of the game without adding much. I found myself just wanting to get through them to see where the story is going. In there defence though, they are rather short. Later dream sequences are done much better. Also, when you finally return to your apartment, after an exciting prologue, you get a rather boring job to do. It works in setting up where Sydney is in his life but feels like filler; just something to break up the game before the real meat of the story begins.\n\nThe other complaint I have is that this act ends on a rather lame cliche that pulled me out of a story. I don't enjoy seeing the puppet string and they were in full view for that ending and leaves me with some misgivings about how the story will shape up. With that said though, this may not be much of an issue depending on how subsequent acts of the game turn out.\n\nIt took me 4 hours to finish The Slaughter but I'm a player that stops to smell the roses so 3 to 3h 30 should see you through to the end.\n\nThis is the first act of the game so much is dependent on where the subsequent acts take the story and its characters, but all in all, I enjoyed The Slaughter and enjoy spending time with these characters.  I have some misgiving about the game's pacing and ending, along with some nitpicks here and there, but overall it was an enjoyable experience and I look forward to seeing how this story plays out.\n","January 28","true","11.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

Alex Francois, alias the brainedchild, had accomplished the task of raising a bit over £8000 for the developpement of this point-and-click adventure which will leave the players hungry for the Second Act.\n\nTell me something...\nAs a french novellist, I have to admit I'm envious of Francois's talent at scripting a cast. Each character has a set of traits that makes them unique and engaging. Believe it or not, I've grown attached to the main character, Sydney Emerson, who was making me laugh consistently during the opening scene of my adventure. In a trashy dark alleyway of London, as if it was not already funny that the low life investigator gets kicked in the guts for having been in someone else's dream, he keeps punching both his attackers with tasty humourous insults. This dark and polished humour established itself in the beginning and it just never stopped. During my playthrough I would find myself smiling at every line the text has to offer.  The only thing that still needs clarification is the multiple dreams in which you find the investigator. I know this is only act one and there is still time to make that connection, but I feel if Francois had not left this part totally to my interpretation, he could have built suspense about it.  As a result, by the end of Act One, the dreams left me annoyed that I had to click my way through them. That being said, I did not lose my appetite for Act 2.\n\nRead more of this review here: http://www.gaming-medley.com/#!The-Slaughter-Review/c1zec/56bccd610cf2fb0f6ff9dad1","March 4","true","1.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The game is filled with original music which sets the tone perfectly and there was one song in particular which was stuck in my head for days. (You will know what I mean when you hear it!)\n\nDespite some adult subject matter, the writing is full of dry wit which lightens the mood and this sense of humour carries over into the puzzles. The puzzles strike a perfect balance, the solutions are logical yet challenging and as such they are incredibly satisfying to solve. I initially found the Shoove Ha'penny minigame to be frustrating but through sheer stubbornness I am now a pro :)\n\nI noticed a review which claimed the game is short but I actually found it to be the perfect length for a first act.

The Slaughter started off very strong.  Witty dialog is off the charts; great characterization.  Interesting side characters and situations.  Graphics are ok.  Not the best pixel art, but it gets the job done.  I got stuck maybe once initially and I think I had to resort to the hint system, but after that the game went well.\n\nUntil it stopped being a point and click adventure and served up a mini-game.  I knew something was up, the story stalled, there was no direction, I ended up at the right location only out of a process of elimination.  And I ended up at the mini-game only because there was nothing else to do (still haven't a clue why my character is playing though).  The mini-game is half-penny where you are supposed to slide half-pennies across a board to certain distances.  It's mind numbingly boring.  Pong is more interesting and I hate those types of games.  But you either have to win, or play 3 rounds (last I heard) to progress.  Honestly, I'd rather do housework.  So, I have a clean house, but haven't finished this episode, and will probably never bother with another one.  Sad, really, this looked like a delightfully entertaining game.  And it was, until it wasn't.\n\nI tried to get myself to refund the game, but the writing was so good that I put it off.  Now it's too late.  Perhaps I'll try to suffer past the half-penny game some day.  Maybe I'll make my own mini-game out of it:  buy some beer and take a drink every time I don't get a half-penny in a column.  Maybe that will get me through 3 rounds.  And afterwards I'll actually feel like the main character to boot!  Alas, there are so many other good games to play.\n\nTL;DR:  Great writing, ok graphics.  Story screeches to a dead halt with an tortuous mini-game that comes out of nowhere and doesn't appear to serve any purpose since there is no context to why you are wasting your time with it.  If you can get this at a steep sale....have you tried hidden object games?  Some of those are actually a lot of fun, and cheap too.","May 27","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

I was engroseed, and besides a few weird design quirks and weird puzzles, I was really enjoying the time I spent with this game. Then it ended. And I was underwhelmed by the amount of content. 2.5 hours of content is stretching it, really. Not a bad experience, but $5 or less is a more realistic price point, at least at this point. Maybe when there are more acts, but not right now; not at this price point.","January 31","false","2.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","14","30","0","3"

While there is a way around it it simply eats too much time. It is as bad as the stupid mini game in Conquest of the Longbow but the solution to that was actually to CHEAT at the game.\n\nIt's a real shame the demo showed a lot of promise.\n\nRequested a refund","April 7","false","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

It didn't disappoint.\n\nThe dialogue is hilarious and the story has a tense atmosphere that brings it all back down to earth.\n\nThe puzzles could be considered easy, but the charm of the game more than makes up for that. My only real issue is how long it took me to find that bloody bar of soap!\n\nYou're looking at 2-4 hours of gameplay, depending on how experienced you are with the genre (and how much ha'penny you play).\n\nCan't wait for act two!","March 9","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very well-written, witty and atmospheric game! I found the puzzles enjoyable and comfortably difficult (not too easy, not too hard). The art is imperfect but charming, and I think it's pretty good at contributing positively to the overall feel of the game. I'm really looking forward to Act Two!\n\nBasically, if you enjoy the point-and-click games that Wadjet Eye and/or Screen7 publishes, I think you'll be pretty happy with this.","May 20","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
