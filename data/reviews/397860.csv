Couldnt find an online match last night, but there probably just isnt many players right now hopefully when the game is finished up and sells more copies that will change.\nThere are alot of weapons and Items that drop so you will never run out of ammo, but I would like to see a dodge roll added tho because the zombies move about as fast as you do and its hard to see them till theyre close unless theyre going for your team mate. The FPS HUD cam was a nice touch tho I wish I could make it just a tad bit bigger. The guy on the radios southern accent is a bit over exagerrated but thats not a deal breaker, has its own humorous charm to it actually.\nIt has a sort of arcade action feel to it, I would like to see more insentive such as leveling up or permanent upgrades or rare equipment hidden around the map that rewards killing baddies and exploring, but if this game is meant to be more of an arcade action style game thats fine.  I think with co op and maybe a couple extra moves this game will be even better.\n\nI'm a big fan of twinstick shooters and this game gets the controls right when it comes to aiming where some other more popular gamea fail. Like I said I would like see a dodge roll, or atleast a better way to break away from the enemies when they get too close.\nAside from a zombies ragdoll twitching and stretching for a second after dying I didn't really run into any glitches or bugs in my 8 hour playthrough so thats another good thing I can say about this game that I can't say for alot of alpha and beta games and even alot of finished AAA games.\n\nWhile there could be more innovation, I imagine the developer takes user feedback into consideration, so I expect the final game to be more polished.\n\nIt's worth your money, just don't expect perfection in any early access title, and I think you will be happy with what you pay for.","October 20, 2015","true","8.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I imagine the game will continue to be polished towards full release. It's a fun little game, I haven't tried it multiplayer yet.","February 4","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This devs are doing early access justice!\n\nYou like shooting stuff? You like blood? You like a ton of weapons?\nThen this game won't leave you unsatisfied! I picked this up even before it was here when they launched their Greenlight campaign. Nice to see this finally on Steam and with Multiplayer none the less even if it currently only has deathmatch.\n\nThe game it's self is really fun, lot's of weapons both melee and firearms and funny hat's a la team fortress! If I had to compare it with another game I'd say it's Alien Swarm with a ton of jokes in it, it's pretty clear they don't take it too seriously the theme of the game, I'd say they are making fun of the zombie genre than actually adding another lame generic addition. Just click a couple of times the credits, seriously! Who does that?? 20/10\n\nI reccomend it indefinitely even at this early stage!","September 15, 2015","true","23.8"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

The gameplay is intense and fast-paced, just like any game in this genre should be. But this game rises above the others. And that's because this game doesn't take itself seriously. The game makes fun of itself and the genre, and I was laughing the entire time. The creators of this game have great comedic timing that really adds to the style of the game in a unique way. I promise you will be entertained.\n\nThe variety in the game is equally awesome. There is a huge range of weapons. Choose anything from blunt objects, to sharp objects, to shooting objects, to guitars?!? Yes, guitars. Awesome. And then there's the hats...oh my.\n\nThis is the absolute perfect game whether you want to kill some time blasting away baddies in creative ways while wearing a stylish hat, or whether you want to really get deeper into the game. The creators of the game nailed the graphical style, and there's a very nice amount of detail here that pulls you into the world they've created. The world is real. The pressure is real. This game is the real deal. Get this game. You won't regret it.","September 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","1"
