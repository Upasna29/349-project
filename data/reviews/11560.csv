Has few flaws, but it is certainly not bad. All 3 races are different, but also look familiar to the zerg-protoss-terran stuff. Still game feels unique. You can also control the commander in 3rd person!\nAnd last thing. Steam says it is SP only. But there is LAN (online service was shut down ages ago) still have'nt tested it, but it should work well. It's a good game if you like RTS, and is worth the money especially on sale.","July 26, 2014","true","0.7"," 66 of 88 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","66","88","5","2"

Anything over $5 is too much.\n","December 20, 2014","true","14.1"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","1"

Whether this is a result of lack of polish or overemphasis on a few key features, the result is a game that just feels weak.  Leaving aside cinematics, vocals and dialog, from the very beginning, the command UI feels frustrating.  There is no feeling of control over an engagement; your infantry will wander around and do whatever they want.  They'll watch complacently while a teammate is mowed down five feet away, and one guy will take a jog around three sides of a building to rejoin the squad after you moved them to an adjacent corner.  Any attempt at strategy is pointless, and blobbing soldiers is really the only thing you can do.  The game's age isn't an excuse; there are many games much older than this one that have better playability.  The Ground Control series comes to mind.","September 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","13","31","0","1"
