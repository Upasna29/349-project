I know how to undock my ship and set a course.  NOTHING will hold me back now and I will rule this universe in no time.\n\n34 hours into EVE and I swear to christ I am still doing tutorial missions, trying to figure out all the differnet angles to make money and do stuff in this damn game.  To fan the flames I have people wanting to do stuff with me, and I'm like "I AM STILL DOING TUTORIAL MISSIONS"..."LET ME LEARN".\n\n42 hours into EVE and I have no idea what I'm doing but I still keep playing.  I told my friends to ♥♥♥♥ off for now.\n\n109 hours into EVE.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ I just realized how many ♥♥♥♥in parts you can have for your ships.  There has to be some sort of build guides for these things.  This is way too overwhelming.\n\n165 hours into EVE and I still feel like a new guy and I've never been the new guy for so long.  I wonder why they call this a game when clearly it belongs in Office 365 Enterprise.  Then I realize this wouldn't be EVE without being so ... detailed...  I still have no idea what I'm doing, but I keep playing.\n\n207 hours into EVE and I realize I have to get into the 4 day trainings in order to get my hands on a mining barge which are really the only way to go for serious mining...still playing.\n\n219 hours into EVE and I start telling one of my friends about how this is so up my alley.  He responds with "Oh god, here we go, don't push your excel sheet on me".  I respond immediately with, "First let me say I dont ever recommend you play it so ♥♥♥♥ off cause you arent good enough for it".  First sign of addiction is getting defensive...\n\n223 hours into EVE and I'm so happy that my brother came out of retirement to play.  He is old school.  I immediatley see the advantage to working with other people, most specifically with someone who has 3 accounts and can haul your ore back and reprocess it at 73%...I kind of want to keep playing.\n\n274 hours into EVE I stopped ♥♥♥♥ing around and finally managed to focus on mining.  I got my first barge outfitted with strip miner IIs and my haul has increased over 10x.  I love this game and I want to keep playing.\n\n319 hours into EVE and I realize that I am only 1 day and 19 hours in skill training away from a Gallente Battleship.  I get excited and read up on which one I should get in preparation into some PVP action.  I realize I want an Amarr Battleship instead.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.  3 days of training added.   Somehow I still find myself wondering when I will actually start ruling this universe.\n\n356 hours in and I finally purchased a GTX 970.  I get pumped and go into EVE's settings and ramp everything up to the highest settings.  I don't see any difference...\n\n367 hours and I just learned a lesson in the vicinity of 185 million isk.  I am not invincible.  Just because I can finally fly a Battlship doesn't mean I should start flying a Battleship.\n\n580 hours and I'm STILL training up Astrogeology (12d) AND Mining Barges to lvl V (18d).  I'm starting to wonder if these big barges are worth the 30 days of training time.\n\n616 hours and I just finished training Mining Barges to V.  I don't even want to mine anymore.","January 29, 2015","true","741.1"," 886 of 908 people (98%) found this review helpful 837 people found this review funny","98","886","908","837","20"

I emailed Eve, and they responded that my account is still active for 1 month and that I should be able to play. I tried playing from the official Eve Online client but it wouldn't allow me to log in from my steam account.

Alliances on both sides of this conflict are currently recruiting a lot of new players into their ranks, so if you ever wanted to try EVE Online out; Now might be the best time to do so.\n\nI'd recommend any new player to get a free trail before buying the game. You can get a 14-Day trial on the EVE Online website, or you can head over to my profile and click the link in the profile description for a 21-Day trial. If you like the game you can simply subscribe to it at the end of the trial. :)\n\nEVE Online is a very time consuming game but it can be very rewarding as well, depending on what you do with your time in-game. It has been said many times before but still rings true: The game is only as boring as you make it. It's a sandbox game and therefore very open-ended, it doesn't hold your hand after you're done with the tutorial.\n\nI'd recommend you head over and do the career agents after the tutorial. It'll give you free ships, skillbooks and items to get you started. It also provides you with a small taste of the things you can do in-game like; Mining, industry, Missions and exploration.\n\nFor a new player I'd recommend doing exploration to get ISK. It is very profitable in low sec. and null sec. and definetly better than mining. I would also recommend you to find a corporation (Guild) that is 'newbro' friendly. Playing EVE solo is possible, but more likely to burn you out before you get into the game, joining a corp. that has a like-minded playstyle will increase your enjoyment and let you learn from more experienced players at the same time.\n\nOne last thing: You are never truly safe in this game unless you are docked. You can be killed at any time, anywhere. I'm not trying to scare you away from the game, chances are you won't be ganked until you are several months into the game. I just want you to understand that you should NEVER fly anything you can not afford to lose. It should be obvious, but some people still do and then complain about it, don't be that guy.\n\nIf you didn't know it already, you lose your ship and everything on it once you get killed. That includes cargo as well, so don't move anything extremely expensive.\n\nEVE Online is a game that requires time to learn and patience to master, hope to see you in-game! o7\n\nTL;DR The game is what you make of it. Everyone has a different experience with it.\n\nEdit: Trail -> Trial","April 6","true","463.6"," 378 of 410 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","378","410","17","21"

Unless you're willing to devote months of your life to this game (which mostly will end up being used for skill training and monotonous isk farming), find friends and blow up ships. That is the best way to legitimately enjoy the game.\n\nTwo pieces of advice:\n-Don't mine, it requires so much time to make money, and after a month or so, you'll realize that training for an Exhumer was a waste of time.\n-Get into null/lowsec as soon as possible. Fit up a nooby frig, watch a few PvP vids, and get going.

I've always puzzled at the name of EVE Online's single server. It's an ironic moniker to lend to a world where hundreds of thousands of players jockey for resources, scheme, spy, and blow each other up. On that one server, wars wage in perpetuity. Scammers ply their trade outside crowded space stations. Fortunes are made and lost amid the bustle of a full-fledged economy. None of it feels particularly tranquil.\n\nAnd yet, Carl Sagan once noted that from space, Earth--for all its chaos--is nothing but a pale blue dot. So it goes with EVE: step far enough back from CCP's sci-fi massively multiplayer online game, and a picture of tranquility begins to emerge. Ten years of steady growth. The recent release of a 20th free expansion, Rubicon. Throughout all, consistency of vision, commitment, and support. It's no small achievement in the winter of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, when young games are born, live, and die, all in World of Warcraft's shadow. In the face of such competition, EVE's languid pace would seem a detriment, and yet, like the universe, EVE is ever expanding outward.\n\nEVE cultivates an appreciation for scales, vectors, and inertia, because it makes their mastery a matter of life and death. The game supports a healthy variety of pursuits, including nonviolent options like building, trading, or mining, but at some point almost all players must hazard a jaunt around EVE's tangled network of interconnected solar systems. Each system is a room of sorts connected by stargates that act as metaphorical doorways. They're spacious chambers, big enough to fit planets, asteroid belts, and space stations with a few trillion miles to spare, but danger always has a way of finding you in EVE. If you're lucky, it'll only come in the form of pirates or warring fleets that open fire on sight. If you're unlucky, it'll be a scammer, spy, or saboteur playing EVE's tacitly sanctioned metagame against you.\n\nConflict runs tangential to even the most pacifistic careers in EVE. After all, it's easier to maintain a lively spaceship market if players are always blowing each other up. But when things come to blows, it's actually a tidy affair. Ships can be piloted by clicking about in space, but most actions in EVE hinge on more mechanical commands like "maintain distance" or "warp to". It's a math-oriented system that hinges on numbers like distance, radii, and acceleration. Once the enemy has been targeted and the keys for weapons have been pressed, battles ebb and flow according to who can dictate range as their ships circle. Large-scale battles are as chaotic and complex as any sci-fi war scene, and skirmishes are thrillingly staccato. Victory in either is less a product of reflex than of strategy. The prelude to war--proper equipment, communication, teammwork, and patience--is usually the deciding factor. As often as a good fight seems to find the unwilling in EVE, it can prove elusive for those seeking it out. For every minute of battle or plunder, there are hours spent as prey eludes capture, as fleets circle and dance to the reports of their forward scouts.\n\nIndeed, EVE's pace is glacial indeed...right until it isn't. A dominant alliance might hold a third of the world in an iron grip for ages, until a spot of corporate espionage dispels it into the digital ether overnight. An interstellar bank could compound every investment it's entrusted with for years, until it suddenly absconds with billions. The universe's first Titan-class ubership may be a world-beater, until it's destroyed because the pilot chooses an inopportune moment to log off. They're the kinds of stories that make headlines outside of gaming circles, the kind that EVE is uniquely equipped to tell. Whether you're speaking to the allure of exploring EVE's vast universe, the machinations of its political scene, or even the prospects of the game's next expansion, that capacity for upheaval is a draw unto itself.\n\nWhat's refreshing about EVE is how much of that change is user-driven. Player characters in the game are canonically immortal, their consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo. So-called pod pilots are the movers and shakers of the EVE universe, and enjoy a privileged position as mercenary demigods (consider for a moment the level of desperation that would drive a non-player character to enlist under a commander who, by definition, never goes down with the ship, and you'll begin to grasp the morbidity of EVE's lore). What gets moved or shaken is a matter of taste. It might mean battle, as a soldier or pirate. It might mean cleaning up after said battles, and pawning the salvage. Or it might mean moving goods from one place to another, and shaking whenever outlaws start eyeing your loot. Each endeavor can be pursued in the name of EVE's four hawkish NPC empires, a smattering of lesser powers, or the great host of player corporations.\n\nPicking what banner to fly is always an important decision in an MMORPG, but in EVE, the decision can make or break the experience entirely. Should you have no allies, the vast reaches of space can be brutally lonely and unforgiving. Sure, there are hundreds of space stations to rest in, nominal communities strewn about the network of solar systems that dot EVE's pointillistic map. But though the game now allows you to walk the interiors of these structures, there's little humanity to be found inside. NPCs are still just portraits in the interface that proffer textual missions. Other players are just smaller portraits in your chat feed. The resultant sense of disembodiment impinges on every interaction in EVE, and it helps to explain the popularity of extra-game forums and meet-ups. Absent a few friendly faces, it's just not that easy to make regions with names like The Bleak Lands or Stain feel like home. Go figure.\n\nActually, Stain seems like Shangri-la compared to 0FZ-2H. That's the naming convention of zero-security systems, which fall outside the protection of NPC guards, and where EVE's player alliances battle for control of the game's open territories. Zero security also sees CCP's most brilliant and nefarious contribution to player-versus-player gameplay: regions, and the distribution of resources therein, are asymmetrical. Zero-sec space tempts with its more lucrative opportunities, but making the trip means leaving the safety of the empires. Inequalities exist among the lawless regions, too. The imbalance creates further incentives for players to band together, if only for the express purpose of evicting those ahead of them at the table.\n\nAsymmetry must be in CCP's mission statement somewhere. It's certainly visible in the designs of EVE's spaceships: intricate, inventive crafts that range in scale from small yacht to small state. Asymmetry colors the use of those ships as weapons, too. At first blush, the more expensive, upper-echelon crafts seem overpowered. That perception holds true, until you develop an appreciation for asymmetrical warfare. There are no restrictions--mechanical or moral--on the size of fleets corporations can bring to the field, and with enough cheap frigates and cruisers, most foes can be felled. Barring that, there's always sabotage, as legitimate a tactic in EVE as any.\n\nBig, expensive ships are also big, expensive targets, either for rival corporations or pirates that operate on the fringes of high-security space. Being blown up might not mean as much if you just wake up in a distant clone vat, but it can take a serious toll on your supply of ISK, EVE's currency. Ships that get destroyed are gone for good, along with all the expensive and rare equipment they've been kitted out with. That can include PLEX, an in-game item that represents real playing time in EVE (and a viable alternative to the game's $9.99 a month cost for dedicated players), meaning some losses can hurt a player's real walle","August 23, 2015","true","542.8"," 343 of 388 people (88%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","88","343","388","29","15"

However, MOST of the content CCP provides for EVE is not something every player see's or experiences.\n\n\nAnd as such, I've known many players who basically experience NONE of the new stuff provided in expansions, YEAR AFTER YEAR. and are, more or less, playing the exact same game from 4 - 5+ years ago.\n\nThere is a very real problem with EVE that I will get into in just a bit. But what EVE succeeds at ... it does... Pretty well.\nIt's a decent game if you have people to play with, people who know what they are doing. If you are able to join a decent corp.\n\nIf you have no friends, or no one to play EVE with, it's normally an extremely lackluster experience, very boring, and very very lonely. EVE can also be very harsh. You can get scammed, lose all your assets, and lose hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of items in game.\n\nI knew a person who after playing the game for a month, bought a bunch of plexs. Who then undocked, and was then blown up. He lost about $300~ worth of plex. Needless to say, he quit the game shortly after.\n\nEVE, for the most part, is a very ruthless game. You need to play it almost in the mindset of something like an even more hardcore dark souls. Expect to die, or lose your ship. Don't fly stuff you can't afford to lose, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Plan our what you're doing, where you're going. Know what you are doing, before you do it. Which, can be a little much when you are starting out.\n\nI've known a lot of new players, and have helped a lot of new players with the game.\nBut, there are a lot of misconceptions. Mostly thrown off by CCP themselves, with how they portray the game... And there's a lot of unknowns and things that you just will not get your head around till you've spent a lot of time/money in the game (For the most part).\n\nI've known plenty of people who spent months trying to get a certain ship, only to find out.. That ship was not what they expected, and they were extremely dissapointed and wound up leaving the game due to it. It's depressing to work for a carrier for many months, then to finally get it and realize.. Oh, you can't actually really use it unless you have other people or accounts to play with. There's a lot of aspects in the game that are awesome, however... They (Honestly) are not executed well imo.\n\nOver the years, instead of EVE changing them to make them better. They've stuck with their somewhat flawed design in ways that has left a lot of people basically... In the dust. It keeps the regulars, but for the most part... A lot of other people just can't stick with it.\n\nA lot of things in EVE really just are not designed that well for a solo player in specific scenarios. And generally, for a new player starting off... That is how it's played. Which is AWFUL. Then there's the dissapointment people get when they realize, they can't do what they thought they could. Or what they want to do. This is a hard limitation of the core game design.\n\nEVE is a game for groups of people. If you play by yourself, you will almost certainly be bored out of your mind more than likely. You will more than likely quit the game within the first few hours.\n\nEVE is just not good at that, and probably never will be.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love EVE. I always have, even though I have a lot of problems with it. I still play it to this day. I've had numerous accounts over the years and it's still something that I usually come back to for a few months every expansion. Then drop off, of course once I realize there's still nothing there for me.\n\nMost people I knew that were hardcore into EVE and used to nolife the game, have never played it again.. There's usually two types of EVE players. Those that love it, and play it all the time. And those that play it, hate it, and never play it again.\n\nI'm a bit of an odd one stuck in the middle but oh well :P\n\nI hope that one day CCP can actually change some of the things that HOLD eve online back from being the best it can be. But I know that will probably never happen, I still enjoy seeing and hearing about the fleet fights, watching the killboards, and playing every now and then but... EVE can get extremely stale for a lot of people, and that's why even people who love it might never come back.\n\nHonestly, would I reccomend EVE? Not really because MOST people (Once again, talking about in general) do not like it, and have a real hard time with the game.\n\nThere, of course, are people that love EVE and eat it up like there's no tomorrow. Great, but for most people.. It just isn't worth it.\n\nThat said, if you are interested in trying out EVE let me know. You can use my referral here.\nhttp://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?♥♥♥♥♥5a39485a-ae65-4ede-b4dd-deb8fd7a1da8&action=buddy\nYou will get extra game time than creating a normal trial account (21 days vs 14).\n\nSo you have some extra time to train skills, try out stuff. Anyone is welcome to ask me any questions they might have. I'm always happy to help new people!

That boss you just killed? He's going to respawn in 2 minutes to allow for the next group of players to complete that quest. And so most MMOs are a tedious grindfest of fetch quests and uninspired raids in which every player is but a puppet in a world devoid of life, just running around on endless errands that go nowhere.\n\nEVE is not like that.\n\nEVE isn't a game: it's a sandbox. A hypercapitalist simulator. The players make the rules, they enforce them, and they break them. The consequences are real. Mistakes are costly, and death is permanent. The learning curve is steep. Very, very steep: more than 300 hours in, I still feel like a noob. But whether I'm mining on my own in a low-security area of space, or exploring a wormhole in search of a quick buck, or speculating on the commodity market, or trying to gain some notoriety in a remote outpost along with a rabble of scoundrels, I know that danger is lurking around the corner, and that I can't afford to let my guard down.\n\nThe friends you make in EVE are real friends. The ships and cargo you lose are worth real money.\nBut like a wasp in a hive, you feel like you contribute to the collective. And while a single wasp sting is only a warning,  the swarm is a sight to behold.","April 9","true","335.9"," 247 of 276 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","247","276","10","6"

Do I like it? Yes. Would I recommend it? No.\nEvE is an exercise in humility. If you join now or at any point in the future, don't expect any satisfaction from this game.\nThe trailers are made to make you believe that you can change something - the news broadcast about the battle of B-5RB are making your mind imagine things that just aren't here.\nEvE is not a Sandbox - it is a multiple choice point & click adventure like those "make your own adventure" books you read when you were a child. There is nothing new to be discovered, everything has been done by someone before you and better to the point where it is almost mandatory to use third party websites to fit your ship, mine, produce, explore or do anything in this game.\nYou will not stumble upon a miner in distress in your first week and join his buddies fleet to see a large battle - if you venture into the PvP space you will be blown up either by the pirates or his reinforcements. Chatting to any of those groups will make you a target.\nPvP comes in three major varieties.\nSolo PvP revolves around finding a mark that you can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your ship, you don't engage. For a new players this means that you will never get in any PvP you can win.\nGang PvP revolves around finding a mark that your gang can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your gang, you don't engage.\nFleet PvP is just two massive blobs colliding. Most fleet battles are decided by who gets the drop on whom - since fleet battles tend to last for more than 10 minutes, a little tactics can be put into it with reinforcements.\n\nThe Sandbox that is often quoted is nothing more than a tech tree with premade options. Ships, Modules and everything you make has been made by a very restrictive system of blueprints that allow no individuality. Any two ships with the same name will look the same, behave the same and do the same until you fit them with modules with the same attributes.\n\nSo in conclusion this is EvE: You grind your ♥♥♥ off in the same missions or same mining belts for days on end, waiting for your skills that are based on real world time to learn to finish learning. Nothing you will do will have any impact if you haven't been playing this game for years, shelling out a quite high monthly fee for a somewhat dated game.\nEvE is the ultimate in waiting simulators.

Opinions ahead, I reserve the right to be disagreed with in an amicable fashion. o7 o7\nI cant recommend this game. it is a profound time sink, and has a really niche player base with very little payoff for more casual players. I played for about a year and i found myself waiting for the game experience to become fun, but it never did. the space combat is unforgivably boring, which as far as im concerned is a deal breaker.\n\nthe ship designs are bizarrely ugly too, and it constantly tempered my desire for new ships. i care less about aesthetics than combat, but playing this i was forced to stare at my ship for virtually the entire playtime, so i would have been happier if i actually liked how my ships looked.\n\nthe skill system was pretty much hands-off, you just had to wait for hours or more commonly days or even weeks to get a miniscule increase to a particular skill, and it never felt rewarding to max a skill out, just on to the next skill, a numb grind.\n\ni realize that many people would cite the massive battles that occur as a counter to my assertion that the combat is boring, but these huge battles are infrequent at best, and due to the in-game economy being so closely linked to real world cash value, these battles could very well cost you more than a few wrecked ships. most of the time youll be battling human or a.i. controlled pirates/bandits in small time skirmishes that serve only to highlight how uninteresting the combat usually is.\n\ni keep a book by my computer for when im downloading programs or whatever, and i found myself rereading the entire Song of Ice and Fire series while engaged in combat or mining, both primarily rely on the same skill set of moving the mouse icon and occasionally clicking buttons.\n\ni also grew to mistrust the company CCP and the community of this game, although im sure there were lots of decent human beings amongst them. the biggest problem i had with the community happened when i first started playing. the leader of one of the most prominent corporate alliances had shown up to a livestream drunk and called out a player by his real name and asked his followers to grief this poor, totally innocent guy. the leader said during the livestream that he wanted the player to actually commit suicide irl, and the big bad leader was marshalling his ingame forces to "make it so".\n\nthis despicable behaviour was reprimanded with a slap on the wrist, a mere 30 day suspension from their little ingame council, and as far as i know, nothing more was done.\n\nthere seemed to be a lingering resentment towards players who choose to pve or mine or whatever, and i read more than a few forum posts that were more like essays on how the elitist players are right in how they grief players who choose to mine, likening them to worse than mindless drones that deserve to die over and over. it felt like i was reading the manifesto of a sociopath, rather than a reasoned sensible opinion.\n\nthere is so much more to say, but i cant realistically place all that i have to say in a single review, who would be interested in reading it?","April 28, 2014","false","603.0"," 1,553 of 1,999 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","553","1","0","108"

So why do I NOT recommend it?  The game is more than a little overwhelming, and, clearly, in order for the game to really pay off, you need to be able to dedicate major time to it, or, you will waste your subscription, and just die, left on your own in the middle of the cold cold space.  Is that what happened to me?  Almost.  I have a full time job, a beautiful wife, and other interests... .  I am convinced you can't have all those things in your life and successfully play this game.  I wish I could.  So for me, and those like me, I don't recommend spending your money and time on this, unless you have enough room in your life for this beast.  In its place, I recommend the X series.  You can "save" your game, have a life, and load it, and pick up where you left off... and not worry about dying and losing it all, because Life called and needed some of your focus.  In the future, perhaps I will find a way to manage these commitments so EVE Online is do-able, but for now, hopefully this review, about an awesome game, saves a few players some time and money.\n\nOn a side-note, if this game ever provides a subscription for life service... you will likely see me on it, from time to intermitent time.","January 26, 2014","false","13.4"," 495 of 630 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","495","630","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vedgaras/recommended/8500/","vedgaras","Vedgaras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vedgaras/","171 products in account","After playing for a couple of months (not Steam version, because the Steam launcher was giving me troubles) I  don’t recommend buying it at this time — June 2014 — due to the overall impression I’ve got. Read the details below and be prepared if you want to buy the game.\n\nPreparations before playing\nI know it is a game but if you don’t prepare properly, you will regret it. Or you will quit the game much earlier. A free trial for 14 days is available to anyone. Any Eve Online player can send you a link for a free trial for 21 days. You can choose to pay the subscription or enter the CD code from a starter pack at any time. Your trial time will not disappear. Your paid time will just be added to the trial time. So always start as a trial. No need to waste 14-21 days.\n\nPvP sandbox\nIt is a sandbox game. Unlike theme park games where gamers can interact with what developers have created to have fun, in sandbox games you have to create your own fun. The PvP (player versus player) component of the game clearly outweighs the PvE (player versus environment) component.\n\nNot a solo-friendly game\nChoosing your race or bloodline is not very important. Stats are the same. Only for role players it is important. Caldari area has the largest trade hub in the game at the moment. You start the game as a member of an NPC corporation. You can join a player-run corporation at any time. Learning the game alone is difficult. Join the corporation Eve University or some other corporation that is friendly to new players. Having a mentor to ask stupid questions is very handy.\n\nCharacter attributes\nVery important. A new character is given three character attribute remaps. You can use them to tune five attributes of your character in quite a wide range. Every skill requires a primary attribute and a secondary attribute. The amount of skill points you have in a specific attribute determines the speed of “learning” a particular skill. Benefits of the primary attribute affect the skill learning speed in full while benefits of the secondary skill give half as much speed. A new player gets two bonus remaps and one regular one. Once you spend them, your next remap will be available only one year after! These attributes are important only for learning. Nothing else.\n\nSkill system\nNever train rank V of a skill unless it opens up another skill that you want. Rank V is designed for perfectionists only!\nUnlike other games in Eve Online you cannot accelerate your character levelling by putting more personal time and effort into it. You can only install implants that give bonuses to your primary attributes. They vary from +1 to +5 attribute points. These implants speed up levelling. Implants + properly maxed attributes for specific skills are vital. Besides, if you buy any starter pack, you get a cerebral accelerator that gives a massive boost to attributes for a short time like 14 days (+9 to each attribute), 35 days (+3) or 7 days (+17 or 19, I don’t remember). The accelerator works for characters younger than the specified age. The effect will stay with you between the time you inject it and the time you reach that age. After that you cannot inject it.\nUnless you are a genius and know the game inside out you must get the program EveMon to plan your character progression. Eve Online is spreadsheets in space and takes a lot of calculations. It is not for impatient people, who want to do everything the game has to offer in a couple of months. A properly skilled character can take a year to get.\nOne thing is good, however. The game has a skill queuing system. You learn skills while offline as long as your subscription time is paid. The queuing skill clearly outlines when your skills get learned.\n\nSecurity levels of solar systems\nEvery solar system has a security level. 1.0 is the highest one and 0.0 is the lowest one. The range from 1.0 till 0.5 is called highsec. In highsec space police (aka CONCORD) will interfere if you fire upon or get fired upon without a war declaration. In this space you are kind of safe. The range from 0.4 till 0.1 is lowsec. Police will not interfere although the personal security ranking of the player, who commits a crime, will drop. If it is too low, such players will be hunted down by police upon entering highsec space. 0.0 is the null security space or nullsec where no rules apply but what you make. Don’t go there unless you are prepared.\n\nUser interface\nThe back end of the game is much more than what you are used to in any other game. You will see how much ISK (in-game currency) you spent or gained every time. You will be able to see every trade between you and some other character. Lots and lots of text. Lots of text as tutorials at the start of the game. Some people complain that it looks like you accept a lot of license agreements.\n\nSpace simulator?\nUPDATE http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/quick-give-me-manual-control/\nUntil recently you couldn't fly using WASD. Double-click on empty space and you will fly in that direction. Or choose a marker from the overview (a list of objects that exist around you in outer space, five tabs max, mind-blowingly customizable), right-click and choose Approach or Warp or something. The game has a lot of right-click and choose an option stuff. Practically core gameplay.\n\nGraphics and sound\nThe game was released in 2003. It has been updated since but still doesn’t look too good. For instance, with all settings on max and shaders at low it will look its best. Music is okay but I wish it had soundtracks similar to music from The Swapper. Sound effects are nothing to write home about.\n\nGame development\nThe game development looks slow. CCP, the development studio, seems to pool all the human resources together and then use them on various projects when a need arises. CCP has a record of promising features and not delivering them. Coming from other games where every expansion offers a tonne of content, I cannot say that Eve Online expansions offer a lot. Probably because game developers don’t stick with CCP for too long.\nCCP also seems to suffer from being too ambitious and from the lack of a clear and integral vision of how their games should develop. Google “CCP world of darkness” or “CCP Incarna” to learn about the game developer’s PR failures.\n\nOther players\nThey are the people you will interact with all the time. They can play the game for different purposes. Beware that scamming in the game is allowed. You cannot open a ticket and get anything restored. Read what you pay for carefully.\nThe veteran players of Eve Online consider the game a game for elite gamers and the attitude can be felt easily on the forums. In the game the attitude is mostly friendly. However, they expect those, who want to continue playing the game after trial, to put effort and time in learning the game properly.\n\nThose, who want to play it right now\nGo for it if you have a buddy in a corporation that does a lot of PvP. You are likely to participate in fights from day one. You will lose your ships a lot but the corporation is supposed (ask whether your corporation does it) to reimburse newbie ships since they don’t cost much for veteran players unless you lose the ships in particularly stupid ways.\nGo for it if you are reading the text much time later and the game has improved by a lot. The things I’ve learned about the new industry UI in Eve Online in summer 2014 is a promise of a better future.","June 14, 2014","false","207.7"," 575 of 758 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","575","758","0","14"

If you're a jerk, you'll like this game. It's tailored so that you get ahead by being a jerk to everyone. It's like a simulation of real life. That being said, I love this game, I'm just not enough of a jerk. I would call them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but steam censors that word.\n\nHere's my experience:\n\n-Learned the controls. They were super complicated which I loved. It takes a long time to get used to moving your ship around in combat and shooting. It takes a lot of know-how to fit a ship well, either through experimentation, or through reading a wiki. Deliciously complex.\n\n-Did missions to get money. Easiest way to make money in the beginning that I found. Doing combat missions nets quite a bit of money, not to mention the salvage operation you can do on the corpses of ships.\n\n-Got enough money to buy a good mining vessel. It wasn't huge, but it did the job well.\n\n-Grinded mining 'till I could afford the big boy. The massive mining barge. Yeah!\n\n-First day of mining, ship got blowed up. In high-sec. (If you don't know what high-sec is, it stands for high-security. Basically, if you attack someone or are attacked unlawfully, NPC controlled police ships called the CONCORD will come in, rather quickly, and blow the attacking ship into dust.) Appearently, this is a common thing. I looked it up, it's called suicide ganking. People outfit a ship to be strong enough to take down an expensive mining vessel quickly enough before the CONCORD get on them. The only goal is to destroy something that's more expensive than what you lose in the suicide gank. If you do that, you win.\n\n-Right after the suicide gank, the guy who killed me sent me a message. He said I was guilty of inattentive mining and mining without a "permit," and if I didn't want other "accidents" to happen to my ship in his company's "territory", I should log online and pay his company some unreasonably high amount of ISK (in-game money) monthly. Say what you want, but this sounds like the mafia to me. The company that produces this game will do nothing, absolutely nothing, not a damn thing about these people. They simply allow it to happen. I refuse to play a game that supports the mafia.\n\nThis game is amazing. I love it. So much fun. 'Till you meet a jerk or a group of jerks. And trust me, it'll happen. This is NOT an isolated incident.\nEvE - Jerks = Best Game Ever Made\nEvE + Jerks/Mafia = Garbage\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI've gotten a lot of flak for this review, and everyone says the same thing over and over again in the comments: "Don't fly what you can't afford to lose." "That's just the way the game is." "Stop sobbing over PvP." "Don't take it personally." "What a nub." Or they end up giving me some arbitrary advice on how to play the game *properly*. I really wish people would read the comments previously placed before adding their own, so that they'd realize what they want to say has already been said.\n\nYeah, I know that's the way the game is played, and I don't like it. That's why this is a negative review. It's my personal account of the game and WHY I don't like it.\n\nThis is neither the first time nor the last time I was screwed over in the game, this is just the one that I remember the most vividly and pisses me off the most.\n\nThis review isn't for the elites who know the in's and the out's of the game, it's for those who wish to start the game right now. The elites know the dangers of the game and know how to deal with and avoid them, but they also know how to screw you over. They know the loopholes in the rules such as the one described in this review. I posted this review to warn new players of the dangers the elite will thrust upon you. I warn you to either tell you to stay away from this game entirely, or be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥ again and again and again.

So, why the non-recommendation?\n\nBecause this game is at the point to where now it takes months/years to do anything that has any impact on the living universe. You can have your own little fun doing small missions and mining ore and killing AI, which really is all fun and immersive, but the fact of the matter is that if you come into this game now, you're already too late and the train has left the station a long time ago.\n\nThe main reason I don't recommend this game is because of the leveling system. "Skills" aren't necessarily skill-based (though you will need to practice various ship "maneuvers"), but merely time spent on downloading knowledge into your mainbrain (a la Matrix) so that your clone can use different ships or weapons. The higher the skill, the longer the wait, the better the payoff.\n\nI stopped my subscription after realizing that maxing out the ships and guns that I wanted to play would take about 3 years. Granted, the ships, guns, and modules that I wanted to use were more advanced, but as a gamer and as someone who enjoys stacking numbers in my favor, I didn't like the fact that I would have to play sub-par until my abilities were maxed out. Nevermind if I had any skill with a ship or was clever at manipulating the market; because of the lack of maxed skills in my prefered style of play, I wouldnt' do as well.\n\nIf I had joined this game five or six years ago, I might feel a little differently, but after investing eight months into the game (two months just to get the slightest idea of what I would have wanted to/could do), I realized that taking so much time to make any kind of impact on the community as a player (not as a person, as I've met some very nice people along the way) wasn't very attractive to me.\n\nAll in all, as a game, I loved my time in EVE online. I might have even stayed if there was a cockpit. The complexity of ship loadouts, the vastness of space, the epicness of battles (that I've never participated in), the realistic flow of economy, it all coalesces into a great experience...for someone who was there to board the train early.","July 22, 2014","false","731.3"," 423 of 568 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","423","568","2","23"

Or you can join PvP corporation and join them in glorious battles of thousands ships. Or you can explore EVE's universe by yourself. Or you can play EVE for years and never fly, because you like trading in stations. Or... Well, there are too many things you can do in this game, I won't list them all. The game is subscription-only (you should pay every month, which is actually good, because it filters some bad players). But there is 14-days free trial or you can ask another player to give you 21-days trial. Once you know what to do, you can get money in-game and buy PLEX (1 month of game time) with in-game money.

Instead of experience points; you get a point every second which gets multiplied by whatever your attributes are. You can use a rare remap to change your attributes to learn certain things faster than others because so many different skills require different attributes to level up faster.

I'm playing because of the corp I'm in.\n\nEVE has several huge problems :\n\n- It's very complex. You'll need 2-3 month to have a correct understanding  of  what can be done in the game (and there will still be huge points you won't  know about). Production,  Mining, Research  for T1 (material/time efficiency), Research for T2, Planetary Interraction, Exploration, Wormholes, Escalation, Incursions, Factionnal Warfare, Corp/alliance war, PvE and PvP  combat, ...  Don't expect to jump in the 2 weeks "trial" and have any correct idea of what EVE is\n\n- Skill learning is REAL TIME based. On some points, it's good, you don't need to grind your skills. On the other hand, it'll take months to get decent skills, years to get good skills and you will probably never pilot one of those top-level ships (Titans).  The skill system make sure that early players will keep the  upper hand.\n\n- To  make it worse, at a time, you could get Tech 2 Blueprints that could be used endlessly (BPO). Now, CCP switched to limited use Blueprints (BPC) that you've to research... this is great... except that they didn't remove the BPO giving once more a big advantage to older players...\n\n-  To make a better use of blueprints (use less time and materials to produce them), you've to research them. It  takes much time (to max up a Frigate (the smaller ship) blueprint, you'll need more than a month (2x19 days).  Again,  older players have their blueprints maxxed (maybe using less time that you'll need) which means that you'll never be as competitive on the market (except if you concentrate on smaller items)\n\n- Besides Mining and Planetary Interraction, there is a 3rd kind of ressource needed : Moon materials. Nearly all the moons that produce these are controlled by some mega-alliances which make them out of reach except by buying them (at an artificially high price) on the market. While the first materials can't be monopolized, the third one is quite limited...\n\n- Speaking of Powerblocks... the game is controlled by some big powerblocks (big alliances)... which are quite closed... you've nearly no chance to join these which means that your impact in game will be quite limited...\n\n- To begin the game, you've some assets (starter mission grant you a few ships and skillbooks, which is better than when the game began)... but to begin to really play, you'll need much ISK. Advanced skillbooks are expensive, same for advanced ships and equipment... which means that you'll have to grind for ISK in the beginning... Either by mining or by doing  PvE missions...\n\n-  When you're killed, you join a new clone... Except that any implant in your former  clone are lost. You'll probably need at least 2 clones, one for learning skills (with expensive +4/+5 implants)  and one for fighting (with no  or inexpensive implants)... To be able to create that second clone, you'll need to grind your reputation (standing) with one NPC corporation... which takes time.\n\nAs you can see, there is an huge unbalance between older and newer players.... one that can never be negated (when you learn new skills, so do them, add to this advantages like the T2 BPO, Blueprint research,... As long as these are not addressed, I could *not* recommend this game to new players.\n\nIf you still want to play, here is a few recomendations :\n- complete fully the  beginner's missions\n- you will be able to find several places in your part of the galaxy with the same beginner's missions... this'll give you some more ships/standing/ISK which will  help you much in the beginning\n- take some time mining with your Venture (you'll get it with the beginner's missions) in 1.0 or 0.9 systems (no rogue NPC) with some extra mining drones (mining->5, drones->5, these will always be useful)\n- at the beginning, think about "generic" skills (Spaceship command,  Hull upgrades, Mechanics, Repair Systems, CPU Management, Electronics Upgrades, Powergrid Management, Weapon Upgrades, Navigation, Warp Drive Operation, Afterburners, Cybernetics (3 or 4  in the beginning), Shield Operation, Shield Management, Diplomacy,  Social, Target management, signature analysis, long range targetting,trade,...) These will be useful  whichever way  you choose to follow (Mining, PvE,  PvP, Exploration, Distribution, Trading,...) as these will increase your survavibility in space, help you fitting modules on your ship and unlock a lot of other skills\n- stick  to one kind of ship : Minmattar, Gallente, Amarr or Caldari and one kind of weapon (Projectile, Hybrid, Laser or Missiles). You'll have time to learn the other one later\n- only fly what you can afford to lose... Each time you  get out of the station with  a ship, you may lose it... To an NPC, to a pirate gank (even  in High Sec), ...\n- Unless you're into  PvP, use implants +3 or +4  to  boost your skill learning (some mission will give you implants as rewards)\n- Choose your faction... Don't do missions for Caldari/Amarr if you have chosen Gallente/Minmatar.  Try  to grind a 8.0 standing to your favorite NPC corporation (make sure it has medical facilities) so you can create a jumpclone...\n- DON'T USE YOUR BONUS REMAP (well, wai for about 1 year before remapping, more bellow)\n\nAfter 6-7 month (minimum) and WHEN  YOU'RE SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, begin to plan your first remap. Most skills are likely to be Intelligence/Memory or Perception/Willpower. Your remap will allow to max out Intelligence or Perception, to get a decent value for memory or Willpower and reduce the other to lowerr values... So, choose which remap you'll do (ships/weapons => Perception/Willpower, production/research/electronic warfare/drones/... => Intelligence/Memory).\n\nWhen you've chosen your remap, only train the skill that use the other characteristics. For example, if you decided to remap Per/Will, train Int/Mem... keep in mind that you'll keep your remap for months (matbe a full year)... this will be 5-6 month training before the remap... after the remap, only train skills related to the remap.\n\nDON'T JUMP  TO  BIGGEST SHIPS.  Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser/BattleCruiser,  Small/Medium weapons, only T1 ships (you may use some T2 modules, forget about faction/deadspace/... modules).  These will require  less time for the skills and are less expensive.\n\nAnd, try to find a good corporation. Avoid the "gankers pirates", they'll lead you nowhere  and there are plenty of good PvE/PvP corporations. Don't fall to these "lotteries" scams or to the racketteers... Fly safe.","December 31, 2014","false","110.8"," 314 of 433 people (73%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","73","314","433","25","15"

I ran missions, explored wormhole space, station trading, Industry, PI, and mining.  However, I quit because this game is very focused on the sadistic side of human behavior.  You cannot prevent someone from killing you and taking all of your hard earned stuff.  You can avoid being killed for a short time but eventually you will be eaten by the bigger fish.  This is what they don’t tell you - this game needs new blood so that the bigger fish can consume you.  As a new player you are constantly flying around in fear of being cannibalized by others.  I can understand that you are better than me and you caught me and you destroyed my ship.  However, it doesn’t stop there.  After your ship is destroyed they Pod you (and they really don’t have to do this) and you have to start all over again.  The worst part is that people are constantly trying to scam you.  They say they want to help you but in the end they take advantage of you.  This is completely allowed - The game developers say this is the beauty of the sandbox mode.  I say it is “Lord of the Flies” in space.  A bunch of kids on a deserted island and all hell breaks loose.\n\nSandbox mode?  Don’t think so.  How can this be a sandbox game when you are limited to where you can go, and do, as a solo pilot?  Yes, a few good people exist but you can’t trust anybody.  I live this in real life why would I want to spend my recreational time doing this?\n\nFinal note:  The game developers (CCP)  have given-up on trying to resolve the new player retention problem.  CCP releases updates that only cater to veteran players - nothing to aid the new player.  The updates aid or assist the bitter vets complaints against null-sec or capital ship issues.  CCP has given up on fixing the tutorials.  They would rather have the existing players tutor the new players.  The problem is this is one of the worst MMO communities around - just read the forums.","April 4, 2014","false","591.2"," 365 of 508 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","365","508","0","29"

No doubt about that.\n\nBut the problem with Eve itself is, that it may offer a ton of things you can do but the main problem is that it will take you a long time to really get started into something. The things you can do or make are massive, but considering the fact that the skill system is time based, you may only concentrate on one thing(for example: mining) and have to stay with it as something different will take a long time to be efficient or even -fun-.\n\nAnd speaking of fun, this game is only something for work-a-holics. Things to do take a long time, even plain traveling and there is not a lot you can do while it. If you want to have fun by blowing up other people or make money you will have to literally work for it and I mean this in terms of waiting, waiting and calculating.\n\nTo skip those waiting processes or do tasks that are meant for multiple persons, people tend to buy multiple accounts and to keep them alive, you either need to A) purchase gametime or B) farm several hours (maybe 10-20 with GOOD skills) to get a plex.\n\nThe combat system is slow and this is intended as this game will set you up with people around the globe. But to be honest, there is not a lot of how you can influence the combat with your own skill. What counts are simple decisions and Skills in term of In-game idled skills.\n\nSo if you really want to play Eve consider taking a lot of time or money to be efficient. And if you want to get out in 0.0, keep in mind that you probably will just end as a 'fighting drone' for some Alliance.\n\n\n","December 20, 2013","false","102.5"," 223 of 317 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","223","317","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agrobal/recommended/8500/","Agrobal","Agrobal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agrobal/","657 products in account","After a year of being abused by many players and pirates, I think it is time to write a detailed review or an impression of the psychological rollercoaster I went through.\n\nEve Online is identical to real life in my opinion. You are thrown in there with little to no instructions. The learning curve is tough. You could end up mining for a guild, oh ♥♥♥♥. I called it a guild, you might be shunned if you call them guilds in this game, they are called corps. Where was I? Oh yeah, you could end up working for a corp as a miner to get the ship you wanted after a very long time in the safest spot or you could end up being a pirate hunting the same miners you could have been. It most likely depends on your skills and how much time you are willing to dedicate to such a game. Why do I say that? Learning skills takes real time as opposed to game time. Skills would start building up in your queue from 3 Hours to months of real time. In case you read this far and you are wondering if it is a casual MMO, no it is not. It is rather hardcore and this is coming from someone who is not all that familiar with MMOs. Anyways, just like I said, you could ultimately do whatever you want to do in this game. Planetary exploration and material extraction, piracy, logistics, Mining, whatever. It sounds very exciting initially but it takes a really long time and money and effort. All that effort can go down the drain however. If your ship gets destroyed, all those upgrades you have spent time and blood and sweat on would go away in a heartbeat, but that's not remotely all of it. Your character's pod is thrown into space and you have to get your pod to the nearest space station to find another ship before someone destroys your pod and... Well, your character dies and loses all those skills you spent real life time on. I am repeating myself with the real life time because it is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrating.\n\nI honestly didn't expect myself to get into a game like this, I didn't expect to get into it for a long time. I rarely enjoyed it but it was like staring at pandora's box from afar, it seems so interesting your curiosity gets the better of you and well... You spend 100+ hours into it getting into more than one corps the same way you apply to a job. Perhaps even more humiliating. Getting into a corp is not easy, they interview you, sometimes skype you and assess if you are the man/woman for the position. It almost sounds crazy, and I assure you, it is when you end up hearing about people being humiliated in chat rooms filled with at least 200 players that watch a man get naked on webcam to get a position in a corp. That's how it is in the world of EVE, it sounds really interesting from afar just like the notorious battle that had thousands of players pit against each other, but when you actually get into it, you want to leave and never come back.\n\nPerhaps I got one good thing out of it. The love of Ambient music. A year ago, I was never a fan of music that fades into the background and helps you concentrate. EVE's soundtrack is full of that. It helps the players enjoy their sweet time digging into their menus for countless of hours to EVE's soundtrack. It was well engineered to the point where you feel lonely and it is scary out there when you are traveling and expect a pirate to strike you down even in the safest spots. Ironically, the first time I encountered an NPC drone, I thought it was a pirate and panicked and abandoned my ship only to find out later that it was part of the mission.\n\nI don't think I have anything specific in my review regarding the technicalities of EVE, but I was just surprised and my expectations have been greatly exceeded by what I saw there, and I was sure it was not for me. At the same time, all I can write here are my impressions. I finally left the game after realizing it was inevitable for me especially after a pirate corp threatened the mining corp I was in. I actually stayed with that cop for about a month or so, and it was newly formed. Later on when the pirate corp threatens it, members of my mining corp started arguing and all I could do was observe. I was a spectator the whole time and it was, admittedly enjoyable to see my own corp's members argue and argue until some of them left and it went down the drain. It's just so amazing how things could change ther-- YOUR SPACESHIP IS BEING ATTACKED,WAT? YOUR GUN IS FROZEN, YOUR SHIELD HAS BEEN JAMMED.... WHY?

There is PVE in the game, but the developer has no sympathy for you if you want to pursue this aspect of the game. If you want to play the PVE part of the game, even in high sec space where you are protected by NPC "police" (aka CONCORD), you are going to be fodder for clever players who work around the broken systems that supposedly protect you. Because CONCORD is currently broken, high sec space is full of suicide gankers, griefers, etc. Some sociopaths in the game prey on newbies for kicks despite this supposedly being a bannable offense if it occurs in "newbie" systems. I have reported a bunch of players for doing this and never seen any bans resulting from it. CCP just doesn't give a damn.\n\nLow sec space is full of gankers and pirates. Null-sec space is dominated by a single Alliance. The developer has actually been caught clandestinely helping certain Alliances in the game. Considering how much Alliance equipment, stations, ships, etc is worth if their ISK (the in-game currency) cost were translated into real life dollars, the developer helping an Alliance destroy others is unforgiveable.\n\nBecause of the skill point system where skill points generate over time with no way to accelerate them other than juggling your stats it takes a very long and tedious amount of time to develop a character, and you will be very weak compared to veteran players with no way to ever catch up. Sure, you can specialize, but it still takes months and months and you are fodder in the interim.\n\nUnless you like tedious boredom (e.g. mining, manufacturing), being ganked or you are a hardcore PVPer or social miscreant itching to vent your sociopathic impulses on others, EVE is not the game for you.","December 8, 2015","false","476.3"," 444 of 679 people (65%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","65","444","679","91","47"

It's one of the most boring and "unfair" PvP games out there. The way you "level up" is by training skills, these skills can range from 4 minutes at level 1 to 60 DAYS at level 5 (max level) and with hundreds of skills to train, to get all skills maxed out can literally take 15-20 YEARS, that's real life time, not in game time.  The point is, if you come in the game tomorrow and want to get straight into PvP action, you will lose to ANYONE who has been playing even a day longer than you, let alone those people who have been playing for 5+ years. That being said, you can avoid PvP if you just follow some guidelines that helpful people have put out there, like don't transport anything too valuable, or don't use a weak but expensive ship and so on.\n\nSpeaking of transportation, let me paint a picture for you. You spend 1 week with 5 accounts mining a particular system, you compress all your ore, it earns you about 3 Billion ISK (Currency in game). You transport this ore, a small group of pirates are guarding a gate, see you come through, they scan your cargo and open fire.... You just lost a weeks worth of work and money just for playing the game.\n\nNow some people enjoy this type of gameplay. I for one do NOT. It's no different than you going to your job everyday, and at the end of every week, you get robbed for your paycheck and you go home empty handed. Or if you're one of those WoW players, imagine permanently losing all your gear everytime you get killed. So BEWARE: You consent to this when you play the game. Luckily I'm smarter than 90% of the people that play and have never been "ganked" and lost all my stuff... PAY FOR TRANSPORT PEOPLE lol.\n\nAnyway, if you have LOTS of time on your hands, and don't mind risking what you play for, then jump into it, it CAN be fun, otherwise, there are MUCH better games out there.\n\n*EDIT*\nAfter reading some other reviews, I also wanted to point out, this game is NOT as complex as everyone "thinks" it is, it takes a bit of time to learn how to travel, the "tutorial"system is virtually nonexistant, and you could be clueless as to how to move your ships, but believe me, after doing it a couple times, it's easy. There is very little to nothing complicated about this game and requires very little brain activity to learn. As long as you have the slightest bit of logic, it's simplistic.... which makes me worry about a very large portion of the EVE community who thinks this game is difficult or complicated.\n\n*EDIT#2*\nPeople have left messages and comments complaining about the "complexity" or "non-complexity" statement I made in this review. If you're unhappy with my review, downvote it. If you're a EVE fanboy and are so butthurt that you have to attack my profile, downvote. If you have a double digit IQ and can't understand EVE, and this forces you to make comments on my profile, play a different game, I hear World of Warcraft is a simple man's game.","December 3, 2015","false","490.9"," 201 of 312 people (64%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","64","201","312","60","0"

This means two things to new players. There is no possible way to catch up to older players. And there is almost no player verses environment content. Eve is a massive PVP game with players either engaging in or supporting PVP battles or conflict. If you are not in pvp then there is mining, exploration, trading and production. All of these are to support the pvp battles. As a new player you will have no chance of success in pvp on your own.\n\n\nEve's real-time leveling system means you don't have to play to level your character. It also means you can not speed up your characters training. Because of this, as a new player, you will not be able to defend yourself against an older players attack or go pvp solo. This doesn't seem like too much of a problem at first because there is almost no new player training. So, you will be spending most of your time trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics and finding the limited training available in game. In the mean time your character will be leveling skills that your not sure are right. However, there will be players chatting you up willing to teach you and even more players recruiting into corporations aka guilds. I would suggest you lean heavy on youtube videos for your game mechanics training. There are many to choose from some much better than others.\n\n\nThe answer the players and I guess the GMs have come up with for the new player pvp problem is that you join a corporation and be cannon fodder. It works like this. You equip your rookie ship with a device that can hold a player of any level or experience in place and then your "friends" warp in and make the kill. You will be killed for sure. But, that's all you can do and will be able to do for quite a while because of the training system. That's it there is nothing else you can do in the pvp area.\n\n\nThat leads to the other roles in the game. Mining, exploring, trading and production can be done solo. You will need to train these areas to be any good at all and that takes real time. This is where those videos come in handy. You can watch them while you character is leveling. "that's what I did and still do from time to time" There are also help chat channels where you can get ok advice and better resource information like what website has the trade info you can't get in game.\n\n\nThe game has a lot to offer and leaves a lot to be desired. Like the lack of PVE content. There really isn't any pve content except for the professions trainers and the profession agents. They have about ten different missions at each level and they are the same no matter what race or corporation you get them from. Doing missions gets you loyalty points that are only good where you earn them. They get boring very quickly because you have to repeat the same missions quite a bit to earn enough points to get anything good.\n\nIf your looking for a good PvE game then look somwhere else. If your looking for a good craft / farming/ grnding game its not to bad. If your looking for a PvP game to invest a lot (several months depending on how fast you figuer out what skill are needed) of time waiting for your character to level skills and trying to figure out the game itself then I guess it would be worth it.\n\nThey say Eve is a niche game and I guess thats true. Alot of the players have spent years trying to develope their characters and don't want the game to change. The developers have done just that.\n\nThis is a post quote from a  long time player concerning the PvE side of the game. I thought  it should be added. I dont know how long it would take to get to this point but, after the initial rookie missions grinding you can do what is described below.\n\n"1: Do missions for one of the thousands of agents in the high security systems, earning money for better equipment, rising from level 1 agents up to level 4 agents as time passes.\n2: Do exploration, finding areas of interrest in the galaxy, and trying your best to exploit those areas for things to sell back at a starbase.\nMind you, there are other things to do, but these two things are what I would define as action oriented Content in Eve.\nAt some point during these first weeks or months, you start to figure out that there are a few more things to do, which would be the Eve equivalent of "end game content".\n1: Level 5 missions, which is group oriented missions, using the same approach as level 1 through 4. An analogue would be "dungeons".\n2: Incursions, which is a system wide alert, as a pirate faction moves in, locks down a system, and tries to kill everything. These Incursions will spawn areas in the system which are geared for anything between a few pilots working together, to dozens of pilots.\nThe equivalent would be "raids".\n3: Wormholes. These are systems "off the grid" so to speak, with combat (and exploration and mining) quite a bit harder than what you would find in normal space. You could compare these to "Elite areas" in other games.\nKeep in mind, none of what you do in Eve can be truly classified as PvE, since at any time, you can meet other players with hostile intent. It is like playing on a "PvP Server", with no safe zones."","August 23, 2015","false","239.0"," 82 of 117 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","82","117","3","0"

Where to begin?..........To be honest, there isn't a good place to start. The game is huge. The amount of things you can do are almost endless. Wanna go inside a wormhole and take your luck against the rats? Good luck. Go exploring in uncharted space? sure. Attend a high pitched battle consisting of 700 odd players because someone threw a fit over rights to a moon? If you're in the right alliance, go right ahead.\nIn the 13 years that EVE has been around, players have made history in the world of gaming, from the largest battle ever created, to some jackass diverting a force three times the size of his own in order to save a 4,000$ titan. The reason why these things happen is because of the complexity of the game. There are a 150 odd ships to choose from, hundreds of ways to fit each one, and the best part is, they're diverse. There're mining ships, ratting ships, PVP, exploration, capitals, and each one is bonused towards it's intended role. There's politics that affect each player. Recently there was (and still is) a war between an alliance called goonswarm and thier allies, and everyone else. The npc empire Amarr just hosted games in an effort to find the next heir to the throne, after their empress got killed by enemy ships. What I'm trying to say is that EVE is essentially a living, breathing universe. There is absolutely no reason why you'd get bored.\nAlright, so are there some negatives? Yeah, a few, at least in my opinion. First things first, the learning curve is steep. Like, Mt. Everest steep. It might take a few days to get the hang of it, but there're people that'll help you. There's a help channel where your questions will be answered. That's probably the greatest thing about eve: the community is the most mature audiance I've ever been a part of. Another negative is the fact that you have to have certain skills to operate certain ships/moudules. All told, EVE has about 20 years (give or take) worth of skills. It'll limit you in the early stages of the game. Not by a lot, but it will.\nOverall, this game is outstanding. There is no other game like it. Elite Dangerous doesn't even come close. If you can afford 15 dollars a month, I'd recommend it. Also, don't forget the 14 day free trial.","May 1","true","718.7"," 56 of 75 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","56","75","0","0"

jump - align - burn towards - dock' this is it, all the manuevers, travelling across the space needs some serious rework because it is kinda dull in current state.\n\neveryone fly the same ships, there is no customization because if there was one CCP couldnt sell their 'XYZ edition' ships at AUR store (there is some signs from CCP about this case, this may change)\n\nfitting the ships are kinda open to imagination but it just doesnt cut it, because when i undock my ship is just one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vexors out there going to do the same frigging thing over and over again, ratting belts doing sites is boring, seriously it doesnt feel like PVE, it just feels blank.\n\nPVP is boring as well, there is our Fleet Commander Yells-A-Lot(big fleet fatty) , 'do this do that and kaboom because i ♥♥♥♥♥ up' you will feel like a drone in fleets mark my words, just a ♥♥♥♥♥ drone, you cant do solo pvp oh no sir you cant do nothing if you are alone, because the loneliest guy at eve will be flying with his alts multiboxing the shet out of the game meanwhile you try to do rat belts on your own.\n\ni know a lot of veterans, some were there when eve was born, and they are all saying the same thing, pvp was much more nicer before, 4-5 years back.\n\npeople who thinks he's a scammer but merely all he does is 'send me isk i'll send you back double xd' , market orders asking 60 million for 1 tech one drone luring people to missclick, hauling contracts which asks billions and billions isk as 'insurance' but pays a few million at the end(mostly you will get blown up just for that colleteral, much more profit that way)\n\nidiot people who cant just understand the fact that game is broken and this ♥♥♥♥ needs to be fixed.\n\ni am not shtting at eve's face, i am trying to point out facts instead of waiting at dark corners in silence, murmuring with others 'eve needs new blood sush let them come', if you start playing this is what you gonna get.\n\nthere may be some points flawed with my review, but these are just harsh facts that i encountered, feel free to point out where do you think im wrong.\n\ni can see CCP is trying to sort things out,  but i dont think CCP is in full control of eve.\n\nafter CCP admits 'multiboxing(isboxing) is hacking(which they kinda did) and goons/griefers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s(still the golden boys of eve) and mittani(may god have mercy on his soul) is not someone who must be respected - just a piece of shet and they did some wrong moves with the game in their past and they want to lower the price of PLEX(way too high in current state) until the game evolves to something better' , i will gladly edit this review.\n\nsome of the things i complained about may be nice for you, or some of the things i love about the game may be gamebreaking for you, it really depends on the person, rule number one at eve is 'adapt' , so if you can you will be able to do what you like in eve, if you cant then you will suffer.\n\njust try the 21 day trial and decide for yourself, research the game before you get in to it, there is a high chance you will like what you see but suffer in the first couple of months, after 5-6 months you will feel that you can do much more then before.\n\nRHEA EDIT:  im giving EVE and CCP a 'secret' thumbs up, things are getting better and you gotta know you cant find anything like eve anywhere, it is unique.\n\nless glitter would be reaaal nice though, i feel like barbie.","November 9, 2014","false","387.7"," 288 of 459 people (63%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","63","288","459","31","46"

There are players in this game that will try to take advantage of you so beware. Fly around, shoot things, dock.

Training in this game takes a LONG time, especially with the high-end skills, they're also very exspensive.\n\nThe recent gate animations that CCP put in are just plain ugly.

Eve online to Eve Steam online, this I have found be very odd thing, Eve online support service I found to be VERY FRIENDLY but when say your steam user thing can get abit confusing.

There are many reviews out there that will give you a sense of what you can expect of the game, so I will spend my time detailing some useful pointers to those who are considering playing the game for the first time.\n\nOne thing I have to get out of the way:\n______________________________\nDo NOT buy any of the 'add ons' you see advertised on Steam. Anyone with experience in the game can tell you that the items they give you in the add ons are not in any way special, and even a newbie can afford these items fairly easily with money you earn in game.\n\nAlso: know that if you create an account through steam you will not be able to take advantage of buying and selling characters on that account. This is not an issue for newer players but once you are wealthy enough to be buying characters you may find it an annoyance.\n______________________________\n\nSo some advice if you do decide to pull the trigger and join EVE:\n\n- Do not consider mining as a career. It is an acceptable and easy way to make small sums of money as a new pilot, but does not lead to the type of glorious and engaging gameplay that makes EVE so incredible. Too many newbies pidgeon hole themselves into mining, this either ends in extreme boredom or unsubbing the game.\n\n- Sure when you begin the game you will have to spend some time training skills and it may be a bit boring in that initial month. Do a bit of research, join a decent looking corp that does something other than mining, and have fun. This game pays off immensely for those who are patient and persistent.\n\n- Do not look at the capital ships and be discouraged it will take you 120 days to fly them. This is not a game where bigger is always better. The biggest ships in the game are very limited in their practical use, there is tons of fun to be had in all sizes of ships.\n\n- Try to avoid the temptation to spend money on PLEX to buy ships you can't afford, this just makes it hurt that much more when you lose them. You will lose ships, you will feel bad when your pride and joy is destroyed. The fact that you can lose almost anything you have is a big part of what makes the game so compelling.\n\n- If you find yourself unhappy with what you are doing or the corporation you are flying with: do something different! Join a new corp! There are TONS of different things you can do in this game, and there are groups of people out there who specialize in all of these various activities. Joining the right group can make the difference between playing for a month and unsubbing, or being happy to play the game for years.\n\n- If something sounds too good to be true, it is. There are many scammers in the game, anyone offering to double your money is one of them.\n\n- Do not think you are perfectly safe if you are in high security space. People willing to sacrifice their ship can still attack you. They will be dealt with by the NPC Police, but they will still be able to destroy you before that happens. Always be on your guard.\n\n- Do not try to play this game solo. As an individual you can have an impact on the game, but you will probably not have much success trying to do it alone. Again, the social aspect of this game is a big part of its draw and having a great group of people around you to share in your successes and failures is really what makes the game so fun.\n\nI could go on, but in short: if you like spaceships and the idea of joining a game where your ability to succeed and make your mark in the universe is only limited by your ambition then EVE is definitely for you. You will experience crushing defeats, and glorious triumphs. All of it in a universe completely run by players in a way that will amaze you more and more as you play the game.","February 5, 2015","true","696.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

I might still tell them it's interesting but it is time consuming (almost like a second job) and many of the other players like to grief players who mine and do pve. They call it "collecting tears" and it fuels their sociopathic tendendies to blow up other players minding their own business (like mining). Then there are some others like a group called "CODE" that employ mafia tactics and force players to pay them to mine in systems. They are some of the most delusional and sociapathic people you will meet in any game, because they "gank" blow up anyone not paying them and call it "justice".  There are many others like this that will blow you up for no reason and call it "fun"\nSkills also take a long time to train and there is no quick way to make money in the game unless you scam people, which is another "accepted" thing in Eve. Some players  harassed another player in real life to the point of a breakdown and they recorded the entire thing for a laugh but sadly no criiminal charges were pressed and the offending player is still playing.

EVE Online is not for the immature audience. Though the immature type has been known to find a place in the circlejerk of griefers and gankers that is found in New Eden, it is those with true-life skills in leadership, strategy, distribution, espionage, intelligence, diplomacy, education, industry, and philanthropy that make up the bulk of the universe.\n\nAnd it is THE universe - a single server full of hundreds of thousands of players spread across thousands of star systems.

I say involved, as I did not spend that entire 10 years playing. It was more like one of those bad relationships where you know you're not compatible, but the action is so good you always go back for more. The emails always come, and I always read the latest goss... I'm not playing but I was certainly invested.\n\nI can do nothing but recommend it... However, there is a catch.\n\nThe reviews are generally accurate.\nIt is like working. Some people like to work alone (very dull), some people like me need co-workers. Find the right group of co-workers and you'll have a blast!\nBut it is work. You will be finding the most time effective way of making coin, you will assess every activity for its ISK/hour return, and weighing up the risk. Sometimes that only gets interesting when you are about to loose the lot, the adrenaline starts pumping, your heart bursting out of your chest as you mash the warp button.\nIt is brutal. People will kill you simply for the taste of your tears (nothing brought me more joy than reading some poor souls ranting on local after we totally fry him for no reason - hilarious).\nAnd it WILL steal your soul. If you like the game, the people you play with, and you have some goals and ideas, you will think of nothing else.\n\nThe shear scale of the game is amazing; nothing comes close to the variation of ships, ship loadouts and variations, skills and 'professions'. You can be anything you want to be, and here in lies the rump. Trying to decide what the hell you want to do.\nIn the early days, everything was new and developing. You would pull a group of people together to help roll off our first battleships off the line. It was a big achievement as a group, and we were stoked. We saw the first IPO in game. Was then we people tried to create the first open and friendly null-sec space, with its own military and police (didn’t work). There were plenty of original ideas out there, you just needed the creativity and drive to do it.\nThings are a little more 'mature' these days, big alliances owning vast swathes of space, with vast epic capital fleets going into battle. It’s kinda hard to make a difference in a world like this. Not impossible, just a little harder. That and things like the new ship ‘skins’ aesthetic changes, with no game play value, seem to just cheapen the whole thing…\n\nThis is not a casual game. You will sink hours, days and weeks into this game, sometimes with little reward.\nIf you find the right people, you can sink those hours together and talk smack whilst your doing it - fun times.\n\nIf you have any sort of life, this game is not for you.\n\nWith a busy job, demanding wife, and a bouncy wee baby I knew I couldnt put the time into this game to do it justice- you're looking for a quick cheap thrill, and Eve cant give it.\nI had to go cold turkey, I gave away all my stuff, eliminated the reasons I might return, and uninstalled the game.\n\nI have now been 6 months without any Eve... is that a free weekend I see?","May 6","true","1.3"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","40","57","13","0"

The new player experience is flat out horrible: I kid you not, you create your character, you log in, and you find yourself in the middle of space in a small ship. That's it. Go, do your thing. Well, thanks for nothing! Yes, the "opportunities" windows will keep popping up on your HUD, but that just makes matters even worse, since those are not coherent, proper tutorial missions, just a net of achievements, basically. The real tutorial missions slumber deep within the "help" menu, which you can lure out by pressing F12.\nF12. Seriously. The quests telling you the basics of how to get around in this massive universe are in a submenu of a menu, that can be opened by F12.\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg, and only a mere hint on how cumbersome and overwhelming the UI of this game is, to a point where a second display is almost a must. Somebody once said that this game is basically "Spreadsheets - The Game", and, well, that's what it is, really. Everything important is in tables, texts and numbers, an unholy amount of raw data and information; I swear you could play this game without graphics even being there, because you do everything by clicking on table rows. Even the combat, yes.\nThat's another problem of mine. If you want in on EVE for the combat, then leave now, because the combat in this game is somewhat similar to Planetside 2 in the sense of being a logistics battle instead of the battle of spacecrafts. You need a good fleet commander and do what he says, and get the right amount of ships to the right place in the right time, and that's that. It's not your skill of flying your ship what matters, but rather your skill to counter-fit your ship considering the strengths and weaknesses of your enemy. To further prove my point, you can see a lot of YT videos, where a guy fights the whole combat in his tactical overlay, which, at that point, becomes a real-time board game. Yellow dots moving to purple dots, purple dots moving to yellow dots, that's it. Does it still require skills? Yes. A lot of skills, in fact. It's just not what you'd expect, and possibly not what you want to do when you think about space combat. Probably that's where piracy comes into play, because that's a way to fight small scale fights, but without a proper manual control over your ship it's just not that exciting (yes, you don't have manual control over your ship, you approach enemy crafts by telling your ship to orbit them or keep them in range).\nOh, since we are talking about pirates and piracy, let's just mention that there are enitre corps, specializing in piracy, WHICH IS FINE! Seriously, this is a sandbox game, part of the fun is that players can be "bad". The problem is that the war declaration system (wardec, wardeccing, or deccing) is a piece of garbage. So what is wardec, exactly? It's a system that enables player corporations to declare war on another player corporation, meaning that they can do PvP combat even in hi-sec space, where otherwise CONCORD (EVE's NPC police) would brake up the fights and hunt down the aggressors. This sounds about OK, right? Nope. The price of a wardec in the game is about 50 M ISK. Now, to put that in context, when the game was new, a PLEX (Pilot License Extension, this is basically gametime in a box) costed about ~400 M. That means 20€ could buy you 8 war decs, right? Well, now you can sell PLEX for 1.2 BILLION, but the price of declaring war remains the same, which means that now 20€ gets you 24 wardecs. The result? Entire pirate corps (so-called "wardec corps") sit on trade hubs, wardeccing EVERY. LIVING. SOUL. This is like if you could, in real life, walk into the police station, give them a checque about $50, and in return they would grant your family the right to do whatever you want with another family. So how can you play around this? Well, either you and your corp move out of the trade hubs, or change regions (and believe me, hauling an entire corp to a whole other region is so fkn annoying), or you can pay the ransom, because yes, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s usually want ransom money to drop the wardec, which is usually 100 M ISK and up. That's basically a death sentence to a new corp, so that's a no-go either. So you either jump systems over and over and over and over and over again, like space gypsies, or make some trial accounts and have some hauling alts, who never leave NPC corps (those cannot be wardecced) and do the hauling between your corp's AO and the trade hub - not immersion braking, not at all, nah.\nAnd with that, I think we finally arrived to the whole cancer of the game: the lack of immersion. In EVE Online, you don't feel like playing a game. In EVE Online you feel like working a job. Hours and hours and hours of doing nothing but grinding, farming and running errands, fueled only by the hope of someday getting some enjoyment out of it in a form of a good ship or some nice equipment - meanwhile the market is filled with fake courier contracts, item exchange contracts and auctions, with which people are trying to trick you out of your hard earned money. The space is littered with space pirates, who are either some bored gamers looking for some fun, or actual horrible people, whose sole form of enjoyment is seeing you suffer; meanwhile decent guys roam around space like nomads, being chased and harrased. EVE is not a joyful ride in space, it's hell, a good example of what would happen if anarchy would overtake our current world; an apocalyptic wasteland, a man-eat-man universe, of which I want no further part.","January 31","false","314.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","20","23","5","0"

It has some of the best graphics and in-depth skill systems I have ever experienced, and has among the most intense player vrs player environments that can impact any level of game play.\n\nAlternatively, the game still is plagued with a slow skill progression where every player is stressed with how to make the best use of each of their 30 day subscriptions. Although the ability to "play for free" is a possibility players must invest both real time and real money, often times with multiple alternate accounts, to even come close to affording such things regularly. The harsh realism of space, and the hauntily similarities of the game to real life can make EVE online a "Real Job."\n\nIf a monthly-subscription simulation game with periods of dull conflict punctuated with infrequent mass conflict from a "Top-Down" real time strategic perspective is your thing then EVE Online can not be beat. Though the harsh reality and learning-"Cliff" of the game can be a detractor for many that can provide substantial sense of accomplishment for those who brave it.\n\nAs such, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, just those who I feel fit into the very selective audience that EVE Online has grown accostomed to over the years. For most, the game can come off cold and unforgiving, though for the others the game can be and is a true gem that is unlike any other.","January 31","false","186.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randerbobanders/recommended/8500/","randerbobanders","White Catholic Male","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randerbobanders/","160 products in account","This game is a special one. It isn't like anything else you will play. That is the most difficult point to get through the heads of newbros. It isn't something that can be explained, in a rewiew or otherwise. It is something that you must experience yourself, and truly experiencing this game will be something you will never forget. It has fascinating and intriguing politics(which you can be a part of), full-scale wars that last months, battles of literally titanic proportions that go down in the game's history(everyone who plays this game can tell you where they were during the bloodbath of B-R5RB), friendships forged through mutual loss and triumph together, and endless depth to every caveat of the game.\n\nYou will make friends that you'll never forget. You'll make enemies that you will always resent. You'll take losses that will leave permanent scars, while making gains that you will brag about for years. When you play this game, you will come out of it with stories so vivid, rich, and exciting that you could sit around a campfire and discuss the time "where you escorted a caravan of allied industrial players through nullsec space with your corpmates after weeks of careful planning", the time "where you set up a wormhole outpost with new-found friends only to be betrayed by your CEO and log in to a disapeared and looted base", that time where you "threw your most prized ship into a deadly skirmish in the futile hopes of just maybe saving your friend's ship worth billions of isk, while your corpmates do the same", any possibility is realistic. Anything can happen. Every player of EVE experiences his own story. Every single one of them is worthy of a best-selling novel.\n\nOnly EVE can make your heart race like never before and your hands shake from sheer excitement as you warp into a fight that has been built up to through weeks of political tension. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, I ♥♥♥♥ed up on my first fight and lost a ship I raised money for over a period of two months because I couldn't get my hands to stop shaking.\n\nThe negative reviews of this game are all results of the same thing - staying in the safety of hi-sec. Doing so will result in a chance of you only experiencing a very narrow and short-sighted part of the game without witnessing anything else. If you try this game, here is the golden rule: GET. OUT. OF. HI-SEC. DO NOT tell yourself that you will "get good first". There are plenty of very formidable alliances that will take you in on day one in null-sec, guiding you through your first months. Believe it or not, it is MORE difficult to get through the new player stage in hi-sec. Start looking at the sov map and researching alliances. Figure out who shares your morals and who you want to fight for. Get out there and get your story started! The key ingredient to this masterpiece of a game is the element of RISK. Don't avoid that. In other words, grow a ♥♥♥♥ing sack, and you'll have a great time!\n\nHere are some motivational videos and links for playing the game(and getting the ♥♥♥♥ to null) that may or may not give you a boner:\n\nTITANIC scale battles\nVideo capturing the scope of the battle\nVideo explaining the cause and implications of the battle\nThe battle of Asakai, you can hear fleet coms in this one\nImagine being there, in a battle with thousands of players. I want you to understand that this is not an example of      something that "only the top 1% of people who play the game" get to experience. This is something that people who go to null sec experience. In that battle, there are many other ships that you can't make out fighting alongside the capital ships. Even if you were not involved in the battle or not yet skilled enough to make a strategic difference--you would still be able to bring in a scout ship(look into training a cov ops frig at some point) and experience being in that battle. Everytime you hear a friend chirp in about EVE, and how that one big battle happened, you can say "yeah, I was there".\n\nImportant videos to see, in order to fully understand the depth of EVE politics\nFountain War\nA visual history of null-sec geopolitics\nThe butterfly effect\nEvery single movement on that sov timelapse has a rich story behind it. The Fountain War is just ONE of those stories. You CAN be a part of these stories, and you DO NOT have to train for years in order to do so. DO NOT let someone tell you otherwise, they are WRONG and I would love to invite them down to null-sec with me so I can change their minds.\n\nEVE trailers\nI'm making an honest review here, I'm not going to tell you that these trailers are like the real thing, but DAMN are they fun to watch. Here are my favorites. Watch these to get you on the HYPE TRAIN:\n\nFanfest trailer showcasing EVE<->Dust514 relations\nDominion\nTyrannis\nAnother trailer showcasing the interrelation between DUST514 and EVE\nThe prophecy\nAlthough it may be a while, the Prophecy trailer shows us what ccp wants to do with its universe--have players soldiers, player pilots, and player fighter pilots all fighting in the same battles. This is already very marginally achieved so far, with the ability for EVE players to provide orbital strikes to DUST514 fights.\nIf you would like a 21 day trial of the game(longer than normal trial!), follow this link.[secure.eveonline.com]\n\nIf you enjoy the game and buy the next month of time, I'll split my referall reward with you half and half. Right now, that would mean 600 million isk for you going into your second month. If you are going to take this route, add my character Vestigo Masefield in-game so I know what is happening. If you want, you could even come down to null and fight alongside me! If you think I am trying to extort you here, I'll be honest and say I don't currently possess the evidence to prove you wrong other than the fact that you won't find anyone in EVE who considers me a scammer(although I have been a victim myself). I'll leave the judgement up to you, but I give you my word--I do not stab people in the back, not even in EVE.","December 15, 2015","true","760.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

While massive wars over territory and resources do occur, along with other epicc occurances, they tend to be few and far between, and ultimatly fairly pointless as again what is resolved largely comes down to the player community and how it reacts. If your interested in solo, or small group, play there is comparitively little to do as the major focus of the game seems to be on large scale guild or in EVE terms "Corporation" gameplay. Due to the politics paranoia is rife as well which can make forming connections and getting in with a good group difficult. What's more the game is totally infested with scammers, and newer players are among the favorite targets, although scamming and conning has become such a part of EVE that you see people largely making a joke about it and sitting around all day in major hubs like Jita claiming that they will give people 10x the amount of money back that they are sent.\n\nThis is not to say EVE is a "bad" game but it's one that I can't recommend in a general sense because it's not for everyone, it has a long-lasting, and enduring community, one of the longest ever, but it's not something I think the typical gamer will find a lot of pleasure in which is why despite the length of it's existance it's never achieved any kind of massive popularity on the level of Everquest, or World Of Warcraft.\n\nIf you play EVE expect a steep learning curve, and a decent amount of frustration, should you make it past that initial obstacle, the biggest question is of course going to be what group you get into, and how good you are at making your own entertainment in terms of setting your personal goals and striving to meet them, as they game is not going to present much in the way of quests or a storyline in the style of other MMOs.\n\nAfter several forays into EVE I can say I understand the appeal, but have not found the game one able to hold my interest for massive amounts of time. Probably due to the fact that I've never gotten into the whole "large guild" mindset, and I'm not paticularly predatory.","July 22, 2014","false","59.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","1"

EVE is a fantastically complicated piece of brilliance. It can offer the most rewarding gaming experience for those who put the time and effort into learning the mechanics and nuances that reside within New Eden. If you want to build empires you can. If you want to get into the fight right away, there is a way. You can join a giant alliance or a small corporation, or you can go it alone.\n\nIt is your sandbox and you may do with it what you will. The economy is deep and intricate with each station housing its own economy packed with items that are almost entirely produced by players. Markets react to player choice. The price of a module or a ship can vary wildly with supply and demand as powerful Null Sec Empires struggle for dominance and control.\n\nAll those who play reside on a single server. It lives and breaths, ebbs and flows. The universe is beautiful as it is deadly. The world is full of gorgeous alien worlds, wormholes, space ships, stations, asteroids and epic battles that non players have seen on the news but can only wonder about.\n\nEVE is home to a wide variety of people who come together from all walks of life. I have met very interesting intelligent people from around the world. They come from all different backgrounds and come together to form a community like no other.\n\nThe game itself has aged very well over its history. The developers are a dedicated team who cares about the players and more importantly, what EVE Online stands for, which is a universe that holds epic rewards and dishes out dire consequences.\n\nEVE is the best game I have ever and probably will ever play in my life. That being said this experience is not for everyone. I would venture to say that for every 10 people who try EVE 9 will quit within the first few days.\n\nThe challenge will not be easy. The game mechanics are difficult to understand and can take years to master. I will admit, the UI isn't the best, although it has improved over the years. EVE doesn't just have game mechanics, they are layered on top of one another like a cake. While some shine, others are buried deep down becoming relics of times gone past.\n\nAs a new player, you will struggle with basic functions. How do I undock? How do I equip a weapon to my ship? How do I move? How do I warp? Where is this mission objective? How do I accept a mission? Why did I just get blown up randomly, I was ‘mining’ my own business.... These are just a few of the questions that new players ask every day.\n\nMany will quit because they have too many questions, others will quit claiming they are bored running missions or mining, and yet others will quit because the game is just too damn brutal. These are all true statements. EVE is not WOW. Completing tasks will not be easy, but a job well done, a battle won, an enemy vanquished will feel 10X as rewarding because you risked it all to get there. You will rise to the top and fall straight off the ledge.\n\nFor the 1 out of 10 eve is like gravity, and the further you venture towards its center the tighter its grip will be upon you. Once you cross its event horizon EVE will have you forever and no other gaming experience will compare. ALL players take long absences but they always come back.\n\nIn EVE if you lose your ship it is gone forever. The only thing is to learn from the mistake and grow as a player. Combat is short lived but very intense. Risk and reward is what EVE is about and those who embrace it will thrive while those who are afraid of it will wither. So if you are the type of player who enjoys a deep challenging and ultimately rewarding experience take a free trial. If you are the 1 out of 10 and New Eden is a place for you Im telling you from the bottom of my heart that It will be the most rewarding gaming experience of your life and well worth the money paid. And if you don't well...EVE is not for everyone.","March 16, 2014","true","640.6"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","1"

This game. Isn't really a game in a sense. It's more of a hobby of sorts where you spend a couple hours doing wormhole relic sites or ratting in -1.0 sec systems to gather ISK then spend it on PvP ships and go out and blow up other nerds. And to have fun. Joining a corp other than the NPC corps is also a good idea. You can either join a massive null-bloc coalition like Brave, Goons, PL, etc or a smaller one that does say faction warfare, small-gang PvP, etc such as Straya. and Redemption Road.\n\nMy one word of advise to anyone who is just starting with a 2+ week trial; go join a corporation that has a well made and reputable newbro program, such as Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, Eve Uni, etc. They will most certainly and 100 percently get you started at Eve and get you into the good fights as soon as they can even though your character is new. Sure, you'll likely die a lot but that's all part of the learninig experience. And if you did decide to join one of these newbro friendly alliances/corps, they have a thing called Ship Replacement Program (SRP) so it doesn't really matter if you lose your little tackle or EWAR frigate, they'll just give you a new one. When you're first starting up, that little 1 million ISK frigate of yours is the most expensive thing you've ever owned in the game. But for some of us, that's a single module on one of our ships. And so many people are happy to throw money at newbros simply because they can.\n\nEVE doesn't necessarily need a huge commitment to play it, but the more you're involved with it, the more fun you can have. And most importantly of all, we should all remember three things:\n1) The best ship in the game is the Friend Ship\n2) Never fly what you can't afford to lose\n3) F*** CODE.\n\n100,000,000/10","April 27, 2015","true","398.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

EVE just might be the deepest, most sophisticated game I'v ever played. Starting out it's a lot to take in and can be slow to get your bearings, but once you get going it becomes one of the greatest experiences in gaming. EVE is not for the lite hearted MMO players and should be avoided if you've never played one. This is a game that requires more commitment than even several other MMO's combined.\n\nIn your usual run of the mill MMO's, give it like a month or two and you've pretty much peaked. You'll find yourself doing redundant daily instances or tasks, maybe some dull PvP and that's it. EVE Online is a multi year commitment. Don't fret though, EVE can and will be casual at most times. You will spend a lot of time basking in the incredibly gorgeous, massive universe that is EVE Online. You will mine, trade, bounty hunt, explore, hack, lead, invest, manage, manufacture, salvage, pirate, scout, and much more. EVE Online also has one of the greatest, if not THE greatest player run economies. It's one the easiest games to become self sustaining, essentially becoming free.\n\nThe truth is, I'v only ever scratched the surface of this behemoth. Yet despite that, If I were to continue this review I'd be here all day typing away and I believe short, to the point reviews are best. If you fancy a gorgeous, truly massive, relaxing worlds in space that is full of possibilites, there is non other deserving of your attention than EVE Online. 91/100","September 28, 2014","true","472.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","1"

It's great looking with a very classy style. People are friendly and mature. YET, it's a game you can play with only your left mouse button...

They're both toys. EVE Online is a game without goals, otherwise known as a toy. If I had to describe the toy I would call it "sad."  It took me over a thousand hours playing this game to realize that. Something else you won't realize until you've spent a lot of time with this game is that it is engineered from the ground up to give veteran players the advantage. It's baked into the mechanics. Wait until you are no longer a noob. By then you should be so bored with the PVE stuff and so sick of helping other noobs that you start to kill them. And then you begin to understand what EVE is all about. It really is a sinister place. I tried many things in the game and even bought older characters, but in the end I decided I didn't want to spend any more of my life in such a dark and sad world. Give it a shot if they really managed to pique your curiosity, but take my word for it this game is more punishment than pleasure so make sure that's what you're looking for.\n\n","December 11, 2014","false","267.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","0"

With that said I did not down rate this because of the interface, if the game didn't turn me off with other things the interface wouldn't have bugged me at all, instead it became one more reason not to play the game.\n\nThe problem with EVE in my opinion is that it failed to give me the impression that I was piloting a starship or was part of something bigger and instead I felt like I was the star ship itself. There is a distinction here and with that said I could not convince myself that this game was worth the price tag.\n\nThe community for EVE is very nice from my experience and once you understand the chat interface you can meet very kind and helpful people. I have nothing to really say about the developers since I never ran into any bugs or had any complications, the game does what it was intended to do well.\n\nI played EVE for about 3 weeks and a few months later I decided to write this review since by now I think I have an objective opinion of the game and I will present the rest of it now:\n\nEVE has an unfun micromanagement issue where you need to travel and do essentially a fetch quest but the time it takes to do this quest can get unbarable. Worse yet at the begining you will be micromanaging just about everything so it's not like you can walk away and take a shower and stuff will get done. I got to the point where I could set AI to take care of somethings in high concord areas (Basically AI will protect me from evil players) but there is nothing fun about mining.\n\nThe next thing is EVE's character creator, it's AMAZING I really liked spending an hour making my character but afterwards there is nothing, nothing to it at all. You can't interact with NPCS because you aren't your character persay. Instead Interactions happen between ships this threw me off big time and I gave the game a chance in the hope that maybe they had plans to expand this stuff but I know of no such plans and I'm unwilling to dump money and time on this game because of it. Essentially instead of feeling like the Captain of my ship I feel like a ship.\n\nThe Music in EVE passes the time well but bring your own music because even good music gets boring after your 15th material haul.\n\nEve takes itself too seriously, the game tries way too hard and consumes way too much time, while I didn't mind it at first the back and forth between areas and having to wait for 2 days for things to complete so I could use them only to find some detail that requires something else be made before I could use it  or make something from it.  To put it briefly the game does not appreciate the value of the players time and it is not streamlined to deliver it's product to the player. The result is being pounded with self imposed fetch missions across a small portion of the galaxy which can take 20 minutes to traverse if you don't get lost.\n\nTextures are mid to low, the character textures are mid to high though, but the game graphically is not puke worthy but it doesn't get any praises from me. Space ship fights look like something you'd see from a web game.","September 7, 2014","false","48.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It's a fantastic science fiction game with lots of tactics/culture/economy, however, it's basically a second job. And more importantly, there's alot of hate for carebears. There's a big push for PvP. In all honesty, this is why after 6 years of playing. I gave up on it. It was just too pvp-centric for me. The point about in game characters in the game never materialized, I believe this in part, because the same mechanics of the game where duplicated in Dust 514. (And did not do so well.) I hope someday they make carebearing more fun, and less harped on by pvp players who flip your cans, create corp wars, or locator agents to harass miners, haulers, and industrialists.

There's so much to do and so many viable play styles (industry, exploration, PvE, PvP, and trade to name a few big ones) that there's really no excuse to be bored. You can micro-manage as much, or as little, as you want.\n\nDon't Buy the Starter Pack\nIt sounds like a deal, but it's not. I bought it when I originally started playing, and trying to move that amount of stuff around as a newbie is more trouble than it's worth. Go to reddit or just about any other EVE site and ask for a trial code. That will give you 21 days to test the waters free, as opposed to the usual 14. Even if you subscribe 2 days after starting the trial, You'll retain any leftover trial days after subscribing.\n\nPlay Through the Tutorials, Really\nEvery EVE vet will tell you that skipping the tutorials is about the dumbest thing you can do. While it is a wall of text (they are fixing it...it's already better than it used to be, which is saying something), it will teach you the basics of just about everything in EVE. You'll also get a good handful of ships to fly around in and a nice chunk of money to start off with. See above - starter pack isn't worth it, and will cause more confusion than problems it solves.\n\nThe Skill System Doesn't Screw Over New Players\nIt's easy to look at EVE's skilling system and say that it gives veterans an unfair advantage. It doesn't. You'll probably spend the first 2-3 months getting all of the "core" skills out of the way, during which you can still have a lot of fun and do a lot of things - a week into the game I was flying around with small PvP fleets (5-10 people) and meaningfully contributing. After the "core" stuff is out of the way, any further differences are on the scale of 2-5%. There's much more going on in combat that's going to dictate the outcome than skills.\n\nBigger isn't Better\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement of flying huge ships in massive battles, but rushing to that point is the easiest way to ruin your experience. You can fly those ships around, but you will be far from effective, which is a quick route to discouragement. Start out in the small ships, learn the game, get blown up. Frigates are cheap for a reason, and new and old players both fly them more than you'd think. Most common advice for someone interested in PvP? Fit 50 cheap frigates and go get them all blown up.\n\nDive in and Have Fun!\nYou will make tons of mistakes while playing (I know I still do), and you will lose ships. In the words of Ms. Frizzle, "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!" It's the best way to enjoy EVE.","December 11, 2014","true","831.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

One might even go so far as to stop calling it a game, as it's more than that - it's an alternate universe, being 90% controlled by the people who play it, it feels as close to real as a game can. Your actions will stick with you, for better or for worse. People remember, and how you choose to live your alternate life as an EVE Online pilot can lead to you being well-known to thousands of people, giving you a kind of power that no other game (and in some cases real life) can offer you. Or, you may find yourself hated by many, and being driven out of the EVE universe. However, most don't reach this level, and many quit before giving the game a chance. It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy EVE, one that can be quite rare. However, if you're that kind of person, this game is like none other, can provide countless hours of enjoyment, and offers a unique sense of belonging.","July 20, 2013","true","695.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042840618/recommended/8500/","76561198042840618","JustJody","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042840618/","62 products in account","I have played over 1,200 hours in this game and I thought I might as well write a review now because I am bored. I first want to say that this game is kind of what you make it in a lot of instances, being that this game is largely player run. Sure you have the devs adding content, fixings bugs, and so on, but it really has been the players that make this game what it is.\n\nI wanted to break this down into a few sections for me to review.\n\nPvP: I think the game revolves around PvP. What do you earn isk(in game money) for? To get new ships to shoot stuff with. Sure you can buy a better PvE oriented fitted ship but I think that most of the time in the end your going to use the isk to get involved in PvP in some way. In fact PvP is not always optional in this game which I will explain later. Anyways though like I said this game revolves around PvP. I think EvE has a unique PvP design that a lot of MMO's don't have. It's a "if you lose it sorry but it's gone for good" kind of game, and that's for almost everything in the game. Even items(like plex for example) that you buy with real cash can be lost and won't be refunded most of the time. You can spend 100 dollars on plex and if your transporting it through space and someone kills you and takes it, it's considered your fault and you'll likely never get that money back. I have had mixed feelings about items being bought with real cash being able to be taken by others, but for everything else it's a pretty good concept and makes the game more real. The way EvE has set this up is really important to the game and removing it would probably kill the game. It's one of the main reasons this MMO is unique. For PvP there is a variety of ships to choose from, and a lot of corps, alliances, third-party groups will often host PvP roams/fleets that you can join. I would recommend a corp that does some PvP. I recommend this and later on I will explain why. Also PvP fleets can get huge and are often exciting. A lot of the time strategy is involved and good fleet structure is always needed. All in all PvP can be really fun in this game but it is up to you and your corp to get involved in it if you want to do fleets.\n\nPvE: I cannot say the PvE in this game is top notch. All of it gets dull after awhile and for the most part only serves the puropose to get you isk to buy new pvp ships. There is a variety of PvE activities you can do which you can look up and see which one you would like to do most to earn isk. All in all I won't go much into detail about this. The PvE stuff is just dull in my opinion and really needs to be improved more. PvE is a job in this game. If your looking for a completely PvE experiance don't come here.\n\nCommunity: I feel like this will apply to all MMO's. Pick a corp/alliance(basically eve's guilds) that is active and for the most part always has players on. Make sure your first corp will be able to teach you the ropes of EvE. The tutorial does some but you will more than likely need extra help from other players to learn stuff. If you find a corp that is really inactive do not give up, leave the corp and join a better one, same thing if the players in the corp you joined are A-Holes. Also find a corp that suites you the best in terms of activities, time zone, etc. I cannot go much further into detail because it really depends on the corp you join.\n\nEconomy: For the most part the games economy is run by players. Prices can go up and down on a daily basis at times. Most of the items you buy are made by players. You can also produce your own stuff with minerals and other materials as well. Since that is is pve though that can be a grind and a job. I personally just buy things off the market. it's totally up to you though. I cannot say much more really.\n\nGraphics: They are fair enough. Not the most wonderful thing you will ever see but it's good. Also sometimes people call the ships submarines because they act like their under water. So definitley not accurate physics.\n\nSkills: You are able to use new items and improve your skills through training skills. You buy a skillbook of the market and activate it. It is all time based. Skills can take weeks to train sometimes so it's wise to choose them well and find which ones will be the most useful to you. Overall i think it's a good system.\n\nConclusion: Eve offers a lot to do. You have many things to choose to do and it's really what you make of the game. PvP is fun but overall PvE is dull and needs work. Most people I have met are also really nice and helpful but like I said you need to choose a good corp/alliance. I have not explained everything but a lot will become known when you start playing the game. Also ask for help if you need it.\n\nOverall I rate this game a 7.5-8/10. I do believe it is worth the sub for many reasons which will take awhile to explain so i will not right now. I give it this rating because PvE is definitley not that great considering how long this game has been out(10+ years). Also I feel for over a decade of producing this game should have more content. As in activites to do and improving PvE more which they have but it still needs work.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 22, 2015","true","286.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

DON'T ! While this game has a very steep learning curve and a lot of the stuff could be made easier with a more modern game design it is this depth that makes it a game you can sink alot of time into and still feel like you are doing and learning something new after over 100 hours of playtime. People downplay the Skill system and how it takes real time to train meaning a newbie can never be as skilled as a veteran player however it takes only a short while to be trained in some of the basic ships and if you fly with a fleet you will be effective enough to take down the more "skilled" players if you can be a team player. All in all I would highly recomend this game as it has a reputation of ruining people for other mmo's based on its depth and the realism of its player driven economy.

My issues with the game where twofold starting with the afformetnioned boring that seemed to creep into the game somewhere in my final week before I would have had to throw down for a full sub, mind you for those first three weeks I was completely glued to this game. Coupled with the depressing reality that nothing I did in game really mattered as far as character progression. Since everything is queued and gains points regardless of if you are even logged in, which was sorta cool I guess but the downside was when you where logged in what you did in game didn't matter because it continued to look strictly at the queue.\n\nAdmittedly that might have changed since I last played but if it hasn't that means if you had say (insert ship skill) queued and went hunting pirates or mining asteroids you got no increase in your weapons or mining skills because they weren't queued. Nor did you appear to get any extra points twards something that you were currently undertaking and had queued. So say you are doing a lot of fighting and had some weapons system or targeting skill queued you didn't get any bonus as far as I saw for actually doing something related to what you had queued. Which injected a certain sense of futility in doing much of anything. I mean there was always grinding for loot to grind for better weapons/ships which you can't used until you queue to train up the requisite skills and log out to let the game train while you are not playing the game.\n\nThere was also the ever present dread of being pvp fodder in much of anything you do. If that is your thing then you should probably check this out but I don't really get anything out of planning how I'm going to ruin someones day or constantly looking over my shoulder to see who is coming to brighten their day by ruining mine. Tho I will admit that there have been some interesting and entertaining stories that have come out of EVE.\n\nThat said this game does look to have a bunch of potential that I didn't get to fully explore but ultimately I couldn't really justify the subscription based on my experience.","December 9, 2014","false","64.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

There are so many ways to play and so many things you could do for self-fulfillment that I really can't condense the hundreds of possible job descriptions into a single review, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nCombat in EVE is, to say the least, hectic. Fleet Commanders scream over interlinked third-party VOIP systems while using whisper keys to intercommunicate while commanding the attention of a thousand or more nerds flying a swarm of spaceships ranging from billions of ISK cost to tens of thousands while attempting to organize tackle [or stuns] squads, anchor and lead the swarm so that they don't get separated or cut apart, and manage the overall damage output of the fleet onto primary, secondary, and tertiary targets in the enemy fleet. All while staying alive themselves, and all while using a few keyboard hotkeys and VOIP.\n\nFrom a fleet member's perspective, you're either healing or dealing damage, and your given set of third-party comms may be two hundred people screaming or ten pilots sitting in complete silence waiting for the order to drop bombs dealing hundreds of thousands of damage per second into the heart of the enemy fleet passing silently around you, unaware of your cloaked presence. Your client could be coming to a crawl or your computer could be exploding if you're running multiple accounts in the same fleet and it struggles to render the thousands of units on screen.\n\nAs for the actual combat itself, it's basically just some math. Certain factors like tracking speed of turrets, signature radius, and locking speed are taken into account to determine how quickly you can deal damage to the enemy and how effective that damage is. Damage types allow for specialization against certain ships, and certain ships allow for unique counters to specific fleet metas that given alliances may or may not choose to adhere to.\n\nSingle-ship combat is effectively an algorithmic back-and-forth of damage per second and shield/armor/hull recharge per second, and who has the damage output to overcome the threshold more quickly.\n\n\n---\n\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, you may be quietly spending the hours alt-tabbed while a heavy miner vaporizes rocks and pulls in the yield... Of course, if you're into more specialized industrial pay, you could run cloaked blockade runners through enemy lines to steal from an orbital station that a spy gave you the access codes to, in exchange for a cut of the profits.

There are so many ways to play and so many things you could do for self-fulfillment that I really can't condense the hundreds of possible job descriptions into a single review, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nCombat in EVE is, to say the least, hectic. Fleet Commanders scream over interlinked third-party VOIP systems while using whisper keys to intercommunicate while commanding the attention of a thousand or more nerds flying a swarm of spaceships ranging from billions of ISK cost to tens of thousands while attempting to organize tackle [or stuns] squads, anchor and lead the swarm so that they don't get separated or cut apart, and manage the overall damage output of the fleet onto primary, secondary, and tertiary targets in the enemy fleet. All while staying alive themselves, and all while using a few keyboard hotkeys and VOIP.\n\nFrom a fleet member's perspective, you're either healing or dealing damage, and your given set of third-party comms may be two hundred people screaming or ten pilots sitting in complete silence waiting for the order to drop bombs dealing hundreds of thousands of damage per second into the heart of the enemy fleet passing silently around you, unaware of your cloaked presence. Your client could be coming to a crawl or your computer could be exploding if you're running multiple accounts in the same fleet and it struggles to render the thousands of units on screen.\n\nAs for the actual combat itself, it's basically just some math. Certain factors like tracking speed of turrets, signature radius, and locking speed are taken into account to determine how quickly you can deal damage to the enemy and how effective that damage is. Damage types allow for specialization against certain ships, and certain ships allow for unique counters to specific fleet metas that given alliances may or may not choose to adhere to.\n\nSingle-ship combat is effectively an algorithmic back-and-forth of damage per second and shield/armor/hull recharge per second, and who has the damage output to overcome the threshold more quickly.\n\n\n---\n\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, you may be quietly spending the hours alt-tabbed while a heavy miner vaporizes rocks and pulls in the yield... Of course, if you're into more specialized industrial pay, you could run cloaked blockade runners through enemy lines to steal from an orbital station that a spy gave you the access codes to, in exchange for a cut of the profits. You could also hectically follow the massive blob of nullsec fleets into battle, waiting patiently until they leave to salvage the corpses of massive capital ships and more literally the corpses of players on the field, who may be or become famous, playing a part in a massive body-trading underground that collects, trades, and pays for corpses of a particular type.\n\n--\n\nFor some, EVE is all about living in New Eden.

As a skill based game you can do what you like - mine, build , research, run ops, spy, battle PVE or PVP. Has a excellent detailed marketplace.\n\nBut the more advanced skills take time - there are some things that help - like attribute modifying cybernetics - but it can take weeks to get high level skills. ( skills train regardless of if you are online) This is good - no amount of money canmake someone walk in and POOF be able to fly a battleship.\n\nAlso has innovative chracter clothing and imagery interface.\n\nI am enjoying seeing how game has developed. They have updates about once every 2 months so always something new.\n\nIf you like a hack and slash beat people up do same ting over and over every day sort of game - this is not for you.

Joining corporations (guilds) does help a little but the war system means that other corporations can declare war on yours and you're fair game everywhere meaning that, until you've spent a very long time getting higher-end spaceships (even if someone gives you one  it takes weeks of training before you can fly it), you're stuck sitting in a station because you can be destroyed the second you exit.\n\nEven outside wars, people sit at gates (how you travel between systems) and just destroy people randomly and, as a new player there's no way you can stand up to them.  It's not a terribly newbie-friendly game but if you don't mind spending months being completely outclassed by your attackers before you have a chance to fight back you may enjoy it as the mechanics are good.","February 7, 2014","false","130.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From the helpful community , overall depth of game, and great friends you make playing it, it's by far an amazing experience that shines above not only other games of the genre, but every other game out there.\n\n\nHaving everyone on a single server lets you, a single person, make an impact on the ENTIRE gaming community. Be it through commanding a giant fleet or being the tech 1 frigate you trained into 2 hours after getting the game, you make a difference.\n\nThere aren't any specific goals set in the game, so you'll need to make your own. Unlike most games, once you've chosen your path it will take you a while to master it. So while your skills train passively (yay no long grinds for skills!) so do your player skills. I've been pvp'ing in this game for 10 months and I still have a lot to learn in JUST pvp. Not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of other non-roller coaster career paths you can take up, you will always have something new to strive towards.\n\nYou won't need to kill a wild hog 500 times to use your gear, since your skills train passively!\n\nThe pvp in this game is also unreal. I've never had games consistently make my heart race like this one. Be it you barely killed a guy and you yourself only have a sliver of health left, or you just won a fleet fight where you were just commanding 50 people, and you just barely came out on top from the 75man gang you ran into!\n\nJust in pvp, the depth is unreal. With hundreds upon hundreds of modules, ship types, and environmental factors it keeps pvp a challenging and fresh experience day in and day out. You can change your game from flying solo, flying in small gangs with a few of your bros, to HUGE fleet fights with thousands of people!\n\nAlthough the learning curve is steep if you go at it alone, it's not meant to be played that way. There's nothing else like making new friends and playing through the game with a group of people you care about and smacktalk and chill on comms with.\n\nWith only a day of training - you can fly and ♥♥♥♥ with players who've already been playing for 10 YEARS.\n\nI highly recommend you at least give the trial a shot, and hit me up so I can give you a hand. If I'm not available, be sure to stop by the channel "R-V-B" and join them to get your feet wet with some fast paced and heart racing pvp!\n\nAll in all, I r8 8/8 m8","December 18, 2014","true","282.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officiaIxlN/recommended/8500/","officiaIxlN","[BBG] Persey The Penis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officiaIxlN/","141 products in account","Given that CCP's landmark creation, EVE Online has consecutively walked away with our annual "MMORPG of the year award" it would be safe to assume that we like this game. I would even be so bold as to say that this collective Internet cloud cherishes, loves, adores, and embraces everything about this online-romp. Eve Online is perhaps one of the most purest definitions of the genre; a definitive example of how a PC, monitor, and Internet connection can open a gateway to a virtual world.\n\nLet's just get it out of the way - if I could, I would marry, buy a condo, and have children with Eve Online: It is just that damn sexy. With that said, let's get on with the formal make-out session I like to call a review.\n\nAesthetics 9/10\n\nGiven that the game is now approaching almost 9 years in age, you have to hand it to CCP for keeping EVE so visually appealing. Starting out in 2003 as a slightly emancipated, ungainly child of an MMO, the Icelandic developer has continually updated and refined their vision of space. From sweeping vistas, colourful gas arrays, and goliath ships that pound seven tons of laser out of each other - EVE Online has a graphical charm you can't help but admire.The scale and "epic" nature of the entire ensemble fights tightly with the adventures that unfold around you - couple this with an inspired soundtrack and you might just believe you are a space-faring smuggler. Since Incarna, the developer's have taken us one step closer in letting us walk around in space stations (still no direct contact) which also adds another layer of immersion, and helps create some of the most camp looking avatar's in MMO history (I prefer the sunglasses and a look that says "I'm casual but I'm ready for anything.")\n\nPerhaps EVE Online's biggest draw however, above and beyond the new interior bits or the awe-inspiring space stations, is its scalability. Whether you have the dimmest laptop or the mightiest gaming rig, New Eden is a forgiving mistress when it comes to processing power, meaning that you won't have to earmark a thousand dollars to make the game actually run - and that's what we like, humble yet attractive.\n\nGameplay 10/10\n\nEve Online is a game in which you can run quests in the morning, build a spacecraft for lunch, and pretend to be an inter-galactic Gordon Gecko for the afternoon. No MMO has ever come quite as close in achieving the multi-faceted, "make your own adventure" that defines this genre. Starting out with a tiny ship and without a single credit to your name, it is a player’s choice and individual journey that will lead them to the height of piracy, or even a freighting-empire.\n\nThe ever-refining tutorials now streamline the process from creation to first steps with easy to follow guides, as well as nudging you to a number of missions which give a taste for the various facets of the game. While newcomers will still suffer from what is known as "Eve-istentialism" at the enormity of the experience, CCP is doing their upmost to help this feeling dissipate.\n\nAnd yet if you come from any traditional online game, you will be confused and scared by EVE Online. The lack of a level system, grind, humdrum questing, or even equipment (+135 Strength YAY!!) building will shock most people. This MMO takes a different tact, skills are gained in real-time, ticking over in hours or sometimes days, meaning that progress isn't about gaining an Engineering level 4, but the bits you do in between. The biggest indicator of success is in the ship you cruise around in, and the amount of money you have in the bank - sort of like a galaxy hopping rap artists: it's all about thruster-spinners and the fuzzy space-dice.\n\nHow you achieve riches and infamy within New Eden however, will be up to you. It isn't highfaluting talk to say that you could pirate the vacuum, or mine your way to fortune. Eve Online is developed is such a way that every play style is catered for, whether you want to be an action-ready pilot or instead a docile mogul looking for that chance to make it rich.\n\nThis is also one of the last few MMORPG's to emphasize the "multiplayer" part. Making it within New Eden will require a few choice friends, and seeing some of the more dangerous and exciting sights will definitely require a buddy or two. Low secruity space offers some of the most intriguing and thrilling moments of PvP known to the genre. This FFA full loot area will see paranoid groups mining for the finest ores, or even cruising asteroid belts looking for unaware opportunists - whatever the case may be, low-sec will never provide a dull moment.\n\nFrom the economy to warfare amongst corporations, the individual can influence everything, and that is where this game shines. Like Ultima Online before, this is the type of game that you can proudly nail your colours the mast and proclaim that the experiment works, and you do indeed have a second life, in a galaxy far, far away.\nBut is it perfect? With a score winking a mighty 10 above, I'd say that whatever few negatives pale in comparison to the sheer volume of things that this game has going for it. For whatever cat-calls of it being too slow, too group-orientated, or indeed "We play to crush, not to bake bread!" well that's just missing the entire point of EVE Online: it is a virtual world, go out there and take advantage of it in its full glory.\n\nInnovation 10/10\n\nOriginally EVE Online was a slightly broken, online Elite with nods towards Ultima Online. Now almost 9 years later that game is the hulking Goliath that most sandbox MMORPGs look to emulate. From the exclusion of grind to the classless, limitless choices for your avatar, CCP's title is leading the way in terms of what can be achieved within the genre.\nLike UO before it, the game bangs the drum of the "playing to bake bread" in that it gives you the option to play an action-packed pirate, or a simple engineer. This is the type of game that truly brings to life the idea of virtual world and finding your own place within it. Even before we exclaim about player-driven markets, low-sec space, or the countless ways its developer's have overcome the most extensive genre issues, EVE Online is first and foremost the greatest definition of the term MMORPG. Innovation is what its Icelandic studio guzzles for breakfast.\n\nPolish 9/10\n\nDeveloping an MMORPG over the course of many years must become like a routine juggling act. On the one hand, maintenance, patching, and refining must all be attempted, but tweaking one thing might cause the whole thing to fall to a crumbled mess on the floor, with several angry little people caps locking "OMFG NEWB RUINED THE GAME". To this end, CCP have done a very admirable job in keeping this game in check, whilst continually adding and tweaking in whatever way they see fit.\n\nEVE Online will rarely splutter or stall, neither will it kick you out like a stroppy horse. Through years and years of continually bettering their product, the Icelandic developer has, with gaffer tape and lots of spittle, forged a well-made, tight game. Now just get on with remaking those newbie ships.\n\nLongevity 9/10\n\nMost MMORPGs are victim to what is known as the "locust player". This is the type of gamer that will not rest, sleep, eat, or poop before they can claim that they dinged 50 before the servers even opened. CCP have once again bucked the trend by offering a game that makes it not only unconquerable with days, but even within months you will still be training skills and juggling abilities.\n\nWhat this means is that not only is the experience in New Eden vast, but also there are many ways in which to go back through it all, never doing the same thing twice. With so many skills and with those taking a finite amount of real-life time, unless you have dual accounts alts are essential to the experience, as well as time consuming to make: the result being that you'll be playing EVE Online for a very long time.\n\nFinal score 9.2","December 29, 2014","true","503.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't lead you by the nose. It does not have mercy for those not willing to put in effort to gain anything.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful scenery. Literal galactic vistas that can be more beautiful than your own night sky. Highly detailed ships. (So detailed you can identify what the armament is by looking at them.) VAST OPEN SPACE.. over 7500 different systems to explore and get blown up in. There is something for every play style: PVP, PVE, Marketing, Mining, Industry, Research, Exploration (that pays!), manufacturing, and even more. Constantly evolving game with direct player influence over everything in the game and a great deal of player influence on further game development. It's not, nor will it ever be, dumbed down to make it easier.\n\nCons:\nThis game is one of the most unforgiving MMOs out there. If you blow up your big fancy ship that you worked months to save up for and trained to fly.. Too bad. It's gone now. Have to buy a new one. And if you had implants, they're gone now too.  No magical respawn where you appear in a "safe zone" complete with your newly rebuilt ship. Nope, you regain consciousness in your home station.. Naked, and with only what's left in your hangar. Sucks to be you.\nAnother con.. players can be giant jerks sometimes and scamming is rampant in the trade hubs. The devs take a very hands-off approach to this. So be wary about deals that seem to good and read every detail of contracts.\n\nI can not stress enough how much I love this game. It's not for everyone. If you played WoW or other simplistic MMOs.. this is like driving in a goKart and suddenly being handed the keys to the space shuttle. Its awesome but you have the learning curve of a baby bird getting punted out of it's nest!\n\nThey have made great strides in trying to make it new player friendly without dumbing down the game. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.","June 14, 2015","true","638.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I guess - to enjoy this game to full extent you have to be very social - ideally play with group of friends. If you try solo, you end up dissapointed. Yes yes, you can join corp, but .. these people don't talk to each other really. It's like CS:GO but these people own half a universe and camp at all low-sec gates all day just to obliterate you. Aaand they have big big ships too. With bigger guns.\n\n- The game itself is very, very unforgiving. Work hard to get enough ISK to get that dream ship? Ok - you might just get it, only to see it blown up when flying out of the station you got it. True story :) You work hard to get next one .... but this time you insure it. Another will get blown up, you will get the money, but ... then you spend half a day chasing that missing equipment you lost. That brings me to my point, most of the game you travel. And it's slow. If you have time to kill, this is ideal. Everything is slow (except when you find russian mafia). One of my combats with NPCs took 15 minutes to kill single transport. I went to take a dump, only to find it's not over yet.\n\n+ On the other hand, level of complexity - it's just amazing. So many items you can loot and put up on your craft, I have never seen so many. And I played for a week only. And I have explored perhaps 1% of it. Maybe less.\n\n+ It looks good too, while system requirements are pretty modest. That's a big plus.\n\n- Also crashes a lot on Mac. What a shame (MacBook Pro 13, Late 2014).\n\nOverall: Looking back after a week of intense play (played more hours than shown here), I have to conclude that this is very very slow paced game, if you don't mind getting blown up all the time by super aggresive russians, or to travel 1 hour just to get your new missile launcher, this game might be for you.","December 20, 2015","false","27.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","11","19","3","0"

I am the only gamer girl in my clan, and it is totally worth it ^.^, this game is not for the feint minded, it requires you to actually spend time training in skills and learning the concepts of the game; But once you do the rewards are endless.\n\nit is a massive sandbox world with 7,500 star systems and hundreds of thousands of players to encounter. you can make friends and form alliances together or make enemies and watch their ships explode as you destroy them in fierce battles, or watch your ship explode if your skills are to low ^.^...\n\nThe world of eve is treacherous but yet very friendly, you can take up roles of whatever you want and you are not bound to them at all if you want to hide in low sec and kill capsules as they are passing through your system you can, or if your a brave bounty hunter you can hunt pirates or earn your isk by ratting in low or null sec, or even if you want a peaceful break from combat you can switch from your combat ships and pilot one of you mining rigs to harvest minerals to sell for isk or save for the blue prints you just found exploring the deep darks depth of space for; and use those minerals to build that advanced ship or fittings that would benefit you alot.\n\nTraining is relatively easy depending on what you want to train in, you can always allocate your points to the primary attribute that skill requires to shorten the training time it takes for your character to learn that certain skill. You can also become a good enough player to use in-game money to buy plex that you can then use to extend your monthly subscription... my first month was the free 30 days from steam then i bought 1 month from the eve account management site which is cheaper... and my third month i was able to use in game money to pay for my subscription, and at this time i learned enough skills to do level 4 combat missions with diffrent corps and by myself to earn 50 - 200 million isk per run.\n\nThe rewards of isk only become better as the risk becomes greater... you start in high sec where ccp forces are protecting you then there is low-sec, null sec, then deadspace , and wormhole space... i love wormhole space the graphics are beautiful ^.^, but my friend's pos (player owned starbases) that helped transport materials to build was attacked and destroyed o.o... but that is eve ^.^, and when you start you get an attribute boost that increases your attributes dramatically and allows you to learn skills faster for two weeks ^.^, lol i forgot about it until i was 2 weeks and a day into the game so i couldnt use it, and sold it for 300 million isk, which enabled me to buy my first battleship The Abaddon.\n\nLearning skills for ship piloting is also very easy you buy skill books with isk and it could take 5 to 7 days to learn skills from frigate to a battleship as a new pilot, but only a few hours if you keep playing for experienced players with im only 3 months experienced and i have 2 battleships and love helping new pilots ^.^... Also the economy is completly player contolled so you can be a trader and become the richest person in eve just by buying low and selling high... I think if you search this video on youtube (EVE Online Inferno | Official Trailer HD) you will fall in love instantly ^.^...  and i will also post a link on my profile page to give you a 21 day trial instead of 14 day trial... and you must buy through steam for starter pack and you will be able to take pictures to share, because the graphics are just stunning... so see you soon, and remember "With risk comes Great Rewards in the world of Eve". ^.^","December 9, 2013","true","216.8"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","7"

It is not a game. It is another life. It is very difficult to sell this MMO-strategy game, not because it is difficult, but because it is so demanding.\n\nThe possibility is endless, you can do what ever you want in the complex, in both economically and culturally world. It will demand every little time you have in your personal life, to research for your best growth strategy. It reminds me of Everquest, but more organic and rich in context, which means you have to co-operate with many others to survive, let along having fun.\n\nThe political structure and gameplay is creepingly realistic that you don't feel like you're play a game. You are WORKING like its your career, DEALING WITH REAL BARGAINS like its your business, and FOLLOW&LEADING like in the army.\n\nSoon enough your will lose balance, you have to deal with two lives, so you developed your time management skills and such, learn to differ your personal life and EVE life and real work. It's just too much for me. I quit because I realise I can't enjoy other games, books, movies and real life relationships. I wish I can but I'm not that smart, not that strong like those I met in the game. They can keep up, leading and manage their kids and wives/husbands in the same time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zZataro/recommended/8500/","zZataro","Zatara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zZataro/","386 products in account","In summary: The World of New Eden is beautiful, vast, & most of all, extremely dangerous.\n\nI'm going to start by saying that EVE is legendary for being unique. Not only due to its Learning Cliff, but also because of its Gameplay, Systems, & the fact that it's likely THE most authentic Sandbox MMO currently in existence (at least Sci-Fi Sandbox, if not overall). As such, with this game, you're going to either feel immediately at home, or you're not, in which case you're going to struggle for a while, only to end up quitting quite fast.\n\nAs such, before you buy, I truly recommend you get yourself a 14-day Free Trial Account first, before you potentially waste money on EVE. It's simply not for everyone. Even if you adore Dark Souls & worship its PvP, EVE might still not be the game for you.\n\nOne of the major hurdles you're going to face, apart from the Gameplay, Systems, the User Interface etc, is the Subscription - much like all Sub-based MMOs, you're going to need to constantly justifying spending the necessary quid each month to keep your Account active.\n\nSome people criticize the Sub Model, saying it's outdated, others feel the game is too old for this, but I prefer to see it like this: EVE provides all of its content, all of its updates free of charge, minus the necessary monthly Subscription Fee.\n\nMost Games launched at the same time EVE was look like they're stuck in the '90s. EVE doesn't. Not only does it look Visually stunning due to the continuous Graphical Overhauls (DX11 features are on the short list right now!), but it also keeps things fresh with constant Updates. CCP has actually just switched to a new 6-week Patching Cycle which will deliver more content, faster than ever before.\n\nOf course, like any game, EVE does have downsides:  The User Interface is like 2006 Burning Crusade (for those of you who played), & Development is slow, but it is steady at least. Much like any other Game, the Community varies beween total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to campers, stalkers, gankers, griefers, haters, trolls, to extremely friendly blokes that actually want to help, to people who run Corporations dedicated to training Newbies in the various Career Paths that New Eden has available to you.\n\nSpeaking of; there's a multitude of Careers to choose from in EVE, you don't need to necessary do PvP (which can vary from Fleet-sized fights to small Gang-sized encounters to 1v1s), or PvE (which also varies from Exploration to Missioning to Incursions (Raids, specifically, Rifts), to Wormholes).  You can just sit in one of the 4 Major Trade Hubs (Jita being by far the most popular), & Trade items on the market all day long, making Millions. You can jump into Wormholes & live isolated from the rest of New Eden in your own secret corner of the Galaxy, fight for your Empire as a Loyalist in Factional Warfare (PvP), or become a Conqueror of Star Systems with an Alliance of like-minded psychopaths looking to seize the Player-Controlled Regions of New Eden (known as Null-Sec) for themselves (with a bit of backstabbing, lying, deceiving, stealing, bribing, & blackmailing involved along the way), etc.\n\nIn EVE, Progression is different, unique even. In many MMOs, you train (read: grind) to the Level Cap, max out some 2-3 Professions & you're done. Then you just bang your head against the wall when it comes to the Content itself until it keels over & delivers "epic lewtz." In EVE, Training can last for months on end until you finally have the Skills you need to fully Pilot that epic Battleship you've been drooling over for months - especially the Pirate Faction Ships, which have higher requirements, tied to higher Damage Output, etc, so when you do finally undock that sweet Beast, you feel like you've accomplished something amazing, you've achieved something that so long ago seemed impossible, even.\n\nThe revamped Tutorials help make the transition from your standard VG into EVE a lot smoother. Just a few years ago I made a Trial only to barely get past them. Now, I picked up EVE again over the Steam Winter Sale, & my experience was far smoother. I ended up clocking over 50 hours into it in just the first week alone.\n\nThat's not to say the Legendary Learning Cliff is gone, no, it is still very much there, & the EVE Community works hard to ensure it remains there, even while helping newbies overcome it. Rather, the Path leading to the top of the Cliff has been worn smooth by a decade of Capsuleers that came before you, but the "Jump Here" sign remains, waiting for those who wish to escape the madness of New Eden.\n\nThe Tutorials used to just drop you into the massive, gaping pit that is New Eden, now, the transaction is smoother. Needless to say, Combat is still unique, & takes getting used to. The game still stands out from anything else, BY FAR.\n\nOh, & the EVE Starter Pack is extremely handy for newbies. In short - recommended, but only after you do the Trial & see if you're actually willing to spend money on EVE.\n\nUpdated 6 months later, still playing, still loving it ;)","January 26, 2014","true","867.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a very steep learning curve but the prolonged tutorials (hit F12 and talk to career agents) will tell you everything you need to know and they will take you through every aspect of the game.\n\nI can't stress enough but there is no game out there that comes even close to the feeling of grandiose and the constant peril around you like EvE. It's horrifying and abso*uckinglutely fantastic at the same time.\n\nDon't be discouraged by people calling the game a "spreadsheet" game - It's not, unless you go full into trading. Don't be afraid of crybabies that whine about getting ganked... PvP is a core part of this game and it will happen sooner or later. HOWEVER - the community is just amazing and chances are huge that the same player that killed you will whisper you back and talk to you about what you did wrong and even help you pay your ship and the fit that was in it.\n\nIf you want to avoid PvP as much as possible - you can always stick with a NPC corporation and be a carebear in high-sec.\n\nThe training system is very different than your usual MMO stuff (no standard "levels" or "classes") and it does favor the players that have been playing the game for a long time - BUT you can be very competent if you specialize early on. It all depends on your skill - both ingame, and RL.\n\nYes, it has a monthly sub but all updates are free, including the expansions that come out all the time.","December 15, 2015","true","197.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Some good things dont come free and this is one of the best example. It is literally a space theme game with a big buffet of things to do.\n\nPros\n- This is the real sandbox experience with online players.\n- Lots of thing to do.\n- PVP gameplay is extensive and it is the main focus of the game.\n- Human controlled corporates (akin to clans or guilds) added vibrancy to the Eve online community, it enhances the sandbox experience in a subtle way.\n- Ingame graphics are top-notch, stunning weapon effects, the ship models are well-designed and great eye candies in the vast lonely space.\n- Enough options for PVE at low level if new players dont like PVP.\n- Probably the best virtual market (ingame, not Eve store) I have come across so far, real players and NPC simulated supply and demand make the market feel realistic.\n- The game is continuously evolving and improving thanks to players' subscriptions. You could be sure it is a matured game with incremental improvements every now and then.\n\nCons\n- Steep learning curve, lots to read up but you should have no problem if you like space games\n- No grinding but 'gaining experience' can be time consuming when no means to accelerate the process without spending tons of ISK or real money\n-  Unforgiving to newbies who venture in low or null sec, you will lose alot of ISK making newbie mistakes\n- Limited means of control for your starships in space, do not expect to pilot your ship with a joystick like a space sim.\n- Pace of game progression is slow and will get boring if you only focus on one aspect of the game. Diversify your things to do in Eve, plan out your learning programme to experience the majority of what the game has to offer.","December 26, 2015","true","477.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That taste can range from an upper class citizen to the lowly dregs of society, but what do they have in common?\n\nAn untreated diagnosis of Moderate to Severe Psychosis and Sociopathic tendencies.\n\nNow this isn't to say that ALL Eve players are like this, but most are. In this virtual realm they are known as " Carebears", according to the Pirate Hierarchy. Online interactions are of course not rated by the ESRB, and trash talking is common in various MMO's, but the level of detail to a response AGAINST PvP in a PvP-centric game is shocking.\n\nDeath Threats, Deviancy, Inclining Child Abuse, Inclining Physical abuse and threats of "hacking"(ISP detection, Keylogging, Apache log manipulation and Proxies) Racism, Botting, hate groups; CCP allows this as long it remains WITHIN THE PARAMETERS of the server client, and action is only taken when external applications and domains are used in violation of the EULA. They are Lax and exhibit Sloth behaviour, not a company I would want to subscribe to.\n\nIt is a game that might of had once noble intentions, is now a den of debauchery, void of good Etiquette, and a haven for the Mentally Insane allowed online.\n\nNow one may retort, "But if you're spouting such inane frivoulties about these psychopaths and played for such a long time, aren't you one yourself then?", to which I reply by saying:\n\nEmulation does not equal indoctrination. I can observe and blend in to delve into the psyche of these supposed "Carebears" when in fact it is the "Evil" pirates that are the Gentlemen and Women of New Eden. This isn't propaganda to say that you should be a pirate, if anything it's a red flag that this Sandbox game is More Linear than Theme Park MMO's such as WoW or SWTOR.\n\nThe pirate Hierarchy run this game, if you want to be a pirate, more power to you, you'll find some decent folk within their ranks.\nIf you want to do anything else (apart from marketing and trading, which can be done solo) you will reach a dead end by AFK mining, Grinding missions over and over again, redundant Planetary Interaction, Faction Warfare Plexing etc.\n\nThere is only one proper way to play EvE in its Canonical format: PvP\n\nIf you are looking for a narrative story, PvE, a safety net, and a nice Passive Atmosphere, I suggest you find another Space Simulator.\n\n2/10 for Community /  6/10 for Gameplay","August 5, 2014","false","264.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I thought 'what the hell' its been 10 years since I played it seriously. I did the 14day trial, and it took about an hour for me to rekindle the love affair. Everything is so much easier than before. I remember it took me a solid month of play to become an ISK millionare in 2003. It took me the best part of 2 hours of working through the tutorials and I've already made 2million ISK. Its not so much 'dumbed down' as streamlined. Graphically it STILL looks stunning, now making full use of modern GFX cards. But the core dynamic is the same.. its a huge and beautiful sandbox.\n\nWhilst my old account has a few years worth of training, I've decided to start completley afresh.. no baggage and no billion ISK to help.. and I'm so pleased I did. I have forgotten more about how to play this game than any other.. the systems are complex but rewarding because they are complex.\n\nI went the whole hog and grabbed a discounted yearly subscription, and I'm really looking forward to spending as much time playing as I can.\n\nUntil Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous comes along, EvE is still the King of the Elite crowd which has consumed more of my gaming hours over the last 30 years than all the others combined.\n\nDefinatley worth a look, definately worth the small subscription fee (£90 for a whole year - thats only £7.50 a month) - I spent £75 on a tank of Fuel this morning.. this is cheap entertainment!!\n\n","October 29, 2013","true","134.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I always come back and think "maybe I didn't try hard enough to like it." and then stop playing after a week because I remember why I don't like it. It is boring as a single player. Combat against AI in missions is boring, trading runs are boring, mining is boring and the only thing motivating you to keep going is to get a better ship (= catch up with other players) and to be invited in a corporation to become part of one of these cool stories you hear every once in a while.\n\nBut catching up is boring. I don't want to play with my space dumpster for 30 hours until I finally get a chance to actually do something meaningful in this game. It kind of reminds me of leveling in other MMORPGs.\n\nTrying to like the game five times over the past few years has had a positive effect: I noticed how the tutorial and the interface steadily improved. At least that hurdle got fixed.\n\nFor me, Eve is more fun to read about than to actually play it.

NO. Stop trying defend such things. It's a bad idea. The learning curve for this game has already been metion enough but really I believe alot of that could be alleviated merely by putting new players in a seperate instance space while they learn the flight controls, How to read they terribly designed HUD [which can be modified but still], and come to terms with everything availible to them. By throwing Newbies in the pot with Vets you only whind up with a massive turnover rate. Which is sad cause I see great potential for this type of hands off MMO. But just because you'll let your game world run itself doesn't give you the excuse to not actually design a good tutorial.\n\nTL;DR Any game with this strong of a learning curve should have a good tutorial. This one doesn't as such you SHOULD count that against the game. NO Players shouldn't have to just slog through it 'till the good stuff comes'.

The freedom to walk the path of honesty or the path of deception. The freedom to make for yourself, buy for yourself, or steal from others. A game where you can be a pirate one second and a manufacturer the next. A game where, given the time and energy, can not only be played for free, but can allow you pilot machines that are larger than imagination. You can be a part of something much greater than yourself. You can take on the entire galaxy if you should so desire. Just be aware that there are consequences to your actions and that an ounce of caution is sometimes worth more than a ton of skill.\nA massive time sink and potential money sink but once you get going, it's hard to stop.

Well there is a space for you to go do that with missions, special ships, and even faction standings. Do you want to help the 'good' empires? Tons of missions to help you do that as well. Do you want to be a pirate or outlaw that just kills, kills, kills? Well eve will you do that no matter how much isk you lose or win.\n\nThis is the one MMO that has kept me, where the people matter and the RP is backed by OOC shooting and pewing. If you are an RPer it doesn't get more immersive than making your villian mad only to have them bring in a 50 man fleet ( which is meh by eve standards) to try and knock over your sandcastle.\n\nIf you aren't an RPer then every action you take, every item you make, every where you go it affects other people. You mine a bit more, someone else is allowed to make a product and sell it on the market for a better profit or a better price; which funds players to fight and destroy eachother in those massive battles which are on gaming websites.\n\nThis is eve, where half the people are drunk, half of them are insane, but we all try to have fun and ♥♥♥♥ the other guys off more.","February 4, 2015","true","739.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have never gotten so immersed and cared so much about a game since my childhood. My hours played is a lie because i mostly played the game outside of Steam, basically i have somewhere from 2 to 3 thousand hours played.\n\nIf you do one thing, like mine for resources, then use that to get a better ship to mine more resources or likewise for doing missions, basically just interact with the AI you will get bored.\n\nGood stuff: make friends, betray your friends, make enemies, kill people.\nThe industry side of EVE is quite interesting, you will look at spreadsheets on a saturday evening voulantarily.\n\nWhat eventually happens: become a bittervet, stop logging in, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the forums, make extremely optimized fits for all ships you will never fly, cancel subscription. 6 months later reactivate subscription and play for a couple of weeks until you rediscover why you stopped playing.

There is THAT MUCH stuff to do in this game. One of the few games that is player driven. Everything in the game is made by players. And when I say that i mean: The ore is mined by players, then refined by players, then items and manufactured from thosed minerals by players, then flown by players, then destroyed by players. Game is very in depth and there is almost never nothing to do. The almost part is because the game has a set maint schedule (1 hour every day for restart, maint, and patching of the server, etc.) With that being said, if you are on the fence. Try out the trial, its free. One word of advise though: Do not think you are going to start and be the best ever. you need to learn. This game can be very daunting / challenging to new players.

All you want to do you can do within a day from the start. The skill queue with the skills for big stuff taking longer is meant to be that way, do you have at least minimal time to learn how to fly the smaller ships.

This is no game, this is a second life. A chance to be who and what you want all while flying some beautiful ships (or in the case of some reviewers your Pod/space).\n\nHave I done mining? Yeah, have 4 alts just for that. Have I done PvP? Yes, high, low, and null. Mission running is a nice break from running sites for PvE and can make you some good ISK (in game money).\n\nAre noobs constantly being screwed over? Only if stupid enough to accept duel requests or loot something that tells them (and they have to acknowledge) will allow EVERYONE to attack them no matter the security status of the system (suspect flag). Also falling into that category are people who jump into low/null/wormhole space because "There's better ore/sites there", join faction warfare without knowing how to PvP properly, carry everything they own with them, afk in space, or allow someone to talk them into going into low/null space with them.\n\nYour actions dictate what happens to you in game. Want help learning how to survive in EVE? Look for a corp that is focused on what you want. Want to build stuff, find an indy corp. Want to kill stuff, talk to a PvP corp. If all else fails, see about getting into EVE University, they'll sort you out.\n\nAgain, if you're stupid enough to do any of the aforementioned stuff. YOU DESERVE TO DIE.\n\nWelcome to EVE, prepare Uranus!","March 16","true","63.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The developers are incredible, the community is like no other game I've ever seen, and the gameplay is unique. After playing EVE Online for a while I tried to find other enticing space-simulator games but none so far have even gotten close to being better than EVE Online.\n\nThe first time I played I started a corporation and although I wasn't "awoxed", one of my members had a large bounty on his head which caused bounty hunting coorporations to declare war on us. We sustained great losses and in the end ultimately had to disband. I stopped playing for a few months after that and have been on and off since.\n\nThis is not a game for casual gamers, this is an experience for gamers who want to be apart of a community.","May 18","true","556.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would play this game so much more but the monthly cost is the only holding me back. It has everything a Sci-Fi lover would want plus more. The entire market place is run by players, which is good and bad. You get galactic started by corporations for their own gain and can even have wars with other corporations over areas for control. All of this is player controlled. EvE has something for every player because if you just want to be playing the game by completing AI controlled missions you can. Want to just mine minerals to sell and make a massive profit you can do that.

The amount possible to do in the game is amazing. But without a lot of friends or the right corporation you can't do anything. You have to get lucky find the right people, then play the game for years. I am being serious years before you can do the big stuff, when you start you have nothing and the time based training system makes it impossible to catch up with the veterans.\n\nLike I said this game is complicated to understand, play, enjoy and get into. Though it's so simple in the matter that's it's a point click adventure which sucks a bag of ♥♥♥♥♥. I can't tell whether I like this game or not at this point. I have a character, that's worth over eight hundred dollars and can fly a titan. But that still means nothing unless you can find super dedicated players to play with. When I say play I mean you have to stay with these people for years. Try the trail before you buy this game.\n\nThe fact that it is hard to play and enjoy Eve Online has made most players disappear. The majority of new players hate the game and quit. The game requires long term dedication but doesn't give you satisfaction unless you have given that long term dedication making new players non existent. This makes the MMO unstable and veterans are also disappearing. Who wants to dedicate to a MMO that could disappear is no time?\n\nThis is coming from a pilot that has not put the long term dedication in but has received that long term satisfaction. Absolute best possible situation for a player and I am still weary about the game. Take this into heavy consideration, and choose wisely. Be careful and don't dump hundreds of dollars into the game, buying PLEX to buy a character.\n\n~ The biggest challenge of the game is finding a corp to experience the game with!","December 23, 2015","true","968.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

Everything in EvE takes an incredible amount of time, either you put in the time and effort and become attached or like most people you just walk away because as a GAME EvE is not fun.  EvE simply becomes exciting when you start having things to lose.\n\nLong version:\n\nEvE Online is more of a Fishing+Poker+Spreadsheet hybrid than a game of spaceships.  You usually have to endure hours of mind-numbing boredom to be rewarded with brief excitement.  The boredom can come from grinding away to have a little bit of income or from enduring 30+ 1-minute long warps across nearly identical - boring - solar systems.  At some point you'll finally have some things in the game that you feel attached to and then it becomes PvP......it's still like fishing but now it has poker elements.....you have something to lose and something to gain and other players are trying to outsmart you.....well, outsmart you or they've been playing for 10 years and a loss is so insignificant to these players that it's essentially win-win for them because they stand to lose .00001% of their wealth to you and that's worth any excitement/potential tears they can get (They'll always have a better hand and more of them and all the chips, good luck!).\n\nAnyway, spreadsheets!  EVERYTHING you do in this game is a spreadsheet with a space backdrop, most folks don't even recognize that there is a view of space.  Want to be a trader?  You dock in a station, open 2 or 3 spreadsheet views and spend all day staring at them, right clicking your orders and increasing them by .01 isk and then having 4 other people immediately up you by .01isk.  Want to run missions?  The spreadsheet is now a list of objects within about 400km of you, CTRL+Click the red things and click your gun icons then let math decide how much damage you do based on range+tracking speed+ a bunch of other things that you can enable as columns on your spreadsheet.  PvP combat?  Yup, just like mission spreadsheets but now you open an additional spreadsheet called the d-scan that shows you items >400km away so you can see what's coming to blow you up!\n\nThat's pretty much EvE summed up.  Yeah, you can make some friends and run a corp......or through 5+ years of effort you could be part of leadership of a sizeable alliance but that's just more spreadsheets with the addition of PR work.  They could call it real life simulator spaceship edition.","July 22, 2014","true","502.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The thing I love about this game is the amount of detail involved in almost everything, and keeping track of everything and preventing information overload can be challenging.  This game can only be recommended to the experienced MMORPG players in the crowed, and at that not to ones that have played strictly care bear types of games.  By background was from Everquest pre care bear days, back in the late 90's and early 2000's when dying meant you could lose all of you stuff.  That is an important distinction since in Eve the exact same can happen but with even worse odds of not recovering your gear.\nIn Eve your ships can get very expensive very fast, faster than the isk curve can keep up with.  Most will just buy a couple plex which they exchange on the market for the in game currency isk which is used in all purchases on the in game market.  This will allow them to fund one or two characters for the first little while to get the needed gear, unless you like grinding the old fashioned way for isk.  Most new players though will have issues with this since they want to get into the action right away, that just usually does not happen, unless you have connections already in the game world.\nThe learning curve is another element of the game that puts most people off, it is with out a doubt the worst in any game ever, yeah including old EQ.  You will be spending long hours reading forums and wikis trying to glean out every last bit of information that you can, especially after losing a few ships and wondering what is wrong with your fits.\nAnd keep in mind after the 21 day free trial your now paying for the privelage of being all the older players favorite new ganks, because that will happen unless you are lucky enough to fall into a good player run corp.  If you are an experienced player and love having to live a game in order to be in the top and receive the just rewards then this game is for you.  You understand that all of this can happen, but with lots of patience and at least 6 months to a years worth of skill training on your character.

I've joined mining fleets, recieved free ships from experienced players and made a fair few buddies too. I've also been suicide ganked more times than enough and learnt to insure anything I buy. Some of this may happen to you, it may not! Who knows!\n\nThe skill system is nice yet time consuming, I had to spend about 20+ IRL days in order to train the correct skills for a certain ship. The benefit is that they train whilst AFK so you don't have to worry about coming online all the time in order to continue progressing.\n\nThis game seems to ask for a lot of time and money to be invested in it before getting anything out of it and it definitely feels like more of a hobby/job instead of a game that you'd play casually.\n\nOverall, so far,  I'd recommend EVE to those willing to put the hours and dosh into it. It gets my seal of approval but it's not really a game for everyone and can be daunting for new players.\n\nAt the time of writing it's a free to try weekend (14-day trial included) so I'd say give it a go and see if you like it for yourself.","May 7","true","81.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Most of them will take new players and will help you learn how to play the game.\n\nI'd also say that you should not necessarily get caught up in the hype about the wars you always hear and try to join a "null-sec" corp right away (null-sec being the incredibly dangerous player owned areas of space). That part of the game is a lot different than high or low security system space and isn't for everyone. It's essentially like going to "ultra hard" mode.

Well actually, the game doesn't have much in the way of exploration, making money kind of burns down to having a bigger hold for ores. Or, you could join a mercanary group and participate in a hundred wars at the same time.\n\nIf you're just plain unlucky, soon after you join a random person will slap a ten million ISK bounty on your head for no reason (saw this happen.)\n\nI played for a bit, and most people I met and chatted with would talk about switching to their pirate accounts where they just trolled people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you attempt to take a risk, expect a pirate to come by and smash your ship for no reason.\n\nI'm quite used to losing everything over and over in troll-based games that'd never make it on Steam, and only left EVE after getting back into KSP, where the realistic physics simulation has ruined my ability to accept space physics in EVE.\n\nI do not recommend this game for one simple reason: There are no consequences for trolling so long as you have two different accounts, one for trolling and one for supplying the troll character with items he can no longer get after blasting every ship he runs across.","May 24, 2014","false","58.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

I have been playing the game for almost 10 years. And the game keeps delivering... That being said it's not to say that I don't take little breaks from the game over time. But I'm always active in training even if I'm not logging in every day.\n\nEve is a game with a little bit of a scary learning curve that some new players have a  hard time with. But for that there are 2 words (walls of text) of advice I have for you.\n\n#1 If you are a solo player.  The game has 0 Theme park learning or gaming style for the most part (small set of noob missions only). Most of eves solo play is DEFINED buy YOU. Eve gives you many different avenues (tools) and styles to play and has many things to do. Try to figure them out 1 by 1 and not get lost buy the shear amount of different things.\n\nIf you focus initially on how complex the game is more often then not a new player will get lost and overwhelmed. Or board from doing only the one task that you start off with. Take the game in stages and when you start to feel like your grinding in any way take time to look into different aspects of the game... The most important thing about this is that eve does not HAND HOLD or lead you into doing anything... even if there are many things to try and do.\n\nYou have to decide what to do and what to focus on buy yourself. If you don't like that type of play style then Eve might not be for you... UNLESS you can handle option number 2.\n\n#2. Don't play the game SOLO :) Eve has a very rich community and the most enjoyment for a lot of players is banding together and fighting for something. And that’s were we get to some of Eve's strongest points. Most MMO's have you fight for nothing more then gear and or a position on a leader board. Something that I as a long time gamer no longer have any interest in. fighting people for an item that you wear or your name on a list does not really impact the game or other people much if at all…\n\nThis is where Eve is different. In Eve you can OWN ships and structures that you can deploy in space. and best of all you can LOSE them all. This makes the game more meaningful and also promotes working together and having real goals. As after you learn about the small roll building your own structures in space is like you take it to the next level and TAKE OVER areas of space needing a team of people (corps-Guilds) and alliances or groups of alliances.  The space you take over needs to be defended from... anyone or everyone some times. You have to defend with structures and your own ships (fleets of ships your friends) ALL which can be lost and destroyed. So therefore you and your friends in game have an investment in what you do one that can be taken and destroyed if not defended.\n\nThis type of game play can hurt but it's also is the reason why most players are attracted to the game. What you do in game matters and can effect anywhere from one person to thousands. Some players are legends in the game. And just because your new does not mean that in some smaller circles or even larger one in time you cant be as well.  The wonderful thing about Eve is you dont have to be a legend if you dont want to be. You can strive to be great, or you can pick the roll of support where you make ammo and ships or mine, any number of behind the scenes rolls.\n\nThere is so much to say and learn about eve and its learning curve can be a little daunting. But the key to getting into a game like eve is understanding that you will have to LEARN how to play the game. The game will NOT hold your hand and make you progress from A to B to C. Instead it gives you  A B C D E F G H I etc. and says here you go figure it out have fun!\n\nAnd if that’s to involving for you then maybe eve is not for you and that does happen some people just can't handle that type of play style. But if all you see about the game peaks your interest. Remember that there are many players in eve that want you to stay and play and will take time to teach you. Also there are some evil guys in the game as well and there in game job is to make your life a living hell and blow up your stuff. Because that’s what the game is about. It not griefing its part of the game.\n\nSome of those people are actually nice people and are just playing a roll some are seriously ♥♥♥ hats lol.. but thats also part of the sandbox. Eve you can do almost anything. and you will die and lose stuff doing it so try and get used to death loss and how to avoid both.\n\n#3. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose. sorry thats 3 :)","May 6","true","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

This includes the recent free time they gave away on steam that could only be applied to a fresh steam account, despite them saying that you could apply it to an old account.

After being asked a ton what i thought of it by various people, I thought I would write this review based on my experiences.\n\nWhile I certainly had fun in it, the lack of any real sense of purpose just kills it. The systems in it are super slow and tedius to use, combat super slow and calculating, requiring a suprisingly small amount of skill, as everything is in the prep work and larger strategy.\n\nBasically, the way I see it, this is the kind of game that for me was best played before i knew what i was doing. Once I was told I really shouldn't be doing virtually everything i was doing, the game became entirely boring. While I was aimlessly wandering about and got podded by some dude, i laughed super hard. When i ran across a bunch of enemies i shouldn't be near and got killed in 2 hits, i found it fun. When i found missions for my own level after I started getting some decent-ish ships, the game came grinding down to a halt. Every mission was "check to see weaknesses, load out accordingly, target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait."\n\nI don't see this being a game I ever return to, but I don't regret my time in it either. It was radically different from any mmo i've tried before and I give it credit for that. That said, it just doesn't appeal to me much.\n\nShould you try it? I really do not know as I never got far enough into it to really experience all it has to offer. Would I personally reccomend the game to someone based off of what I played? No.","May 8","false","91.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/8500/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Reviewing MMO's is hard. Having people pay attention to those reviews is even harder. Yet I'm going to write one anyway:\n\nEVE is around 10 years old now and is showing no signs of slowing down. If anything, it is (probably) still expanding its player base. The reasons for this are many, but one thing that can certainly be said is that it is unlike most other MMO's out there due to the fact that it is a "sandbox" rather than "themepark" MMO. The latter-type of MMO, which includes most other MMO's out there (World of Warcraft being the most obvious), EVE is not about dungeon crawling or loot hunting or any of that sort of stuff. The "sandbox" of this game allows for an absurd, and honestly frightening, amount of options for how to play the game. There's PvE content for solo and groups, though admittedly this is easily the weakest and least interesting part of the game. The PvP environment is, on the other hand, arguably the most vibrant and violent of any other MMO out there. Fight scale from arranged one on one duels to massive battles involving thousands that have been noted by gaming and even mainstream news outlets on more than a few occasions. And then there's the market, full of complexity and opportunity in equal measure.\n\nIn other words, this game isn't very good solo. It's far better in groups and even moreso if you choose the right one for what you are wanting to do in the game. It is worth noting however that these groups have a double-edge to them not usually found in other games. Aside from hacking the game, RMT, and stuff like botting, there are virtually no rules on player content. This means theft and scamming are perfectly legal, which scares people away from this game but the reality of it is that you can only really get conned if you are careless or too trusting of bad people. I personally have never fallen for a scam, though some of the cleverer ones almost grabbed me early on. People can't just go into your hangars or wallet and steal all your stuff: You have to either put it in a place accessible to other people, like Corporate (Guild/Clan) hangars (think Guild Banks in WoW), or you have to actually hand your stuff over to someone else without realizing you are falling for a trick.\n\nThe other side of this lack of rules is that this game has a metagaming scene unlike any other. The individual scams and steals from hapless victims, but the corporations and alliances have full-blown intelligence networks. Espionage is a very real thing here, and the great heists you may have heard about where someone steals gigantic amounts of stuff are, more often than not, agents of another group specifically sent to spy and eventually take everything that isn't nailed down. Or it can be a high-ranking officer who decides to rage-quit and just steal stuff on the way out. Eiher way you only will personally lose stuff if you allow it to happen.\n\nThis game does have flaws. The potential for theft with few consequences creates a culture of paranoia that some might find really annoying to deal with. The spaceship gameplay is often boring, with the PvE content being the worst offender. The public channels, like every other MMO, are often filled with idiots who just spam garbage. The learning curve is notoriously high, and the sheer amount of things there are possible to do can easily overwhelm a new player. The game's skill training system, while good in that it lets a player make progress even while not playing the game, makes it take some time before you can truly get to where you want to be. And lastly, as with all MMO's, tedium and grindy activities are inevitable. This may be an MMO unlike most others, but it is still an MMO. You should think long about whether or not to jump into this game, because it  can become extremely difficult to pay proper attention to this game and others at the same time.\n\nBut, I like it. If I was forced to play an MMO, it would be this one.\n\nSo if this overlong review didn't make you flee, you can check out a free 21-day trial. Speaking of free, it is entirely possible, if you make enough in-game currency on a regular basis, this game can be a free-to-play MMO. Perhaps not for the first few months, but it is very possible, once you are established, to never have to pay real money for this game again.

This mix of skills and traits combined with your ship, ships bonuses and the equipment you choose to slot effects what kind of role you decide to play.\n\nNeedless to say the many menus, massive game map, dozens of factions, ratings, reputation let alone the controls are pretty staggering at first.

The reason for this existing is that Eve Online, simply put, struck gold at the time. And as such, the producers and everyone financially involved in the game are utterly terrified of increasing any kind of spending or significant change.\n\nIt has an incredibly dumb and seemingly 98% automated combat with no real actual freedom of movement, most design decisions made for the game are overly complex methods of developing certain systems and methods of doing things which while something i can personally enjoy since I've been around for quite some time, It shows that the developers are struggling under both pressure from compatibility of current times and producers. Another note is that this game is more expensive to subscribe for one month than it is to buy a new copy. And that's quite frightening.\n\nIn short, Eve Online as of right now, is an unfocused pile of garbage, trying to draw out It's filthy breath for as long as possible before everyone paying for it suddenly realize that everything they see and experience are over 10+ year old byproducts of engine limitations and as described above, It will continue to do so until the cost to gain ratio declines. The "official" set in place deadline for Eve to cease existing is in about 20-30 years according to CCP.","May 13, 2015","false","321.9"," 89 of 177 people (50%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","50","89","177","11","1"

Customizable in every way, no limit to how many windows you can have open, all the text is small and sleek, hotkeys for everything etc.... Just feels and looks great.\n\n-Freedom: This game is a true Sandbox, you get thrown into space, there are no classes etc, you train in whatever you want so you become the kind of pilot you want. You can explore wormholes, scan down old space archaeological sites to get loot. You can be a pirate and gank people just for the hell of it and take their stuff. You can be a bounty hunger or a miner or be part of a huge corporation playing the politics and trading goods on the market and much much more.\n\nNow for why I do not play the game haha.\nI have plaid this game off and on for years now and the reasons I stop playing are always the same.\n\n1. This game requires a large time investment to really have fun, you can get in and run a quick mission in half an hour. However to really do anything worth doing you are talking 6-9 hours.\n\n2. The skill system is setup so that you have your character studying a skill book and they study that in real time. This is great because they keep on studying when you are at work etc... However because of this you do not feel any real drive or reason to play the game. Other then making ISK (which is the in game currency) and once you have enough isk you really run out of reasons to play. This could be easily solved by making it so that as you reach certain goals in the game or accomplish certain missions etc... to speeds up your study time but there is no feature like this so you eventually just get bored and lose any drive to play when you realize you need to wait 2 weeks before you can get your new gun or ship no matter how much you play.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? yes, great game. Do I think you are going to keep on playing it? no, you will most likely have a love/hate relationship like myself and every other person I know.","January 22, 2014","true","394.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The ideas, theorys, lore, and community are all great.  But, man does break your spirit sometime :P.  It's not a game for the faint of heart or who like to lead by a carrot on a stick.\n\nThey give you the freedom to build empires but expect you to figure out how gather the resources, how use them, and how keep them safe as the game won't do any of it for you and you can't do it alone either so trust plays a large role as well.\n\nSo who this game is not for.\n#1 Solo players.  You'll probably end up feeling like you're never getting ahead since to do a lot of things you'll want people around you or even need them.\n#2 People who need direction.  While you can get it you have to find it first.  The game does some simple tutorials of a lot of the paths in the game but then basically lets you go of the bike for you to ride it the first time without training wheels.  You'll either fall or find your way.  There are no lvls, no real restrictions on where you can in which ships, or anything like that.\n#3 Impatient people.  You can't power lvl your way to the top in this game.  While skills won't make or break you they do accumulate over time(not based on your actions other than making sure you have some queued up).  So you won't be able to do everything perfectly anytime soon and it will take you awhile to do anything perfectly but that doesn't mean you're useless for month.  The oposite really.  You just may be stuck with a job you didn't imagine starting out in a PVP corp for example but your role will be vital trust me.  Sure you can buy characters(within the rules of the game) but well they aren't cheap and you'll probably fall on your face because you lack the knowledge to use them right.\n\nNo matter what though remember you can change waht you want to do at anytime(or create alts if you want to do more than one thing at a time starting out would be my recommendation).  So if you started out wanting to be miner but find it boring simply stop mining!  Sure some skill points will go to waste but don't get lost a goal that's not meant for you.  On that note I would recommend saving your first remap until you find that thing that draws you ;).","March 23, 2014","true","339.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Customizable in every way, no limit to how many windows you can have open, all the text is small and sleek, hotkeys for everything etc.... Just feels and looks great.\n\n-Freedom: This game is a true Sandbox, you get thrown into space, there are no classes etc, you train in whatever you want so you become the kind of pilot you want. You can explore wormholes, scan down old space archaeological sites to get loot. You can be a pirate and gank people just for the hell of it and take their stuff. You can be a bounty hunger or a miner or be part of a huge corporation playing the politics and trading goods on the market and much much more.\n\nNow for why I do not play the game haha.\nI have plaid this game off and on for years now and the reasons I stop playing are always the same.\n\n1. This game requires a large time investment to really have fun, you can get in and run a quick mission in half an hour. However to really do anything worth doing you are talking 6-9 hours.\n\n2. The skill system is setup so that you have your character studying a skill book and they study that in real time. This is great because they keep on studying when you are at work etc... However because of this you do not feel any real drive or reason to play the game. Other then making ISK (which is the in game currency) and once you have enough isk you really run out of reasons to play. This could be easily solved by making it so that as you reach certain goals in the game or accomplish certain missions etc... to speeds up your study time but there is no feature like this so you eventually just get bored and lose any drive to play when you realize you need to wait 2 weeks before you can get your new gun or ship no matter how much you play.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? yes, great game. Do I think you are going to keep on playing it? no, you will most likely have a love/hate relationship like myself and every other person I know.","January 22, 2014","true","394.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PWNnies/recommended/8500/","PWNnies","Bob from Human Resources","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PWNnies/","184 products in account","Home to world record breaking PvP battles in terms of player participation and monetary losses, Eve Online is a polarizing PvP centric MMO that players will either love or hate. Especially new players; most will hate it while some will love it. While commonly described as an MMO and sandbox, a more accurate description of Eve Online may be that it is an economic simulator wrapped in a political simulator with “roguelite” elements. While initially intimidating to new players and overall unforgiving, especially endgame, Eve Online’s developer CCP has created a meritorious masterpiece that has received a bounty of awards since its inception.\n\nThe pace of the game will be off-putting to the majority of potential and new players. Unlike the majority of other MMO’s, acquiring new skills and abilities in Eve Online happens in real time; there is no experience to be gained by completing missions or killing rats (NPC’s). Training new skills will take a given amount of time in Eve online, but may be altered by changing a pilot’s attributes, by utilizing implants, which affect training time. Skills in Eve Online may take merely minutes to train or may take months. In ARPG’s, the point of the game is to acquire new, better, and rarer loot. During endgame, the new loot may augment the game in some facets, especially in the case of Path of Exile, but general gameplay elements (endlessly killing monsters) and those of the player’s chosen class largely remain the same creating stale, repetitive gameplay. The seemingly endless amount of skills to train in Eve Online means that there will almost always be something new to do in-game which functions similarly, yet superiorly, to loot in an ARPG.\n\nGameplay in Eve Online is unique and very much different from other MMO’s; a player cannot move his/her ship using WSAD. Instead, you give commands to your ship, such as “orbit at 30 km,” “approach,” “warp to,” etc. However, you can still double click anywhere in space and your ship will head in that direction. This lack of freedom of movement will also be unappealing to many, but it allows for more tactical gameplay especially in PvP.\n\nPvP is heavily strategy based; an expensive ship can still lose to a relatively cheap one. PvP requires not only an in depth knowledge of what the function is of each ship, but the synergy amongst them. Also, it requires that a pilot know what modules to best fit his/her ship. However, a pilot’s individual mistakes and lack of understanding of the game may be made up for by other players, since PvP battle may consist of several thousand players.\n\nTime Dilation (TiDi), is heralded by CCP as a triumph to reduce lag in epic, expansive battles involving thousands of players. TiDi supposedly reduces the passage of time in the system, where the battle is occurring by up to ten percent as to reduce the stress on the server’s hardware. CCP decided to introduce this so that things players did in the battle would not be processed out of order. However, players who have experienced TiDi will report that actions that would have taken no more than ten seconds instead take between several minutes and up to twenty minutes to complete.\n\nPlayers are arranged into corporations, corporations may thus be arranged into alliances, alliances may thus be arranged into coalitions; all of which revolve around the economy. These arrangements allow for complex player run governments. These governments vie for control of various systems across the galaxy for the right to harvest various resources. Almost everything in-game can be made by players and then be sold on various markets. Unlike other MMO’s, such as World of Warcraft, the market in Eve Online utilizes a brokerage system akin to that of the stock market.\n\nCCP allows controversial actions such as extortion, thievery, espionage, and scamming in Eve Online. If a player were to do any of these in the majority of other MMO’s, he/she would be facing a permanent ban. These controversial actions fit well into the governmental arrangement of players as well into the occurrences of wars.\n\nThe effects of PvP are wide reaching; they can be felt across the game. Such was the case of the costliest battle in Eve Online history; B-R5RB. Prices in in-game markets, especially those in the main trade hub in Jita, fluctuated more than normal allowing traders to secure large profits.\n\nPLEX (Pilot’s License Extension) in Eve Online is analogous to gold in the modern world; PLEX is what determines the worth of ISK. Also, much like gold, the value of PLEX fluctuates. PLEX is an in-game item equivalent to thirty days of game time. It can be bought in-game with ISK, hauled to various markets, and sold. It can also be purchased for twenty dollars. Comparatively, a one month subscription that is instantly activated on an account (not PLEX) costs fifteen dollars. While not free to play, it is more than possible to play Eve Online without having to open a wallet, although this will most likely be difficult in the first few months of a new player’s account.\n\nWhile not often addressed, Eve Online utilizes many roguelike elements and thus, may be classified as a roguelite. Ships may cost tens of billions of ISK and when they are destroyed in battle, the pilot lose ISK which translates to a few thousand dollars (USD) lost. Those ships take real time to make; potentially thousands of man hours to make and months of waiting for it to roll off of a production line. When they are destroyed, they are gone. There is no respawn; they no longer exist. The most expensive ships are titans, the Death Stars of Eve Online, are worth approximately three thousand dollars. When a ship is destroyed in Eve Online, a pod is ejected containing the pilot. Should a pilot be unable to escape in his/her pod and be killed in battle, he/she loses a clone which may have billions of ISK in implants. The most harrowing of losses, due to mistakes, involve pilots not updating their medical clones to retain the skill points they’ve trained. Should a pilot fail have failed upgrade the clone and be killed, he/she stands to lose millions of skill points which may have taken months to train.\n\nAnyone one can be ganked anywhere by other players. Whether a pilot actively engages in PvP or simply mines asteroids, he/she can be ganked. Systems in Eve Online are assigned a security status. Depending on the security status, the in-game NPC police force, known as CONCORD, may respond and aid the victim by attempting to destroy the aggressor.\n\nPlayers are most often drawn into the game by the epic, lurid tales they hear of massive battles, espionage, or betrayal. Eve Online is a massive game. While events do occur like these on a daily basis, they are rather uncommon. As a result, many players do not make it past the trial version or tutorial because of this realization, whatever or whoever made them decide to try Eve Online made no mention of the incredibly slow pace, or the unusual and very different gameplay style.\n\nEve Online is not perfect; no game is. Developer CCP has claimed through its public relations that TiDi is indeed necessary and successful in its purpose. Despite these flaws CCP has done many things right. According to the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2014, the battle of 6VDT-H in Eve Online reached a total of 4,070 pilots fighting simultaneously, making it the largest PvP battle in history. CCP is one of the few MMO’s that welcomes immoral actions into its core gameplay. Eve Online is a game in which there is an incredible amount of depth as is evident by the way players produce goods, the manner that player governments who want to do so must hold their own territory in which the resources to do so reside, the in-game economy, and the strategies utilized by players in PvP. While the pace will be appalling to some, Eve Online warrants a try from all.","March 6, 2014","true","405.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've played EVE off and on since 2004, and there's simply nothing quite like it. The freedom of choice and play style is unprecidented. The freedom CCP gives you over the game world is also unheard of in an MMO.\n\nYou wanna join a corporation(clan) and scam them out of everything they own? Go for it. Try that in most other games and good luck getting your account unbanned. Play space pirate? Sure. Beg for ISK till the cows come home? ♥♥♥♥ you, but ok, that's up to you. Missions, mining, exploring, scamming, freight hauling, trading... what ever you want.\n\nA lot of people feel overwhelmed by this game. They see a lot of menus, a lot of what looks like doing nothing, or the lack of twitch based ship controls. So they pass it over, make fun of it even. Parroting insults they've heard online about EVE. If the game isn't your style, that's one thing. At least give it a shot. In reality it's probably the "best" MMO from an objective viewpoint. Just given all the stuff it lets you do, and the heights you can reach.\n\nAnother interesting thing about EVE is that for many, the game has ceased being pay to play. In game if you can earn enough in game money, you can simply buy Pilot License Extensions and keep playing your account. Or buy PLEX outside the game yourself with real money and list them on the forums or in game to rake in the ISK.\n\nThe game is constantly changing as well. Always with free expansions.\n\nI truely love this game and what it represents for those who play it. Can't recommend it enough.","January 30, 2015","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have tons of stuff to do. Even if you think you won’t play the game when you buy it, you actually do and won’t stop. When you first start playing, you will have to play the game for at least 10 or 15 hours, just for the basics. Learning all of the stuff will take a lot of your time, probably months.\n\nThere are lots of ways to play this game. You can find wrecks in space which you can loot, go fight with other people / AI, mine for precious ores, trade, customize your ship (customization is perfect) start a corporation, use planets for your own behalf. I can just go on and on. There is at least 1 thing to do for everyone.\n\nNow, don't let the monthly subscription scare you away. If you complete the tutorial and if you know what you are doing (and probably get some people to help you, the community is great) you can buy PLEX with in-game currency: ISK.\n\nAt the end, I had a lot of fun playing this game and if I continued playing I’m sure I would have 200+ hours in a short amount of time. I recommend trying this out with the starter packs first and if you really like it, get a subscription. I know my reviews aren’t the best but I try to give my friends, or even people who check the community page, some info about the game.

Alot of people search out the null sec alliances and what not when they start eve because they heard of some huge battle and want to take part in something like that now sure yeah you might find some corp thats in some powerfull alliance or coalition that will take you in but most of the people ive come across that got into some of the bigger alliances in null were just used as a suicicde tackle without any guidness or tips how to get started or how to get those shiny t2 lasers they want and honestly null sec can be a very dull place for example lets say youre just killing some rats near or at your home system to make some isk and you see 2 or 3 neutral capsuleers enter the system and youre forced to dock up because if they find you your ceo or someone else higher up in the corp is gona grind you because it looks bad on their killboard or you get into a bigger brawl and dont get me wrong those can be fun up to a point where TIDI kicks in so hard it takes you an hour to just warp to something so yeah null isnt very fun place to be at least for me and specially since CCP turned it into a tug of war. My advice for new players is to stay in hi sec dont rush geting into big corps stay in your NPC corp and meet some people hang out in factions chats and others theres some good people to meet there and read item descriptions its very easy to get around fitting your ship or figuring out how to build something just by asking someone for some help with it or just reading descriptions and checking out tutorial and try out diferent stuff and find what you like the best not what will get you most isk in certain amount of time or fullfilling someones requests just for braging rights of being in some known corp also dont aproach eve with the mindset "oh its this huge complicated thing that will take you monts to figure out" on contrary eve can be easy to comperhand just by reading items descriptions and pay attention to tutorial that explains some basic mechanics most of the other stuff youll either learn through trial and error or simply by talking to people now the comunity i find is one of the best mmo comunitys ive ever come across tho it has its trolls and bu++hurts and whatnot but aside from HI sec wardecers camping trade hubs and some goons theyre pretty rare. also for both new players and veterans try out roleplaying corps its quite easy and can make eve so much more enjoyable just imagine doing an op fully in character.\n\nOverall eve can be a great game for you or the most dreadfull one youve come across it all depends on how you aproach it really. and one last tip dont think of eve as a second job of some sort with doing multiple characters just to get that operation running on your own or depend alot on out of game information and tools one alt is all you need really just to be in the wh if youre living in one to scan your self back in if you lock your self out or something.\nfly safe out there o7","November 12, 2015","true","714.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

This is why you pretty much cant trust anyone in EVE, the one you are talking to could be a spy account too. Nobody treats their characters seriously, because the players categories their accounts into combat roles/industrial roles/spies. They try to eliminate a lot of multiplayer role playing experience by completing most activities within their main and alts instead of socializing with others.\n\nIf each player has at least 2/3 alt accounts, the amount of 'real pilots' in that universe is far less than you think. If you want to pvp with players who exploit multiboxing; be a professional miners with full of afks in the corp, less interactive and dishonest community, you are at the right place.\n\nEve Online is not a true MMORPG, its just some random MMO.

This is why you pretty much cant trust anyone in EVE, the one you are talking to could be a spy account too. Nobody treats their characters seriously, because the players categories their accounts into combat roles/industrial roles/spies. They try to eliminate a lot of multiplayer role playing experience by completing most activities within their main and alts instead of socializing with others.\n\nIf each player has at least 2/3 alt accounts, the amount of 'real pilots' in that universe is far less than you think. If you want to pvp with players who exploit multiboxing; be a professional miners with full of afks in the corp, less interactive and dishonest community, you are at the right place.\n\nEve Online is not a true MMORPG, its just some random MMO.

An accurate THIS IS EVE video should show an EVE Player with lots of open windows that display data you use to do basic operations most games manage to display in sector lists or on radars in seconds.\n\nThe basic design of the game that of a box containing space with your ship and other limited objects in it that you right click on and choose an action to perform or select and click a button to do stuff too it. Despite the steep learning curve the game is very simple, in a hard to follow or understand kind of way. The hard to follow aspect is why such a simple idea hads a steep learning curve.\n\nIt may be popular but its design is pretty poor and the steep learning curve comes from its interface being ♥♥♥♥ poor.\n\nI was really looking forward to this but the excitement drained out of me the second I realised this was a management game and not the space game all the movies and screenshots say it is.\n\nI will recommend 1 thing for those who get it, ignore the 4 career path tutorials, they are so badly explained you need a tutorial to understand those tutorials.

The tutorials ease you into the basics and are a lot better now than they used to be.  Do them all, don't miss any and at the end of them you will have some useful skills, more skillbooks waiting to be activated and a few frigates along with a destroyer if you complete the advanced combat tutorial.  Also, don't skip the mission text.  Many new players get stuck because they couldn't be bothered reading.  After the tutorials take a breather, relax, sit back and really think about what you want to achieve because specialisation is key.  If you want to make millions as a miner then take the time to look at which ships are specialised for that career, what skills you need to fly it and what skills you need to equip it correctly, like the ability to control drones etc.\n\nThe most useful piece of advice I can give is to find a good corp.  Don't be shy, put yourself out there.  Find a corp that will help you realise your vision and in turn you will become a vital part of theirs.

They've been doing it for a while, and it's great.\n\nThat being said though, money is pretty useful, and those game time tokens (PLEX) sell for a handsome margin on the market, so I can see where folks think there's a pay to win aspect to the game.\n\nSpeaking of the market, almost everything in this game is build, sold and harvested by the players, no NPC vender nonsense.

It's also an extraordinary social experiment, there is little to no interference from the devs, everything from the economy to player interaction, PVP, PVE are left to player interaction.  The community can be ruthless, acerbic and down right nasty bordering on total griefing at times.  But how you deal with what is thrown at you is what makes this game special.  The guy that just ganked you in high sec space may rankle you intially and may even cause you to rage quit.  Eve is about options, there are options to deal with this griefing upstart, form an alliance, hunt him down, make his life miserable...declare war on his corporation.

The community is also great.\n\nEverything you do, creates ripples accross the universe, even something as simple as buying and selling items on the market. Being a director level spy in another alliance or coalition. Being the newbro who tackles a titan in a merlin, enabling his entire fleet to destroy it.\n\nThere's simply so much you can do in eve, its pretty hard getting bored. Your experience depends on what you want to make of the game essentially. You can mine all day in highsec or you could go to  null sec, or low sec and PVP. On the other hand you can do other forms of PVE that are more enjoyable, like exploration, incursions etc. There is no instant gratification in eve, takes time to get decent at the game.\n\n\n","May 8","true","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a pointless waste of time and can best be summarised as 'Waiting for days to elapse in space'\n\nYes, there is clearly a 'real world economy' and my God is it....probably detailed. Oh and the ships! Everything is generated in game, if there is something you see....a player built it! Isn't that amazing?!\n\nThese are the things that drew me to EVE, however after spending 25 hours, over a solid day of my actual life on this garbage I am about as close and involved to the EVE economy as a 25 hour old baby would be to the human one.\n\nIt's spreadsheets and being a dickh*ad in space. There really is very little nuance beyond this. The whole thing plays like a space stock trader game....ok not the end of the world, right? I still think I could get into that, hopefully there is some action and excitement to make it 'feel' like a game whilst you are actually gathering resources to trade, right? Nope, for all this 'It's a griefing paradise' that I was promised, I barely saw another ship.\n\n25 hours in, few other ships, few missions - lots of clicking around and waiting for actual time to elapse to build my skills up. That's another thing worth considering - this game charges a monthly fee. You can only 'level up' by waiting. Not even waiting 'in game' time, waiting real life, human hours that you could spend walking your dog, shouting at your wife or playing anything that isn't this drab attempt at making Excel fascinating. You get better exclusively by paying them money, and waiting.\n\nI wanted the sweet economy thing to be true so badly. I even talked down other MMOs because 'EVE has this amazing online economy' and it does, it's clearly going on. I have never come across a game less accessible than this. EVE fans tout this as though it's some great selling point, however I think what's actually going on is people who have invested thousands of hours into this dross now need to convince themselves that it wasn't time wasted.\n\nIf you haven't already invested a thousand hours, and if you're in any way normal, just don't bother. Jesus Christ this is tedious.\n\nIf you've got a thousand hours, £120 and a strong desire to be part of the biggest game of spreadsheets in the world, then yeah you can probably watch your summer vanish whilst living your life in fake space.","March 21","false","25.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","11","23","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3825GE/recommended/8500/","3825GE","SwagLag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3825GE/","136 products in account","First to get this outta the way with, I AM aware of the sickening gankers, and other types of socialpathic mischaps, but lets get this outta the way with, because i've been flooded by messages about how this game is.\n\nThis game should be considered something not easy to accomplish. The game is a pay2pay game, if you don't follow: After you pay for a starter pack on steam, you must pay monthly subscriptions, or try getting an item named "PLEX" (Pilot License EXtension.)\n\nFor those who don't know what PLEX is, and how expensive it is read on below:\n\n- PLEX is an item which allows you to gain one month of gametime or to be redeemed for one of the rewards below:\n- Gain 3500 AURUM, a currency which allows you to buy Ship skins, and Character clothing, and other services (see below)\n- Gain 30 days of a "Multiple Training Certificate". If multiple characters are used (to a max of 3) on a single account, and you want to train both characters, the "Multiple Training Certificate" gives you an additional training queue. Under  no circumstances you may train 2 skills at once on a single character.\n\nNow that PLEX is out of the way with, i want to talk about the statistics of how money is being made, and how easy this "PLEX" is availible to get.\n\n"PLEX" at the moment of writing scales from 1 Billion "ISK" (Ingame Currency: InterStellar Kredit), to 1.5 Billion "ISK". "ISK" is relatively easy to get in small numbers (especially with project exploration, if youre willing to be bored to death), but getting something about 1 Billion in ISK is something very hard to accomplish.\n\nIt is very hard to explain how this game works (VEEERRRYYY STEEEEEEPPP LEARNING CURVE), but as far as i know, theres 4 main roles in the game (as stated in special edition tab):\n\n- You can be a skirmisher, who runs through "combat sites" to eliminate bad ships (PvE) and gain loot in exchange. I am not familiar with this, because i never took this path.\n- You can be an explorer, someone who traces down space anomalies (Wormholes, Data sites: Read down below, Relic Sites), "hack" the sites, and gain (expensive) loot in exchange. This is quite a hard path to go down, because it takes a lot of money to get the equipment to be prepared for this.\n- You can be a colonist (youre not really "the colonist"), which "colonizes" (more kinda industrialises) planets and exploits them in order to gain materials, which can be processed at the planet into end-products, which are worth quite a couple of ISK on the market.\n- You can be a industrialist, which mines asteroids (ore can be sold directly) for use in blueprints, whereoff the end product results in either a ship, a module, or whatever you can come up with, as long as its nothing out of the ordinary (Special (event) loot)\n\nBut its quite hard to get started as i stated before. It takes a lot of time to get the starting skills trained (Skill system), even with the Prototype Cerebum you'll get from start (A one-time use item, which you can't buy, which speeds up training speed considerably). Training times can scale up to 1 MONTH, which basically means you should've either sold your "PLEX" by then (to speed up using skill injectors, for ~667 MILLION ISK) or you would've used your first "PLEX" by then.\n\nSo, i wouldn't recommend this to the average player, unless youre sitting on a pile of cash, and you want to pay your first 12 months training skills using the subscription system. DO NOT (unless you want a lot of ISK at once) BUY PLEX, because its a LOT more expensive than actually taking a subscription.","April 17","false","16.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You can have a small fighter and take down a titan (after a few hours of using really high level shield boosters and repair modules with very powerful weapons. This event is very unlikely to occur.) You can even lead a space terrorist organisation! (I would not recomend it though. Bounties pile up fast. I got a 21,000,000 ISK bounty on my head in 2 days. That is what happens when you get too cocky) You can even terraform planets!!!!!!!!! And make profit off of that. I am just gonna sumarize this all up with: This is basicly the space stage of spore with a heck of alot more stuff, and less cartoony, and with humans. Did I mention nearly every item in this game is player made and you can lead an army that has the possibility to take over the universe?","May 4, 2014","true","48.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

With one of the best economy set ups in MMO history, EVE lets you pursue careers as miners, crafters, traders, pirates, and a number of other things.\n\nMassive Alliances battle over sections of space, and you can be part of that.   There is a huge array of ships to choose from, ranging from the small scae Frigates and Destroyers up to the big boys that have been known to cause grown men to cry when they lose their ship.\n\nEVE is a great MMO if you're into just crafting, harvesting, trading, piracy, or just massive space battles.","November 27, 2013","true","97.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is really like no other. I have seen and experienced things that I have never in any other massive multiplayer game. I tip my hat to CCP in their ongoing development of this title. A decade strong, and they are still pumping out one or two expansions per year.\n\nNow, what to actually say about this game. You spend your first week playing the game learning the basics of how to navigate through New Eden, but the learning doesn't stop there. When I say basics, I really mean the basics. Once, you're released into to universe you come out with a puffed chest and you feel like the world is your oyster (and it really can be!). You jump into a corporation or you start one, and you begin your journey. You, the player, are in control of everything that you decide to do. You can train up your security-based skills and head out on missions to burn pirates & and make some ISK. OR you can head off into the pvp realm of the game and bring chaos and disorder amongst your fellow capsuleers. Maybe you have a mind for business so you set up contracts and buy/sell orders on the market, and rake in the ISK. Maybe you like to work and explore, so you load up your mining/salvage vessel and you head out into the far reaches of space and look for the "mother-load". It's really all up to you, and that is just part of what makes EVE such a fantastic game.\n\nThen there's the under side of the coin. Flip that over and you find that you have not only opened Pandora's box, but you are neck deep in the worst way. Remember that oyster that you thought was yours at the end of your training days? Yeah, you find that you don't want it anymore. You hate it. You despise it. EVE Online is a great game to play, and the things I listed out earlier really are fun and prosperous, but those same exact things are what can get you into trouble. That's right, this game is so community driven, and cut-throat that you never know who to trust out in the stars. You could have a really great operation going, but if you irk the wrong person or even maybe just pass by the wrong person at the wrong time, then you could potentially watch everything that you've done crumble before your very eyes. Now, this may really make you think, "Yeah, I don't want that to happen. So what's the point if you are just going to lose it all?" I agree, it sounds so wrong, and unappealling, but you have to accept that eventually your empire will crumble into ash. The beauty of it though is that this happens to everyone. No one in EVE Online is a god amongst ants. Sometimes, you'll see a situation that feels that way, but there will always be someone else who will topple everything over. It's all a matter of how you take your steps, and how you act accordingly.\n\nAll in all, I know that this game isn't for everyone, but I at least encourage everyone to give it a shot for a couple months. If you don't like it and you can't handle the cut-throat aspects of the game, then that's fine. We understand, and it's probably best that you aren't among us. Otherwise, if you find that you really like the game and want to amass your fleets to take on all of New Eden, then well, all I have to say is\n\nWelcome to the stars.\n\n-Evalyn Vaeltros, CEO\nModal Auxiliaries","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

As the value of ores and materials change, so do the costs of ships, equipment and items, a true inspirational community market of unsurpassed genius and integrity. No one person dominates the the market. With thousands of places to shop, 4 player driven / founded market sectors, players will have no problems finding the resources or items they need at a reasonible price.\n\nReal Skills / Real Time / Real Changes:\n\nIn Eve there are no levels, there are no experience points for destroying enemy AI's or players, there is simply time and money, as you go around killing other ships and players their ingame money system (ISK) is token to you in bounties and rewards depending upon who and what you kill. Reputation is your experience in Eve, for everything you do, if felt positively in the nation you fight for, and negatively in the nation you fight against. Skills in the game drive how quickly and how effectively you use items and ships in the game. Having more than 1,000 skills, each requiring real world time to develope, but have no fear even the time you are logged off of Eve still contributes to the learning process of skills. 30 Days of Membership means 30days of Skill Training provided you log in to change your queue of skills being learned.\n\nReal Skills / Real Time / Real Consequences:\n\nSkills aren't everything, how you setup your ship, events that play out on the battlefield, and the people you fly with can change everything, in Eve, even the most robust and wealthiest player can be taken down by the most noobish and uncoordinated player depending upon how you play.\n\nUnparrelled PvP Fleets and Squad Honor:\n\nEve Onlines PvP Fleet / Squad System is known far and wide for its companionship, real world leaders of both men, experienced and unexperienced, leading people into the fray, giving orders and handling issues while under pressure define some of the best combat experience fleet organization and player PvP Battles you will ever immerse yourself in. There is only one rule, The Fleet Commander says Jump, you jump, and don't jump early, don't jump late, and whatever you do, don't rebel, or you'll find yourself in a pod, slow boating it back to secure space praying you remembered to upgrade your clone.\n\nRating:\nNot for Level Junkies, not for young players intent on showing off, Eve is for the mature, action driven player that wants to change something in the world. There is only one server and your choices are felt across it like a stone in a pool of water. Will they be good choices, or will they be bad, who's to say, join the Eve Online Community today and find out for yourself.","November 16, 2014","true","468.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's very little story, other then the stock "MMO" story, and you'll mostly aimlessly float around, in you're tiny part of the galaxy, talking to people while you mine for 6 hours, then skirmish with npcs, die from players, and move packages from one base to the other.  Very minimal, almost along the lines of the current "Survival" genre, where they add a bunch of cool things, and you're just kinda waiting for the rest of the game to come out.  A great game.

I could accept paying 30-40 $ for the game upfront and even give 10-20 $ a year for major expansions but spending 15 $ per month or 130 $ a year is just too much.

And that is a strong maybe. A very strong maybe. Such a strong maybe that if they had a maybe tab I would choose it. I would also choose the "Pay a monthly fee to get your ship blown to bits by some useless prick coward" tab as well. If they had a "Then spend the next few weeks trying to get your ship back to what it was just to have some prick NPC blow it out of the sky because the warning they gave you lasted 0.1 seconds" tab. I would also pick the "then get hounded by dickless wonders when you ask what happened because you should have known because they knew" tab.\n\n\nget what I am saying....\n\nTo enjoy the game stay away from useless prick cowards.

While it is true that new players may never accumulate the same total number of skillpoints that older players have, everyone can gain the skillpoints necessary to fill a particular role exactly as well as those old players can. Age allows you to branch out more expertly, but a level 5 certified Interceptor pilot will get the same results with their ship whether their character has 5 million skillpoints or 150 million. And for people with limited play time, there is no fear of being left behind by those who would otherwise "grind" their way to the top in a traditional MMO. The system has it's good and bad points, so it's really better to think of it simply as being different.\n\n2) The players. EVE encourages competition at every level, in every aspect of the game. This naturally makes people competitive outside the game as well, on forums, blogs, and news sites. This is not meant as an excuse, merely an explanation, as to why EVE players seem more monolithically hostile. Whatever you do in the game, there are almost certain to be other players trying to beat you at it, which makes finding the right people to play with far more important than it is in other MMO's.\n\n3) The combat. I can only echo  the rebuttal linked here, and say that if you find the PvP combat boring, you've never actually experienced it. To this day no other game has given me the same sort of adrenaline rush you get when your ship is on the line in EVE and only your skill at piloting can win the day.\n\nI recommend this game for a particular kind of gamer. EVE has a rich history, a strange fabric, and a thick shell, and it's rewards are consummate with the amount of effort you put into walking your own path through it's universe. For those who are dedicated (or disturbed) enough to seek it out, there is no other experience like it.","June 1, 2014","true","91.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I WANT to like this game.  The graphics are beautiful and the universe is MASSIVE.  However, while I'm playing I get the feeling that I'm missing something.  I honestly feel like I would like this game a lot more if I had direct control of my ship.  Since everything is coordinate/location based in this game, you're stuck with pre-defined areas to explore.  I just want to point my ship in one direction and fly.  It's good for when I'm spacing out and want to play a game 1-handed so it's not all bad.","January 6, 2014","true","45.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This daunting giant of a game has been around the internet for as long as most people can recall and this beast still continues to keep tearing at boundaries.\n\nThe basic premise of this game is "You are a space pilot, you are in space, you're pretty rad now." but to say that's where it ends would be insulting as there are too many things to even list in a mere review meant for a brief read for some form of idea.\n\nA more accurate description is that you're a space pilot in a constantly changing galaxy that litterally evolves and changes based on what the community itself are doing within it: Sectors can be claimed or lost for factions, mine deposits can be exausted in certain areas, pirates can come for you when you least expect it, you can be a bounty hunter that hunts down other players or be the bounty yourself, making yourself feared throughout the galaxy!\n\nThat alone was enough for me to buy into this and yet, more new features are constantly being added to this (already huge) giant such as building your own Colony within a sector or planet, hacking ships to get treasures and even linked play with Dust 314 to assist players fighting on planets with orbital bombardments.\n\nThe downside is that since there is so much to this game to even consider doing or even do, it's very mindblowing to any newcomers to EVE Online, putting them off as a whole. Fortunatly, the tutorial sets you off to some basics to help you get some form of idea what you could be doing. Skipping the tutorial altogether however feels very non optional and will not only leave you very confused as to what you should be doing, but make EVE a very boring game in the long run since you'll have nothing to start off with.\n\nIf the tutorial didn't help you, there are several players that will gladly mentor you (which to be honest, actually saved me from running screaming from this game and never looking back, so thank you brilliant mentors!) and help you get onto your way with whatever you want to focus on.\n\nAll in all if you're willing to put the time and effort into this game, it begins to get very interesting as well as rewarding, such as using in game currency to rebuy your subs rather than using real money instead. If not owning this game, then at least try it just once.","November 29, 2013","true","16.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And I like it.\n\nLearning curve is hard and even though they are experimenting with tutorials and opportunities, you probably need someone to guide you into the game. Once you have found a great corporation (clan) and figured out what you would like to do in EVE, you will probably enjoy this game. The economy is best I have ever seen in a video game, and space battles are great even though you control your ship via clicking buttons instead of a joystick.\n\nAnd sometimes you wake up 3 AM just to shoot couple hours a POS (Player Owned Station) with your friends to get the phat loot.\n\nRecommended.","July 4, 2015","true","244.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game will take all your money away in a heart beat. At the same time it could make you richer then you'd ever imagine. This is one of the few games thats ingame economy is supported outside of it. You can turn few million Isk into a decent profit if you Know how. If you are below the age of 14 or you're more of a charge in solo player then Please stay away. This game is subscription and already filled with insanely strong players. I do not know the total of player which have the max level ship but I do know there are stories of EVE Online player who lost a little over 400K if not more from this game. Not because they put the money into it. But because they made that 400k worth on there profile. This is why i said it can make you rich or take away your life savings... or your parents for some peoples case. Do i think the game is good. Eh. I thing elite dangerous is better but again you cant compare them. Do i think the community is good? half-half. There are the dudes are way to powerful to waste a single railgun shot on you or anyone else below there level and are more then willing to help at the cost you aint a ♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll be respectful to the top dog (aka them) and then there are the serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags that have alt accounts and multi box by ramming another low level starter ship into you commiting suicide just so another ship of theres that isnt wanted by the damn space police and swoop in. Steal your cargo. Sell it. And not  worry about the space cops or any other player knowing they are dangerous. Please beware purchasing it. For all that it is worth to EVE players shaking there heads at my review. Im upvoting this regardless because I know how much this game has done for some people.
