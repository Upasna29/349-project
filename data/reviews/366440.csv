Spent 10k+ hours playing the first game. Imagine my shock and amazement when i became aware of this game 10+ years later!\n\nWhat this is as of now:\n\nA faithful recreation of my favorite game ever.\nEvery weapon/unit available\nAmazing animations and effects\n4+ Awesome UE4 maps and many more to come\nRunning on a smooth awesome new enigne (ue4)\nWith some new ideas (and many more to come)\n\nSavage is a game of 2 sides, beasts and humans. Beasts have magic/melee strength. Humans have guns and melee that's also pretty good. The sides are not symmetrical, they are quite different. Humans have block, beasts have leap etc.\n\nThis game is based on raw skill, the better player almost always wins. The pacing of savage is somewhat slow, but this isn't a bad thing. It's a relaxing game but at the same time its very intense. The melee is very fast and decisive. You won't last long flailing around.\n\nThe same is true of the ranged combat. Better aim, you're going to win. You don't die instantly, the guy who shoots first has almost no advantage even if its a hit. You must land more to actually get a kill, not just surprise someone. The guns are moderately powerful. They aren't crazy. But they're just as important and useful as melee is.\n\nSavage is all about teamwork, timing important things, getting players on the same page. But it's also very much about individual skill. One very skilled player can kill the entire enemy team even with all of them shooting at him! Savage is just pure, raw skill in many situations. Very different from most games nowadays that let lesser skilled players get kills right away.\n\nWhat I find makes Savage so addicting is that it's all about personal improvement. You can practice dueling and aiming in savage for untold hours and still improve. And the game is paced slow enough to actually see your efforts very clearly. Whether melee or ranged you'll be able to tell right away how much better you've gotten after practicing in the next game or two.\n\nI sincerely hope enough people give this game a chance and realize how deep and rewarding it can be. It's not quite up to it's original glory in terms of content (maps/voices) but it's so far a very good recreation on a new engine. All the guns/units are there. And S2 only plans to improve it in Early Access. We have a bright future ahead of us.

If you liked Savage 1 then this is the game for you. Outside of a few minor, mainly cosmetic changes it plays just like the original. Better still is that it is going to be actively tweaked by the developers and continue to evolve. Hopefully it will surpass the original, while staying true to its gameplay style, something which was lost in the creation of Savage 2. Never imagined this game would happen and very excited for the possibilities it holds.","May 20","true","54.8"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","0"

What even is a fps-rts game? But my friend, once you set foot on the battleground, you wont regret it! Games are never the same and the possibilities are endless!\n\nPros and Cons:\n+ Beautiful maps and characters\n+ The same awesome feeling from working together as I used to get from Savage1\n+ Melee is still the most awesome thing about this game, impossible to perfect!\n\n- I dont want this to be just Savage1, I hope they add more ways to alter strategies and tactics\n- Learning curve is still steep. Hopefully a good tutorial will teach good basics, and a rating system will seperate veterans and newbies some\n- Games tend to linger on forever when both teams and commanders are clueless\n\nIm gonna be playing this for a long time henceforth, see you on the battleground of Newerth!

Two good commanders leading organized teams and having their units work together can lead to a tense match where it's up in the air as to who will win. Resource management and starving enemy resources is a big part of the late game and puts a huge emphasis on maintaining map control.\n\nHowever, the issue right now is optimisation. I use an FX-8350 and GTX 980, and find that the longer the games go on, the worse the framerate gets. On high/ultra settings the game starts at around 70-80fps, then dips as low as 12 on certain maps. The Eden map is the worst for this, however the snow map seems to be well optimised and I have no problems with it.\n\nSo as I say, I can recommend this game but make sure your rig is decent enough that the late-game frame drops aren't going to completely ruin your playing. Hopefully this will be fixed in the near future, at which point I'll recommend with confidence.","May 22","true","26.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

Its that adictive.\n\nFirst the main concept is that its an RTS/FPS Hybrid. You have a Player who is the commander, who plays along the normal RTS gameplay. You build buildings with 10 AI Workers, getting Weapons and improved units for your inventory. the amazing concept is that that Units that normal are AI that you ordwer to atatck are actualy Real life players! you can have up to 11 players playing for you in your team, fighting to destory the other teams base.\n\nThe game itself is based around two factions, Beasts and Humans, and the main way to attack is to melee someone. the melee though, is aysmetrical. Humans have Block, Whilst Beasts have leap. However you can also use range. Humans have technology whilst Beasts use Magic.\n\nThe Whole game has a high skill ceiling, and i will admit, that it takes time to get good at the game. But the reward is very easy to notice. So lets say you practise for a couple of hours a day. after each day you will notice a slight increase. the different skill levels you can have in this game is so broard and the skill levels of the players are so vast that you will always find someone either lower skilled than you, on the same skill level or higher than you, and its so addictive that you just want to play more to get better and to reach that higher skill level.\n\nIn order to win you have to concentrate on teamwork. In Savage, the team that uses teamwork better will 95% always win! whilst it is possible to go it alone and kill lots of people! in order to actualy push the other team back and kill their base, you will need to work together, group up and attack as one team, and this is what makes the game for me so exciting. playing the team work together and fighting side by side with friends.\n\nAs a team you push forward accross the map to the other teams base, It is the commanders job to fortify your position by building forward outposts so that you can get to the fight quicker and push your advanatage. its very rewarding to see the enemies base destroyed and very fun too.\n\nGive the game a chance, you will pleasently be surprised. I'm not the only person who has played the original for over 10 years, theres many of us that have because the game is so Unique, Fun, Rewarding, and Skillfull that we keep coming back to play more. Not only that but the DEvelopers are looking to add more to the game for free. mpre maps, different game modes...\n\nIt's well worth downloading and playing,","May 21","true","57.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

It has almost the same melee, fps and commander UI. 6 classes for each race, 12 weapons, 8 items. Commander of team should research this through game, spending resources. Team and NPC workers collect these resources. Btw, if commander is really bad and nothing happens with your build progress for long time, you can impeach him and get another one.\nThere is no tutorial, so you should have patience to learn how matches go - strategy, tactic, fps, melee, then you will get skills to feel better on battlefield. There are old Savage 1 players who have advantage to win match, so you have to overcome these difficulties.\nIt is Early Access, but this game has potential to be eSports.

(I did play it for several years, after all.) We have Savage 2, which was "meh", now we have Savage Resurrection. Savage 2 strayed a little too far off the original's path to some players but was still a decent game.\nSavage Resurrection is the original reborn, hence the name, led by the same developer. Now using the Unreal 4 engine, the graphics have improved significantly.\n\nThe game is in it's early stages but live true to the original in it's combat, ui, mechanics. There are a lot of odds and ends that need cleaned up, such as shots clipping invisible parts of trees and rocks. There are those getting "Fatal Error" crashes, amongst a few other technical difficulties. However, they're updating rather frequently and I have never been given a reason to not have faith in S2 Games.\n\nResurrection introduces "Crates & Keys" similar to that of CS:GO. Purely cosmetic.\nThey've also introduced leaderboard, statistics and things of the sorts.\nAnd now we have not only Casual but Ranked games with leagues like you'd see in League of Legends or Counter Strike. (Well, once it's enabled, that is.)\n\nIt's easy to recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive scene, both 3rd & 1st person. There's even room for those whom enjoy RTS, due to the "Commander" seat which controls workers, construction, resource and research development. The game is solid, even as of now, for it's asking price. It'll only get far better. They intend to introduce new game modes and further improve on what the game once was and it'll be magnificent.","May 22","true","11.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Pings are changing like crazy for no reason, sudden lagspikes are annoying as hell and no matter the settings you apply, you won't get the smooth experience you want. The company is working hard that's for sure, I bought this game like 2 days ago and I've already seen amazing improvements.

For Savage 2 fans like me, it's, "different", but still, the Savage memories, the classic gameplay, everything is still there so spending ~20 euros is literally nothing compared to what you get.\n\nGaming websites always skip projects by companies like S2 but this shouldn't remain under the radar. It's high quality, it has a simple and moderate replay value (for newcomers at least, veterans just can't stop playing), intense battles, and it's diverse, you can become a commander and do the base building part etc.\n\n10/10!","May 26","true","40.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

There's a whole upgrade tree, which takes over an hour to fully unlock and resets every match. It's good fun to try out each and every weapon. The learning curve isn't really that steep, it's just the controls holding me back, from my experience (arrow keys in RTS mode, WASD in FPS mode etc). The maps aren't very large, but oh my do they look amazing on max settings. The foresty maps remind me of Skyrim with an ENB and a few graphic mods, amazing flora, crepuscular rays/god rays looks oh so amazing. Generally a very graphically impressive game, from dynamic shadows to amazing models. A large thumbs up to the devs for this. There's many different playstyles. You can play with bots if you don't have friends to play with. Now, onto the cons. There's an early max of 10 workers, I feel the game could be on a much larger scale with a much higher limit, such as 50, bigger maps and more buildings. It would play a whole different way that way; you have much a larger total base, but so does your enemy (unless they're AI! This game doesn't have AI I would even call easy, but rather harmless, more on AI later), just something I feel would be a nice addition. AI, my team doesn't automatically upgrade themselves to newly unlocked classes, they don't choose new weapons as soon as they're out and have bad pathfinding which takes them around 50 seconds to stop trying doing an impossible task. Maps aren't too impressive in size. There's a need for more larger ones. A matchmaking lobby, I would be nice to be able to fully design what match you want to play: How many people on each team, every bots' difficulty, maps, etc.\n\nGameplay  Fun in the later stages, really "meh" during the first 10 minutes. Both teams just clunck into eachother, whoever gets the first blow is destined to win the firefight and then proceeds deeper into the map. This is what happens for most of the match. You'll be switching between commander view and FPS mode, commander mode doesn't let you truly guide your team, it would be fun to have some interaction with them, such as a health boost or gift. The FPS mode is very much like Smite, a first person MOBA. Except not skill based (skill, as in summoning fireballs, not skill as in how good you are in game) but rather more strategic. to sum it up in one sentence: fun, but needs some major overhauls. I've noticed that the AI sometimes just stays in base and does basically nothing if you first choose to be an infantry, but then within the first few seconds become commander as they need a full team to siege the enemy. Also, some of the maps are unfinished and one just refuses to work (crashes to desktop every time). So I've been stuck playing the Snow map over and over jsut because it's one that co-operates with me.\n\nPros and Cons  Pros:\nGraphically impressive\nTons of upgrades\nTons of weapons\nGood amount of buildings\nRTS-FPS hasn't been done that much in games, surprisingly fun though\n\nCons:\nSmall maps\nCan't customize controls\n\nFinal Ratings  Honestly, I think it's a wise buy for fans of a new game genre which is becoming more popular. Just wait until it gets a bit further into development, it will not dissapoint. But for now, just check for how development is going. There's a lot of potential here for a good game.\n\n\n88/100\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow   Game Related Universe\nCheck out the group.

I was disappointed with Savage 2. This looked like it was going to be fun, but honestly cannot be recommended to anyone in its current state. They are fixing bugs every day though so hopefully I can recommend it soon. Right now it is just absurd. Melee combat is horrible. If the human successfully blocks a single attack, the human wins. If the beast lands a single attack, the beast wins. There is no room for mistakes at all. A single mistake is death. And I don't even mean if the PLAYER makes a mistake. You can time your block or your leap or swing right into someone, but due to latency issues your block or your attack misses, you're dead. It is impossible to recover from any mistake, even if that "mistake" is just the fact that you have 40 ping. Behemoths are a huge problem too. In a small game you just don't have enough fire power to take down a single behemoth fast enough. But in a large game, there is way too much fire power for behemoths to ever get in range to do anything. There's a very small and specific sweet spot where behemoths can be effective for the beasts and managable for the humans. Otherwise they are insanely over powered or ridiculously useless.","May 24","false","15.9"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","6"

Right now I'm extremly bored of everything and pretty much waiting for overwatch. For being early access it is very far along, with some minor bugs, but overall the state of the game is far ahead of other early access titles.\n\nAs for gameplay it's very fresh. You really feel like a unit on the battlefield of an RTS match. I love the feeling of the early game as it advances into mid-late game. It makes every game feel unique because you will have some commanders that will try rushing, or some that play for the long game.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game. Minor bugs, player base is slowly growing(it released 12 hours ago as of writing this). I've been supremly bored with games and this will fill my time until I get to overwatch and will be something I will come back to every big update.\n\nPros:\n-Unique gameplay, RTS meets FPS and it works very well\n-Unique Units, lots of units to choose from\n-Melee vs. Ranged feels very balanced(hard to do for FPS titles that have melee)\n-Feels very far along for an early access title\n\nCons:\n-Minor bugs, which are in most EA titles\n-UI needs some work, feels like temp UI\n-If you have a bad commander, or no commander, matches can be rough\n-Has a slight learning curve, the first 10minutes you might not know what to do(I had a commander that would give me direct orders which helped a TON)","May 21","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is in Early Access. There are bugs. Such is life when you jump into a game this early. Most of these bugs are simply irritating I haven't had many problems that caused me to be unable to play the game. The odd crash here or there and somewhat more recently lobbies where people couldnt become a commander (simply left this game and joined a diff lobby where it was working).\n\n2. There's not that many people playing yet. The game was kinda sprung on everyone out of the blue so until word spreads there's generally at least 3-4 active lobbies atm. This doesn't impede on the fun at all.\n\n3. No oceanic servers (yet). Putting this here even though it doesn't really affect me. From what I've seen the people from the other side of the world tend to have 180-200 ping or so connecting to the NA server. Can't speak to its playability for people from there.\n\n","May 21","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Which leaves a lot open for new maps which can help force a more melee orientated match.\n\nAs a player of S2 games since 2003 - I can proudly say they focus on producing and fine tuning a great game rather than dumping said money into advertising to give you a game that looks great but a crappy final product.  They lack on advertising and have full focus on the game.\n\nHighly recommended.

Ranged is used frequently.\n- Game has a playerbase on the smaller side at the moment, but considering how unique this game is I expect it to grow rapidly.\n- Long loading times at start up\n- It's in early access.  Don't expect a polished and well balanced experience, things are still in the works.\n- AT THIS MOMENT: Blocking is completely worthless as a human.  Don't bother with it.  I hope this is fixed soon.","May 29","true","6.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

My savage career started 13 years ago in the beta of "Savage: Batle for Newerth". I played the game during the first 2-3 years almost exclusively and took a break with the launch of Savage 2.\n\nI came back several years ago to play the excellent Savage XR "community made" version of the original Savage 1 title. Savage is the only FPS i'm addicted too for over a decade. I started my FPS career in Wolf 3D, followed by Doom 1 and Quake 1. Then played the excellent Tribes series, UT 2004, TF1 and TFC.\n\nIf i would have to rate the FPS i played during my gaming "career" i must give Savage the crown tied with Quakeworld.\n\nWith Savage Resurrection i'm looking forward to play this superb series for another decade, yes i'm not kidding. If S2games listens to the extremely experienced Savage community this game will be a monster hit. I'm really looking forward to user made content like maps and mods which kept the series alive for 10+ years and counting.\n\nI'm not going to rate the early access version but i'm already seeing the good old maps in new shiny "shoes".

Fast paced combat with strategic meaning behind my actions is great. Every choice I make, player I kill, is step toward destroying parts of the enemy base, which actually has real consequences on the match. I like other shooters too, but find that the strategic element of savage really makes my actions matter, and therefore I find it a lot more fun.\n\nThe game is definitely a little rough right now - it's early access - and sometimes it's hard to find a "fair" match.. but when you do get a good, fair match, the game is a ton of fun.

It rewarded skill, was very asymmetrical (yet balanced) and had a fresh mix of RTS/FPS/Action-RPG elements. However, it wasn't perfect and ultimately it's steep learning curve and lack of AI and other features really hampered a multiplayer only game, which didn't fully shine until a map was well populated with 24-48 players (although competitive was 7 v 7 which was perfect due to the incredible skill level).\nIn this manner the game relied very heavily on the community.\n\nWith Savage Resurrection the same elements pretty much apply, although it is releasing into an increasingly crowded and sophisticated marketplace. With the right direction (and atm I've been impressed with 5 updates from developers in the first week), this game could really go places, possibly even becoming a esport. However with empty servers this game is unplayable, which is why I am hesitant to recommend this right now with a limited player base (although if you're in the US or EU you will be all right during peak hours each day).\n\nIn short:\n\n+ Amazing potential, fun as it is with most Savage 1 features implemented, could be multiplayer GOTY alongside overwatch and such if done right\n+ Developers currently very active and communicating well with the playerbase\n+ The steep learning curve rewards skill and makes this game earnestly enjoyable\n\n- Limited player base, which for now is essential to play (AU servers particularly)\n- Still missing some savage 1 features however and needs to grow from there\n- Gameplay needs to be balanced and modified for new engine (but hey that's what EA is for!)\n- Steep learning curve for new player (will help with improved tutorial, AI and community; maybe a commander mentor feature or something for the RTS elements","May 29","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To again play the game which was so good that if it had better marketing it could very possibly today be up there with DOTA and CSGO in popularity. To enjoy it's brilliance and amazing melee combat then I would say that this game is for you... Or that is what I wish I could say, BUT not yet.\n\nAs for now the game is lacking what we remember of the 'good old' in terms of gameplay. The base is there. They have the core game of Savage 1 copied, but it's not tweaked. Now this is not 2003 anymore, and ofcourse they are going to make changes to the game, for better or worse, but that is not the issue. The issue is that they have not yet managed to copy the former brilliance of Savage 1's fluidity in combat. Which would have been a solid ground to build upon. As for now we're stuck with a unsatisfying combat, especialy in melee.\n\nHowever, can this be fixed? Yes, I strongly believe so. The core of the game is not fundamentaly broken, but it has to be fixed before I can recommend this resurrection. Will it happen? Hopefully. I kind of felt S2Games lost their way in Savage 2, and are now trying to claw their way back to the development brilliance of Savage 1 so they can figure out what went wrong. In any case, time will tell if this game will become good, or continue to be mediocre.","June 3","false","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is still in the early stages and I can not judge it for that too much because it is in serious need of polishing still. I run a mid-end computer slightly above recommended (not minimum) system requirements and I have slight lag problems still even after altering graphic controls. It isnt really lag but more or less because I have to change my graphics to a lower setting it gets choppy feeling and the graphics still are not extremely detailed to begin with. There lacks a smooth feeling I get from most good FPS games.\nOne thing I dont like too much is that you can die so insanly easy. Literally about 1.5 hits in melee and you're dead. The death timer is usually 15-25 seconds, and when you run out to scope the enemy and then somone 1 shots you it gets frusturating.\nThe last of my 'complaints' is the most important. I see some people playing and they seem unkillable and have amazing scores. I figured they have insanly good PCs and are experienced at previous versions of this game however I am convinced I am wrong now. I have noticed due to the enemy using a specific weapon that the odds of him hacking (eg. using auto aimer) is extremely high. There are people reaching scores of 40 kills and 0 deaths. I understand some people are good, but not that good, several games in a row. When facing against these people I noticed with the gun that shoots a stream of energy, I use my leap twice in a row and the beam of energy never left my body. I understand good aimers, but to be 100% accurate on a gun like that is realistically impossible. I love the game, but I won't be able to play unless some precautionary measures are in place for this --if possible.","June 2","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you try to help base build, or gather resources or defend. You get very little xp and you will quickly be outleveld by the enemy, and find yourself useless.\n\nThe game is more or less won, by a single player who has managed to out level everyone else, and proceeds to face roll you for the next 20 minutes. So dont dare take a break to help your team out, only focus on gathering xp for yourself, killsteal, solo farm, do whatever you need to do.\n\ngames are won in around 15-20 minutes, very little tug of war, or close calls. Its usually just out right slaughter for one team, not fun at all.\n\nNo ammount of teamwork will save you, its really a 'get gud or get rekt' scenario and before you cheer, remember there is only room for one person to do the wrecking in this game, and its most likely not going to be you.\n\nEven games where the high lvl guy is on our team its not fun. There is no build up, no struggle for control points. no winning or loosing by a hairs breadth. Its more or less just follow behind this one guy and place mines, and barracks in areas he clears.\n\nI understand its a skill base game, but when a single player can terrorize your entire team and you dont stand a rats ♥♥♥. its not even fun.","May 25","false","8.2"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","22","44","2","15"

I see potential. There are so many down sides and the fact that you just get 1 or 2 shotted always makes the game so unenjoyable. Yeah you get 10k gold you get a sick predator, you spawn and shot twice by a coil rifle...you're dead...they spent 500 gold on that coil rifle mean while you've spent 4500 gold jsut to be a predator. the logic is awful. If they were going to make it so easy to kill people the respawn shouldnt be 15+ seconds. And dont even get me started on the wonders of spawn killing. To top it off, if you try to kill the npc creatures for some gold, they ♥♥♥♥ you up just as hard, yes they're two shot kills and what not, but you almost always come out with 3/4ths your max health or less. The damages needs to be tamed down a whole lot. Humans can pretty much permanently block, its pretty sick, they have a bar that ticks down...all they have to do is let go of right click and press it again, what am i supposed to do to stop that? Nothing, because it takes so long to switch weapons, ive already died of cancer.

Some good things and some bad.\n\nI came from back in the day playing the original Savage and Savage 2. So here is my ratings compared to those games.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat graphics\n\nBig improvement over the older games. This is to expected as the Savage 2 was what, made in early 2000?\n\nGreat Weapon Choices\n\nIn the previous games there was only X amount of weapons and no utilities. You couldn't get ammo packs or heal packs etc... This is a great improvment.\n\nCONS\n\nEverything else.\n\nGame play still feels like I'm playing Savage 2. It's clunky and just feels off. A good example is trying to switch from ranage to melee during combat. It is slow and sometimes doesnt change right away you have to double tap the button to switch.\n\nSometimes I can go from over 150 FPS to like 5 fps for no reason. I wont even be in combat and I have a beast of a PC.\n\nI understand it is early access but some of these things like the clunkyness is built into the game. It just how it is and I don't see this being fixed with patches. it's how the game was designed.\n\nOverall it isn't bad but for now I'm doing a refund until I see some major patches come out for it and then I made change my review.

Now we're just back to COD where we point and click and gun to fire. The game needs to go back to its melee combat.

I used to be a big fan of the original game and even felt the second version was pretty good. However, something just doesn't seem right with this one. It is very similar to the original one, however I literally could not get the controls to work right. It ignored 3/4s of all my attacks. Very buggy and yet I do have the hardware requirements as well as a good connection. I have asked for a full refund and I expect it soon. I honestly cannot recommend the game in this state.","May 25","false","0.7"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","7","24","0","0"

Well, I got disappointed rather fast. I'm not sure if you have to play the old originals in order to really appreciate this game. It runs on the Unreal 4 engine but it looks like complete poop. The map I played on felt rather empty and "simple". The building and mining process is hilariously daft, you hack with your left click attack animation at whatever you want to build or mine. The "growing" animation of buildings that are being build is straight from 90's RTS games, it looks uninspired, oldfashioned and ugly. The mini map itself looks like it's made in Paint. With my GTX 780 the game doesn't let me put the antialiasing on ultra. The third person view gives me the feeling of some regular clunky moba clone.\n\nThere are many similarities between this and NS2 though, like the command system, asynchronous gameplay, upgrades, weapons, classes, RTS elements, skins etc that work as intended and can be fun. But for me the pure bad outweighs the good. Would recommend you try it out for yourself since experiences can vary and there's a good chance I haven't played it long enough to get a good enough impression. The one impression I got wasn't anything near positive though, even more so for this price tag.","May 22","false","0.5"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","10","37","4","3"

It's a pure multiplayer game so this is a big downside.\n\nBugs: The game refused to let people respawn. The chat text was barely readable. The error messages, when trying to connect to a server, disappeared so quickly, it was impossible to read them. One character's ability didn't seem to be doing anything, while it is supposed to protect other players from damage.\n\nTeamplay: A good commander is needed to organize the players. He's the one with the best overview. With a bad commander the game is pretty boring and currently most commanders seem to be bad.\n\nCombat: It feels slow and clunky. This isn't anywhere close to games like dark souls or overwatch.\n\nUser interface: It's hard to read the chat text. Apparently the tutorial is only an image with some text on it, which I doubt anybody will read.\n\nGraphics: Looks like a 10 years old game. The dota-like creeps that you can farm for gold - which for some unknown reason is limited to 10 k gold pieces - look so terribly bad. There were some pretty rabbits though.\n\nPrice: This should be free to play at the moment. You have to buy the game and then there are still micro transactions - eventhough they supposedly aren't planning to make them pay to win. It's definitely not worth the early access price at the moment.\n\nAudio: Nothing special. Didn't notice any good music. The voice acting was good.\n\nOther reviews: Most people who have currently reviewed the game on steam seem to be big fans of the previous games and recommend the new game mostly because they enjoyed the old game.\n\nWhat do I like about this game?\n\nIt's different from the other clone-games. The mix of RTS and FPS could be fun in an organized team.","May 21","false","1.1"," 15 of 58 people (26%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","26","15","58","3","32"

If you're playing from AUS like I am, expect ~300ms.\n\nThe game itself was enjoyable, very reminiscent of the original Savage. Good variety of items/upgrades for each team, with an easy system to inform the commander of your tech progression preferences. Commanding feels more intuitive than previous installations. I found playing the healing classes difficult (mainly shaman, it was hard to understand distance/remain locked to heal someone as everyone is constantly moving/leaping), but am unsure if this was purely a lag issue.\n\nI think something that needs to be looked are enhancing information given to the player - in the loadout screen I'd like to see the statistics of each class (particularly differences in health). Also perhaps a chart describing what the player is rewarded with each time they level up, because it can be easy to forget, or it would be nice to know what's coming next (faster building/more armour etc.)\n\nI was a big fan of the original Savage, and a bigger fan of Savage 2 (also HoN, seeing the predator model in a DotA clone was great). If you liked them, it's essentially more of the same, but better looking and with some changes.\n\nEdited: Increased comprehensiveness of review","May 20","false","3.2"," 18 of 74 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","18","74","2","10"
