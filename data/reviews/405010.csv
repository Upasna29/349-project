It is really a inside joke as a whole;the story and game design both... If you are fortunate enough to understand and indentify with the niche humor, then you are in for a rediciulous ride. I personally enjoyed what I played of it due to its satire of the virtual world it depicts. Russian is not my first language but I can say that understanding and being familiar with both the language and culture is a part of enjoying this game. It is far from perfect and has some issues of course... but that's the fun in it.\n\nAlso, it is the only playable Russian game I have ever experienced. I'm glad this was it!","March 8","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","February 29","true","4.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","4","12","3","0"

Slang, Gaben, a concrete mixer, drugs, despair, revolution, Snoop Dogg and 2D girls... Surprisingly, but I haven't seen any bugs! It needs more quests, good optimization (long loadings really make me mad) to be better than GTA.\nHowever, I think the game's hardly interesting for people who knows neither Russian memes nor the culture of Russian imageboards.\nAlso you can get all achievements without any problems. And trading cards are expensive now.\n\nМоре лулзов, мемасики, сленг, Габен, бетономешалка, наркотики, тлен, революция, Абу, Snoop Dogg и 2D-тян...\nУдивительно, но даже багов не встретил! Допилить побольше квестов, сделать что-нибудь с оптимизацией (а то долгие загрузки реально бесят) и будет просто конфетка - лучше GTA!\nВпрочем, всё же думаю, что людям, далёким от сетевой культуры в общем и культуры русскоязычных имиджборд в частности, будет не особо интересно играть.\nА ещё тут можно без проблем получить все достижения.
