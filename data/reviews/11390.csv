Alas, after just over one hour of trying to come to grips with it, I have to admit I give up on it. It's not an awfully bad game, far from it. The graphics are more than decent, considering it's a game from 2009. On the highest settings (not that there are that many settings...), the cars look nice and the environment is more or less ok - bar the awful pop-ups in front of you of several objects. The driving model is fair, nothing special, but when played with a controller it feels fine. The music, as so often with this type of game, is all too repetitive for my taste so I switched it almost immediately off. There are some possibilities for adding your own music tracks to the game, so for those interested in this, the game offers something extra.\n\nThe bad thing about the game is the "gameplay" - actually, there hardly is any, at least I did not find much of it. There are several modes: a free patrol mode, in which I searched in vain for anything to-do other than driving through a generic-looking city with roadsigns that kept saying "Köln 2300m" all the time. You can do a normal city race, which is fine for just a quick try, but the "story mode" is what lets the game down. The various objectives are simply hilariously difficult - most of the time one has to damage an opponent to 100%, but whenever he gets further away than 200m, the mission has to be restarted. Since the AI miraculously can teleport itself down bridges or through walls, this got me first staring in disbelief and then lauging out loud. I guess this game can be fun to some, but to me it's a no-go: there are simply too many other good games out there, including large-scale racing games, to put any more time into this.\n\nOverall score: 3.5/10","April 12, 2015","false","1.1"," 85 of 102 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","85","102","3","2"

Everyone seems to have played this game for only 15 minutes, and honestly, you can't judge a game within 15 minutes. This game reviews are clearly manichaean ; you have two possibilities according to Steam reviews : you completly disregarded it because you played a few minutes and no minigun spawned on your car or you will find this game "somewhat OK". In my honest opinion, I really liked this game. Of course, there is tons of better game in that game style, like the FlatOut series, but this game got a decent amount of pros. Let me make a list of the pros, the cons and the neutrals.\n\nPros :\n+ Graphism ; Considering it has been released in 2008-2009.\n+ Soundtrack ; Brutal and powerful, one of the best metal and hard rock soundtrack I listened in a videogame.\n+ Cars ; Despite the huge load of germans cars, you can still find a great american Dodge Ram SRT 10 called the Pick-up T2. ['Murica intensifies]\n+ Gameplay ; Easy, fast and fluid.\n+ Open World ; "Like GTA, you know ?"\n+ Splitscreen ; 4 players Polizei-Ausfahrt-Party.\n+ Race gamemod ; Chaos and destruction.\n+ Damage physics ; Pretty decent.\n\nNeutrals :\n~ Based on the German TV show Alert for Cobra 11 ; I don't have a strong opinion, some will say this is a great show.\n~ Storyline ; "Chef : Cobra 11, I choose you !" "Semir&Ben : OMG God Bless Germany !" "Enemies : I am having a heart attack ! *die*".\n~ Voice acting ; It's really bad, I admit but you need to consider the budget they got to do this game.\n\nCons :\n- Lack of clarity and ingame messages ; This game isn't for the lazy ones, you need the ability to easily figure out what's going on and what's the objectives. The less ressourful people will dislike this game.\n- Bad staging ; Yes, considering there's no cutscene or models for the characters, they did what they could.\n- Advices ; They should show the utility of the Action key in some missions. Futhermore, when you choose a place to do your patrol, check if the car you chose got a red flag next to its name. It means, you have a mission to do, and this car is allowed.\n\nTL;DR, I really appreciate this game. However, don't think this game is incredible like a Grand Theft Auto. And please, if you buy it, don't be one of those bad players making bad reviews with only 15 minutes played.\n\n→ 80/100","November 17, 2014","true","76.1"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","60","71","7","0"

I never purchased it, it was just there. I installed it out of boredom and expected the game to be no better than those "X SIMULATOR" games you see here on Steam. I was pleasantly mistaken, because this game, despite being made on an almost non-existent budget, is surprisingly solid. What the game lacks in originality, presentation, and innovation, it makes up for with solid controls, and really great vehicle physics. There's a fair amount of attention to detail here, too. Your car, and every other car in the game as well, can be absolutely smashed into an ugly mess, with way more convincing looking damage than what GTA IV and V have to offer. You can park in front of a train, let it smash your car's front grille in, go flying, land, and not be able to control your car at all because your front wheels are now several feet away racing eachother down the autobahn without you. The gameplay is pretty generic and repetitive, but still solid. You'll get bored eventually, but until then you'll have fun chasing criminals, smashing into everything, and racing. Traffic will move the ♥♥♥♥ out of your way when you turn on your sirens, and when you finally catch up to the bad guys and P.I.T. them into a wall, you'll have to hold them still there for a few seconds in order to "arrest" them. There's things to collect and vehicles to unlock, including an excavator and a massive armored personnel carrier with six wheels, which absolutely smashes everything out of its way including buses and large trucks, even in oncoming traffic. All of the cars are unlicensed rip-offs of real world vehicles, which I'm glad the developers managed to do. It's not a BMW, it's a Semir! They're different! We swear!\n\nAll in all, it's a solid game. It's not the best game in the world, but it's definitely not bad either. It's just decent. A 5/10, or I guess 7.5/10 if you go by IGN's rating system. If you like racing and police chase games, and don't mind games with low budgets, pick this one up on sale.\n\nThe developers of this game, sadly, stopped making video games in 2014. They were very well known in Germany, but virtually nobody knows about them outside of Germany. They specialized in racing games and their games were some of the best selling games to come out of Germany. Rest in peace Synetic, and if you guys are reading this, I loved World Racing 2 on the Xbox.","November 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","25","29","6","3"

The UI and voice acting leave a little to be desired, but I can live with that. But the missions, the missions, the missions are just unredeemably awful. If this had just been a normal racing game, I would have liked it, but the attempt at open-worldiness is half-baked at best and doesn't improve the game whatsoever. The missions are so finnicky that it's very easy to instantly end up in a position where it becomes unbeatable, and with the complete lack of checkpoints this means you're going to be doing a lot of restarting, doing the same boring stuff over and over and over again. Staying at just the right distance from another car isn't fun, at least as implemented here. And after playing this game for an hour, I didn't get into a single race, which was what I was looking for in the first place. I feel like this game has the makings of a really great low-budget Burnout, but they instead went for some police angle that just doesn't work at all, either thematically or mechanically.","February 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 67 of 105 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","67","105","0","5"

After TDU2 was in the mood for more mission base driving which CTII does quite nicely.  Nice graphics engine and alot of detail in the environment make CTII a pleasure to look at and at 60FPS.  Missions are limited to what you can do with a game like this. There are multiple difficulty levels.  It's been quite sometime but the game sort of reminds me of Wreckless, the mission based racer for the Xbox.  The primary career mode encompasses the exploits of 2 of Germanys finest though there is a Case structure for replayability and picking up past the 1st stage of a multiple stage Case, a welcome feature giving that I've played too many games that make you start from scratch.  There is a race mode where you can set up parameter based race events.  These include all of the vehicles in the game including semi's which no doubt leave a path of destruction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/11390/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Crash Time 2 is a series of games based on the German police drama "Alarm for Cobra 11: Autobahn Police". There was actually several games made under the Cobra 11 brand, then came Cobra 11 Nitro. However, none of these was exported. Next version, Cobra 11: Crash Time was exported  as "Crash Time", and that lead to the Crash Time II, and so on. (We're now up to Crash Time V).\n\nAt its heart, Crash Time is an open-world mission-based driving sim with a fictional city for you to drive around in using variety of vehicles. CT2 has a good selection of German vehicles, none with actual names and logos, but they are readily recognizable, plus a few favorite foreign cars.\n\nThe graphics are actually quite good, giving the amount of detail available for the cities and buildings. Some multilevel garages can be driven to the roof and back down via the spiral ramps. the Autobahns are nice and wide with plenty of places to speed, and many cars have nitrous injection added for that extra burst of power.\n\nThe mission, on the other hand, are your typical police chase (either stop the car or crash him into toally disabled), checkpoint race (reach X checkpints, stop for 1 second in each), getaway (don't let the bad guys catch you), time trial (reach the destination via specified route before time runs out). CT2, however, added "jumping puzzles", where you must take the ramp at certain speeds to ensure you jump correctly onto certain locations in order to do something you can't do otherwise. And sometimes you need to chain the driving and jumping together, and that is just ridiculous.\n\nFor example, one of the missions was "stop that barge from dumping waste into the canal" How do you do it? By taking ramps and JUMPING onto the barge (without falling into the canal, of course). That requires jumping across the canel, landing on the other side, make a left, jump ANOTHER ramp, then stop right on top of the barge (without falling off). All in... 45 seconds. ARGH!\n\nThe city is large enough and open enough that "free roam" is quite possible Indeed, you are encouraged to "patrol" the city for missions to advance the campaign. Though in reality you just need to respawn at the regular start spots and few times, and/or scroll around the city map (fully zoomable in 3D!) for a "red arrow" which means mission starting point.\n\nHandling of the cars are simplified, and are exciting without being overly difficult.\n\nThe campaign missions, however, have the dubious honor of having some of the WORST English dubbing done EVER in a game. The two voice actors are either very bored or acting too hard. Though this seem to reflect the type of TV show this was based on: more of action comedy than pure action.\n\nIf you can find this game cheap, it is worth a try at least. It's not NFS: Hot Pursuit, but it has its own charms.\n","April 28, 2013","true","13.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

This game may look low budget and it might be but I'd have to hand it to the devs for making such a great fun little game on a low budget. I've been looking for a good mission based racing game ever since I played The Simpsons: Hit & Run (Which I loved) and this really brought me back to when I first played it. It has some great missions ranging from escaping and smashing crooks of the road to high speed autobahn races. The graphics hold up very well for it's age and the open world is of a decent size. Cars handle great and there are plenty to unlock along the way. This was such a surprise since I got this for free and has definitely got me wanting Crash Time 3 here on steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/11390/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","If I had to compare Crash Time I would say a cross between Flatout and GTA driving controls. The driving scheme is interesting, and the damage portion is not as accurate or as hard hitting as Flatout, but does give satisfaction when you hit a car at a solid speed and the instant replay starts playing (one of the features of the game). The voice acting isn't as bad as everyone says (it's just the pauses between the voices that are weird).\n\nThe gameplay itself is not bad. The game involves a lot of running around, doing missions, knocking these guys out while protecting these guys that sort of bit. Some missions are ridiculously hard and require a lot of replays (some missions can get meticulous). What's interesting is you can flick on your emergency lights, put on hazard lights, put on your turn signals - so if you like driving by the law in GTA this may be for you.\n\nRealistically speaking though the game provides its moments of fun and overall is playable and enjoyable. As for outstanding... not so much. It seems there are opportunities where it could have been, but it missed it's glory.\n\nYou still get a decent game to play though!\n\n7.2/10","August 1, 2014","true","2.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberInferno/recommended/11390/","CyberInferno","CyberInferno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberInferno/","1244 products in account","Crash Time 2 is a very enjoyable game. It's not without bugs, but I think the experience is certainly fun enough to warrant fighting through those.\n\nVisually, it's fantastic, and I had no framerate issues at all running with max graphics on my GTX760 (1680x1050 fullscreen). The cars have great damage models—you can literally knock the wheels off your car, and you will actually feel it. Knock off both your front wheels, and you can't steer anymore and must reset your car. I really liked that touch.\n\nThe missions are fun and varied. Even if you do similar things in some missions, they tweak the mechanics enough that you never feel like it's completely monotonous. Driving the RC cars (bomb detonators) is particularly fun.\n\nThe world is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to explore. Granted, there aren't really "side missions", but it's fun to just drive around nonetheless. There were quite a few moments where I went off drops at max speed, and it gave me a real sense of adrenaline flying through the air (fortunately no one was around to mock me shouting, "Woah!!")\n\nThe story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, but it won't win any awards. The same is true for the voice acting. For a racing game, it's probably slightly above par.\n\nA good selection of cars are available, and you can pick and choose the cars you use for some missions (though certain missions can only be performed with certain cars). They have completely different feels to them, but for the most part, you're going to want to stick with the faster vehicles for most missions.\n\nI paid $0.99 for the game, and I would honestly have been happy paying $5 for it. I definitely recommend it.\n\nThe downsides to this game are the bugs, and here those are (with recommended workarounds if available):\n- On "wreck the car" missions, if you flip the opponent's car over, the car disappears and respawns somewhere near you (the same thing that your car would do if it got stuck upside down). If the opponent's car happens to respawn behind you, that means it will likely turn around and drive the other way. I recommend doing your best to not flip over the cars or completely pin them where they can't move. Just keep hitting them with force or get them behind you then keep bumping them as they try to pass you.\n- Sometimes, it's just plain hard to find a mission. You drive around for a while and nothing appears. In these cases, try switching cars (look for ones with mission indicators), and try switching starting locations. You shouldn't ever need to be driving around for more than a minute for the mission brief to play, so keep moving about until a mission appears. Annoying, but workable.\n- The navigation arrow is absolutely useless sometimes. It will recommend jumps over bridges when your car isn't fast enough to make the jump. Fortunately, the mini-map has a much better direction indicator that adjusts for different routes and recommends shortcuts. I highly recommend using that primarily (even though you have to look off the screen a bit).","November 29, 2014","true","13.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So when the game was on sale for 99 cents I decided to bite the bullet and buy an old game that my brother and I used to enjoy. Now to say the least I have played allot and i mean allot of racing games and car/truck sim's that are out there, and to say this is one of my favorites is a lie. For starters the overall graphics of this game are not bad for the games time period, though graphics don’t make a game what it is. The story line; well there isn’t a story line it’s just a bunch of missions thrown together with shabby characters and some really bad voice acting. Split screen is ok if you have someone to play with other wise no online multiplayer as far as i see. The Open world aspect of the game is not bad at all, though seems like its a cross between a car sim and a burn out paradise type of racing game. The car mechanics aren’t horrible but definitely not the best. Now one thing I would have to give them is the body physics of the car, even though they are not soft body they still put allot of over racing games body physics to shame.

And ofcourse price of this game, I mean 10 dollars for this is to much...\n\nAnyway my overall rating is 6/10 if it has been below 6 I would give a negative review","February 20","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Heute werden wir auf Crash-Zeit II aussehen.\n\nVery good game over all to say the least. Well worth the $10. (Got mine for $2.50)\nThe graphics in the game are great and the physics are great as well.\nThe only two things I do have to complain about is the voice acting and the missions.\n\nFirst, take a look at all the reviews below this one and then come back to here. Well what did you see? I bet that every single review you saw complained about the voice acting and how terrible it is, that it is so funny. Am I right? Good. Another thing that I say is bad is the missions. Are they supposed to happen randomly? Are they timed? Do you have to drive to a certain area to activate them? The game tells you nothing about where to go to find missions. No waypoints, no markers, nothing.\n\nWell now that the bad is done, lets talk about the good.\n\nAmount of cars: good 10/10\nFeatures on cars ie. Police cars make noise and have working lights: good 10/10\nSmashing around and crashing at 230kph: excellent 12/10\nMissions, for what I have done so far for them: good 8/10\nEXPLOSIONS: good 10/10\nGraphics: good 7/10\nSounds: good 8/10\nWorld Design: good 9/10\n\nVoice acting: NEIN 0/10\nMission finding: NEIN 0/10\n\nIf you can find it on sale or get a coupon (thats what I did) then buy it and just have fun crashing into trains and other cars.\n\nTschüs","May 10, 2014","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086398618/recommended/11390/","76561198086398618","Professional Russian","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086398618/","66 products in account","The first thing that you must keep in mind if you have purchased this game ( or got for free ) is that you didn't spend a whole lot of money for it. For this, you will be Thankful ; you do get what you pay for. Don't expect a Burnout Series game level of development and gameplay. If you want a ' quality ' game, be prepared to pay the premium and scroll past Crash Time 2.\n\nThe game is based on a German TV show called ' Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei Ausfahrt ', a TV show that I cannot figure out as to whether or not is a serious crime drama or a German spoof take on the 80's series, Miami Vice. If you are from an English speaking country, the TV show that it is based on looks really really bad ( I did some youtube research by watching a couple of episodes to try and better understand what this game is based on )\n\nGraphics :  I haven't seen a PC game since that late 90's that has such a short draw distance and pop in. You can actually see the grass grow as you drive by embankments. The developers must have heard ' Bloom ' and ' HDR  ' and thought ' you mean ' Glare ' as that is what you get. Glare then translates to making the screen bright white in some areas. The plus to this level of techincal wizardry is that you don't need an i7 and a pair of Titans to play this game. The specs required to play this game are from around 2003 i.e. if you are reading this review, your computer can run the game. Yes there are some slow downs, but in general, it's not a bad frame rate for a 2003 standard driving game. Unlicensed cars which are very obviously actual BMW, Mercedes, VW's, etc. The cars are not bad at all, hence why you can actually tell what they are based on ( or not badged as ). The city is well, German ( industrial, efficient and logically laid out but a little bland  ; mostly built in the last 70 years onwards due a disagreement with a couple of countries a number of years ago ).  Graphics wise, not the worst - not the best - kinda ' Eh ' if you can forgive the HDR ( or lack of ) and pop in that is.\n\nGameplay : Hmmm. You have a car and can drive around - really enough said. The ' handling ' is an arcade racer, not a sim. Don't expect fantastic drifts, just understeer and poor brakes. I tend to use the handbrake instead of the normal brakes for stopping. The nearest driving experience would be if CrazyTaxi had a love child with an early TOCA game. The story is as deep as a standard cup of water but hey, you either paid $0.99 or got this game for free right?\n\nVoice acting : Voice acting needs a special mention all of it's own. You need to play the game to understand where I am coming from around this. I have NEVER heard such bad voice acting from ANY game, TV show, telemarketing scammer, etc. When I first heard the characters, it was quite amusing. As the game went on, it becomes, well a little bit creepy. Ever heard a 6 year old in a school play? Well it's a bit like that but spoken by a 40 plus year old guy.  Why really bad English accents? Why not German's speaking English? I think this would have worked better ( and they could have slipped in the word Squirrel for bonus points ) .... You have been warned.\n\nControls :  I have read some reviews on this game that say that the controls are difficult. I did not experience this problem as I plugged in my generic USB gamepad AKA PS2 copy and configured to suit a PS2 layout. You MUST use the D Pad to control the menu up and down then use the top button to select ( Triangle for PS2 ) and circle equivalent ( PS2 ) to go back. If you use the keyboard at any point on the menu, the game pad will be disabled. It's really not very hard to figure out though. To configure, enter the control lay out menu and set the control for the button of your choice ( press enter on the keyboard, then the button on the game pad that you want to use for that control ). For those that have configured a DOS / Windows 95/98 game pad, it's back to those days. Once configured, controls were responsive and worked as you want them to.\n\nConclusion :  Reading the above you are probably wondering why I am recommending this game? The fact remains that it is a very cheap ( or Free )  FULL game with graphics that exceed homebrew games. Buy it, but don't expect Burnout Paradise for $0.99c or Free. If you want Burnout Paradise, then don't be so cheap and buy it ( or wait for a Steam Sale 75% off ).\n\nNote that support for the game was ditched after about a year from release, but likely not for the reason that Apple use to ditch support to sell you another product ( though we are upto Crash time 5 according to the interweb )","November 16, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Granted, you should expect the kind of detail from a game called Crash Time II. This game runs very well even on cheap computers and the graphics are pretty sick for the price you pay for it. The best part of Crash Time II is that it is a very challenging game, i had to try most of the missions four or five times before i was able to nail it. Theres not much to do but chase bad guys, do tricks, and wreck stuff, but this is still a pretty fun game.

While I of course like free games, I don't often also like playing them. As far as this title goes, I don't find anything special about this game, and in my opinion it is quite... uncomplete.\n\nThe graphics are decent at least, not great, but not bad either, and while they paid less attention to environment, cars are as shiny as they can be, which would make sense in a car game.\n\nHowever the gameplay is where it takes a turn for the worse. The only storyline I've been able to gather is that you and a friend of yours are some sort of undercover cops who use a civilian car to catch. While there is no continuos gameplay, at least you have freeroam, and you can get random missions from the dispatch.\n\nBut let's see what the actual missions are about... well, chasing criminals, smashing their car until they come to a full stop. I have so many pet peeves when it comes to realism in this game that I can barely make myself write this review. Firstly, there are absolutely NO human animations. If the scenario makes your partner jump into a truck while you keep steady near it.... he just stays in the car, even though supposedly he is driving a truck now, even though he is still riding shotgun with you. Turning the wheel? No animation. Crashing recklessly in everything? No animations. The evil guy whos car you just totaled with nothing left other than the wireframe? No animation. What's more, you don't even arrest him. You just wreck his car (which takes a ridiculous ammount of bumping into) and then.. leave. And I guess he will just sit patiently idling (not like he has animations to begin with) in his carwreck until your fellow police officers arrive.\n\nAbout the sound, not great either. The radio consists in a few metal instrumentals, which I can't say I dislike, but that's about it. No radio control, you always listen to the same tracks over. However that shouldn't be bugging you more than the total lack of talent in voiceacting. I'm not trying to bash the developer here. I didn't do my research, might as well be some guys in a basement, struggling to make their dream game but still... the voice acting is terrible. TERRIBLE.\n\nAll this being said, if you get the game from free from some random humblebudle-esque deal on the internet, go ahead and at least waste some time with this, however I would never recommend anyone actually paying money for.","October 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

If your first thought was it must be worse than you'd be right.\n\nIn case you are a fan of police stories or racing then you should probably take a step away from this. If you just wanna crash into things and kill about 10 or 15 minutes while you wait for a better game to download then you might as well.\n\nThe cars and the damage models are the only thing remotely fun. As the damage model isnt only affecting your car visually but also your performance, the things they expect you to do, either will be fun or just frustrating.\nLimiting the amount of damage your car can sustain or how much property damage you do are mission objectives that just utterly ruin it.\nYou'd think that it makes sense seeing how they are police officers but no, thats not the case in a lot of them. For instance: A girl gets kidnapped but as soon as your car takes more than 15% of damage the mission fails. Too bad girl, have fun with your kidnapper.\n\nThe awful mission design, horrendous voice acting and repetetive music is what will ultimately make this unenjoyable.","February 26, 2014","false","15.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Which, in some way, is. The menu interface, the music, even the fonts used are screaming "german simulator". I believe that the developers thought to retouch an unfinished simulator and make it something more like a "racing" arcade game. What do we have as a result? A bad polished low budget Burnout style racer, full of simulator elements that are entirely useless (it has dedicated buttons for indicator lights for example). It has one of the worst AI I've seen for a while in a racer, there is no indication to what is the main campaign or the single missions, you just randomly pick a mission and hope you will proceed afterwards. And -oh my god- the voice acting is so fricking bad, it's hilarious.\n\nPROS:\ndecent graphics\nresponsive controls\n\nCONS:\neverything else\n\nVerdict:\n4/10\n\nThis game is so bad, it's actually funny..

Okay so what do we have here... The graphics are something I can deal with because we all know that graphics doesn't make a game, However it does improve the quality of a game quite well and my pc could run this at super omega ultra high quality, the graphics on high could still use some work however. With saying that, it could definitely be improved upon.\nMy 2nd complaint has to come from the voice acting, ABSOLUTELY terrible. It literally sounds like you hired people just randomly off the street that had NO experience at all with any form of voice acting before this, I mean for all I know you could have picked up some bums off the street and told them you'd buy them a bottle of booze if they read words off a paper, because quite frankly that's what it sounds like to me.\nMy 3rd complaint has to come from the spawn. I crashed on the road and I pressed R which is the respawn button in this game by the way, anyways... I was NO WHERE NEAR, the river and for some reason, your coding sucks so badly that giving me a spawn in the river was a good idea, but it wasn't only that! I pressed R again, ONLY TO BE SPAWNED IN THE RIVER AGAIN, you want to guess what I did next? I pressed R and what happened? Respawned in the water again and again and again making this game even more unplayable and unacceptable than it already is to begin with. It can't be that hard to make actual spawns that are decent that are not in the middle of the water scuba diving. Let's be honest here that's ♥♥♥♥ programming.\nAnother problem I have seen in this game is some of the missions seem very... Mediocre and even that is being polite and being nice. I had more fun doing bugger all in this game than I did doing the actual 'story line' which barely exists in this game to say the least.\nNow this isn't the worst and I realize that but (Who expected it to be in the first place I mean let's be honest here.) That doesn't give you the excuse to release something so appallingly broken that it's rendered unplayable because the developers are either trolls or rookies when it comes to creating codes in a game that make it an enjoyable experience.\nAt least this game doesn't seem to be running on Lemonade stand funds like some games so I'll give it that... (*Cough* most simulators that are on steam.)\nAlso this game lacks mouse functions for whatever reason so you use your arrows for menus and we all know we're too lazy for that. Takes more time then using the mouse and that's boring. There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't add in a mouse mechanic, no reason whatsoever.\n\nWith all these complaints I cannot give you a recommendation. There's no way, especially when there comes a time when you have to look out for your fellow steam users and help them before they bite the bullet and waste their precious time and money on a pathetic excuse of a game like this. Do I recommend this game to friends and other steam users? Not on your life, there's no chance in hell that I could do that.\n\nDo NOT buy this game you WILL be disappointed.\n\nThe game seems like it goes nowhere just like this review, just filling up characters in a box telling you how unbelievably bad a game is.\n(Originally Released Aug 27, 2009 but seems like it's from the 1980's but with better graphics for a game back then. In other words it's ♥♥♥♥.)\n\n12/10 DO NOT BUY.\nThank me later.\nPenguin out.","April 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It teaches you simple things like, "How to tail a car," and such. But it doesn't really help otherwise. I kinda gave up on the tutorial after the second part since the car I was driving didn't have good handling and I ended up destroying the front wheels to the point that I couldn't drive it anymore. There's also no area where you can see the controls. If there is then I'll correct that part, but as far as I looked I couldn't find any control mapping.\n\nOverall, the game can be very fun. I just had a very difficult time figuring out the controls which turned me off instantly. Most games have been very intuitive about teaching players their controls (even back in the day when controls were simple and easily understood on systems like the SNES). This does not teach you how to use your controller/keyboard. Just kinda figure it out on your own and hope you don't press some "self-destruct" button (note, there is no self-destruct button as far as I know) accidentally.","October 30, 2014","false","0.2"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

To my delight I was wrong, the game is a blast to play. The graphics of the cars before and after they get smashed are great and so is the map. The map is fairly big, with lots of jumps and small race courses spread throughout the map. The game was originally made in Russian so the voice acting is a little rough, but does not take away from the overall game, and I honestly enjoy it, it's comically bad.\nThere are only a few bad things in my own opinion when it comes to this game. When other cars explode, the explosions are weak, they don't look real at all. Also when you just want to explore the map it asks you if you want to do the missions to often making you stop for a bit to say refuse mission. Also when I started playing the game I didn't enjoynot being able to use the mouse, but it's easy to get used to.\nPositive\n-Large map\n-Many types of cars\n-Interacctable terrain (I.E. Trains, Cars, Cows etc...)\n-Realistic physics\n-Lots of fun missions\n-Wonderful graphics\n-Cars have great damage graphics\n-Lots of cars to smash\n-Tons of breakable items to drive through\n-Fun jumps scattered around the map\n-Replay after big smashes\nNegatives\n-Unrealistic explosions\n-Comically bad voice acting\nOverall a great game for the .99$ I got it for but honestly I believe it's worth the 10$ as well.\n9.5/10","July 8, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaedesEnder/recommended/11390/","CaedesEnder","Caedes Ender [SOLDIER 1st Class]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaedesEnder/","592 products in account","Where can i start with this game?\n\nWell first off i got it for free so atleast im not annoyed that I payed the steep price of £6.99.\nSecondly, Imagine everything you know and love about driving games like stuntman (which IMO this is a poor copy of), now forget it all. The game handles very poorly, from not being able to ue the analog stick in menus to the the car being sluggish to turn one second, to spinning 360 the next.\nContinuing with controles, they are so random its not even amusing, (Y) is horn, (X) is siren (on, on silent, off), the right analog stick only has left and right in use and thats only for the respective indicators (im not even joking) and as far as i can tell, the bumpers do nothing at all (atleast in the tutorial anyway).\n\nInterface wise the game is also quite poor, your speedo, map, mission objective and distance to target are all in seperate parts of the screen so you find yourself looking around at everything but the road. The speedo also has this odd feature of telling you what speed you need to hit ramps at, it will do this by taking up 1/4 of your screen and having a huge green mark and arrow at the speed you need to be, this speed is NOT optional, too slow you fall into a gap/dont make the jump, too fast and the game will send you flying into anything that it feels could be in your way.\nThere is also a replay cam that will replay what you did not 2 seconds ago (that seems about the extent og its record time) whenever it feels you've done something special, this is considered anything from a high speed overtake to a 45 degree turn, a 1080 aileron roll over a building or a 360 backflip over a roundabout? nah thats not replay worth (oh and your leads can get away while the replay is heppening).\n\nGameplay. The random spawn for cars is so borked that I swear i saw a family car with a caravon on it pull out of an industrial complex, and this wasnt a one off mistake, about 30 cars where queing to get out of a police testing area. The waypoints are another thing that are non-optional, miss one by a smidge and you will find yourself doing a 180 or slamming it into reverse while your lead gets away. Lastly that brings me to the persuit mechanics, it told me to attempt to stop the van with some light taps, instead I got infron of it and forced it to stop. Not good enough. Ok its traiing i can forgive that, so 5 taps it is, then I have to dissable the vehicle, so I flip it on its side with some fancy driving, nope, didnt fill the damage indicator so it de and respawns to carry on.\n\nOverall this game was very poor, it looked ok back in 2010 when it was made im sure, but now its dated, jaded and needs to fade into the background.\n\n~Round Up~\n\nStory - unrated, I refused to play after the tutorial.\nGraphics - 7 - There not the worst and I'm sure when it was released they did look good.\nsound - 5 - forgetable OST with less than average voice acting topped with a siren that is all you can hear when its on. The only reason I didn't rate lower is becasue the crash sounds arn't that bad.\nGameplay - 3 - Poor controles with a bad HUD and strange mechanics.\n\nOverall - 4 - It might have a good story and if your into games like stuntman you could get on with it but it just seems like a copy done wrong, if you like stuntman, break out the PS2 and play it, you'll have alot more fun, trust me. £6.99? I'd  still be anoyed if I'd paid £2.","October 9, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #34 - Crash Time II\n\nSo the Oxford dictionary added janky to their list of words this year.\n\njanky (adj.): of extremely poor or unreliable quality.\n\nAnd it just so happens that janky sums up Crash Time 2 very nicely.\n\nI start, like with many games, by trying out the Tutorial.  So I'm start with a mission where I have to pursuit and stop a car.  Okay, sound simple enough.  In fact, I very quickly pin the car against a fence, and render it completely immobile.  Oh wait, apparently the game didn't expect me to do that so soon, so instead of giving me credit for stopping the car, it disappears and then respawns.  Now I have to chase it down again.\n\nEventually I chase it down and this time I look long enough that the game rewarded me for it.  In the next part of the tutorial,  I have to chase the car again, except this time I have to ram it to do enough damage to stop it.  So I start ramming the car, and eventually I make the car flip over.  Awesome, I win, right?  Oh wait, no, instead of getting credit for stopping the car, the game just makes the car respawn.  Apparently it wants me to keep ramming the car.  Apparently this game equates thinking outside the box with cheating.\n\nSo after ramming my way to victory, next I'm on a mission where it tells me to hit the "Action Button" to launch a remote control drone.  It doesn't tell me which button on the controller that is, it just says "Action Button" like it's obvious.  I proceeded to mash every single button my controller and none of them worked.  Oh wait, I forgot to push down on my thumbsticks.  There we go, the action button was apparently mapped to pushing down on the right thumbstick.  Totally my first choice for an "action button", and not those pesky X or A buttons.\n\nSo now that I've figured out how to hit the action button, it spawns what looks like a stick of dynamite on wheels.  Now I'm controlling a remote control drone.  I then drive it to my target and hit the "Action Button" again and blow it up.  Now I'm back in my car and it wants me to launch another drone.  Okay, so now as I am driving this other drone I have to hit this jump just right, and it will launch me over a fence to my target.  Well I wasn't going fast enough so I end up vertical against the fence.  Now I can't get myself off the fence.  I hit a bunch of different buttons, trying to get back into my car instead of the drone.  I hit the back button and sure enough I'm back in my car.  Except I didn't go back to my car, the game teleported the car to me.  So now I'm in my car stuck vertically on the fence.\n\nI do eventually get through tutorial and decide to try and actual game.  So I pick the option to Patrol and get a mission where I have to go to the harbor to escort a car that's being delivered.  So I start by driving towards the harbor as directed.  But then as I get part way towards the harbor, suddenly my screen is black, well most of my screen anyway.  The UI is there, including my speedometer and minimap, but there's no longer a road.  Apparently I'm supposed to drive to the harbor blindfolded.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531560267\n\nI restart the mission and this time it lets me make it to the harbor without blindfolding me.  So now I'm escorting this truck.  The truck has the prototype car in it, and in turn 2 cop cars are escorting the truck.  So I have to follow the truck from behind, but not too close, and not too far either.  I guess I'm like the undercover backup that no one is supposed to know about.  So I follow the truck for a little ways and 2 vans drive up and start taking out the cop cars.  I better help those poor cops, so I floor it to catch up.  Oh wait, that would be common sense.  I forget this game doesn't reward me for common sense because I'm breaking the rules, because now I'm too close to the truck.  Nevermind the mortal danger here, I'm outpacing the games scripting, and we can't have that.\n\nI can just picture this conversation where the publisher warns the developers of this game, "Hey guys, the game is coming along, but it could really use some polish".  Except the developers misunderstood and made all of the cars in the game shiny.   Unfortunately, no amount of shine could possibly cover over this janky turd of a game.\n","October 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/11390/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Not worth your time. Doesn't live up to the name. It is not about crashing or damaging cars, it's about conducting boring routine tasks as a german police officer. First and foremost, the car models are quite well done, with excellent graphics for the time it came out. Apparently that is where the studio spent all their time and money. The game honestly feels like a graphical showpiece for car modeling. Besides the cars, the environments look blocky and bad. The gameplay also suffers. The worst offender is the car driving, as I can't remember driving mechanics so poor. Your small boring generic sedan, which is basically the only car you drive during the game, handles like a boat. Turns are taken terribly, and breaking seems to take forever to slow down. There is no handbreak or way to take quick turns, which means turning basically means slowing down to a complete stop then slowly turning. Backing up doesn't work either. Once you've stopped you press break and it changes you to reverse, then you need to let off the button and press it again to start backing up. There is no way to look at controls in game. I had no idea what anything did. I tried looking for a handbrake, and there seemed to be 2 different ones, but once didn't turn you faster, it only flung your forward at an angle for some reason when you were slowing down. There is no way to look behind you, which you actually need to do in the game, so I have no idea why they wouldn't include it. You have to use this tiny unhelpful rearview mirror. Then there is the gameplay. The single player makes no sense and isn't untuitive. There is a case, single race, and patrol at multiple different locations - tabs. Apparently you just select a patrol with a flag and then drive around and wait to get a call, which makes no sense for a single player. The voice acting may be the worst and cheesiest I've ever heard. Missions have multiple parts, but if you fail 2/3 in you have to start from the beginning for no reason. This is easy because if you get spun around or accidentally hit the wrong turn, as is common with the terrible direction indicator on your small map, or you get stuck behind the tiny railing that you can't get through (logic?) and you are following someone, you will fall behind the certain distance. Then there are the parts you have to break a car to win. You are a cop but you have no gadgets or guns to help you, all you can do is crash into cars........sounds like the plan of no cop ever. Destroying vehicles takes forever because damage modeling makes no sense, and you only do tiny damage at a time. I flipped a car over 3 times within 30 seconds and he would just drive off with no damage to the top or side of his car. It never makes sense how the cars get damaged. So you have to destroy a car but it literally takes 7 minutes of you following it around hitting it, having no idea how far you are in destroying it, because it never changes in performance. Then there are missions that have you drive to certain spots to check things out, but instead of 3-4 spots, the game has you go to FOURTEEN spots, which should take about 12-15 min, for no reason but to inflate length and give you busy work. That isn't fun because the random german city is boring and generic looking, with nothing interesting to look at. There is really nothing to make this game worth playing. Good vehicle graphics though, even if they are super un-interesting to use or look at. 4/10.","March 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The budget for the game must of been $10 because the game mechanics, and voice acting are complete s***, and the objective is non-existent. It's like no effort was put into creating this product.

The game is frankly, dull and flat like an cop drama that gets cancelled 2 episodes in.  You can play it for a while, but it really can't make you care enough to finish it. It's similar to the kind of show that you'd only watch if it were 3am and the only alternative was to be in a quiet room alone with nothing but the memory of regrets you've accumulated in a life mispent.\n\nWhile the physics and crashing are mildly interesting, the cars get damaged really badly really quickly, and leave you having to finish a mission on 3 wheels. While some people might relish this kind of challenge, I didn't. And there is a lot of "put your car right here for 2 minutes at speed" challenges which seem needlessly picky about car position.\n\nIt's cheap, and will kill time as long as you care to play it, but it's just not engaging. Save up and play something more interesting.","December 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

The game was utterly boring. The controls were descent but the gameplay and the mission were terrible. It wasn't challenging at all and was rather tedious. The campaign/story mode for this didn't pull me in but the graphics were half descent. The replay value would not entice me to continue playing this game.

God awful graphics and highly sub-standard gameplay. If you love blurry textures you will love this game. It controls just like the massively overrated game Crazy Taxi, which means no real braking system and you constantly careen into things. You get two brake buttons and neither of them slow you down enough to take a corner at even medium speed without just not being able to turn enough and slamming into a wall. I could not drift around a corner because I don't think it exists in this game. Even when I slowed down some, I still could not brake enough to get around the corner without going off the road. Just a really generic Sega Arcade game ripoff that sucks big time, mainly because you could take about ten seconds to find a far superior racing game anywhere. I played through the tutorial and that was enough for me to go right back to two other far superior games, Insane 2 and one of the best racing games ever, GRID 2.","October 14, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Today, I noticed it is on sale at $.99 and bought it.\nIt is well worth the $.99. The voice acting is horribly bad, but the rest of the game is pretty decent.\nThe physics aren't the best, but much better than many low budget games. The crash damage is pretty nice, i thoroughly enjoy  accidentally hitting a wall at highway speeds and having the front wheels fly off as the engine lands in my lap.\nI would not recommend this game at the full $9.99 price.\nIn my opinion, any price below $5 would be worth it.","July 8, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManiacRFTW/recommended/11390/","ManiacRFTW","Mad Max","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManiacRFTW/","105 products in account","So it is Crash Time. Number 2. Let's take a closer look.\nProsThe car handling is alright, good to control. Physics are "okay", have seen worse and have seen better. Car chasing is fun of course, put on some proper chasing music (top tip: Miami Vice Theme) and it is just great. The game was made for this chasing and so it earns all points there.\nThere's a small selection of cars; just like in Burnout there are no real brands, but the cars are based upon real cars. It's not Miami Vice with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, but driving a huge pickup, Porsche Cayenne or BMW like car does satisfy.\nConsThere are some down sides though, it is a rather cheap game so do not expect a full Need For Speed or BurnOut like experience. It all feels a bit cheap, and it doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary.\nThe English voice acting is just terrible. It's best to just turn it off, reading the subtitles instead of hearing the voice is much better. The music isn't anything special at all too.\nAnd there are some design mistakes. Such as you are in a chase, you stopped the chased car, and then suddenly it respawns itself back to the street, because you'll have to damage it up to 100%. However, when this happens you'll have to chase it again, and probably you were somewhere off the street. The target will escape, and you'll have to start over again. What the hell is up with that. So watch yourself out there when doing big moves.\n\nVerdictA fun little police game. There are better ones out there, but that'll mean a bigger price. It's great fun for just 1 euro, and you can hardly score wrong for that price.","July 9, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pull up too soon and the 'Too Close' timer pops up because as they are discussing pulling up next to the truck, the 'escort' objective is still in play, 'too close' timer runs out and you start the mission over.\n\nAnd then you have the 'pleasure' of taking out one of the persuing vehicles. While this is probably the best selling point of the game, in practice it does not work too well. One time I managed to hit the target so hard I fliped him onto his side (losing a wheel in the process). After a brief pause, there was no more car beside me! The target had warped to the other side of a fence! The opening was a good 50m back, and as I hobbled over to it on three wheels to resume persuit, 'too far' for too long, mission failed.\n\nAnd guess where you are after you fail? Yep, back at the start escorting the truck. Failed 4 more times (a couple times were error on my part, the others were similar cheating AI), gave up, and am now uninstalling.\n\nGlad I didn't pay a cent for this.","October 9, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just the collosions you can get with a train in either a small tunnel or some large scaffolding, the car is trapped then flung about!\n\nHowever, the voice acting is SO TERRIBLE that its funny! That and the content this game has is pretty decent. The AI cars are also well scripted and damagable. Ramming cars and caravans with the lorry is fun.\n\nOverall, is this game worth £6.77?

It is beautiful and good! Consider that this game released in 2009 (2008 in Xbox 360, after I did some googling). It's surprising that the graphics still looks decent, even in lowest setting (I use low spec laptop, lol)\nThen the mission. I dont know. Sometimes, those mission are fun enough to play, but in another missions, those are so frustrating, especially for some mission that involve ramps in it (it's frustratingly hard, I nearly ripped off my hair).\nVoice acting.., kinda bad, but I can understand that this is not AAA budget game.\nThe other bad things bout this game is the glitch issue. It makes the game nearly unplayable(lower the graphic setting will help).\nI'll give this game 7/10. It's fun to play.","November 26, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best bad game out there.\ntl;dr buy it on sale\nAn open world game about European Police. Well, A European city with british coppers. With stock sounds, laughable voice acting and a physics engine that doesn't quite understand mass you'll definately have a strange, yet somewhat enjoyable experience playing this game.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is quite bad. However if you pair that with the terrible jokes slipped in, it actually becomes\nquite humourous, for the wrong reasons of course. The sound effects are stock sounds and the soundtrack is mediocre but expected for this type of game. You can put your own music in the game which will help you play for a little bit longer. Although the process of putting your music in could be tedious if you're not familiar with file explorers.\nThe graphics are actually quite good. There are great lighting and shadow effects and the textures are high resolution. The models of the vehicles are quite reasonable and there is a lot of detail in the damage of the cars. Realistic or not, it definately brings the game up.\nNow, talking of the damage of the cars, there is definately a lot of detail put in and the damage is local to where you hit. Parts of the vehicle will hang off and debris will come from the vehicles. The vehicles also stop break down if you sustain too much damage to the engine area, though this can be annoying.\nHowever, the vehicles do not crumple and wheels fly off at almost all high speed crashes. NPC vehicles explode with little damage, with their explosions causing no damage to surrounding vehicles. Also if you're travelling at ~90mph or above, most vehicles will just be smashed out of the way with little effect on your speed, which brings me on to the physics engine.\nVehicles that are part of the missions are better at taking collisions. But the physics are inconsistent. You can spin out a vehicle with a slight tap, yet if you shunt them from behind they experience next to no loss of control. This is quite annoying when you have to take down a vehicle as you have to wait for them to turn a corner so you can smash them in the side at high speed if you want to do any damage.\nThe handling of the vehicles isn't the best. But it's not quite the worst. It's easy to slalom and weave through traffic but if you want to turn a corner at high speed, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to slow down to near stopping point if you want to turn the corner without completely missing it or smashing into a wall and have a wheel fly off.\n\nIs it worth the money?\nI bought it for 69p (~$1), and I'm cetain I  haven't  wasted my money. The normal price is around £7 (~$11) and I would be reluctant pay that for the game. But I'm a bit of a cheapskate. If I payed around £3.50 (~$5.55), I wouldn't be dissappointed.\n\nShould you buy it?\nI'd say  yes!  Even with all these bad points, I still like the game. It's almost as if you don't notice it when playing; you never really expected much from it anyway. I could play this for an hour or so burst before I would get bored of it. Not to say I wouldn't come back to it. The  humour  in the voice acting and custom soundtrack should keep you going through the missions. It's not a bad game really.","November 11, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of free roam maps which are decently large and a lot of unlockable maps, however when free roaming about every 5-10 min you are asked to do a mission which is very annoying. the missions give you no detail of what you are supposed to do.the graphics are okay im not one who cares about graphics that much, the vechicle damage does look good however sometimes the smallest tap can do a large amount of damage (not to you to cars on the street). the instant replay are nice but they are not accsessable after the replay (at least to my knowledge).\n\ni got this on sale 90% off, so i got my moneys worth (£0.69) i would not recommend it at full price though","November 12, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are nice, but the game is very poorly optimized. I can run Grid 2 at maximum graphics with 60fps, but this game still slightly lags on the lowest graphics. That being said, the voice acting is ridiculously awful, but that wouldn't even be a problem if the gameplay made up for it. The game is riddled with game breaking bugs and glitches, such as random respawning of enemies hundreds of meters away, which will result in a failed mission. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

I'll preface by saying that I haven't played more than a few missions, but have spent hours cruising around.\n\nYou get the brief impression from loading the game that it may have been re-branded from a more conventional german road driving simulator, but it almost liberates the player from taking their time on the road too seriously. The voice actors continue this first impression, causing the gamer to question exactly what subliminal german propaganda is being pumped through their speakers - because clearly, it can't be that superficial..\n\nYet, for all of its faults, there are plenty of great qualities.\n1. The graphics are still nice and shiny on newer directX releases, and it holds up well over the span of 5 years - a virtual eternity, so to speak.\n2. The almost apathetic mixture of citizens and police driving around makes for some catastrophic crashes while business as usual goes on around them.\n3. The driving itself, while not exactly precise in terms of the on-the-road handling physics, is pretty fun. It maintains a good balance between lively handling and classic arcade driving. The chases are a little easy if we're honest, but the crashes make it worthwhile.\n4. The comedy gold. If you start to look at the voice acting less as an actual attempt to create a dramatic environment and more of a strange video game cameo of mystery science theater 3000 post-translation, you'll be able to appreciate the rich social commentary presented between the lines. Bonus points for trying to drive with no front wheels, just a stream of sparks originating from your low-speed collision.\n5. The damage contest. While it's not a great idea when you're racing, one of the best parts of the game is seeing just how much property damage you can rack up before "The engine exploded."..\n4. Being $2.49 on sale occasionally. Very, very hard to complain about that.\n\nIn short, if you come into the game expecting more than flat-out level driving performance, you'll probably be a little underwhelmed. But, if you load it up just to drive around and have a little fun driving like a maniac without the GTA-style shooting, it's a great way to mindlessly pass a few hours!\n","August 5, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could have been enjoyable if it wasn't for the many annoyances such as the silly mission format, which means that you do the first mission, and have no idea how to start the next part of the story. It just has a few other options such as patrol and race, and the other story parts are greyed out and unavailable... I would have liked to play more story, but it gives no clear indication as to how. The cars don't turn very well, the streets are littered with cars and the roads are narrow, so you will crash a lot. I know it's called crash time, but the driving is like a sim, and the game is trying to be an arcade racer such as the likes of burnout.\n\nSo basically, it's really tedious, and would have been far better if they streamlined it and made it more accesible to play through. If you think driving while in the game is tedious, just try to get to the next bit of story through the menus. I quit because of that problem.","October 14, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are nice, but the game is very poorly optimized. I can run Grid 2 at maximum graphics with 60fps, but this game still slightly lags on the lowest graphics. That being said, the voice acting is ridiculously awful, but that wouldn't even be a problem if the gameplay made up for it. The game is riddled with game breaking bugs and glitches, such as random respawning of enemies hundreds of meters away, which will result in a failed mission. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

It could have been enjoyable if it wasn't for the many annoyances such as the silly mission format, which means that you do the first mission, and have no idea how to start the next part of the story. It just has a few other options such as patrol and race, and the other story parts are greyed out and unavailable... I would have liked to play more story, but it gives no clear indication as to how. The cars don't turn very well, the streets are littered with cars and the roads are narrow, so you will crash a lot. I know it's called crash time, but the driving is like a sim, and the game is trying to be an arcade racer such as the likes of burnout.\n\nSo basically, it's really tedious, and would have been far better if they streamlined it and made it more accesible to play through. If you think driving while in the game is tedious, just try to get to the next bit of story through the menus. I quit because of that problem.","October 14, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll preface by saying that I haven't played more than a few missions, but have spent hours cruising around.\n\nYou get the brief impression from loading the game that it may have been re-branded from a more conventional german road driving simulator, but it almost liberates the player from taking their time on the road too seriously. The voice actors continue this first impression, causing the gamer to question exactly what subliminal german propaganda is being pumped through their speakers - because clearly, it can't be that superficial..\n\nYet, for all of its faults, there are plenty of great qualities.\n1. The graphics are still nice and shiny on newer directX releases, and it holds up well over the span of 5 years - a virtual eternity, so to speak.\n2. The almost apathetic mixture of citizens and police driving around makes for some catastrophic crashes while business as usual goes on around them.\n3. The driving itself, while not exactly precise in terms of the on-the-road handling physics, is pretty fun. It maintains a good balance between lively handling and classic arcade driving. The chases are a little easy if we're honest, but the crashes make it worthwhile.\n4. The comedy gold. If you start to look at the voice acting less as an actual attempt to create a dramatic environment and more of a strange video game cameo of mystery science theater 3000 post-translation, you'll be able to appreciate the rich social commentary presented between the lines. Bonus points for trying to drive with no front wheels, just a stream of sparks originating from your low-speed collision.\n5. The damage contest. While it's not a great idea when you're racing, one of the best parts of the game is seeing just how much property damage you can rack up before "The engine exploded."..\n4. Being $2.49 on sale occasionally. Very, very hard to complain about that.\n\nIn short, if you come into the game expecting more than flat-out level driving performance, you'll probably be a little underwhelmed. But, if you load it up just to drive around and have a little fun driving like a maniac without the GTA-style shooting, it's a great way to mindlessly pass a few hours!\n","August 5, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first started the game, it opened BW setup. when BW setup opened I thought it would be a simple "click the play button".  it turns out that it needed to be running in win vista mode to work, but even after I set it to it`s recommeneded setings for compatability it gave me a frozen screen. so what I had to do was set one of the three game exacutables to win xp mode\n(I tried vista and it didnt work) it finally played ( my face :| ).\nNow that I finally got this stubborn exacutable to work I started by playing the tutorial. The tutorial displayed greate control for the nature of the game, But it does not tell you what the controls are. so when it tells you to use the action button, I find myself testing every button on the keyboard (the action button is F). therefore I found that this game makes use of hazard lights, both blinkers, sirens, and turbo.\nother than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial the phisics are decent, the cars look good graphicaly, and I can see how this game can be enjoyable.\nBUT I will only recomend  this game if you can get it for cheap.","March 18, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun car racing game. Good environment, lots of destructable items, relatively large open-world map. Poor voice acting but story is ok. Many missions seem impossibley hard. Totally not worth 10$. Try to buy it on sale (I got it for $2 I think). Good for at least a few hours of free roaming destruction and some missions.\n\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ Driving mechanics - while not entirely realistic, they are more than adequate and feel appropiate for this game style.\n+ Collisions - very satisifying to just plow through some poor soul who did not pull over fast enough.\n+ Soundtrack - I liked it at least, the rock/metal soundtrack. felt appropiate for the fast-paced chase style racing.\n+ Open World - Very large with a pretty good environment. On high, the graphics are not terrible (its actually pretty close to the steam screenshots above).\n+ Destructable Items - pretty much solely streetside items, there is more than enough stuff to run into and cause mayhem. Always a plus.\n\nCons:\n- Voice Acting - Beyond miserable. Its sooooooo cliche and often in proper grammer that no common person (let alone cop) would talk like. I know they are on a budget, but still. Come on.\n- Cutscenes - Not too bad, but they get annoying when you have to watch them like 8 times over (you cant skip through them).\n-  Motion Blur - Really annoying and I can't seem to turn it off. Sort of makes it lag too.\n\n...and the biggest one of them all\n- MISSIONS - Even on easy, some of them seem impossibly hard. Many require you to chase some sort of perp and stop his car. Fair enough, but "stopping" them is defined as inflicting 100% damage on their car. Merely getting them to spin out and pinning them or flipping them isnt enough - the enemy will just respawn a few dozen meters behind you and go the opposite way. Compounding this is that there is often a limit to how far they can be from you before you fail the mission. It is super easy to spin out or miss a turn and be done. The AI takes impossibly tight turns very fast and utilizes unexpected shortcuts that you dont see until you miss them. One could easily spend 10-15 min chasing down a guy until he is at 100% damage, but we can't. There's also a timer too.\n\nOverall chance of mission success on easy? Hahahaha.\nNormal/Hard? Don't want to even think about it.\n\n\n\n**** EDIT: ****\nIt should be said that not all of the missions are like this. There are some that are actually quite fun and require skill to do right - but just enough to make it a little dificult but doable. These are the ones that really make the game and the reason my score isn't worse than it is.","May 11, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I couldn't even get past the first case mission, as it is way too hard for the first mission after the tutorial. Where it fails for me is when you have to take down the opponent cars. They need to be 100% damaged to destroy them, and in the meantime your car is also spun about madly, damaged and it gets quite tedious quickly. The worse part is that the opponents drive completely randomly, are about as fast as you and if you let them get more that 200m ahead of you you have a 5 second wait before you fail, and are forced to restart the game. Terrible design choices.\n\nI also found the level design to be alright, but it is a shame to see a game with the name "Crash" in the title and not allow you to plow through most fences, and the "secret" areas or shortcuts had so many of these indestructable fences that it became a chore to find the way out.\n\nThe jumps are pretty fun though, but the starting cars are so underpowered that it is kind of useless to attempt them. Also, the bugs can be quite hilarious. One time I managed to jump off one of the roads and into a passing train, causing the car to glitch out and get stuck underneath, destroying the entire car and showing that Ben and Semir are just torsos with arms and a head attached. lol! Also another glitch in the first case (and also free-roam, may be a hardware or some other cause) was when something was causing the physics to be terrible so every single car was jumping up and down like they were having violent sex with the road. So what happened was that I was trying to get close enough to the truck to let someone jump in it, and it decided to jump hugely high and turn towards me at the same time, causing the wheels to fall down on top of me and ejecting me through the bridge at high speed, it was so unexpected that I almost died laughing, and a friend of mine who was over at the time nearly fell off the bed he was sitting on, lmao!\n\nI guess this game is alright, but try to find a completed save online as that mission is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard and DIASed that I just went exploring on the free-roam every time I booted it up.","May 9, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But "Crash Time 2" who was in charge of calling the game that? It should be called Police Patrol because thats what you are. You are a Police man with your partner in your car whether its a undercover car or a normal police car (which you have to unlock). And yes, I can understand where "Crash Time 2" comes from because you crash into objects and cars to get points but really? There arent really that many jumps in the game, most of them are in the tutorial.\n\nGameplay wise, the game should have been a Police Simulator game because you can do Police escorts, patrols, and much more which brings out that Police Simulator type of feel to the game. Car handling is pretty horrible, I would rather play with a controller but sadly its not supported. The tutorial is not something you should be laughing. If you get lucky you can finish it, but I gave up on it because it was that hard. I gave up on the tutorial and went to Career Mode to do Patrol Missions.\n\nFinal verdict, its a decent game and not worth the $9 dollars. In my view they shouldn't have called this Crash Time 2 and instead make it like a Euro Police Simulator game.\n","June 5, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Let's take a closer look.\nProsThe car handling is alright, good to control. Physics are "okay", have seen worse and have seen better. Car chasing is fun of course, put on some proper chasing music (top tip: Miami Vice Theme) and it is just great. The game was made for this chasing and so it earns all points there.\nThere's a small selection of cars; just like in Burnout there are no real brands, but the cars are based upon real cars. It's not Miami Vice with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, but driving a huge pickup, Porsche Cayenne or BMW like car does satisfy.\nConsThere are some down sides though, it is a rather cheap game so do not expect a full Need For Speed or BurnOut like experience. It all feels a bit cheap, and it doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary.\nThe English voice acting is just terrible. It's best to just turn it off, reading the subtitles instead of hearing the voice is much better. The music isn't anything special at all too.\nAnd there are some design mistakes. Such as you are in a chase, you stopped the chased car, and then suddenly it respawns itself back to the street, because you'll have to damage it up to 100%. However, when this happens you'll have to chase it again, and probably you were somewhere off the street. The target will escape, and you'll have to start over again. What the hell is up with that. So watch yourself out there when doing big moves.\n\nVerdictA fun little police game. There are better ones out there, but that'll mean a bigger price. It's great fun for just 1 euro, and you can hardly score wrong for that price.","July 9, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well there is plenty of physically interactive decorations to crash into at any time but the voice acting is absolutely horrific. Sometimes that's the funny part but here it is very sad. To add to the horror apparently these bros have a German cop show in Europe and play there TV characters in this game. Reminds me of Chappie. Anyway, It rips you right out of the game by the collar like your step dad.\n\nSo back to the game itself. The first three times I played Patrol mode it threw me right into the first mission but the fourth try... well since that attempt and every after I can't seem to stumble upon the mission. The first mission of the game doesn't want to engage itself. This would be fine if there was any other thing that could be done in the game, besides the other modes (which without progress you can only free race). Sadly I only kept failing it because on easy (and normal) the enemies cars where almost indestructible and the slightest tap from a vehicle can send you right off the side of an overpass during any given death race. Yo but that isn't a problem for these two cops who have zero compassion or logic. Within a matter of seconds they blow a cops entire years salary on public destruction and vandalism, with a splash of domestic terrorism. There's this destruction counter that calculates in Euros and I've seen that thing fly over 300k in seconds. It's hilarious because when they chime in with there completely unrelated banter boy do they come off as two sick ♥♥♥♥s, I guess because of the accents, either way, it's a normal day of manslaughter.\n\nTruly, you want some of that crash time but traffic density is pretty damn low, it feels like I can run any light or intersection and will NEVER get hit. When I drive I just stare at the HUD, the bland greys are so overwhelming I can't really tell I'm going anywhere, thus every turn is a surprise. The HUD arrow never points where you should be driving but straight at your destination which is only helpful if you can fly. This is a driving game, you can't fly without getting hit by the monorail. ♥♥♥♥ if you get hit by a monorail you can go through the ground or even the train and end up anywhere. The best part about the whole game, hands down, is crashing cars into that train.\n\nAll in all, the game should be called Train Terrorrizers 2- Training Day. 2/10","June 5, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/recommended/11390/","officialevilpanda","Evil Panda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/","320 products in account","This game is quite boring, its got possibly the worst voice acting/narating i have ever heard, it sounds like a british computer reading each work individually and not reacting or showing emotion to anything around them, the criminal cases are boring and repetitive and lack any kind of story e.g criminals are using karts to steal by driving them in alley ways and small places cars cant reach so race against them and take them down but guess what there are no alley ways or small places they just drive on the same old road as every other mission. Basic idea of missions is to either ram into something until it dead or go to some check point, no story, no cool car customization, no cool new map area nothing just same old cutscene of computer talking followed by driving. Other problems with this game include poor map design e.g went to drive through dark tunnel where other cars were driving, turned out the "darkness" was in fact a solid cube blocking you from using the tunnel and completely destroyed my car, To many cases at once, so basically there are a set of cases for which you can complete and unlock new cases unfortunatly you have to enter free roam mode and wander around until someone goes hey your near a case and automatically starts you in it and since they have such weak storylines you end up completeing multiple storylines at once and they end up making no sense but luckily the gameplay is so repetive you easily complete them all.\n\nPros:\nGraphics\nDriving Controls\n\nCons:\nRepetitive\nPoor Map Design\nLack of unique vehicles\nLack of storyline\nBad voice acting/Naration\nBuggy\nAnnoying Cutscenes that can rarely be skipped\nBad damage reactions/Animation e.g hit wall both front wheels fly across the map, AI hits wall, small dent apears on their door.","March 23","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun car racing game. Good environment, lots of destructable items, relatively large open-world map. Poor voice acting but story is ok. Many missions seem impossibley hard. Totally not worth 10$. Try to buy it on sale (I got it for $2 I think). Good for at least a few hours of free roaming destruction and some missions.\n\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ Driving mechanics - while not entirely realistic, they are more than adequate and feel appropiate for this game style.\n+ Collisions - very satisifying to just plow through some poor soul who did not pull over fast enough.\n+ Soundtrack - I liked it at least, the rock/metal soundtrack. felt appropiate for the fast-paced chase style racing.\n+ Open World - Very large with a pretty good environment. On high, the graphics are not terrible (its actually pretty close to the steam screenshots above).\n+ Destructable Items - pretty much solely streetside items, there is more than enough stuff to run into and cause mayhem. Always a plus.\n\nCons:\n- Voice Acting - Beyond miserable. Its sooooooo cliche and often in proper grammer that no common person (let alone cop) would talk like. I know they are on a budget, but still. Come on.\n- Cutscenes - Not too bad, but they get annoying when you have to watch them like 8 times over (you cant skip through them).\n-  Motion Blur - Really annoying and I can't seem to turn it off. Sort of makes it lag too.\n\n...and the biggest one of them all\n- MISSIONS - Even on easy, some of them seem impossibly hard. Many require you to chase some sort of perp and stop his car. Fair enough, but "stopping" them is defined as inflicting 100% damage on their car. Merely getting them to spin out and pinning them or flipping them isnt enough - the enemy will just respawn a few dozen meters behind you and go the opposite way. Compounding this is that there is often a limit to how far they can be from you before you fail the mission. It is super easy to spin out or miss a turn and be done. The AI takes impossibly tight turns very fast and utilizes unexpected shortcuts that you dont see until you miss them. One could easily spend 10-15 min chasing down a guy until he is at 100% damage, but we can't. There's also a timer too.\n\nOverall chance of mission success on easy? Hahahaha.\nNormal/Hard? Don't want to even think about it.\n\n\n\n**** EDIT: ****\nIt should be said that not all of the missions are like this. There are some that are actually quite fun and require skill to do right - but just enough to make it a little dificult but doable. These are the ones that really make the game and the reason my score isn't worse than it is.","May 11, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But "Crash Time 2" who was in charge of calling the game that? It should be called Police Patrol because thats what you are. You are a Police man with your partner in your car whether its a undercover car or a normal police car (which you have to unlock). And yes, I can understand where "Crash Time 2" comes from because you crash into objects and cars to get points but really? There arent really that many jumps in the game, most of them are in the tutorial.\n\nGameplay wise, the game should have been a Police Simulator game because you can do Police escorts, patrols, and much more which brings out that Police Simulator type of feel to the game. Car handling is pretty horrible, I would rather play with a controller but sadly its not supported. The tutorial is not something you should be laughing. If you get lucky you can finish it, but I gave up on it because it was that hard. I gave up on the tutorial and went to Career Mode to do Patrol Missions.\n\nFinal verdict, its a decent game and not worth the $9 dollars. In my view they shouldn't have called this Crash Time 2 and instead make it like a Euro Police Simulator game.\n","June 5, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Some missions are way too hard. For example the bank heist. The vehicle takes forever to get destroyed.  It is just not possible to do in 5 minutes (easy level).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/recommended/11390/","officialevilpanda","Evil Panda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/","320 products in account","This game is quite boring, its got possibly the worst voice acting/narating i have ever heard, it sounds like a british computer reading each work individually and not reacting or showing emotion to anything around them, the criminal cases are boring and repetitive and lack any kind of story e.g criminals are using karts to steal by driving them in alley ways and small places cars cant reach so race against them and take them down but guess what there are no alley ways or small places they just drive on the same old road as every other mission. Basic idea of missions is to either ram into something until it dead or go to some check point, no story, no cool car customization, no cool new map area nothing just same old cutscene of computer talking followed by driving. Other problems with this game include poor map design e.g went to drive through dark tunnel where other cars were driving, turned out the "darkness" was in fact a solid cube blocking you from using the tunnel and completely destroyed my car, To many cases at once, so basically there are a set of cases for which you can complete and unlock new cases unfortunatly you have to enter free roam mode and wander around until someone goes hey your near a case and automatically starts you in it and since they have such weak storylines you end up completeing multiple storylines at once and they end up making no sense but luckily the gameplay is so repetive you easily complete them all.\n\nPros:\nGraphics\nDriving Controls\n\nCons:\nRepetitive\nPoor Map Design\nLack of unique vehicles\nLack of storyline\nBad voice acting/Naration\nBuggy\nAnnoying Cutscenes that can rarely be skipped\nBad damage reactions/Animation e.g hit wall both front wheels fly across the map, AI hits wall, small dent apears on their door.","March 23","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The trick to really enjoying this game, however, is that you have to get past the frustrating first mission.  You know how most games give you easy tasks at the beginning of the game, and just about the time you think you got the hang of it, the difficulty ramps up until you begin to feel like a failure?  Crash Time II does just the opposite.\n\nThe first mission requires you to perform a rather tricky maneuver, followed by extensive car chase in which you need to disable the car you are pursuing by ramming it over and over until it's an immobile pile of metal.  This is more difficult than it sounds, especially when you are new to the game.  In fact, it took me over three hours to complete the level.  After that, however, the game became much easier, with the next several missions being timed tasks, races, or chases that only require pinning your target instead of destroying them.  Yes, the game has several other frustrating missions that require multiple attempts, but by this time your skill is better and they don’t take as long or seem as daunting.\n\nI played this game both with a controller and with a keyboard and mouse.  Personally, I have no preference and found both methods adequate.\n\nHelpful Tips to make the game more fun and reduce frustration:\n\n1.  Play in easy mode.  The chase missions are hard enough -- a simple wrong turn can allow an enemy to escape in an instant.\n\n2.  Read the manual.  At least scan it. I spent a lot of time driving around doing nothing early in the game until I read the manual and figured out why missions weren't triggering.\n\n3.  When you are required to completely disable another vehicle, avoid pinning it for too long.  Back off and let it get going before ramming it again.  What the game neglects to tell you is that all the criminals have graduated from Hogwarts and, when pinned, will suddenly disappear and reappear elsewhere, sometimes far enough away that they can escape before you even have time to turn your vehicle around.\n\nFinally, the voice acting is brilliant!  No, I didn’t say it was good, well written or well acted.  Just brilliant.","April 21","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've owned it for probably over a year. But, as this is on Steam, there are bound to be more gamers giving it a go. So, here is my review on Crash Time 2: Burning Wheels.\nWhen I first picked it up, I really wanted to like it.\nNow, don't get me wrong, I do not hate it; I just don't like it...much.\n\nI will dive right in with the Pros-v-Cons.\nPros:\n\n+ Graphics:  Despite a little too much bloom effect on some of the models, and the occasional clipping, the overall graphic quality of the game was enjoyable.\n+ Control:  There is a catch (see Cons). I use an XBox 360 controller for all racers, and the control is fairly good in this with the occasional understeer issues aside. For me, keyboards just don't make good racers. The on/off switch controls just won't cut it in my opinion. Kudos to those who can pull it off with good results.\n\n+ Comedic Value:  The translation from German to English is laughable at times. And the English voice acting is, in a word, atrocious. I would love to hear feedback from German speaking gamers on whether or not the original actors/script were any better.\n\n+ Soundtrack:  Great rockin' soundtrack and the ability to add your own tracks made for an enjoyable time.\n\n+ Damage System:  I loved how the car fell apart and stopped performing accordingly.\n\nCons:\n\n- But that Camera:  Here's the control catch. My first issue was the camera. Too often, I found myself going around a winding road corner and smacking right into another car that I could not see from the camera scheme offered. Or worse yet, a sneaky little outcropping in the wall, strategically placed to catch you unaware and throw you off your line. Both things that you could see in the first person camera if not for the lack of left/right control. The 3rd person high camera was what I would typically gravitate toward, but you still could not see what was coming around the corner. I realize some driving line planning is in order here, but being able to use the right joystick for camera control left and right would have been ideal. Nobody drives with there head and eyes glued straight forward.  Unless, of course they are staring at a cell phone (Don't even get me started on that).\n\n- Stick to the Mission. What Mission???:  At times, finding missions was harder than it should have been. I've read, in several online posts, that you had to be in a particular car, in a particular place, for HQ to contact you. However, in many missions, I would start off in said particular vehicle only to have to drive back and switch to another vehicle to continue the mission. It shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nI actually enjoyed playing this game once I figured out the no mission issue.  I always read reviews to know what I'm getting into before purchasing a game.  Occasionally, I will steer clear of one because of them.  However, ultimately, enjoyment really depends on each individual gamer.\n\nWould I pay sticker price for this game?   Well, THAT is what I read reviews for.\nAs much as I love to support the creators as much as possible, I am on a limited budget so the games I pay full price for need to be really worth it.  So, the answer to the question, is no.\n\nThat being said, I will most likely be trying "Crash Time 3: Highway Nights" soon. And I hope the other 2 installments will be released in the U.S. as well.  Why?  Because most people tend to get better as they learn more and develop their craft.  I hope the same rings true for Synetic.  Everyone has to start somewhere.  Give "Crash Time 2: Burning Wheels. " a try. It's no Need for Speed, or other big budget racer, but it can be entertaining.","May 25","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
