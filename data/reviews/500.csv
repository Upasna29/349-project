We were obsessed with this game back then, it was the best experience for us.  I love the characters, guns, zombies oh yeah and especially the gore.\n\nMe, my dad and my brother loved to play zombie apocalypse games, this was probably our first favorite zombie game that we first started playing together as a team. I laughed when my dad thought the witch one of the special infected was like the most overpowered zombie in the game, when my dad was busy with work the day me and my brother started testing more maps out in the game we wanted to try see if the witch is invincible, turns out she died, its the day I first crowned her with an autoshotgun.\n\nBest time of life, me, my brother and my dad played this game for like 3 years none-stop. It was a very addictive game for us it was so fun for us. A few weeks after me, my brother and my dad got use to the game, I started doing research, found some cheat codes thats when I started cheating by testing out some cheat codes thats when I showed my brother and my dad about the cheat codes then we started using cheats after we finished every single map which was like throughout 2008.\n\nThis game is very impressive, I miss the old times when I use to play with my brother and dad.\n\n100/10 gg, sweetest memory I had in 2008 with my dad and brother. ♥","February 28, 2015","true","514.9"," 347 of 368 people (94%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","94","347","368","62","3"

You and three friends will battles against hordes of 'infected' or perhaps become the vanguard of those infected to wreak terror and death on survivors as the 'sepcial infected'. This game prioritizes team work over twitch skills and is a great game for people who like to play with a dedicated group of friends.\n\nI have not played for a few years and when I left the game was more geared for hard core players when compared to it's successor, Left 4 Dead 2. From a cursory look this still seems to be true. A great game, but for beginners I might actually suggest playing Left 4 Dead 2 first, and then perhaps trying the first game once you are a little more skilled. Getting quad capped by people will 5000 hours in game might not be your best first expereince of the game :)\n\n\n\nHOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account.

I'm not sure what the downvotes in the community are for, the review system is in place asking if you "Recommend someone to buy this game" and no, I don't, I wouldn't point someone at L4D1 since...again the sequel contains this game and more. So go get that game instead.\n\nEdit: Since some people can't understand the review I wrote, I'll ellaborate,\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a great game, it really is and I've had a lot of fun with it. The trouble is that this game, the entire game, all of it, is in the sequel L4D2 for free and it costs the same and comes with far more content including intergrated mod support.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/recommended/500/","IxianMace","IxianMace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/","57 products in account","Left 4 Dead is a solid co-op first-person shooter that, while clearly showing its age, is worth the small price you can pick it up for on sale.\n\nPreface:I remember when I first started playing this game. I was scared of everything. I moved very slowly, cautiously, and ran from place to place, looking for the safest and shortest path to the next saferoom. When I finally finished a campaign and got to watch the ending cutscene roll, it felt like a real achievement.\n\nThen I tried joining my first multi-player campaign and discovered a whole new world. Having someone running along with me, giving me helpful advice, and us all generally looking after each other as a team was a great experience. This is a game where good team-based gameplay is rewarded, and where people who go rushing off alone commonly end up getting themselves killed. Left 4 Dead feels like it was built for cooperative gameplay, from the ground up. There's safety in numbers, and when you're the last one standing and trying to survive on your own, you'll really feel just how alone you are in a hostile world where pretty much everything is out to kill you.\n\nThe game can be played in both single and multi-player. Up to four players control one each of four survivors as they all attempt to move from one safe area to the next. Any survivors not being controlled by a human player will be automatically taken over by the survivor bot AI. As they move through the levels in the campaigns, the survivors will encounter various enemies, including hordes of common zombies and some rarer 'special' infected. These special infected come with unique abilities that make good teamplay essential, as their attacks can disorient and even render lone survivors helpless.\n\nLevel Design:Levels are premade and static, meaning they never change from game to game. After playing the same campaign enough times, you'll end up memorizing the most efficient routes through the levels. Item spawns are also preplaced, so if you find a bottle of pills behind a dumpster in a certain alleyway, then that's what you can expect to find in that location in all future games you play. There is some variation in the fact that items won't always spawn where they're available to be spawned, but that's it.\n\nAt certain points throughout the game, you'll encounter various events that trigger attacks from hordes of zombies, or even spawn 'boss' infected, which helps break the monotony of simply going from point A to point B. Otherwise, the meat of the campaign mode consists of moving from one location to the next while shooting zombies and finding items. There are six campaigns; most of them have a total of five maps. In each campaign, there is constant visible evidence of the decay of society and the collapse of civilization through wrecked buildings, vehicles, piles of dead bodies, and more.\n\nGame Modes:Besides campaign, 'versus' and 'survival' game modes are also available. In versus mode, up to eight players can join a single game session. Versus mode is basically a campaign where there are two teams of human players - one team controls the survivors, and the other spawns as special infected. The survivor team must attempt to make it as far as they can before being killed, while the infected team attempts to stop them as quickly as possible. Once the survivors have been killed or make it to safety, the teams switch roles, and the map is played again. This rotation continues until the entire campaign has been completed, at which stage, points are tallied up to determine the winner.\n\nIn survival mode, the survivors are trapped in certain areas found throughout the campaigns, and must hold out as long as possible against relentless waves of enemies that get more difficult as the game progresses. Gold, silver, and bronze 'medals' are awarded for lasting ten, seven, and four minutes respectively.\n\nSound:Music in Left 4 Dead adds not only atmosphere, but is also dynamic in that it changes depending on the situation. Impending horde attacks are met with the sound of intense drumming, the presence of an attacking 'Tank' (boss infected) comes with its own 'epic' theme, unique 'terror' music plays while being strangled by a 'Smoker' special infected, and so on. Leaving the music in this game on can actually help the player maintain situational awareness.\n\nSurvivors also call out and comment on things they see throughout the game, and the voice acting is generally good. Players can make the character they're controlling say certain things with the press of a button for quick communication in case they can't or don't want to type messages or use a microphone.\n\nAI:The survivor bot AI does an adequate job of keeping together and shooting enemies, but has a habit of running directly into the player's line of fire. I also noticed frequent pathfinding issues, causing bots to get stuck before 'warping' to the player's location. Sometimes, fellow survivor bots also take an inordinate amount of time to rescue other survivors from the clutches of special infected if there is even a minimal amount of zombies occupying their attention. Incapacitated survivor bots also have the uncanny ability to close doors, which is not something the player can do.\n\nThe infected AI is very accurate and effective, and often 'cheats'. Hunters are able to claw survivors while in mid leap and even after getting shoved away, and Boomers instantly hit survivors once they get within range, before even completing their swiping animation, There is also some kind of oddity with hitboxes involving rocks thrown by Tanks, which allows Tanks to hit survivors round the corners of buildings.\n\nPacing/Networking:Game sessions can be hosted on dedicated servers or locally via a player's computer. The game runs very well on a slow connection - on a connection that had a maximum transfer rate of 8.5kb/s, I've managed to maintain a ping between 50-70 on a dedicated server within the same country. Depending on how quickly players rush through a campaign, game sessions can last anywhere from 11 minutes on the shortest campaign, to up to roughly an hour for a standard one.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Great multiplayer functionality (netcode, built-in voice comms)\n+ Quick drop-in, drop-out ability\n+ Maps have decent atmosphere and varied settings\n+ Great mod and add-on support\n\nThe Bad:\n- 'Cheating' infected AI\n- Linear maps\n- Weapon variety is somewhat lacking\n- AI has slight pathfinding issues\n- Survivor bot AI can be annoyingly incompetent\n\nConclusion:\nLeft 4 Dead is a game best played with good, human teammates. Survivor bots will suffice in the beginning, but as your skill increases, you'll quickly see just how deficient bots are. Linear maps limit replayability, but this may be offset by the fact that so much community-made content has been released and is readily available for download - www.gamemaps.com/l4d\n\nWhat's the point of getting this game when Left 4 Dead 2 has everything the original has, and more? The gameplay in the original Left 4 Dead feels different compared to the sequel. In Left 4 Dead 2, there is more of a focus on rushing through hordes while under continuous attack. In Left 4 Dead, the focus is more on waiting the horde out while staying in a defensible location. The maps that were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 from the original game have also been modified to reflect this.\n\nIf you've got no one to play with and are just looking for a server to join, at this stage, you may have difficulty finding games online, depending on where you live. The game's lifespan can be significantly extended if custom add-ons come into play, and the game can also be tweaked using various command-line startup options. I found a lot of entertainment and cheap humour in watching the bots play campaign and survival by themselves while I spectated.","December 25, 2015","true","000.4"," 86 of 87 people (99%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","99","86","87","12","0"

The game is a zombie apocalypse game where you play as one of four survivors trying to get themselves to safety. These survivors are Bill, Zoey, Francis and Louis. They're trying to get themselves to safety as their story began two weeks after the infection. They themselves are immune to this virus while thousands of people already become hungry undead.\n\nThe gameplay is almost similar to any Valve game, you can play up to 4 players with friends or people from the internet and play together. The zombies in this game are also unique, you won't just meet regular zombies, there are special infected that has many special abilities which can get you some troubles. Hunters for example, likes to leap and then pinned the survivors by surprise. The most fearsome infected could be the tank or the witch, they are the worst. Witch can take you down with only single attack despite her pity appearance. Weapons are quite good here, there are pump-action shotgun, dual pistols, submachine gun, assault rifle or hunting rifle. If you're overwhelmed, simply toss a pipe bomb and that thing will attract zombies from you and then blow them up.\n\nGraphics of Left 4 Dead is quite decent and impressive. The Source Engine has again prove its worthiness. Explosion effects, gore and blood effects, the sounds and the environment are all impressive, including the amazing ragdoll effects which makes the environment more chaotic. And still, the game runs pretty stable and smooth.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead is a good game to play with friends. I recommend this.\n\n+ Cooperative play.\n+ Good choice of weapons.\n+ Good graphics, engine and physics.\n+ Many variety of zombies.\n\n- AI team still not very improved.\n- Harder difficulty is too hard.\n\nRating 8/10","January 21, 2014","true","11.9"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","87","95","0","2"

No longer could you "win" the game by only caring about yourself. You need your teammates and your teammates need you.\n\nPros\n● Unique Cooperative Gameplay in every Gamemode! (Campaign, Versus, Survival)\n● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.\n● Free DLC.\n● Make your own Maps!\n● Low PC Specs required.\n● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.\n● Scoring System in Versus allows for both Teams to make an insane comeback!\n● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.\n\nCons\n● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining.\n● No Workshop.\n● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.\n● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.\n● Ragequitting is not punished at all.\n\nThe Community\nThe Community for Left 4 Dead is very comparable to Left 4 Dead 2, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates.\nThere however used to be a Competitive Scene, this scene was much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies. Unfortunately, it has died a long time ago.\n\nCurrent Status of the Game\nAs of this post, Left 4 Dead has an 30-Day Average of 385 Players Worldwide.\nYou are very unlikely to find Games going on, and if you do happen to find some, they're likely going to be unenjoyable.\n\nThe only way you're going to really enjoy this game, is if you find a couple of likeminded buddies and get Campaign + Survival going. Pushing your way through Expert mode will always remain fun. :)\nIf you're feeling lucky and you're not prone to ragequitting or shouting accusations (Trust me, nobody cheats in Left 4 Dead anymore) you can give Versus a go. 4 Players is already half of what you need!\n\nFinal Words\nLeft 4 Dead currently costs $20, just like Left 4 Dead 2. They however have a much different feel to the game and I'd still buy both versions.\nI recommend adding it to your wishlist until it gets on Sale though. ;)","October 18, 2014","true","858.2"," 82 of 88 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","82","88","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/500/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Left 4 Dead is a CO-OP first person shooter game. The game uses Valve's well known Source engine, released in 2008.\n\nThe game is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, you take control of one of four protagonists, which will be known as the "Survivors". They will be pitted against hordes of infected zombies in four different game modes, a single player mode which the three other characters are controlled by the AI. A co-op campaign mode,  an online versus mode and a four player survival mode.\n\nthe game play focuses mainly on cooperation and working as a team. You will see all the regular features included in other FPS games, such as outlined teammates throughout the world, so you know where they are all the time. A cool feature which I found to be a nice surprise was if a member of your team were to fall off a ledge, they won't automatically plunge to their death, they will manage to hold onto the ledge and the other team members may go and "Help them up" much like you would do if you were healing them.\n\nThe campaign mode has six levels, each containing anywhere between three and five individual chapters in them. Each of the chapters takes place in a set environment which allows the player to explore around to find little Easter eggs, pick ups - such as medi-packs, pain pills,  weapons and ammo. These points are supposedly randomly generated so each time you play, they will be scattered around in different spots. There are tons of rooms, tunnels and buildings to explore on every level, and there is no time limit either so you can roam around to your hearts content, provided you don't mind the odd zombie jumping out of the closet to try and eat your brains every now and again.\n\nEach of the Survivors are individually voice acted very well; and you can communicate with your team using quick menus. Some voice commands will sound off automatically such as when you are reloading, you'll let the rest of your team know so they can cover you. This to me was a small addition but added to the realism of the game.\n\nThroughout the game you will encounter a number of different zombies which have their own special attack or mutation, such as The Boomer, which is a bloated zombie that will spit bile onto the Survivors which attracts other zombies to your location. This again adds a lot of variety to the game so you don't feel as if you are just mowing through hoards of regular zombies all the time.\n\nThe graphics, while are running on an engine which is a number of years old now, still look awesome, and games today sometimes struggle to present them selves as well as Left 4 Dead. Even with settings right the way down on low, it still looks impressive - meaning any rig or potato will be able to run this.\n\nI played the single player campaign on normal mode; while I had no real issues finishing the game, apart from the last level, I still was satisfied with the level of challenge which was on offer, I can imagine the hard and advanced levels will be completely mind fumblingly hard though. I tried to play the campaign mode online, but sadly there weren't many games available at the time, but it is something I really want to try just to experience the co-op side of things on this game.\n\nPretty much every one owns Left 4 Dead already, and most will have probably already played it; but I really suggest people that haven't played it or at least purchased it but not tried it to play.

Players who run ahead are typically targeted by the game, and the game is harder with few players (so it's important that you *AND* your teammates survive!). Therefore this game--in my many years of experience with it AND in comparison to my many years of Counter Strike experience--tends to have a friendlier and more team-oriented group of players to interact with. I appreciate the game dynamics in L4D very, very much.","October 31, 2014","true","057.7"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","62","66","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaka9lag/recommended/500/","kaka9lag","Kaka O'Camper | 9lag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaka9lag/","171 products in account","My Review :\n\nRate  : 11/10, would hug Tank and date witch!\n\nGame Information :\nGenre : Action, Survival Horror, FPS, Multiplayer, Co-op\nEngine : Source\nDeveloper : Valve\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac\nRelease Date : 17 Nov, 2008\nNumber of active players : 300-1000\n\nLeft 4 Dead or what we fans call 'L4D' is an action based horror FPS game developed by Valve in 2008. "Green Flu" a highly contagious virus causes extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells and loss of higher brain functions. Two weeks after the infection four immune survivors : Bill, a Vietnam veteran, Zoey, a college student; Louis, an IT analyst and Francis, an outlaw biker make their way through the city fighting infected, dangerous mutations. There are 2 types of infected, special infected like hunters, boomers, smokers and tanks and other type is common infected that aren't playable. There is one more special infected called 'witch', you can't choose her in Versus Mode. There are originally 20 maps and 10 weapons. Not all L4D1 achievements and maps are ported to L4D2. And not all of us play L4D2 as much as L4D1. So I recommend buying L4D Bundle, it better for you to decide which one is your type.\n\nSo there are 4 ways of playing this game :\n\n● Single/Offline Mode : You and three AI bots play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps.\n\n● Multi/Co-op Mode : You and your 3 friends/online players play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps. For the newbies, don't directly jump to expert servers as people there wouldn't care much to teach you what's right/wrong and will simply vote kick you. I'll cover this part at the end.\n\n● Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, either playing as a human trying to get rescued or as 4 playable special infected.\n\n● Survival Mode : You survive in a closed area and hold out against the infected horde and special infected as long as possible and compare your stats with your friends. There are 3 medals : Gold, Silver and Bronze based on your survival time.\n\nThis game requires you to work with your teammates and help them and get help in return. When you get pounced on by a hunter or get dragged by smoker or generally incapped by an infected, only your friends can revive you so make sure you treat them nicely.\n\nOnly thing I see people complaining here is that they get vote kicked for not doing anything. Here is a list of things you should consider and follow to not get kicked by others.\n\n● If you see an incapped survivor, based on situation if its possible and easy to revive them then help them, don't simply leave them there. I know its called Left 4 Dead :D\n\n● Make sure you don't hurt your teammates. In case you hurt them, heal them with your kits or give them your pills [Pills Here!] Least you can do is apologize before they call a vote.\n\n● Don't start the events. Events are those situations where you press a button or open the door and hordes rushes at you. Just wait for all players to arrive at that spot and make sure all are ready. If you really want to press those buttons then ask if they are ready and then start it.\n\n● In the Versus Mode, it is important to work as a team. Since it is 4v4 (or same level), all the players have to incap all the survivors at the same time. One survivor is enough to ruin others attempt. you will likely get kicked if you stay apart or just roam around as an infected.\n\n● Don't change your team in Versus Mode, not just kicked, admin might ban you too. (Personal Experience :P)\n\nEven after following all the rules and you might still get kicked. Don't get disappointed if someone kicks you, even players with 1k hours still get kicked. Sometimes, people just kick you to help their friend get a slot or if you have very high ping.\n\nIf you like my review, please upvote it so more people can read it.

It's gaming experience is dark, viserally frightening and frequently so intense that it will have you looking over your shoulder just to confirm there isn't a zombie behind you.\n\nThat is why it is so incredibly awesome!\n\nSo, without any further delay here are my top 10 reasons for why you should definitely buy Left 4 Dead:\n\n1. The survivor characters are well thought out and very relatable.\n2. The game has excellent replayability, even in campaign mode.\n3. The achievements are carefully crafted, challenging and completely addictive.\n4. It does what a zombie game should do: scare the crap out of you.\n5. Multi-player is encouraged, rewarding but not always necessary.\n6. The varying difficulty levels actually make a difference (just look at my hours on expert)\n7. You can play as special infected in multiplayer mode!\n8. The level and campaign design is amazing.\n9. It's one of the best zombie FPS games ever.\n10. It's just so much bloody fun!\n\nMy only criticism is that sometimes the available weaponry options feel restricted and limited, but that just adds to the challenge.\n\nYou don't just play Left 4 Dead, you experience Left 4 Dead.\n\nSo experience it today!","November 26, 2013","true","226.7"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","0"

Why? Because currently it is priced around the same level and the sequel has all the campaigns from the previous game included! This means more than a dozen levels with continuous zombie shooting!\n\nIn any case, this, just like its sequel, is an excellent game. Although it was released more than 5 years ago I believe it aged well - the game still looks good thanks to the well-developed Source Engine. Years later Valve released many updated including DLCs that expand upon the campaigns - the latest, The Sacrifice, came out in 2010.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a great game! It is a coop-based, action-oriented survival horror game. It is pure fun to get rid of the continuous hordes of zombies with friends game after game!

After two weeks of this green flue caused by the highly contagious pathogen four immune survivors Bill a Vietnam veteran, Zoey a college student, Louis an IT analyst and Francis an outlaw biker were making their way through the city of Fairfield. After avoiding all the infected finally survivors were rescued from the Mercy Hospital roof but unfortunately they found the pilot is an infected too. Zoey killed him and the chopper crashed in an industrial district outside the city. Fortunately they found a vehicle full of weapons and so they went to the riverside. While their way after crossing road blocks they arrived to the local church. When they encountered some lunatic infected in the church they realized that the city is overrun. Then they decided to rush to the nearby boathouse for rescue. From there they reached the city of Newburg on the other side of the river but they got that most part of the city is in flames. So, the large nearby greenhouse was their shelter. But then when a military C-130 Hercules passed overhead they tried to follow it by travelling through the city’s business district towards the Metro International Airport. After arrival they found that the military had bombed the airport while infected pilots crashed planes in an attempt to land. Finally they managed to escape by the C-130.\n\nBut it crashed again and survivors found themselves on the outskirts of Allegheny National Forest. From there they made their way to a functioning yet abandoned military outpost. From there they were rescued to Northeast Safe Zone Echo which is supposed to be the only uninfected area not yet overrun. Although they were immune but yet they are carriers of the infection, so they were temporarily hold by the military. But the four escaped via train and travelled south by Bill’s insistence. Bill had belief that they can get long term safety at islands of Florida Keys. They found a boat by raising an old rusty bridge powered by a very old generator at portside town Rayford. The machinery noise of the process alerted a horde of all types of infected. But then the generator gave out. Bill sacrificed himself to restart it so that the other three can reach at safety.\n\nIf you like up to this then surely you are going to like the game. If you have already played it then may be your liking may increase. Moreover you may feel oneness with the characters by role playing! :)","April 26","true","161.5"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","42","44","11","2"

You play as 1 of 4 survivors (Zoey the college student, Bill the war veteran, Francis the biker, Louis the IT guy). The character doesn't seem to matter, it's just a different voice and skin. They will talk to alert you of things like health, weapons, reloading and where you should go next. Left 4 Dead is geared toward online multiplayer, but you can play solo through the game where your computer partners are competent enough, but need to be guided by you. Instead of online multiplayer where the other players seem to just run right through each level.\n\nThe controls are simple, point and click to shoot like any first person shooter, right mouse button is for melee for when foes swarm around you and they will. You have a long range weapon (shotguns, oozies, assault rifles and so on), a pistol (or 2) with limitless ammo, a medipack to restore your health or someone else's, pain pills that will temporarily give you a health boost and finally an explosive thrown weapon like a flaming cocktail or pipe bomb. You can jump or crouch for better weapon accuracy and that's it. The combat feels very limited because of this.\n\nThe big drawing point to the game is some sort of smart engine called the director that will generate random zombies to come at you, so no play through is the same twice. Such as a zombie that was at point A of your first play through might be a wall of zombies or no zombies, or a female zombie in your next play through. These zombies will race toward you after a few moments of shuffling their feet that might result in your terror, but an entire game of zombies running to you gets old very quickly. Zombies can climb up areas, go under truck trailers and the animations are good in general. Weapons and ammo scattered outside of safe rooms will not be in the same place twice.\n\nThe game is broken into campaigns and levels that you can access any one at any time. The campaigns are brief and really take you out of the action when you need to load a new campaign after completing one. The levels have good atmosphere, dark, spooky, but it gets old very quickly. Most every level feels the same with generic buildings, generic exteriors, generic trucks.\n\nBetween the levels are safe rooms. Leave a safe room and make it to the next safe room to cap off the level. Then at the end of the level, you see your score and how you did against the other players. Who killed the most zombies, who took the most damage. Stuff like that.\n\nTo be honest it's not that good. It feels very one dimensional. Within the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer. You will quickly see all of its small variety of enemies zombies run straight at you, witches that stay huddled until you put a light on them, stalkers pounce on you until you are saved, smokers use a tongue to strangle you until you are saved and explode smoke, exploders that vomit on you and tanks that can throw you and take a giant amount of punishment. You will really need to rely on others for survival. The computer players will be very willing to help you, but the players in multiplayer may not be as willing or can't when you've been left behind or gone ahead.\n\nThat's it. The game isn't very long and for a game that touts its random enemy generator, it doesn't make me want to replay the game again and again. Combat is simple, enemy variety is lacking, but the game plays very smooth. Essentially left for dead is about mowing down tons of zombies and if that's your thing, this is the game for you. If you need puzzles in your FPS or weapon depth, it's not for you.","February 21, 2015","true","12.7"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","2"

People who play this game are usually older players, people who had this before L4D2 came out. This game takes Left 4 Dead to its roots, where it was more about the gameplay and teamwork. This game also comes with the Sacrifice, which is a really nice plus. You should all play this game. Add me if you want to learn this game better.","October 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/500/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Left 4 Dead is a co-op, first-person shooter video game, with survival horror elements thrown into the mix. Just like Castle Crashers, this game is for that special friendship group, composed of four friends. With this game, you will find a bounty of endless fun, especially when setting the game's difficulty to an all-time high, as it really gives you that experience of being an endangered species, with the more stronger zombies wanting you dead, thus extinct. From my point of view, you can already tell I hold this game in high regard. Probably due to the fact it is developed by Valve.\n\nThe story takes place in an unamed location, within Pennsylvania. A highly contagious virus known as th ''Green Flu'' swarms the state, causing heavy mutation to human body cells and brain functions, resulting in the loss of humanity, meaning yes, the birth of zombies.\n\nTwo weeks after the infectious outbreak, four survivors, William ''Bill'' Overbeck, a bold, Vietnam veteran; Zoey, a sassy college student; Louis, an optimistic IT technician, and Francis, an aggressive outlaw biker, the four heroes of this game make their way through perilous cities, discovering along the way that the virus is causing more dangerous mutations. On a side note, the story of this game is split into campaigns, going in chronological order from top to bottom and progressively, the story is carried out on to the games sequel.\n\nThe player takes control of one of the four survivors; only if human players are not involved, thus the survivors are controlled by the CPU. The main objection of the game is to reach the safehouse after each level of the campaign.\n\nBeware to watch out for the special infected. These types of zombies are the strongest of the common infected and if you get incapitated by one, you won't be able to shake them off, but unless one of your fellow survivors lends a helping hand and kills the attacking zombie. So, this just goes to show that teamwork in this game is the key of getting farther and staying progressively stable to continue playing.\n\nGuns and other types of defense and weaponry, (in the shapes of molotovs and first-aid kits) are scattered among the map, usually on different occasions. This mainly happens after holding off an entire zombie horde, where they break through from left, right and centre. All of these weapons that you find are frequently random, but you can stick to the weapon you like the most. Just make sure to search for ammo at a seldom pace, especially if you're playing on a much higher difficulty. When outnumbered, just remember to always keep your health up, along with your teammates, as every chip of HP is precious into reaching the end of your goals.\n\nThis game is simply fantastic, but is usually overshadowed by its sequel, Left 4 Dead 2; possibly due to the inclusion of all campaigns found in this one and carried out in its said sequel. The one thing I personally prefer from this game is the feel of the slightly tighter controls it has when compared to Left 4 Dead 2. I would say this one is for the competitive players and the sequel is for the casual players. Considering you could just mess around, with the Shrek mod and all, and don't tell me you bloody haven't. It's a lot of fun and of course, the modding community adds to Left 4 Dead 2's advantage, much to this games' disadvantage.\n\nIn closing, I definitely recommend this game to all who are fans of survival horror video games and those itching to test their own determination and teamwork with one another. If you have have the sequel, I would still recommend getting this first game, just for its originality and or the fact you can add it to your godly Valve collection.","April 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","35","44","6","3"

Spitter (makes it a good thing to hide in small rooms for survivors in all the cases) 2. Charger (much less insta kills possible) 3. Jockey (♥♥♥♥ yeah I hate them)\n-  Knowing the last 3 infected, being alone as survivor is even more dangerous (hunter is probably the best one to get alone survs, and with the smoker its really easy and it can make quite much damages too. Unlike the jockey who makes less damages, or the charger with whom its much harder to get one single person)\n-  Some items are missing such as adrenaline, defibs, laser sights or fire ammo.\n\nSo in the end L4D1 lowers the tactic possiblities as infected (pretty much always the same idea with these 3 ones) but also makes it more complicated for survivors on many levels, which is a good thing knowing how they're OVER ♥♥♥♥ING POWERED in L4D2.\n\nMany peaple hate L4D2 and just like L4D1, that's understandable, the first one is fairer in the realtion survivors / infected, but the second one has much more fun items, and much better maps too as for me.","January 2, 2014","true","75.2"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","3"

Compared to the sequel Left 4 Dead 2 it offers less content and less possibilities like gamemodes but the feeling you get when playing Left 4 Dead 1 is still completly different and Left 4 Dead 2 is not able to give that certain feeling that you get when playing Left 4 Dead 1.\n\nIf you´re thinking of buying Left 4 Dead 2 and you´re looking at this now I would say Left 4 Dead 2 is the better game and gives you more content. But I can surely tell you Left 4 Dead 1 is worth a shot especially if you can get a few friends to play it with you. If it´s on sale and you have a few bucks left this is definitly an option even if you already have Left 4 Dead 2. The feeling when playing this classic can never be reproduced by Left 4 Dead 2 even that it is the better game in general and also offers all Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns to be played there as well.\n\nAlso a personal plus for me is it was my first actual game on steam (not the reason I signed up on steam though) 20 Euros however seems way too expensive for a game that is very good but as well 8 years old already. 5-10 Euros sounds more reasonable to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vampus/recommended/500/","Vampus","Vampus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vampus/","1361 products in account","NOTE: Review based solely on campaign mode 4-player co-op. You can play with 1-4 real players, with the rest of the slots being filled up with adequate AI.\n\nTL:DR; If you can find some decent people to play with co-op, the other elements of the game won’t matter.\n\nL4D is a first person co-op shooter published by Valve. The cooperative nature of the game makes it somewhat tricky to review as one needs to differentiate between the game itself and the people you’re cooperating with. A good game played with poor players tends to sour the game while a poor game with good players tends to elevate it.\n\nThe game was built on the source engine; the same engine Half-Life 2 uses. There were times playing L4D that it felt like you could have been playing Half-Life and I found that a little distracting.\n\nThe graphics themselves were on par with Half-Life 2; they weren’t pushing any boundaries but nor were they terrible. If anything, the graphics felt a little dated, but were smooth and allowed for relatively quick load times. It’s a trade-off.\nYou’re given a limited array of items / weapons to use in the game. It basically boils down to which playstyle you prefer: Long range sniper, mid-range assault rifle/submachine gun or close up shotgun.  All these weapons use up a limited ammo supply with the option of pistols with unlimited ammo also exists (still needing to reload however).  Also available are support items such as Molotov cocktails, zombie luring pipe bombs, medkits and pain-suppressing pills. Some additional variety in items wouldn’t have hurt, but it doesn’t detract from your experience.  (This is addressed in L4D2)\n\nOn the topic of limited array of things; the enemy types also suffer somewhat from this. At the end of the day however, you’re fighting zombies, so what do you expect? They’re a relatively slow-moving, minor inconvenience, offering limited threat…until they swarm. A music cue heralds the arrival of a swarm, often followed by an amount of swearing by the players, as players steel themselves against a brief onslaught of fast moving, swarming zombies. This threat can be a little more troublesome.\n\nAudio cues precede another kind of enemy; a special infected. These inflected also cause players to pay attention and cry an alert as they often throw a spanner in the works of an otherwise simple turkey shoot. Some of them can be easily dealt with or in one case avoided entirely while others can pose a significant threat, an equivalent to a boss in other game franchises.\n\nLastly, the story. Normally the story would be one of the first items I’d address, but in the case of L4D it’s only a minor part of the game. If story is what you’re chasing, you won’t sate your desires here. It exists, but mostly in an overarching chapter introduction, justifying the setting of the map. In most (all?) cases, it requires the players to get from point A to B, usually with a pre-set, player-triggered  swarm encounter somewhere in the middle and another at the end. The story does allow for some interesting, oft throwaway lines of dialogue by the characters however, that allow some entertainment.\n\nWhile L4D may not be the best game in and of itself, but it’s a good co-op. If you can get some friends together and battle your way though it co-op, you should get a lot of enjoyment from it.","November 8, 2015","true","22.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","0"

You play as one of a small group of them. There is Zoey, a young woman; Bill, the grizzled veteran; Louis, the middle-class office worker and Francis, the biker. Armed with weapons, these survivors must battle their way through the undead.\nIn each of the game scenarios, you must battle your way to a series of safe houses that lead to a rescue point. You can have up to four players in a game, controlling each of the characters, or the AI can fill in and control the bots.\nEach scenario is presented like a movie. At the beginning there is a movie poster showing the cast. If you survive, the "credits" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots, who delivered the most friendly fire, and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.\nThe zombie horde that you battle is based on the "fast" zombies. Besides of the zombies there are also special infected. There is the hunter, which can leap across large distances to pin a survivor to the ground. Then there is the smoker, which has a frog-like tongue that can grab a survivor by the throat. The boomer is a corpulent zombie that vomits or explodes to spray survivors. Getting hit by the substance will not only temporarily blind survivors, but it drives the zombie horde into a feeding frenzy. Last but not least there is the tank, he is brick of a zombie that can take an enormous amount of damage and dish out a fair amount. And finally, there is the witch; she is an enormously powerful zombie that can take down a survivor with a single swipe.\nAll maps of Left 4 Dead are available now in the sequel, so it would be cheaper to buy only Left 4 Dead 2.\nStill I would say that Left 4 Dead is an incredible and highly replayable multiplayer experience that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 12, 2013","true","82.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

The versus mode is great too where you get a chance to play as the zombies themselves, it’s a lot harder to play as them though because you need to use tactics and play very carefully or you die easily. The game itself is a mostly online multiplayer game which encourages team work as you keep each other out of harms and rescuing them from certain death which is inflicted by the different types of enemy you face. You can play it offline too which is a nice touch but to really achieve the full experience it is best to access online.\nOverall it's a great game to play, but doesn't last long enough, you will get through the main campaign pretty quickly, so there will be a lot of repetition as you play the same levels over and over again. Thankfully there are custom campaigns to download and play, and modded servers can be used which can change the gameplay experience.\n","April 10","true","209.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

The greatest shoot-and-bash experience and comfortable phisics, nice zombies and other monsters, very impressive characters even with this little told about them, pleasant graphics... I like very much almost everything it consists of. Excluding one damn thing - it's singleplayer on expert is too-damn-senselessly hard, mostly due to three stupid AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, which know how to screw up player's best efforts. They could at least obey commands like "Wait![you three idiots, damn you]", and keep close when they are most needed, that'd do it. Spent a hundred hours in single on expert, completed most missions, but ain't managed to beat no final mission on this difficulty, thou there was many almost beat ones(. Mostly screwed up in the end by those three friendlies. Of course i can look for tricks in internet, but that won't change my negative impressions from this, as of a player with enough experience of killing bots on hardest difficulties(.\nMy apologies for any inadvertent mistakes in english i could have made.\nВ общем классная игра, вполне подходящая для того чтобы ей надолго увлечься. Боевая часть очень понравилась, как и физика игры в целом, зомбари и прочие уроды тоже радуют, персонажи впечатляющие, хотя о них в игре толком и не рассказывается, общий вид неплохо отрисован. В общем почти все круто. Кроме одного неприятного момента - местами бессмысленной сложности и соответственно низкой проходимости синглплэера на эксперте. В основном из-за трех тупых ботов, периодически критично обгаживающих все усилия игрока. Могли хотя бы подчиняться командам типа "Ждите[три тупых урода мать вашу!]" и держаться строго рядом когда они больше всего нужны, этого было бы достаточно.\nПроторчал в игре часов сто, прошел большинство миссий, но ни одной финальной - хотя почти до конца проходил и их(. Можно конечно подсмотреть как это делается в инете, но подпорченности ощущений от прохождения это уже не отменит, мне обычно хватает собственного опыта на максимальной сложности из других игр, чтобы разбираться самому. Чисто боем без трюкачества финалы в сингле л4д на эксперте близки к непроходимым на концах, боты все портят(.","December 28, 2013","true","355.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maidoforleans/recommended/500/","maidoforleans","Jeanne the Maid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maidoforleans/","54 products in account","Hello,\n\nThis game is the first in the series of left 4 dead games, and has largely been overtaken by the release of left 4 dead 2. There is however still enough of a playerbase for you to jump on at any hour of the day and organize a full group (4 players).\n\nDespite what you may have read, left 4 dead 2 is not exactly the "same game" as left 4 dead, there are many differences, such as the assortment of enemies and overall gameplay.\n\nLeft4dead is much more pure and vanilla, it has 4 primary special infected instead of the 8 in left4dead2, no melee weapons and less map event triggers/sidequests.\n\nIt would be accurate to classify Left4dead2 as an updated version of this game, but with that you're losing the simplistic gameplay of the first, for a much more contrived chaotic version of itself.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes:\n\n- This is NOT entirely what I would consider a survival game, it is not team based Resident-Evil, it is an episodic action shooter.\n\n- It is a team based game, while it is possible to operate solo within a map, you're more or less dependant upon those you play with, whether its AI or PC's.\n\n- The graphics and sounds effects are good for when it was released, no complaints there.\n\n- Level layouts are done pretty well, there are always a few bonus areas to explore, you will never find you're stuck wondering where to go or what to do, but because of this the game feels largely linear... I suppose this was the intention of the creators as it is broken down into goal oriented episodes/chapters, as a result this game can start to feel rather repetitive after playing through a particular map a few times.\n\n- The game is never boring, it is constantly throwing enemies at you, and you're constantly rushing to finish the current map, there is very little "downtime" other than the starts and ends of each map.\n\n- There are also two different modes of play offered apart from the regular "movie" mode. Survival, where you have to survive in a set location for as long as possible while the difficulty increases and Versus mode, where one team takes control of the zombies as the other team works its way through the map.\n\n- There can be a few bugs in the game, such as those regarding players falling off buildings and teammates attempting to rescue them, but largely the game is not full of any bugs that directly affect gameplay.\n\n- Personally I feel both L4D & L4D2 should have more weapons, but you never get bored with what you're given.\n\n- Regular zombies in this game are "runners" they're not the classical slow / shuffling Romero zombies, headshots are not required to kill them. In fact these are not "zombies" at all, they're infected/mutated humans, so shooting anywhere can result in a kill.\n\n- The amount of zombies/infected is determined largely upon the players movement through the map, there is no significant set amount of zombies within each map, player progress results in map triggers that spawn hordes of infected that rush to the players location. So moving slow, keeping quiet , etc will be of no real benefit if you're trying to avoid detection.\n\n- It has a few additional items one would expect, med kits, pain pills, molotovs, pipe bombs, gas cans and propane tanks...all spread out rather liberally across any map, irregardless of difficulty, although it does significantly change in expert mode.\n\n- The game offers various difficulty levels, the difficulty level does not affect regular zombie health, instead it changes the the DMG they inflict on a player when hit. Special infected on the other hand are given HP & DMG increases. With each increase in difficulty the available additional items, weapons and ammo on a given map will decrease. If you're wanting to play this as a "survival" game, setting the difficulty to "Expert mode" may offer the play experience you're seeking.\n\n- L4D & L4D2 also seem to have a large map making community, so there will always be something new you can decide to download and play through.\n\n- This series is not ignored by the company Devs, and they don't hesitate to fix problems or show community support.\n\nI would recommend buying L4D/L4D2 as a bundle, if you're interested in playing. If you're seeking community numbers I would not advocate purchasing this game over L4D2, as most L4D players have migrated there.\n\nIf you enjoy team based gameplay and blasting away zombies to the point of nausea, then this is probably the game for you.\n\nThese are well made games that are supported by their company, you will never feel as if you had wasted your money, even if you don't particularily like the game.\n\nEnjoy :)","December 2, 2015","true","18.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

To me, this game is a favorite classic. Sure, you can get the same maps and characters on Left 4 Dead 2 nowadays, but there is nothing better than the original zombies and weapons. I've played this game for years, and I always come back to it.\nThe darkness and eariness throughout these campaigns are amazing. The survivals are extremely fun. And the versus and servers are also a fun competitive experience.\nThe game can be glitchy, and there are plenty of loopholes found in the game, but overall, this game is definitely worth the buy.","May 11, 2015","true","125.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I used to play this on my Xbox 360 and have ever since. I recently bagged this and Left 4 Dead 2 on a bundle deal for £5 ($7) on Steam.\n\nIt was great to finally get to play this game on my MAC. It works superbly and runs great... and with the Steam Edition you get FREE DLC as a pose to Xbox which you must pay for each bit of DLC.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nThe general gameplay is great. It runs very smooth on my MAC and the campagins are brilliant (Full Specs at end of review). I'd have to say that the campagins on this game are better than Left 4 Dead 2's campagins, but that's just my opinion.\n\nCommunity\nThe Community on Left 4 Dead is decent... everyone is friendly and you rarely come across stuck up people who's aim is to troll. Left 4 Dead isn't as active as Left 4 Dead 2 (800 Players v 15,000 Players) but there is still some servers active and enough people to play the game with (although single player works just fine).\n\nOverview\nIn general this game meets everything that I look for in a game. It has great graphics and great gameplay. For a classic game it's deffinetly a great buy and I would reccomend this to anyone who had a notion of buying it. What I will say is I do think you should wait until this is on a deal. As I said I got this game and L4D 2 for £5 together instead of £22. Deals happen ocassionally on this game. But when you catch it on SALE I suggest buying it.\n\n\nRating:\n\n1. Must Buy\n2. Get on Sale\n3. It's alright\n4. Not worth it\n5. Avoid\n","May 7","true","2.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonfoddah/recommended/500/","cannonfoddah","cannonfodder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonfoddah/","1094 products in account","I play this game for an entirely different reason than I would play Left 4 Dead 2. Both games are meant to be cooperative, but after getting rather good at L4D1, I feel that it's somewhat broken in terms of your partners being indispensable.\n\nIn L4D2, you absolutely need to work together as a team in order to accomplish your goals. If there's inexperienced people on your team or if you end up playing with bots, the challenge becomes much more difficult. Some of the guns have been nerfed in order to reinforce the need for partners. Also, you can't melee forever, like you are able to do in the first game. Your character eventually fatigues and your character will start to melee more slowly after a while. The maps are designed to prevent the group from hunkering down in a corner and waiting out the horde. Instead, you are meant to run and gun, trying to lessen the amount of damage you will take, since you can't hide in a corner and melee, which would allow you to prevent taking any damage at all. The finales are much more varied and definitely require some teamwork. Without human players backing you up, the finales on some of the new maps would be near impossible.\n\nIn L4D1, on the other hand, the infected are pretty easy to dispel if you stay in huddled in a single squad. All you need your partners for is to give you a shove to save you from the occasional special infected. As long as you stay in a team, you can save each other from any hazard. The game is simplistic and pattern based. All you need to do is follow audio cues to know what to expect. Hear some piano keys playing? A Hunter is nearby. Hear a howl? A horde of zombies is coming. It's at that point that you just look for the nearest building corner and crouch. Then, you melee and shoot until the horde eventually dies. The game is extremely simplistic, once you've learned how to read its cues. The finales are also a very simple pattern of horde, Tank, horde, Tank, followed by the rescue, at which point you have a horde and a Tank at the same time.\n\nIt's for this reason that I play it, though. I enjoy playing it while talking to friends or use it as an opportunity to make friends. I can spend hours talking to people while killing zombies. For me, it's like a chatroom with a teambuilding exercise built into it. When I play L4D2, on the other hand, I spend so much time focusing on the task at hand, that I can't stop and chat. Not to mention that it's an entirely different gaming experience, which I have yet to acclimate to. In other words, I still suck at L4D2, so I can't easily chat and play at the same time. So, for how I use it, I definitely recommend L4D1.","February 6, 2015","true","948.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Saw one of many (at that days) gameplays and walkthroughs on YouTube and after watching first 5 minutes I watched next video, and next, and next… After 2 hours I was sure: I'm definitely gonna buy this game. I haven't had good enough PC that time, but first thing I did after getting new computer was installing Steam and… meh, buying L4D2, what I regret. 3 weeks later I bought L4D1 and I couldn't believe that game could be so much messed up after just 12 months. The only bug I encountered in L4D1 is that Zoey's animation gets stuck in weird position after loading shotgun (but it's fine when it was empty or only one shell was loaded), and only if playing by Zoey. In L4D2 the most, huh, „critical” bug I got was having all Survivors invulnerable for a few minutes after I somehow managed to shove Jockey off my head (big shame I didn't record it then).\nBesides this, L4D2 feels like it's just not polished – dumb Survivors animations, even more overpowered weapons, cartoonish feeling, annoying behaviour of Special Infected… L4D1 is free of this flaws – and that's why it's my favourite. Heh, in L4D1 I have only my own weapons sound mod in constant use, while L4D2 has about 1 GB of mods throw on it and I still can't get as much fun from it I get from L4D1. Big shame Valve practically dumped it in favor of money they get out of L4D2.","February 8, 2014","true","567.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

That could be the reason why the original Left 4 Dead is "left for dead". BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

However, this version is the best!  Read to the end to find out why.\n\nNight of The Living Dead meets 28 Days Later...  what more could you ask for?\n\nEverything you've heard about Left 4 Dead is true.  It's a great game, and while there's enough action and excitement to enjoy the single player campaign, this is mostly about the instant and gratifying co-op multiplayer that you can get out of it.  Playing with friends is a blast, but playing with complete strangers can also be a barrel of laughs.  Yes your co-op partners can make the gameplay more difficult for you, but to this day there is no end to the amount players that are still playing this timeless classic of an Zombie / Action / First Person Shooter.\n\nSome things to know:\n\n* Left 4 Dead has a fun campaign which can be played alone but is most entertaining when it is played with others.\n* The story is bare-bones, and each campaign ends with a rather short bookend, but each chapter is it's own action adventure.\n* While the story might be light depth and content, the game is presented in a very B-Movie Hollywood schlock fashion that should appeal greatly to classic and modern Zombie movie fans, but also first person action fans as well.\n* Every time you play Left 4 Dead things may play out entirely differently than last time, this is especially true and adds almost endless replay value when playing with numerous different people including randomly encountered gamers.\n** Left 4 Dead is regularly modded by the player community and provides endless hours of entertainment including all new ways to play the game.  This is why the Console verison cannot really hold a candle compared to the Steam version of the game.\n\nI could go on and on about the game, but I think that Left 4 Dead has been reviewed by enough people that it isn't necessary.  I just figured I'd give my two cents and perhaps encourage anyone who still hasn't had a chance to enjoy this excellent action zombie horror game.  Here's the most helpful tip I can give you:  If you're a Zombie movie fan but don't own Left 4 Dead on PC, or World War Z on Blue Ray or DVD, then buy L4D and forget all about World War Z (and go read the book instead, cuz the movie sucked!)","January 13, 2014","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Broad support for modding and addons, and plenty of those to be found on the web. Good fluent shooter gameplay with some dynamic stuff i.e.: items and pick-ups placed randomly (still at pre-defined locations though). Few glitches and a good overall stability. The game content is  mostly gore not horror, nothing really scary in there just disgusting.\nSadly the gaming community is the worst of all i encountered in any multiplayer game. There are players to have a good game with that is roughly 20-30% of the average gamer population for this. The rest of them are egomanic loners who love to waste your gaming experience by either rushing, sabotaging, or even outright teamkilling you. The former are the most frequent type, making you wonder why they even bother playing this with others when they would be much better off playing the game single player. Often you will find they set up fake accounts to "troll" those who simply wish to enjoy an imersive campaign and play with a good team. (Votekick usually wont work, so just let them rush and wait until they get incapped and killed by a special infected or tank, then they usually leave because you did not save their royal butt.)\nSo, if you get this either have 4 or more friends you will be playing it with or be prepared to play this singleplayer more frequently than multiplayer. On a bright side the entire game can be finished in singleplayer and AI is okay as well, just a bit stupid-ish.","December 20, 2014","true","146.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I believe that more features does NOT make a game better. Neither do flashy visuals. What do we remember a game for?\n~A bit of my background: I play old school games more often than newer games, and prefer them much more becuase they were, more often than not, a 'complete' package when purchased, and more often than games today, had 'polish'. I'd underline polish if I could (maybe I can and I don't know how hahaha)...\n\nThis game is WAAAAAY better than Left 4 Dead 2 in my opinion (if only it had steamworks! p.q).\nThe difference between Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 is that the former is of the Surival/Horror genre, built around a Co-op FPS. Left 4 Dead 2 is of the Survival(/Action? *kinda vague*) genre (lacking the Horror), built around a Co-op FPS. -The difference between the two games is night and day to me (literally and figuratively). Left 4 Dead 2 feels more like an action arcade game than a Survival/Horror game to me.\n-Left 4 Dead (1) has a better atmosphere, the lighting throughout the game and the time of day immerses me much more than Left 4 Dead 2 does, often times I'll peek sides of a door, enter the dark room, and check my corners. Depending on how thorough I am, I might literally jump in shock because I backed into the one Common infected in the room and she got 10 free damage on me with one smack! The first Left 4 Dead has suspense to me, it leaves me wondering what's going to happen, how the Developer is going to do things, this feeling of unknown whilst still being somewhat familiar as I can think on my feet and know how best to handle a situation.\nLeft 4 Dead 2 has a similar familiarity, but it's more of an "imminent wall of death is coming at this part..." familiarity with the tedious events involving turning off an alarm or loud noise. I get that it takes a degree of preperation and I dig that, it obviously takes teamwork... it just feels as though it occurs too often.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 just feels like a chore with just about everything that I do in it. I had to patch the game up (with custom content) to make it a more 'complete' game, but even with Steamworks and the vast amount of devs (thanks to you all for your content making it more like the first L4D!), some things just can't be changed.\n\nDo I have a bias? I sure do... I'll admit it (don't we all?), but that's because my idea of an 8/10 and a 9/10 or 10/10 is glaringly obvious. An 8/10 isn't a bad game by any means.\n9's and 10's have polish. I would say Halo CE had more polish than the other Halo's (Halo 2 had little time for polish as it was rushed, but was VASTLY more polished than the sloppy Halo 4 with object collisions and other etc.).\nI believe a big bullet point is that the first game in a series makes or breaks the (potential) continuation of the series.\n-After that, a company doesn't have to try as hard to 'make a name' for the franchise if they can just ride off of the first game's successful momentum. It's the same case with Left 4 Dead 2. Sure it has the original Campaign and survivors, and sure I can download Steamworks mods and copy Left 4 Dead(1)'s sounds over and make it more like the first, but I would rather play the first. Because I don't have to fix it to my liking. Everything's already there.. it could just use a bit more content (time to turn to custom campaigns :).\n\n-Left 4 Dead (1) has better weapon balance than L4D2 (naturally, due to the game having fewer variables for game devs to consider regarding balance). *More Variables=Less Balance* "way she goes bud".\n-Left 4 Dead (1) has better sounds (music included that draws me and my friends in), etc.\nThe Jockey, Spitter and Charger bacterias sound jarring (when paired with contagion sounds) and negatively impacts the Survival/Horror atmosphere I seek in the Original campaigns in L4D2, some sounds/music just don't mix well, it feels forced, like it wasn't thought out.\n\nThe most important part would be that the first Left 4 Dead has polish (9/9.5 out of 10). A lot of little issues that can easily be overlooked by most people that are present in Left 4 Dead 2 (8/8.5 out of 10), are not in the first Left 4 Dead.\n^I'm referring to 'little glitches', etc., a particular example that comes to mind, is when the Common Infected do that 360 degree spin while doing the 'looking around' type animation, sometimes they throw up in a circle, it just... screws up the atmosphere/immersion and results in me looking down, shaking my head, and wondering where the hell video games' quality standards have gone. Could this simple thing not be patched?? It shouldn't even need to be, but I bet it woudn't be too hard to fix... considering it wasn't in the first Left 4 Dead :p\n\n+Some would say I'm nitpicking, but I don't compromise on my gameplay experiences. I started with SNES games. and LOVE many N64 games because SO many of them had polish.

Left 4 Dead was the flagship of the zombie apocalypse genre. With a fairly interesting story-line, as interesting as it can get when zombies are trying to eat you. The game is split up into episodes, or movies, where the four protagonists make their way through all imaginable zombie infested areas.\n\nI think Left 4 Dead didn't start the zombie culture, as there were books much earlier, but the game obviously did a great part of magnifying the genre, not only for games but for movies and TV-shows as well. The game has a lot of gore and darkness flowing through it, and I remember being terrified in my first play-through of the game. Looking back - this game didn't have a long lifetime, not as it's "competitor" Killing Floor, that is still kicking.\n\nValve kind of screwed Left 4 Dead over with Left 4 Dead 2 being released only a year after the original. The sequel wasn't even close to having the same atmosphere as it's predecessor, with all that darkness and grain film filter. Valve later ported over the whole Left 4 Dead into the sequel, which gives no reason to play the first game at all, which is very saddening, indeed.","December 2, 2012","true","106.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The atmosphere, the visuals, the pacing, the humor, the maps.\n\nValve reinvented co-operative gameplay with this title. Sure, there have been multiplayer games that let you mash bad guys as a group, but never done as thoroughly as L4D does it. Your team's survival depends on teamwork. And yet, it's never complicated. L4D rewards you for behaving exactly as you should behave if there really was a zombie apocalypse. Stay together as a group, watch each other's back. Share resources.\n\nThe Versus mode exemplifies these themes too, in that the infected team works best if the individuals cooperate and coordinate.\n\nAll of this adds up to an awesome "beer & pretzels" alternative to your usual hardcore fare.\n\nL4D2 one-ups L4D in many ways, but the atmosphere of the original is much darker. When Valve adapts all L4D maps for L4D2, there will be little reason left to buy this game... but still. It's on sale all the time.

Coming from a guy who spent a lot of time playing Left 4 Dead 2, I can personally say this game is actually really awesome. Some people simply don't play this game, because everything that's in this game is in Left 4 Dead 2. Which is true to a degree, however there are some differences. First of all, there are only Left 4 Dead campaigns (which is obviously expected). Second of all, There are no melee weapons either. Third of all, the community is almost dead.\n\nOk so why the hell would I recommend this game? Well, it feels like a better game. Let me explain. Valve wanted to create an amazing 4 player co-op zombie survival game and they did! It was pretty damn scary, it had great characters, the tone of the game was really dark, and it was a ton of fun! On top of that you could actually see your own legs! Left 4 Dead 2 just feels like an upgrade of the game by adding new campaigns, characters, and melee weapons. Left 4 Dead never got the attention it deserved (in my opinion) because Valve decided to release L4D2 way earlier than it was supposed to be released.\n\nhat I'm trying to say is, Left 4 Dead feels more like a classic Valve game and feels like a simple game compared to Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game, but Left 4 Dead is simply a classic.\n\nTL;DR\nLeft 4 Dead is a great FPS game created by Valve that's taken place in the Zombie apocalypse. It's an amazing 4 player co-op game that anyone can enjoy! If you're still not satisfied of what this game has to offer, go buy L4D2.\n\nOverall rating 9/10","December 28, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are also small soundtracks that you may not have heard in the sequel, you can find one of them at the last level of No Mercy after you beat the first tank.\n\nAll in all; for it's price right now @ Summer Sales (or any sales out there really), buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game if you're a true L4D fan. It's worth the money.","June 20, 2015","true","46.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/500/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead 2, this is basically the same game but streamlined. For the uninitiated, Left 4 Dead is a multiplayer FPS where four survivors must work together to survive a zombie apocalypse, fighting hordes of fast-moving Common infected and Special infected with unique abilities.\n\nIn this original iteration, only the Hunter (fast pouncer), Smoker (long-range snarer), Boomer (kamikaze horde summoner), Witch (extremely dangerous if alerted) and Tank (it is what it sounds like) appear.\n\nThere are four modes in L4D: Campaign (play through one of a number of 'campaigns' in the story), Versus (like Campaign but additional people can control the Special infected), Survival (the hardest mode, where you must hold out for as long as possible against the Infected and set time records), and singleplayer (Campaign with bots on your computer).\n\nThe gameplay is directed by an AI system named The Director, who spawns items & enemies, and changes the level depending on the status of the survivors. The harder the difficulty, the more contempt it has for you.\n\nThe presentation, as befitting most Valve games, is stellar. The campaigns are presented as movies, with 'credits' after the end displaying gameplay stats and a separate music Director controlling the incidental music. It does a good job of creating a zombie-film like atmosphere.\n\nOnly thing of concern is the community. It's not abysmal, but it's relatively small and you'll run into some toxic players, given how cooperative and intense this game can be. If you want to play Expert at all, be prepared to do some janky metagame stuff to fit in - killing players who are below 50 health when they reach the safehouse so they respawn at 50 being one example.\n\n\nNow you might be wondering: with all of the official L4D campaigns ported over to the sequel, why should I play this? Well, there are a number of differences that for make L4D unique and worth playing for me and others even today, and even if it lacks Workshop mod support.\n\n\nRegarding weaponry and equipment:\n\n* The weapon animations are simply better than the sequel's. Fortunately, there are mods that port some of them to L4D2. There is also an HD port mod for the pump shotgun.\n\n* The pistols are M1911s, which I much prefer over the L4D2 pistols. There is also also an HD port mod for them.\n\n* There are less guns, which means more meaningful weaponry choices. Tier one only has the pump shotgun and Uzi; tier two has the auto shotgun, M16 and hunting rifle. The shotguns function the most different: if you reload them from an empty magazine you must rack the chamber before firing. This makes a difference on the harder difficulties.\n\n* The melee in non-versus games does not suffer from fatigue; you can keep doing it as long as you need. This is helpful when there are no melee weapons to choose from!\n\n* There are only pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails; and no adrenaline shots, defibrillators or ammo packs. Which, again, can make for more of a challenge.\n\n\nRegarding your enemies:\n\n* Less Special infected (no Jockey, Charger or Spitter) make for a different and some say harder experience, not in the least because the SI that remain are more dangerous here.\n\n* The Common infected appear different and more true to what Valve had in mind.\n\n\nRegarding performance:\n\n* The game runs better than L4D2.\n\n* The HUD is streamlined and looks better.\n\n\nRegarding aesthetics and other stuff like that:\n\n* There are different achievements in L4D; for example you do not get achievements in L4D2 for beating the original campaigns on Expert. If you want credit for doing so, you'll want to do it here.\n\n* The little touch to the bot AI's weapon selection is missing in the L4D2 ports. In L4D2, Zoey uses assault rifles as well as hunting rifles, Louis uses shotguns, and Francis uses snipers. This is in contrast to their behaviour in L4D, where Louis would use the Uzi/M16, Francis uses shotguns, and Zoey would usually pick up the hunting rifle.\n\n* L4D2's campaigns and aesthetics are action-horror oriented. L4D's are more horror-oriented. While this is largely carried over in the L4D2 ports of the original campaigns, the optimal experience is playing them in L4D.\n\n* For those who enjoy glitches, there are a number in the original campaigns that have not been fixed. The Jesus Rock in Death Toll's finale is a prime example.\n\n* You can see your legs when you look down.\n\n\nBasically, Left 4 Dead distills the formula to its essence and consequently makes this first entry into the series a classic. I suppose this right here is why it's still being played in a nutshell.\n\n\nNot to say that Left 4 Dead 2 isn't bad, because apart from the weapon animations and its larger but more toxic community it's really not worse - just different. If you want a different Left 4 Dead experience, or you want to ease your way into the franchise by picking it up at the source, I'd recommend this.","July 9, 2011","true","33.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

On left 4 dead 2 you deal with new special zombies jockeys, spitter, and charger. These special zombies are really annoying in 2.

For a reason, it's more enjoyable though to play a single game as a party with campaigns from two games, rather than always switch between 2 games if you want to play different campaigns.\nCampaigns itself and the whole scenario in L4D1 are better though, probably they aren't really that much different from what they are in L4D2 though to some people, so in case if you don't already see any difference between them yourself, you should just stick to the sequel.\nThe versus game on this one has more idea than in L4D2, since on L4D2 you just run to the safe room and that's it, with this you all have to maintain your health as good too rather than crawl to the safe room as a group.\nStill, with that there's the one problem you would notice if you have played both games, there's half of the special infected that you can use in versus since there are more added zombies in the sequel. It's kind of like a preference if you don't like Chargers, Jockeys or Spitters, but I would find 2 Hunters, Smokers or Boomers a bit unfair altogether.\n\nThere are some things that you might miss from L4D2, like special weapons or throwables, or even some of the gamemodes. Making mostly only the Campaigns the core of this game, which it mostly is though of course. I don't think you would be able to get more than 4 people to get to play this in these days anyway now.\n\nThis is still a great game though, but I don't see any reason to spend money on this for the story, since as said, all the same campaigns are already in L4D2. There's even more story between The Sacrifice and The Passing than almost at any other part of the game and those both campaigns were added to L4D2 in the first place too.\n\nOnly thing that this has what L4D2 doesn't, is a one survival map. So if you're dying to get that, feel free to spend 20€ to get that rather than to search a custom map file for it somewhere for L4D2.","March 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebackuphero/recommended/500/","thebackuphero","BackupHero316","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebackuphero/","180 products in account","I highly recommend this game to fans of co-op games. Even though Left 4 Dead 2 is technically better, the original still manages to be a pretty awesome game in it's own terms.\n\nThe game is split up into a bunch of campaigns, each split into five chapters/levels (excluding two campaigns). The first four levels require a team of characters to progress to a safe house. Along the way, you encounter or are attacked/ambushed by hundreds of zombies, and while they are pretty to defeat, the sheer number of attacking enemies can be overwhelming. Teamwork is a key element when playing on normal difficulty or over. Adding to the enemies are a number of minibosses, which require different strategies to defeat. Some are pretty easy, while others keep you on your toes. The fifth and final level/chapter in the campaign is normally some kind of extraction from the area, which requires players to defend themsevles in a certain area for a set amount of time. It can get pretty intense.\n\nThere are four characters to choose from before the start of the campaigns. There's a computer guy, a biker, a war veteran, and a college girl. There's not much of a difference with who you choose, it's more of a personal preferance. But even so, there's quite a bit of dialouge for each character, some for scripted events in the campaigns, and a ton of comments/quotes for player use during gameplay. This is useful for players who don't have a microphone during multiplayer.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, there's an interesting versus mode, where some players play as the survivors, while the others take control of the game's minibosses. And not to mention a survival mode.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. Even though this game is from 2009, it still holds up in today's standards. Lighting and flashlight mechanics are impressive. Textures are mostly high quality. Depending on your rig, the game maintains a good-maximum framerate, even when you have thirty zombies running around in your field of vision. I was surprised that the game ran so well, since I have a pretty bad graphics card for gaming. I managed to put almost all settings to max. On the negative side, I see black spots like a radius around fire ingame, although I'm sure it's just my graphics card (Intel 3000 integrated).\n\nAll in all, I think this a great game. I myself play mainly solo, but this is certainly best played coopertatively. Worth the money. 9/10.\n","January 10, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easy to learn and play, takes tons of practice to master but suits difficulty for everyone.\n\nIt's insanely addictive and co-op with friends or even just random people is a refreshing experience and a great way to make friends to play along with in later games.\n\nKeep an eye and ear out for the special infected, tanks and witches. They will definitely test your ability to work with your teammates and make you feel truly rewarded when you kill them.\n\nWorth every cent.","November 23, 2013","true","172.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play through a series of maps fighting common infected as well as various special infected that provide a greater challenge. As you go through the maps, from saferoom to saferoom you pick up consumable items and get better and better weapons. Although the lower difficulties are so easy a child could complete them the higher ones provide a great level of challenge and are nearly unachievable without a team of good players.\n\nIn the second game mode, versus, you play a four vs. four matchup where teams take turns at playing survivors as well as infected. As the infected team you spawn as one of the various special infected and try to inflict as much damage as possible before the survivors reach the saferoom.\n\nWhile campaign is mostly a smooth play, provided you have friends to play with, versus has a number of problems that make it hard to enjoy in the long one. Chiefly is that the game was never balanced in any meaningful way so the survivors can quite easily complete every map taking a minimum of damage. Without imposing some sort of house rules on what the survivors are allowed to do any organized versus game quickly becomes a rather boring affair.\n\nAnother rather large problem is the number of bugs still in the game, despite Valve doing almost weekly patches for several years the tank, the infected's only real game changer, will still occasionally spawn outside the map and instantly die or spawn on top of a burning barrel which works much the same.\n\nAlthough underneath the horrific balance and game ending bugs is a rather solid game it is also a game that requires organized team play. You can't simply jump on a random server without expecting to get disappointed. I was lucky enough to have a number of great friends to play with yet whenever I booted the game up by myself I always found it to be a frustrating and bland affair trying to get any sense of game going with randoms. It's a game that can only really be enjoyed in gathers.\n\nGraphically the game is quite good despite being on the now aging Source engine. Various poor design decisions mark the experience though, most notably the unusually low skyboxes on certain maps.\n\nThe sound is fairly functional, each breed of infected carrying with it a number of distinct sounds that'll always keep you on your toes.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a good game but it does have some problems, the most important of which is that it isn't a game you can just buy for yourself, you have to have friends to play with and while I enjoy playing coop with people I know not having to option to occasionally jump on and play a quick session without planning it beforehand really hurts the game in the long run.\n\nAlso, any review of Left 4 Dead would be incomplete without a mention of Left 4 Dead 2 because that's what killed this game. These days you'll only find a few games going at any given time and for a Valve game to have such a short lifespan is just atrocious.","November 15, 2012","true","253.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Very highly recommended (plus the online player base is fairly decent) and, by the way, 9.3 user rating on metacritic after 3000+ ratings. That's quite a testament to the quality of this game.\n\nAlthough I've rated it up, if you can afford Left 4 Dead 2, I suggest you buy that instead (actually it's the same price as L4D as of Feb 2015).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/500/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Left 4 Dead is a first-person, cooperative shooter that takes place in a zombie apocalyptic Pennsylvania where you play as Bill, Francis, Louis, or Zoey and fight the hordes until you reach rescue. The game sounds very obvious and doesn't sound too special nowadays. However, does the game still appeal to gamers in today's standards?\n\nBefore I continue on to this review, I got Left 4 Dead in mid-June 2009. What is that previous sentence relevant or important? Well, let me tell you. If you had brought Left 4 Dead from November 2008 to December 2010, Left 4 Dead was a magnificant game. Heck, it was a great classic and a perfect gem. When Left 4 Dead was released back on November 2008, the game spawn a whole new genre: Multiplayer Cooperative. Sure, there were some games that had that genre, but Left 4 Dead won over the general gamer's perception of a true, cooperative game that you have to rely on your friends to help and assist you. Arguably, Left 4 Dead had also build a foundation of a new video game genre (which is now getting a bit overboard now): Zombie games.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a multiplayer game that put you and your three other friends (or players) in various campaigns (which takes around 45 minutes or so, depending on difficulty level or pace) to reach rescue (or finale that is called).  What is interesting for Left 4 Dead is that you replay the campaigns over and over, but each replay feels "different" or new in some extent. This best feature is known as AI Director. AI Director is a system where items, zombie spawns, and various props are randomized in different locations, making the players not always assuming that the items are in that one, specific area. Thus, this increase replay value by a good margin. Left 4 Dead's atmosphere is actually very immersive and impressive for an aged game. In addition, Left 4 Dead's Survival Mode is worth playing and is very fun so it is encouraged for the potental buyer to try it out.\n\nA summary of positive features...\n\n+ Strong, cooperative multiplayer without a doubt\n+ It is really fun playing with your friends, and a lot better when you make new friends on the game\n+ AI Director increase its replay value\n+ Very immersive and night atmosphere which is better than Left 4 Dead 2 (even when Left 4 Dead's maps are transferred over to the second game)\n+ Survival Mode is really fun and really worth playing to get your personal best, breaking records, or achievement hunting. Either way, you might make new friends when you play Survival Mode\n\nA summary of negative aspects about the game...\n\n- Versus Mode is an interesting concept and can be fun, but it is ruined by arrogant players\n- The game used to have over 30,000+ players when I played back in 2009 and 2010. Nowadays, it is around 500 players thanks to Left 4 Dead 2 and Valve's abandonment when the sequel was released.\n- The game has aged and less than 500 players are around. Might be a bit discouraged for a potential buyer to get it\n\nLeft 4 Dead was a legendary classic that spawn two gameplay features that remains popular today and it is highly recommended.","July 12, 2015","true","294.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean the game doesn't even have trading cards and early access titles on steam that are purchasable Alpha-stage games DO. What's that say?\n- Also, no steam workshop.\n- There are a number of exploits in the first game that are left totally unchecked by the default game developers - such as crouch glitching a hunter in versus off of a collision-enabled object such as a moveable car [punchable]. (too many to list here)\n- No competitive mode ever instated in the game: I.E. a rebalancing mode that would work much like the Rotoblin sourcemod plugin - removing tier 2 weaponry or limiting them, as well as items and health items.\n- No SOURCETV or HLTV equivalent!!!\n- Extremely locked-down engine, with SO many commands being set to literally "DEVONLY" tags in the source code itself - making them invisible inside the engine without removing the "DEVONLY" tags or using Sourcemod.\n- No easy or simple way to remove all of the elements of the hud visually [Ilncluding visual recoil] during demo recording, for good smooths, for stable recording that feels more 'camera-like', as POV demos can be somewhat messy, and a cleaning up is always in order when cfging, and you must write a config to record them smoothly, ((and while this is nice of them as a company to let us use the developer console, this is the best kind of game in that arena, and Valve has always held steadfast to that for their older games)); meant solely to increase the popularity of their games that much more.  :/ Come on its a glorification for a fan to dedicate some of their time on earth to the personal creation of something like that, and when done right they are very entertaining.","November 7, 2015","true","420.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, i love games with zombies and apocaliptic climate in background. It is a game for everyone who like zombies - Killing like and playing as them. U have 4 playable main characters, which u choose ? It's your decision !. On Versus mode u can play as zombies. U have 5 zombie "Bosses" which 4 are playable. 3 are random everyime and 1 - Called Tank - choosed for any player in infected team. All is random.\n\nThen now i choose good and bad atributes of L4D.\n\nGood Sites:\n+Great climate.\n+Best Multiplayer Mode focused on teamplay.\n+Two sites in Multi.\n+ZOMBIES !.\n+Some effective weapons.\n+AI are good.\n+Play with friends !.\n+Much Campaigns, u can download more if u want.\n\nBad Sites:\n-Not much weapons.\n-Some bugs.\n-Not open world.

Many times I've asked myself whati in this game is so adoictivelly immersive, that I've to spent so much time, allthough I posses more than 100 verg good games'\nFinally I can say that L4D is grounded on the deeply humanistic orientated and composed game I've ever personally meet. Even if you play it single, there are so good (and funny) dialogues that feel some kind of deeply socialised partnership. Actually, after few trials you somehow know that you are usual member of the "apocalypticcy survibal crew" .\nAdditionally, every NPC has own style, personality, and recognizable value system, belief and precipously portretet character. NPC-s are never boring, you'll not noticed any kind of fepetitioning sequence, even if I recognized appropriate sentence, because it is usually happened in a kind of new situation.\nAlso, this game is somehow react on your way of playing, so sonmetimes you'll find a lot of unexpectzed situation - as you usuali have on higher level. In my opinion this is very good, because on that way game cannot become a kind of boring content.\nI warmly  recommend L4D to any gamer (not only to FPS lover, 'cause I'm personally NOT FPS lover...)), In my opinion, L4D1 is bacsed on deeply humanisticly oriented game, warm stoy of usual humans, who give us a hope, even that things go worse.\n\nAččthough it seems to be uncorrest - but legitimate - previously written L4D1 recomendation CANNOT be used as a concept of L4D2 RECOMENDATION, but rather as very opposite. Just say onestly: L4D2  is deeply missing tragic atempt, basic on idea that something what is actuaslly perfect, can be renewed to be "more" perfect?","October 31, 2013","true","284.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamajellydonut/recommended/500/","iamajellydonut","iamajellydonut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamajellydonut/","71 products in account","IMPORTANT!!! This is not a bad game by any means. It is, in fact, a very good game. It's just that Left 4 Dead 2 has everything this game offers AND a whole lot more. If you are looking to get a Left 4 Dead game, just get Left 4 Dead 2. I suppose you could get this game and Left 4 Dead 2 for the sake of bragging rights, but that's really about it. The only reason I have this game in my library is because I preordered Evolve, which, as I said in my Left 4 Dead 2 review, is probably one of the biggest financial mistakes I've made in my life to date.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nLooking at people's reactions to this review, I'm a little unsure whether I should keep this review up to encourage discussion or if I should go ahead and give Left 4 Dead 1 the old thumbs up so people don't get so butthurt.\n\nAlso I am a wondering if people were mislead by my "biggest financial mistake in my life to date" ramble. Evolve was what I was dissing, not Left 4 Dead 1. And I'm not gonna go comdemning people who have purchased Left 4 Dead 1 even if I didn't like it, because how you spend your money is none of my business.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna go lying about how I feel about this game. Yes, there are enough differences between the two games for them to technically pass as two separate games. The differences just aren't substantial enough for me to justify trying to sell this game as being infinitely better like the entire planet seems to think it is. I will not deny that Left 4 Dead 1 is an absolute masterpiece. I will not deny that there were plenty of changes made from L4D1 to L4D2 that were most certainly NOT for the better (most notably, IMHO, the ridiculous camera movement when being damaged). But I am BAFFLED by the fact that people compare these games like they have zero similarities to each other, completely ignoring the fact that both games are built on the EXACT same engine, have the EXACT same base gameplay mechanics, and even use many of the EXACT same in-game assets.\n\nIt's not like I'm never going to play this game. I will absolutely pick this game up on occasion and play for a while. Like I said, I don't think the game is bad at all. I've even gone so far as to make a point (which EVERYONE has made a point of missing) that it is, in fact, a fantastic game. But the lack of any truly substantial game-changing tweak from L4D1 to L4D2 on top of the fact that L4D2 has more characters, more guns, more campaigns, Steam Workshop integration, better zombie gore, even melee weapons... I'm sorry, the appeal of zombie games to me is the killing of the zombies in itself, and L4D2 provides more options in that respect than L4D1. While I absolutely understand that many other people have many other reasons to play zombie games besides the zombie killing in itself (such as atmosphere, story, horror, etc.), the fact that L4D2 delivers better on the sheer joy of murdering zombies than L4D1 is exactly that. You know, a fact. And at the end of the day, why else are we even playing any Left 4 Dead game? The atmosphere? Maybe. The story? Meh. The horror? You've gotta be kidding me.\n\nBut seriously. If you think you have something to tell me that you think will change my opinion, please let me know. And no, whining about how you are so insulted by my review will not accomplish anything. If anything, it would probably be worth noting that the L4D1 community consists mostly of butthurt children who would rather be antagonized by any critical statement in regards to their precious little game, instead of freaking the ♥♥♥♥ out about the fact that right-winged Adolf Hitler 2.0 is running for president of the United States. You know, like any halfway decent excuse for a human being would.\n\nGood day. :)","October 22, 2015","false","14.8"," 73 of 142 people (51%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","51","73","142","11","13"

I am a lover of all things Valve, and a sucker for games that make you feel epic in every aspect possible, and this game delievered exactly these things. My interest in buying this game came from the Steam Halloween sales...I knew not much about it except for a pretty cool trailer I saw for it, and was also considering Killing Floor. I got both, and gotta say I love L4D over twice as much. I've never really played a multiplayer co-op before but this just took me by the balls and made them produce a cournucopia of ♥♥♥♥ due to the amazing factor. It brings together players easily and in very cool ways. CONSIDERING L4D2 OVER THIS?? Grab this one. The characters are so much more fun imo, and I think the hype of new weapons is unnecessary, as I have never felt a shortage or care of weapon diversity. And melee weapons are cool but more of an extra, and will kill you if you buy a game for that! Also L4D is very populated!!\n\n(My first impressions in comments)","October 31, 2011","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

One person can't carry the whole team forever. Some of the game's zombies have certain abilities that FORCE the players to work together. If one player runs ahead of the group, there will be a zombie who incapacitates a player and the only escape is by the help of a teammate.\nLeft 4 Dead is the epitome of undead apocalyptic teamwork. It truly is worthy of all the praise its recieved.\n\nMy rating:\n9/10.","March 7, 2014","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I'm going to recommend why you should play Left 4 Dead, I have to convince you right here, right now why it is better than Left 4 Dead 2. I'll do that by making comparisons.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is the nostalgic zombie game of the twenty-first century.\nMod friendly and complete capability for customization of game play.\nThere's an ambiance in the original L4D which you can not find in the first.\nI've had 700 hours of gameplay in both games and I can tell you the AI director is different in both games.\nLet us say the AI director in Left 4 Dead is GOD.\nIn Left 4 Dead 2, the AI director is GORDON RAMSAY.\n\nLet me say there is nothing wrong with the Introduction of new infected. However, the Jockey and the Charger exaggerate a new issue in L4D2: spawn location.\npawning infected in checked rooms, cleared areas, is one thing. However, spawning special infected in a checked room/closet/space right after leaving that space makes no sense. If that is supposed to make the game more challenging, it is a very lazy way of doing so.  Let alone add two new infected that have an extremely fast gap closer, spawning them in the closet you just closed based on a rule of "20 feet" or so is not fun. In Left 4 Dead 1, Spawns for infected started at a distance and because of clever level design, were able to move in and sneak up. Spawning right on top of your location is not clever or sneaky. It is annoying. That is how left 4 Dead 2 works. Wherever you are, the zombies are. The zombies spawn based on your location, instead of being apart of the ambiance.\n\nWith that said, I will briefly summarize the pro's and cons of each game right here so you can choose what you want for yourself. Keep in mind what I am about to tell you are facts. Writing reviews based on opinion is as pointless.\n\nLeft 4 Dead Pros:\n1. Ambiance\n2. Pace (Zombie spawning)\n3. Difficulty\n4. Streamlined (complete game)\n5. Mod Friendly\n6. Can see your own feet.\n7. Easy hosting and server set up\nCons:\n1. Need for new infected role (Spitter, NOT charger or jockey)\n2. Need for new Gameplay Mechanics and guns (Adrenaline, grenade launcher)\n3. Community player base demolished since release of sequel.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 Pros:\n1. Great Versus Mode\n2. Very Mod Friendly\n3. New Infected Roles change game dynamics\n4. Large Community Playerbase\n5. New, exciting game modes\n6. More jokes\nCons:\n1. Horrible AI spawns and game pacing\n2. Lack of Ambiance\n3. Sometime too difficult because of bad spawning\n4. Can't see your own feet\n5. Difficult server set up, local servers limited\n6. Large number of unusual behaviors by zombies coined as "random, planned."","November 2, 2011","true","100.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You can wield a shotgun, machine gun, handgun or sniper rifle the first two have upgraded versions (the autoshotgun is the best) on top of the guns you get to carry throwables like molotovs and pipe bombs, all to destroy the endless hordes of zombies and anything else you may encounter.\nIncase the action gets to thick for you on expert, The game hosts 4 different difficultys. if its to hard just drop it down level, The game try’s to keep you on the edge of your seat by introducing new enemies (special infected) randomly through the stages, which can be the most annoying thing when playing on harder difficultys, but makes the game alot more fun because they always seem to jump out unexpectedly.\nHealth is very important, and the game works it in well, each player starts with a medkit which should be used wisely, you can also carry pills (need to be scavenged) which give you a minor health boost temporarily for when your on your ropes, these things come heavily into play the higher you set the difficulty.\nJust briefly wanted to touch on the games players A.I = USELESS, its nigh on impossible to do a level on expert when your playing alone.\nThe replay value is great. and the achievements can have you doing levels over and over, the best part without doubt is the co-op. playing a 4 player game with friends trying to shoot your way through levels on expert is great fun. even when you ruin the session by getting your friends and yourself killed.\nIf you like FPS that are fast paced and relentless this could be for you.

Before Left 4 Dead the only major coop exclusive games were mods like Sven Co-Op\n\nHowever, as much as I liked Left 4 Dead it was an imperfect game that was only improved upon gradually through patches and DLC. One of the features that makes Left 4 Dead and it's successor interesting is the AI Director. Valve must have realized Left 4 Dead would be exclusively a rental unless they spiced things up to the player. What the AI Director does is decide where zombies and items in the world are depending on the player's progress and how well they work together. Every time you play the game it is completely different, especially depending on who you play with.\n\nThe biggest factor to buying Left 4 Dead is wether or not to purchase the second instead. I believe the campaigns from L4D1 have already been ported to L4D2. As a result Left 4 Dead remains just a curious bit of history and only a purchase if your not a big fan of Valve's big budget changes with L4D2.","December 6, 2012","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/500/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on October 15, 2009\n\nGranted, at first when I heard Left 4 Dead would have only 4 campaigns of 1.5-2 hours length each, I was very confused, however they more I played the demo the more I understood what valve was going for. The re playability of Left 4 Dead is phenomenal.\n\nGameplay- Left 4 Dead's core gameplay is an incredible amount of fun, and if you've ever played zombie mods for other multilayer shooters and wondered what the most awesome ungodly combination of zombie gaming would be, this is it. Basically you and three teammates (AI or human) go through these campaigns together fighting off hordes of zombies and specialized monsters all while being tormented by the mysterious and much vaunted AI director. Well the director is quite talented at mixing it up. Even on your hundredth playthrough of a given campaign, you won't know where the attacks are coming from exactly. The game does get a bit predictable in terms of spawn points, but that's really only limited by the mapper and the overall feeling is one of scared confusion, perfect for a zombie game. I could describe Left 4 Dead's core zombie gameplay for hours but it's really something you just have to play. It's very intuitive and a whole lot of fun. A few complaints are legitimate, however. In total there are 5 guns besides your side arm(s): shotgun, auto-shotgun, assault rifle, smg, and sniper rifle. A bit more variety and customization would have been nice, though these weapons all work just fine. Also, although you wouldn't know it now, valve has been slow on patching this game up to what it should have been at release, doing things like unlocking all campaigns for versus, and adding survival mode. Ultimately, they will continue to support Left 4 Dead, but they get marked down for being slow.\n\nGraphics- It's a late build of the source engine, but it's still the source engine: nice, but not anything special in 2008, let alone 2009. it does the Job and they have spruced up the lighting and dismemberment effects quite a bit.\n\nSound- The sound in this game is a lot of fun. The aural cues given off by special infected and the musical crescendos that precede major fights are things you only tune into the more you play. The weapons sound and feel satisfying, and some of the special infected noises are just gross, or even disturbing. Very fun.\n\nValue- Left 4 Dead is a game to be played online, preferably with friends. The bots will give you your money's worth, but the true longevity of this game is in both competitive and cooperative online play. Valves updates both past and possible future ones will continue to add content for the players. All in all, a much better value than meets the eye.\n\nTilt- I love zombie games and movies, so what might have been an 8.7 on the old scale becomes a 9 on the new one.","December 31, 2013","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I'm going to recommend why you should play Left 4 Dead, I have to convince you right here, right now why it is better than Left 4 Dead 2. I'll do that by making comparisons.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is the nostalgic zombie game of the twenty-first century.\nMod friendly and complete capability for customization of game play.\nThere's an ambiance in the original L4D which you can not find in the first.\nI've had 700 hours of gameplay in both games and I can tell you the AI director is different in both games.\nLet us say the AI director in Left 4 Dead is GOD.\nIn Left 4 Dead 2, the AI director is GORDON RAMSAY.\n\nLet me say there is nothing wrong with the Introduction of new infected. However, the Jockey and the Charger exaggerate a new issue in L4D2: spawn location.\npawning infected in checked rooms, cleared areas, is one thing. However, spawning special infected in a checked room/closet/space right after leaving that space makes no sense. If that is supposed to make the game more challenging, it is a very lazy way of doing so.  Let alone add two new infected that have an extremely fast gap closer, spawning them in the closet you just closed based on a rule of "20 feet" or so is not fun. In Left 4 Dead 1, Spawns for infected started at a distance and because of clever level design, were able to move in and sneak up. Spawning right on top of your location is not clever or sneaky. It is annoying. That is how left 4 Dead 2 works. Wherever you are, the zombies are. The zombies spawn based on your location, instead of being apart of the ambiance.\n\nWith that said, I will briefly summarize the pro's and cons of each game right here so you can choose what you want for yourself. Keep in mind what I am about to tell you are facts. Writing reviews based on opinion is as pointless.\n\nLeft 4 Dead Pros:\n1. Ambiance\n2. Pace (Zombie spawning)\n3. Difficulty\n4. Streamlined (complete game)\n5. Mod Friendly\n6. Can see your own feet.\n7. Easy hosting and server set up\nCons:\n1. Need for new infected role (Spitter, NOT charger or jockey)\n2. Need for new Gameplay Mechanics and guns (Adrenaline, grenade launcher)\n3. Community player base demolished since release of sequel.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 Pros:\n1. Great Versus Mode\n2. Very Mod Friendly\n3. New Infected Roles change game dynamics\n4. Large Community Playerbase\n5. New, exciting game modes\n6. More jokes\nCons:\n1. Horrible AI spawns and game pacing\n2. Lack of Ambiance\n3. Sometime too difficult because of bad spawning\n4. Can't see your own feet\n5. Difficult server set up, local servers limited\n6. Large number of unusual behaviors by zombies coined as "random, planned."","November 2, 2011","true","100.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The more casual gamers may sadly get tired of the repetitiveness that zombie killing produces even with several campaigns on offer. Online multiplayer does however offer fun extras to the game as does the variety of zombies included in the storymode. And who doesn't love a great zombie slayer game?\n\n8/10\nPros/Cons\n\n+ A good variety of zombies (provided by the "specials") and the multiplayer mode mixes up gameplay.\n+ The decent graphics and well integrated audio make for a well-rounded gaming experience.\n+ Killing zombies  is a hugely fun novelty compared to most of the modern FPS games of today.\n+ Smooth game mechanics with a brilliant pick-up and play style make this an excellent game for all.\n\n- There is no doubt a lack of content given that this game relies on replaying the campaigns.\n- Even the different campaigns get slightly repetitive as you play them through for the first time.","February 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is completely addictive – at least it is for me. Shooting zombies is just so much fun, especially when it’s made possible by such a well-crafted game. The premise is very simple: you and three fellow survivors have to make your way from one safe house to another until you are finally rescued. Along the way you have to fight off hordes of slavering zombies. In single player mode the AI is pretty good, although your teammates don’t always behave as you might wish them to during the incredibly hectic campaign finales. There are 4 campaigns with 5 maps to each one. Replay value is good due to the fact that the AI changes the zombie attacks and spawn points with each play, so you never know where the horde is going to come flooding from or where the bosses are lurking. When you get bored with the maps supplied there are loads of 3rd party maps and campaigns available on the web. On top of all this you can even play as one the various types of zombies (on a random basis). Personally I find this less satisfying, but it is worth a go just to get the other perspective. This is a simple but truly great game. L4D2 here I come!\n\n5/5","June 1, 2013","true","574.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a lover of all things Valve, and a sucker for games that make you feel epic in every aspect possible, and this game delievered exactly these things. My interest in buying this game came from the Steam Halloween sales...I knew not much about it except for a pretty cool trailer I saw for it, and was also considering Killing Floor. I got both, and gotta say I love L4D over twice as much. I've never really played a multiplayer co-op before but this just took me by the balls and made them produce a cournucopia of ♥♥♥♥ due to the amazing factor. It brings together players easily and in very cool ways. CONSIDERING L4D2 OVER THIS?? Grab this one. The characters are so much more fun imo, and I think the hype of new weapons is unnecessary, as I have never felt a shortage or care of weapon diversity. And melee weapons are cool but more of an extra, and will kill you if you buy a game for that! Also L4D is very populated!!\n\n(My first impressions in comments)","October 31, 2011","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

For the price of 20 dollars, you can purchase left 4 dead 2, which not only includes its original campaigns, but includes all of left 4 dead 1's campaigns, as well as ALL the DLC campaigns.

Left 4 Dead 2 still includes versus modes, and all the original special infected, while also adding a new mutation mode which are scenerio based Left 4 Dead campaigns that are unique depending on the day you play. Left 4 Dead 2 is still able to play custom maps and campaigns as well, so if you somehow get bored of the original Left 4 Dead campaigns, plus the Left 4 Dead 2 campaigns, plus the DLC, there is plenty to offer.

The game really is at it's best with four friends working together. Co-op is at the heart of L4D, and it's greatest strength. What valve really nails is the simplicity of the game. There aren't many controls, items, or weapons. You know all you need to know in 5 minutes. But learning, and dealing with certain situations gets better with practice. The verse mode is great, troll your friends with one of the “special infected” zombies. Each with it's own special ability. L4D does a great job randomizing enemy spawn points, and mobs seem to trigger right when they should. The atmosphere, and music are on point for this type of game. The graphics can be scaled back, and I find you can run this on practically any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only drawback I find in the PC version is the lack of split screen co-op. This can be done with a command from the dev console, but I think valve should have put it in the menu like they did on Xbox 360. Here is a link if you want to play local split screen.\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=745113\n\nIf you haven't played this one yet and enjoy blasting Zombies with your friends, check it out.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED\nPOTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","November 6, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Any replayability in the game can be attributed to different dialogue and zombies and items that spawn in different places, and that's it. The developers somehow believed that those three factors alone would make L4D stand the test of time and blow people away for generations to come.\nThe Versus component of the game is not much better than campaign mode, if not worse. I find the teams to be unbalanced and always in favor of the survivors and although this next point isn't exactly related to the game itself, the VS community is rather childish and on the same behavioral terms I'd expect from a daycare for spoiled little brats. While this isn't a development flaw it clearly shows that L4D's competetive scene attracts the wrong kind of crowd and soured an entire half of the game for me.\nWhile it's easy to rag on the negative points, it's also easy to forget what has drawn us to the game to begin with: The atmosphere is perfect (which is more than can be said for it's rushed sequel), the coop serves as an excellent hangout for friends and once in a while you just feel the need to partake in a bloodbath that is clearly scaled to your favor.\nIt almost pains me to say that L4D has aged as well as milk that has been sitting out for a month. But it's true, L4D just didn't hold out in our hearts and minds.","January 6, 2013","true","397.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ColeMacGrathHero/recommended/500/","ColeMacGrathHero","Cole MacGrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ColeMacGrathHero/","21 products in account","Left 4 Dead is a CO-OP first person shooter game. The game uses Valve's well known Source engine, released in 2008.\n\nThe game is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, you take control of one of four protagonists, which will be known as the "Survivors". They will be pitted against hordes of infected zombies in four different game modes, a single player mode which the three other characters are controlled by the AI. A co-op campaign mode, an online versus mode and a four player survival mode.\n\nthe game play focuses mainly on cooperation and working as a team. You will see all the regular features included in other FPS games, such as outlined teammates throughout the world, so you know where they are all the time. A cool feature which I found to be a nice surprise was if a member of your team were to fall off a ledge, they won't automatically plunge to their death, they will manage to hold onto the ledge and the other team members may go and "Help them up" much like you would do if you were healing them.\n\nThe campaign mode has six levels, each containing anywhere between three and five individual chapters in them. Each of the chapters takes place in a set environment which allows the player to explore around to find little Easter eggs, pick ups - such as medi-packs, pain pills, weapons and ammo. These points are supposedly randomly generated so each time you play, they will be scattered around in different spots. There are tons of rooms, tunnels and buildings to explore on every level, and there is no time limit either so you can roam around to your hearts content, provided you don't mind the odd zombie jumping out of the closet to try and eat your brains every now and again.\n\nEach of the Survivors are individually voice acted very well; and you can communicate with your team using quick menus. Some voice commands will sound off automatically such as when you are reloading, you'll let the rest of your team know so they can cover you. This to me was a small addition but added to the realism of the game.\n\nThroughout the game you will encounter a number of different zombies which have their own special attack or mutation, such as The Boomer, which is a bloated zombie that will spit bile onto the Survivors which attracts other zombies to your location. This again adds a lot of variety to the game so you don't feel as if you are just mowing through hoards of regular zombies all the time.\n\nThe graphics, while are running on an engine which is a number of years old now, still look awesome, and games today sometimes struggle to present them selves as well as Left 4 Dead. Even with settings right the way down on low, it still looks impressive - meaning any rig or potato will be able to run this.\n\nI played the single player campaign on normal mode; while I had no real issues finishing the game, apart from the last level, I still was satisfied with the level of challenge which was on offer, I can imagine the hard and advanced levels will be completely mind fumblingly hard though. I tried to play the campaign mode online, but sadly there weren't many games available at the time, but it is something I really want to try just to experience the co-op side of things on this game.\n\nPretty much every one owns Left 4 Dead already, and most will have probably already played it; but I really suggest people that haven't played it or at least purchased it but not tried it to play. You will not be disappointed and this is one of the classics of our generation that you need to experience.\n\nP.S - if anyone would like to have a play through the campaign with me, please add me or hit me up as I would welcome any opportunity to give it ago!","July 3, 2015","true","39.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is completely addictive – at least it is for me. Shooting zombies is just so much fun, especially when it’s made possible by such a well-crafted game. The premise is very simple: you and three fellow survivors have to make your way from one safe house to another until you are finally rescued. Along the way you have to fight off hordes of slavering zombies. In single player mode the AI is pretty good, although your teammates don’t always behave as you might wish them to during the incredibly hectic campaign finales. There are 4 campaigns with 5 maps to each one. Replay value is good due to the fact that the AI changes the zombie attacks and spawn points with each play, so you never know where the horde is going to come flooding from or where the bosses are lurking. When you get bored with the maps supplied there are loads of 3rd party maps and campaigns available on the web. On top of all this you can even play as one the various types of zombies (on a random basis). Personally I find this less satisfying, but it is worth a go just to get the other perspective. This is a simple but truly great game. L4D2 here I come!\n\n5/5","June 1, 2013","true","574.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is completely addictive – at least it is for me. Shooting zombies is just so much fun, especially when it’s made possible by such a well-crafted game. The premise is very simple: you and three fellow survivors have to make your way from one safe house to another until you are finally rescued. Along the way you have to fight off hordes of slavering zombies. In single player mode the AI is pretty good, although your teammates don’t always behave as you might wish them to during the incredibly hectic campaign finales. There are 4 campaigns with 5 maps to each one. Replay value is good due to the fact that the AI changes the zombie attacks and spawn points with each play, so you never know where the horde is going to come flooding from or where the bosses are lurking. When you get bored with the maps supplied there are loads of 3rd party maps and campaigns available on the web. On top of all this you can even play as one the various types of zombies (on a random basis). Personally I find this less satisfying, but it is worth a go just to get the other perspective. This is a simple but truly great game. L4D2 here I come!\n\n5/5","June 1, 2013","true","574.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whatever platform you own this on, fun times are to be had.\nYou take control of one of four survivors of the Green Flu (Virus?), a nasty disease turning the population into flesh-eating horrors. The rest of the survivors are either A.I., or players (treat the A.I. nicely, and you shall be rewarded). You then proceed to embark on a journey from safehouse to safehoue, 'till the finale, where you must hold out for an amount of time before escape is available. In order to even make it to the finale, or move on at all, tight teamwork is needed. You can share items, heal others, and use z and x to say things such as Help and similar call-outs (after all this time, i still don't know what they're called. Voice commands? I don't know. Someone tell me.) to further help the team.\nNow, about the zombies. They are fast. They come in large groups. They are smart. There are certain events which cause them to come in endless hordes, unless something is done that stops them from being attracted. Or the A.I. Director (the thing controlling all the zombies) can send a horde (this one is NOT endless) your way if you spend too much time in one place, or if it feels like it.\nThere are special infected (each special infected has their own music que, and there can be only around 3 in-game at a time) The Boomer spits bile at you, attratcing zombies. He explodes when shot, showering you in bile. He can also detonate at will, so if he's in your face, shove him away before shooting, or before he explodes.  The Smoker produces a long tounge that drags it's prey to it, where it then claws the living hell out of you. Shoot the tounge, or shoot it before then (it likes to stay far away form the group, so be careful). The Hunter can jump super long distances and great heights, screaming every time. He will pounce on you, clawing you until soemone gets him off, or kills him.   The Tank. The name speaks for itself. This thing is insanely strong, requiring the whole group to put it down. Each punch stuns you and sends you flying. Also, he can throw cars. Fun.    Finally, the Witch.  If you hear any crying women, turn your flashlights off and stay away. Sneak around her. You can shoot her, just expect her to make a beeline for whoever disturbed her, and proceed to down you in one hit. She also has very large health, and does the most damage in the game.\nWell, that's all there is. It's a great game to play with friends, or alone. Multiplayer matches, or no. A must-have.","February 14, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which attracts a horde of infected, so don't get too close!\nThe Hunter, a hooded covert that pounces and mercilessly claws through your flesh!

Keep your distance, or else she'll shear you into pieces!\n\nAnd the worst of all.... The Tank!\nA giant mass of muscle and speed, ready to smack you to Timbuk2! Killing him usually requires a group effort!\n\n\nBut besides killing infected until you reach the safehouse, other fun modes exist!\n\n\nOther game modes, such as Infected, has you either play on a team of survivors or special infected, all being controlled by live players, duking it out until one team has been completely wiped out.\n\nSurvival mode is a horde mode where you and others fight through countless waves of infected, the goal is to survive as long as you possibly can! This is an online game mode as well, but it's possible to play this one offline.\n\nEven though this game was released 6 1/2 years ago, it holds up extremely well!

Better thing to do is shoot myself in the face. That Witch jumped up, claws out, and hit me with 1 blow and I am down on the ground with a pistol and had to be saved. That thing is deadly beyond comprehension.\n\nThen there's the Tank. I had an auto-shotgun and it still didn't go down easy.

In return, he kills me and spawn traps me continuously until he died. The level restarted and I brought it upon myself to get revenge. I killed him and both him and his butt buddy decided to kick me just for simply getting revenge. If you ever run into these type of people just report them and leave. Overall the game is pretty darn good. The community is "eh" it has good sports that don't get mad just because you accidently shoot them, and bad sports that get mad just because you accidently shot them once.\nI rate this game 8/10","February 1","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now there has been an update to L4D2 where you can play with the original characters on the original campagin while adding all the new things that came with L4D2. The melee system, the enhanced graphics, more weapons and more baddies. With this update L4D2 has essentially made L4D obsolete now that everyones favorite characters have moved up to the new game.

The game really is at it's best with four friends working together. Co-op is at the heart of L4D, and it's greatest strength. What valve really nails is the simplicity of the game. There aren't many controls, items, or weapons. You know all you need to know in 5 minutes. But learning, and dealing with certain situations gets better with practice. The verse mode is great, troll your friends with one of the “special infected” zombies. Each with it's own special ability. L4D does a great job randomizing enemy spawn points, and mobs seem to trigger right when they should. The atmosphere, and music are on point for this type of game. The graphics can be scaled back, and I find you can run this on practically any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only drawback I find in the PC version is the lack of split screen co-op. This can be done with a command from the dev console, but I think valve should have put it in the menu like they did on Xbox 360. Here is a link if you want to play local split screen.\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=745113\n\nIf you haven't played this one yet and enjoy blasting Zombies with your friends, check it out.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED\nPOTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","November 6, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The melee system, the enhanced graphics, more weapons and more baddies. With this update L4D2 has essentially made L4D obsolete now that everyones favorite characters have moved up to the new game.

This game defintely has a different feel than Left 4 Dead 2.\n\nHere are some notable differences i have noticed playing Left 4 Dead:\n\n- 2 Tanks can spawn in one chapter (This is unlike Left 4 Dead 2 where only 1 Tank is allowed to spawn on non-finale chapters)\n\n- It is much easier to startle a Witch in Left 4 Dead as compared to Witches in Left 4 Dead 2.\n\n- You can friendly fire your teammates with pistols while your incapped (This is absent in Left 4 Dead 2)\n\n- If you fully discharge your shotgun you will perform an additional pumping action before you can shoot again.\n\n- It feels like Hunters attempt to sneak up to you more often as compared to Left 4 Dead 2.\n\n- Ai Bots can shoot car alarms, gas cans, propane tanks and oxygen tanks.\n\n\nThe question many people wonder is if they should get Left 4 Dead since Left 4 Dead 2 has such a large fanbase with the workshop. If your looking to grasp the feel of the original game i would say go for Left 4 Dead, but because of how little people play i would advise buying this game only on sale.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is still the better game but defintely did not regret checking out the original feel of the game.\n","May 17","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
