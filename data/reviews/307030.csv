As with most things of great value, it takes a little time to fully appreciate Fractured Soul. Initially, the gameplay, while razor sharp, will confound most players. The ability to navigate the levels over both screens is one which will take time to grow, but when it does, playing Fractured Soul is an absolute joy. The innovation behind the dual-screen mechanic is anything but a gimmick. With time, one will realize how carefully and intuitively the levels have been put together. While it may not take players much time to complete the earlier stages (particularly on the more forgiving "normal" difficulty setting), Endgame have done a wonderful job in steadily introducing additional mechanics. Just as you begin to feel comfortable with the shifting mechanic, you will have to deal with, amongst others, strong wind, inverse gravity and heat damage.\n\nVisually, Fractured Soul looks great (the PC version has a smooth 60FPS), and if you are able to take your eyes off the action, you will appreciate some surprisingly varied and beautiful backdrops. While I very much like the aesthetic, and the story is nicely told through text between the levels (fleshed out from the brief text of the 3DS version), Fractured Soul is very much about its gameplay. The game actually develops a very specific skill set, taking the platforming genre, as trite as it sounds, to a new level. There are really two ways in which you can play this game through to the end. The first is by adequately mastering the shifting mechanic in such a way as to simply complete the levels, using as much health and time as necessary. This will probably be enough for the casual gamer, and will still provide a stiff challenge. The second way is by playing the game to the point where you have intuituvely mastered the shifting mechanic and "understand" the levels, and are thereby able to comple them within the par time, picking up all bonus items, without taking damage. To my mind, this is how the game is meant to be played. This is extremely challenging, but because the game is not "cheap" and the levels are built entirely around the effective harnessing of Entity's shifting ability, a combination of attention, care and persistence will eventually pay off. Fractured Soul is a game which at heart is built around the idea of speed running, and achieving five stars, particularly in later levels, is a truly rewarding sensation. I have recently managed to five star all thirty-one levels on the 3DS, and am looking forward to doing the same on this version.\n\nFractured Soul is a gem of a platformer. Obviously made with passion, it espouses real creativity and intuition without even a hint of pretension. Particularly with the low introductory price, it is a very easy recommendation, but even at full-price it is money well spent. For those who enjoyed the 3DS title as much as I did, it should be a no-brainer. The technical improvements are clear, and through over 100 brilliantly-conceived achievements you will further hone your capabilities and draw even more from this work of art. Fans of tough and true platformers should lose hours on this, and appreciate every second.\n\nEDIT: I will echo another review that in order to appear on Fractured Soul's leaderboards, you must choose "view leaderboards" after selecting the corresponding level.","February 7, 2015","true","24.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","4"

Times are uploaded automatically.\n\nDo you enjoy hardcore platforming while slowly mastering the mechnics in the game? Do you love speed running through levels to get those low times!? Do you enjoy unique takes on the tried and true platforming style? Then this game is for you.\n\nAs an original 3DS version players, I have to say jumping back into this game felt amazing. I have stated many times on Gamefaqs that this is the best platformer on the 3DS in my opinion. Now let me get to the review. First review ever actually.\n\n_-Gameplay-_\n\nThe game on the 3DS version span both screen but on the PC, both screen are on one screen essentially. You switch your character accross both screens, both with their own enemies and platforms as well as obsticles. Your only actions are jump, shoot, and warp on the controller.  It is you job to get that muscle memory working and be able to not get confused by the amount of "warping" you'll be doing. You'll most likely hate the feeling at first but I insist you stick with it and keep attemping level 1 till you get the warping down and feel comfortable with it. I used to speed run this game a lot and trust me, it took a lot of time and patient to get 5 star rankings on ever level.\n\nAdded to this version is a 2 player mode where each player takes control of one of the screens. When player one warps, player two now takes control. I haven't tried it with a friend, but it feels it would be fun to butt heads together.\n\n\n_-Sound-_\n\nThe music is generally quiet and helps you concentrate more on the game than the music. The music does sound a lot better than the 3DS version though, but sometimes I do wish the music was a bit louder or a bit more in the "picture" so to speak. It's a minor complaint but it's just my likings.\n\n\n_-Graphics-_\n\nGraphics have definetly improved and the colors of objects and the general area have improved. This game isn't the grandest display of GRPHIX POWA but it works and looks clean and simple. You can bump the anti-aliasing up to 8x. In the end, gameplay over graphics for this game.\n\n\n_-Replayability-_\n\nThe game has tons of potential for replaying every level if you wish to improve. Every level has a set Par time to beat, crystals (names secrets) scattered all over the levels and a 5 star ranking system. In order to get a 5 star ranking you need to beat the level under par, grab all secrets, and take no damage at all. The game also saves your "any rank" times where you can rush through the level as fast as possible and score a low time as well. As the levels progress, achieveing 5 star ranks will become much harder. There are 25 normals levels ( 2 SHMUP levels, 3 boss fights, and 20 normal levels) and 6 unlockable levels. These unlockable levels will put your skills to the test and unlocked by getting as many stars from the levels (5 star ranking system). The more stars you achieve, the more extra content you get to play. This game also features leaderboards but I seem to be the only person ranked on the game currently so I'm hoping it's online compatable. NOTE: the game now features a "Normal" and "Hardcore" difficulty setting. I have no idea what the difference is but it's there if anyone was curious.\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nI hope this review pursuades you guys to experience this amazing game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did back when I got it on the 3DS. I'm still hoping there's a little something extra for us who are double dipping to enjoy but if not, it's cool. Good luck fellow players, I'm going to be shooting for those low times!\n\nI give the game a 9/10","February 5, 2015","true","18.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprsclr/recommended/307030/","sprsclr","sprsclr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprsclr/","147 products in account","The core gamplay is built around platforming in levels that are split between 2 screens. (Note: This game was originally released for the 3DS but I never played the game on a 3DS) As you progress and get a better grasp of the game mechanics, you can start to complete levels in more creative ways by making use of the split screen. This core gameplay is very solid and the game is very enjoyable especially if you're the type which enjoys speedrunning and constantly replaying levels in search of a faster route. The replayability also comes in the form of getting Five Stars ranking and achievements to unlock on every level.\n\nSome points to note:\n- You can change the key bindings.\n- The ONLY video option you get is Anti-Aliasing of up to 8x.\n- The sound effects are very nicely done but the music is on the flat side in my opinion. The music doesn't distract you from the gameplay but it doesn't add to it either. (That song you hear in the trailer, Planet by Bitrok is NOT the in-game music)","February 28, 2015","true","66.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/307030/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1087 products in account","Fractured Soul is a wonderful 3DS escapee. A platformer built on short levels with a dual-screen dimension shift gimmick that is as disorienting as it is clever and boy does this game take that gimmick through its paces. Every possible iteration of warping between two similar platforming levels gets tried here in these tight, compact levels. The difficulty is brutal, but checkpoints are plentiful. There really is not much keeping you from the end of the game even on the Hardcore difficulty setting... well, apart from always clever, always interesting, always quick platforming. Not a second of your time is wasted (Well, I can't really say that for some of the shmup levels but even then they average out quite good, again, using the gimmick always well. And when they waste time it's just a few seconds here and there.).\n\nThe end goal of this game, though, is to go back to each of these stages and replay it until you can get a 5 star ranking, by collecting all the secrets, clearing it under par, and taking no damage. Leaderboards are implemented for those who really want to compete, and the levels do lend themselves well to perfect speedrunning.\n\nHowever, even if you don't think speedrunning is the bee's knees, the levels themselves are still consistently interesting and fun for a lovely little platformer. Far, far better than the indie schlock you might see elsewhere. (*Cough* 1001 Spikes), nor does the speedrunning feel like a crutch attached to a game that just isn't worthwhile if you aren't speedrunning (*Cough* Mighty Switch Force.). Whatever your tastes are, if you want a clever, tough platformer that does not beat around the bush, you should definitely dig into Fractured Soul.","February 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

That in itself should get this game a thumbs up. They promptly fixed the major issue, and the game is now very much playable and even enjoyable. Nice job, Engame.\n\nThis game looked so cool in the trailer. I was all set to like it. I'm a huge Megaman fan and this looked like something I could easily get into. Nope. The biggest issue is the controls. They make absolutely no sense. I'm using an Xbox 360 controller. The default layout is garbage, but you really can't improve on it much since you can't map the A button for some reason. The next big problem is the graphics. The only thing you can change in the settings is anti-aliasing. As someone who's using 2 GTX 980s, this is very disappointing as the game looked very graphically impressive in the trailer. I feel that was very misleading. The music in the game is repetative and unimaginative. Overall, a huge waste of $7ish. I really wish Steam did refunds because I'd be all over that. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this game like the plague. Terrible.","February 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

It is worth getting on sale.\n\nPros:\n- Unlike in stonerid, this game manages to make the dimention ability work well in practice as well as gently teaching you about it and letting you get used to it.\n- To keep things interesting it adds a new element each level, such as one dimention being flodded in water or a wall of death chasing after you.\n- customisable controls\n- Pretty good 2.5D graphics\n\nCons:\n- the sound effects of the player (not including guns) and for the baddies (not including explosives) are terrible\n- The music is incredibly bland, boring, and uninspiring.\n-Tthe story is told in the least engaging way possible with a small wall of text between each level.\n- All of the above make it impossible to immerse yourself into the game and you'll find yourself playing this sparingly when you're bored (like you would play candy crush for example) rather than through one big passionate run.\n- No personality in this game whatsoever, when you finish it you actually feel happy to have finished it. That's not a good sign.","June 29, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
