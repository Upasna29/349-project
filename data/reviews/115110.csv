Your family is kidnapped, so you head out to find them, possessing other dolls and using their abilities to solve puzzles and proceed. The storyline is a classic naturally, but it's the premise of the game that really stands out, and Stacking has a lot of fun with its premise. You have a lot of abilities to choose from, accessed by literally jumping into another character's hollow body, and the solutions to the puzzles are clever and entertaining. While the humor of the game sometimes swings towards the puerile, there's a little something for everyone.\n\nThere's limited voice-acting in the game- cutscenes are done in a 'silent movie' type style, complete with rolling projector film. The art is bright and distinct, and like the gameplay, toys with its character model's limitations. The characters move like you'd expect a Russian nesting doll to move, if that's something you've given much thought or worry towards.\n\nThis is a great game for achievement hunters as well- the achievements are tied into completing each level to 100%, and are sensible and fun to finish.","February 27, 2014","true","13.0"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","64","68","2","4"

Great writing, good humor, unique settings and mechanics, and oozing character. This really is a unique game that you should play. Essentially a puzzle game, you complete challanges and other tasks using a plethora of Russian stacking dolls, each with their own special skill. Artistically it's presented very well, cut scenes take the form of silent films or plays and over all there's an industrial revoltution feel (but it is recommended to turn off the screen overlay and widen the FOV). Despite writing for a child main character and many children NPCs the humor and tone is definitely aimed at adults.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/115110/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Double Fine never ceases to amaze me with the sheer amount of charm and originality they can squeeze into a game, and Stacking is perhaps the best example of this yet. An adventure puzzle game starring Russian nesting dolls, it's designed around the principle of, ahem, stacking your character inside other dolls in order to gain control over them. Each doll has a unique ability based on the character they play (for example a bear can scream at the crowd, or a seasick child can literally toss his cookies), and it's in using these abilities that you are able to open up new paths and solve problems in any number of different ways.\n\nAnd that's what I found so enjoyable about Stacking. It's not so much the actual task of solving a puzzle that's fun, but finding the myriad of alternative, often hilarious ways in which you can solve a dilemma that proves so satisfying. Sure I can simply take control of the chef and toss the caviar in the gutter to stop buffet, or I could use the Pide Pipper to draw a band of rats into the kitchen and have then overrun the place. Even when the solutions become too nonsensical to guess, a surprisingly handy hint system points you in the right direction without completely spelling out the answer.\n\nAnd of course all of this is wrapped with as much charm and personality as you'd expect from a Double Fine game, with terrific characterizations for the dozens of unique dolls, a brilliant vintage art direction, and excellent cutscenes that pay homage to silent movies. It's absolutely brimming with character and manages to tie it all back in to its clever puzzle mechanics, making a cohesive whole that might possibly be my favorite of Double Fine's recent games. It's a hard call, but regardless of my personal ranking, Stacking is a joy to play and you'd be missing out if you let something so fun and uplifting pass you by.","August 21, 2014","true","6.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","4"

Stacking does an amazing job of offering fun, challenging puzzles without having any stupid, frustrating aspects.  If you're looking for a fun puzzler with a very fresh taste to it: pick this game up, you won't be sorry.\n\nIn Stacking the basic mechanics of the game uses the concept of those Russian Matryoshka dolls that stack inside one another.  You play a tiny doll, and to solve puzzles you have to stack inside of various bigger dolls each with their own special ability.  You use this dynamic to solve puzzles as you progress through the game using different dolls and their different abilities to overcome obstacles.  It is an extremely innovative and refreshing concept, in my opinion, and I loved every second of it.\n\nThe graphics won't leave you in awe, but they do the job.  The atmosphere won't send shivers down your spine, but it sets the tone. The story won't totally enthrall you, but it holds everything together. Regardless, the gameplay is so incredibly fun and fresh that the mediocrity of some of the other aspects are made inconsequential.\n\nPlay this game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 14, 2014","true","9.9"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/115110/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","A Review About StackingAboutStacking is a game made by Double Fine Studio which produces classic which I will not name but you are probably familiar with. Anyways what is this game about? A lighthearted puzzle game set in a world where matryoshka dolls replaces humans and everything is shrunk down, scaled and done in a way that would make sense for a matryoshka doll. Since they also incorporated silent era film stuff what this means is that dialogue are not voiced but rather appear on screen to the tune of piano and violins and there is no such thing as facial expression since everybody have prepainted wooden faces and they all speak by flapping their midriffs. -sigh- Anyways,\n\nIt uses a third person perspective with a simple story and mechanic that I will describe later but do read the critique section to learn about some of its flaws.\n\nGameplayGameplay is really really simple to the point that even a child could finish the game provided they are age 8-12. Basically you press a button to possess a doll 1 size bigger than you so you can solve the objective at hand with the doll unique ability. Sometimes you need to possess a doll several time so you can grab the larger doll, also some dolls cannot be possess until you clear the challenge since they will either face you preventing you from possesing them since it only works when you are behind them or they are situated in out of reach places.\n\nSo with the power of the dolls you must then use it to clear the challenges aka mission objectives that ranges from reopening the train station to stopping the food services which is nothing complicated and they all have 3-5 ways to clear them and by finding all the solution you will earn a completion mark and a unique doll. Some of the solutions can be a bit obtuse but thankfully there is the hint system which after a short period of time will give you another one so you are never really stuck in a level.\n\nSo after you finish the level you can either do the side challenges like collecting all the dolls in a set, doing bonus challenges, collecting all the unique doll in a level or doing hi-jinks which are basically doing mean things using a doll's special ability a number of times.\n\nAll in all rather simple, good for some fun and one of solutions for any given challenges are often incredibly obvious. Once you are done with a level your hobo friend will draw a mural for you and display all the unique dolls you have possesed and all the challenges you have completed.\n\nOption Menu/Performance/ControlsVery basic, you have options for controls, game effect, resolution, vsync, and a few other things but no sound, also what is the how to play section and credits doing here anyways. The option menu is rather empty for most parts.\n\nI manage to get 60fps on the highest setting although it does stutters when loading a new section of the map.\n\nControls are pretty good but character tends to feel like they are sliding at times since they don't really have feets but after a few minutes I got used to it. I suggest  a keyboard since the game don't really support controller fully.\n\nGraphics/Sound/PresentationGraphics looks fine, all dolls have these sheen to them which suggest they have been applied with a layer of lacquer and dolls with soots and crayon don't have these sheen as expected. Enviroment are good, nothing of note.\n\nDouble Fine were aiming for a classical sound style and they succeded in that. Piano, violin and period style musics are used aplenty and dolls often grunts and do weird noises as oppose to speaking.\n\nNow presentation. Double Fine really nailed the presentation, dolls have floating accesories since they don't really have any hands to hold things and everything else have been adapted masterfully. An example would be the animal which still uses the doll style and trains being made with pins and cardboards. Good point for immersion is what I am trying and failing to say.\n\nConclusion+CritiqueIt has a good premise, good gameplay and they really nailed the presentation so what went wrong in my opinion? Simple.\n\nThe game lacks depth. The whole game feels like one big challenge mode  with nothing else to break it with. While fps may have turret section or sniping mission that goes quiet and 3rd person games have stealth section but Stacking have only the power of using a doll's unique power and possesion to get through the whole thing.\n\nSo if you are not a fan of those I suggest you look elsewhere. But for what its for if you enjoy hearing about this premise I suppose you might enjoy it once this game goes on a sale.\n\nIts short too, clocking at 5 hours for both the story and DLC with the story mission finished but not all the side challenges so there is that to consider.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: B-Rank. [Good for what it does but otherwised a bit short.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo Drama Just Review = http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews","October 26, 2015","true","5.9"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

With everyone being bigger than him, one could say that Charlie is the only one not being in some way hollow. Every doll has a special ability that may help Charlie on his way.\nOverlooked or ridiculed by the bigger dolls, his only help is Levi, the hobo, who offers him a hideout and chronicles his adventures.\n\nThe concept is very well executed, making for lots of fun and at times quite tricky puzzles. There's multiple ways of solving the different situations, with a generous but optional hint system suited to all ages. On top of that there are lots of optional mini quests, involving all kinds of shenanigans, encouraging one to try out all possible combinations of stacking. There's much to explore and delight in in this small world.\n\nMuch effort is put into details. Difference in height when using different dolls changes perspective, field of vision, depth of focus and perception of sound. When jumping into a dog the colours fade, and so on.\n\nThe humour ranges from fart jokes to more mature themes such as the seductive black widow or that creepy guy who stares at women.\n\nAlong with the PC version comes the only DLC, in which Charlie returns the favour done to him by the hobos; finding the lost hobo king of Camelfoot is just as enjoyable as the main game.\n\nThis one comes highly recommended, whether you want to play it alone or together with your kids. Since some of it's themes are quite dark, it's probably not suited for toddlers as tiny as Charlie, unless you lend them a hand. Despite the grim tones, there's still a happy end.\nIf you like titles like Costume Quest, this one's right up your alley, but keep in mind that the alley is in some places quite a dark one, with monsters called men lurking in the shadows.","January 18, 2015","true","15.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

I mean, hell, it comes with it's own cheats.. err, hints, even.\nIn fact, it seems that if one were to do only the main objectives, one could easily complete this game in about 90 minutes. But then, one would be stupid, because Stacking is, actually, not a game, at all.. it's a toy.. to be played with.  More precisely, it's a toy box full of animated old wooden dolls.  Robust characters, diverse in size and personalities (though, not ethnicity, as everyone seems to be white.)\nBut, wait a minute.. they're not just dolls, but vehicles, too! They're easy to jump in and outa, and speed around in, and take screenshots from.  And, as if all that isn't fun enough, each doll type possesses a talent or skill (from gross bodily functions to amusing cartoon antics) to be mixed and matched, and otherwise, experimented with, and giggled at.\nFrankly, the only reason I ever moved on to the next level was to get more dolls, and different places to ride em around in.\n\nHow You'll Probably Play\nIn Stacking, you'll play Charlie, the youngest member in a family of old-world themed nesting dolls. They're poor (of course), but happy (of course), until one day when Charlie's dad goes out for a pack of smokes, or something, and doesn't come back. Eventually, and mysteriously, all of Charlie's older siblings disappear, leaving young Charlie the task of rescuing them, all.\n"Don't worry, I'll bring them home." He tells his mother, then bravely bobs off in search of family.. and adventure.\n\nNo Matter How You Play\nI think there's 5 levels, each with a main challenge, as well as some optional side trips. In general, the challenges are simple, and puzzle-ish (unless you're crazy enough to set it on hard), which allows for a stress free, laid back gaming experience.\nWell, that is, until Charlie's last challenge..\nYou'll probably need to sit up a bit, to get through that one.\n\nNotes:\nI got my copy as part of a bundle, so paid about 1/4th Steam's retail price of $9.99.\nThis copy of Stacking also included The Lost Hobo King DLC,  which I have not, yet, played.\n\n","July 3, 2015","true","24.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","9","10","4","0"

It is essentially a puzzle game starring nothing but Russian stacking dolls where you try to solve problems by stacking into certain dolls and using their wacky special abilities.  It sounds simple, but the levels are large and there's a lot of dolls to choose from, so it can be quite difficult to determine which dolls will work for a given situation.  There are always multiple solutions and only one is required to progress through the story, but the game has a way of making you want to find them all.  It would actually be quite frustrating if it weren't for the hint system, which provides 3 increasingly obvious hints (the last one actually tells you exactly how to solve it) for each puzzle solution.\n\nThe game is made in the style of a silent movie slathered with Double Fine's signature style, with all aspects of the game fitting together so well.  Doll abilities range from farting to charging, punching, and even firing a gun and other dolls will react in ridiculous ways.  They even look shocked when you stack into another doll, since you seem to be the only person with that ability.  It even fun just watching the dolls react to you when you're going about your business solving puzzles.\n\nAs an additional note, this game is locked to 30 fps.  It is the only game I've played that I feel has an actual reason to do so, given its silent movie style, but it still makes the game feel choppy and I would prefer being able to run it at a higher framerate.\n\nSo, Stacking is great fun.  If you like any of Double Fine's other games or just want a silly fun game to play, Stacking is a great choice.","February 24, 2014","true","12.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

And the funny thing is: this game is not just for little kids, adults will enjoy it just as much, if not even more.\n\nStacking is the name of the game and the main mechanic: your goal on each level is to solve a set of clever puzzles by jumping into other dolls, taking over their actions. All dolls have a unique ability that could be the key to one of the many solutions for each puzzle. If not, then it may be used to complete an optional challenge for added fun!\n\nAll of this puzzling is packaged into a story that reminded me of Charles Dickens: early industrialist world with steam engines everywhere, pompous factory owners who try to oppress the working class even more by introducing child (slave) labour, and a witty little protagonist, Charlie Blackmore, who starts on a quest to save his kidnapped family, following the advices of a friendly hobo he meets along the way.\n\nThe plot is divided into 4+1 stages (train station, ocean cruiser, zeppelin, luxury train, plus a DLC stage in a shanty town), all with increasing difficulty and maximum doll size. The first two stages start out especially memorable with their level and puzzle design, but the second half of the game is blander with darker levels and puzzles that share the same goal over and over: get rid of the next guard.\nLuckily there is a DLC/expansion after it, the Hobo King quest, which brings back the creativity of the early levels, bumping this gem to “highly recommended” status for everyone who likes a good adventure.","September 29, 2015","true","12.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Many of the environmental pieces come from real life objects, for example you will see playing cards used as fences, and popsicle sticks and pins littering the area.\n\nThe story is decent, you are the youngest child in a family tasked with rescuing the rest of your siblings after certain events provided in the beginning. The controls are very easy to become familiar with and the tutorial is both helpful and non-intrusive. Learning curve is minimal due to the helpful tutorials and simple control scheme.\n\nAs the youngest and smallest child in the family, you are able to "stack" with dolls exactly one size larger than yourself. Essentially, you are body snatching the person lol. For each person you take over, you will have a particular skill you can use. For example, one of the most helpful dolls is a lady doll that can use "eagle eye," which will reveal any unique dolls in the immediate area.\n\nThere are special sets of dolls that you can get achievements for if you successfully stack all of them together. For example, in the first level there is a family that has become separated - stacking the son, daughter, then the mother will complete the optional side quest.\n\nThe puzzles are not too challenging, and there are 3 available hints that you can use if you are stuck. The hints have a cooldown timer that is not very long. The first puzzle you encounter involves you having to find a way into an exclusive restaurant in order to clear out the guests (so the 3 people you need to body snatch leave as well).\n\nFor each puzzle, there will be different ways to complete them, and these things will all be represented in your secret hideout.\n\nIn the hideout, you will get a new wall mural for each level you complete. For each unique doll you collect in the stage, there will be a life-size model in front of the mural (similar to Fallout's bobble head collectibles). For achievement/100% junkies, you will love this part. There is also a mini painting representing the puzzle challenge you had to complete, and completing the puzzle every way (3 ways in the very first challenge) will complete the picture.\n\nGreat game if you want a new take on puzzle adventures, definitely recommend.","July 12, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

What is more important is that the game gave me entirely new memories because of how original it was in its design and execution. The game didn't drag on either, it was action packed, straight forward and gave me a wonderful nine hours of gameplay to beat the core of the game and the additional downloadable content.

Definitely one of the most original games I've played in a very long while: it's charming, it's funny, it's cute, it manages to be both easy and challenging at the same time, and most importantly: it's fun to play through and actually makes you -want- to complete all the extras and side quests! As an extra bonus, it's one of the very few games that I not only found had pleasant music, but I also liked it enough that I didn't care to lower the volume to almost nothing to avoid hearing it.\nOn the downside, cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but only at certain points, apparently), but I can live with that for the most.\n\nEdited (a bit more thorough) review below:\n\nStacking is one of the most original games I’ve played to date, and one of my favorites. I just cannot tell you how much I love this game.\n\nIn Stacking you take the role of Charlie, the youngest in a family of Chimney Sweepers. His relatives are all taken away to work for the Baron, an Industry leader. Your task? To find and rescue your family, and while you’re at it, free the children that are being used in child labour by the Baron.\n\nThe game is just super charming: the visuals are pretty stunning, the nesting dolls are adorable, and they all have their own powers and personalities. You, being the youngest of your family (and thus smallest) will need to solve puzzles (how to get into and out of places, unlock stuff, etc) by getting into different dolls and using their powers to achieve your goal. You have to respect the sizes, so sometimes to solve a puzzle you have to get inside various different sizes of dolls.\n\nWhat’s best about it, besides the originality of it, is that:\nAll the puzzles are very logical, thus making them both challenging but at the same time not impossible.\nAll puzzles have more than one way to solve it. Meaning you can go back and find all the other ways in which you could have solved the problem. in fact, you will definitely want to do this.\n\nI found the humor utilized through it to be quite adorable and funny too.\n\nThe cutscenes are all made like little theater plays, and the music is just beautiful and very in tune with the game’s setting and style.\n\nThe only downside I could find to this game, though, is that the cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but apparently that works only at certain points because most the time I just couldn't skip them).\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to everyone, regardless of age and gender.","December 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Additionally, there are small achievements to shoot for, just for the fun of it, usually involving using a particular character's ability to annoy a certain amount of particular characters or interact with so many specific things.","November 24, 2014","true","13.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Stacking is the third game from this company I've played, and probably the worst of the lot. It has its charms, don't get me wrong, but they wore away quickly for me, until all that was left was a mediocre puzzle game bereft of any reason to be attached to it.\n\nStrangely enough, the puzzle elements of this game remind me of the Hitman series, where there is a single or multiple goals in a fairlly small venue that need to be achieved through one of various means, with plently of disguises to be worn and crowds to be lost in. However, without the thrill of evading discovery or the danger of imminent death, Stacking fails to make the formula work. Without any danger and the barest of motivations, I was ready put the game away by the second area of the game, and becoming actually angry with it by the third. It is a puzzle game in the sense that it is puzzling how it is even considered a game.

The visual style of the cut scenes is done in a style similiar to a silent movie and it works for this game.  The level design is very polished and everything meshes for this particular art style.\n\nThe only drawback of this game, is that each problem has multiple solutions.  It's good from the aspect that the game never forces you to solve a problem in any particular way; you're free to choose your solution.  However the game encourages you to solve the problem by exploring every solution.  This was fun for awhile, but the levels are massive and movement around them is not very fast.  So you figure out the second solution, and remember that the doll you need is all the way across the level.  Many puzzles have four or five soutions.  After you make this trek a few times it gets monotonous, even if the cut scenes are funny.  I got part way through this game and then let it sit for awhile exactly for this reason.  However I picked it back up and played it out to the end, just solving each puzzle once, and I'm glad I did as the ending was enjoyable with a quite a few hearty laughs on the way.\n\nA good game for adults and kids alike, even though it delves into toilet humor territory, it still keeps it clean.","December 8, 2012","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

So it has nice little morals and such along the way, and even has a funny little extension to the story after the main game.\nThe main idea of the game being that you start off as a tiny little Russian doll, and as you know, a Russian doll usually has 4 or 5, maybe even more layers to it, and you're thrown into a busy world, with many different dolls walking about minding their own business. Many different characters with different abilities and you can jump into the next size doll up, to control them and make use of their ability. E.g. jump into the body of a guard to open that pesky door you needed to get through. It really opens up your imagination and there are many different solutions to each puzzle, so it really gets you thinking. If you choose, you can collect all the solutions and earn little trophies for your main hideout, which I loved, because I am one to love collectibles. But I’m sure you've picked that up by now if you've read any other game recommendations I’ve written.\nAs for art in this game, I personally loved it.

Taking control of a child who could possess any person as long as they are unaware, you could traverse intricately designed locations in order to learn an unusual story. A downfall of that game was only that it came before its time.\n\nStacking, however, isn't Messiah. Its characters are completely flat, the story left me failing to care, and, worst of all, even though you anticipate an intricate game of expertly using your matryoshkas like a point and click adventure inventory, Stacking is not an adventure, it is simply a collectathon.\n\nAn example of what I am talking about: a room is filled with malodorous gas, which has to be bypassed. How to solve it? There is a hazard suit literally directly opposite to the room. Puzzle solved. Congratulations. This is a late-game puzzle. There are about four of these per chapter, for a total of four chapters.\n\nWhere is the content coming from, then? Alternative solutions to the puzzle that are just as simple: such as using the doll whose farts smell wonderfully to override the order.\n\nCollecting unique dolls, such as a doll whose farts smell wonderfully.

There were a few entertainign solutions hidden in the game, but once you've found one solution trying to find all of the other solutions for a particular puzzle gets a bit boring.\n\nI used a keyboard/mouse setup to play this, and it felt at times as if the way the game's characters moved werea bit sluggish when compared to what I expected to happen. Not laggy or anything, but it just felt a little slow.\n\nIn the levels themselves, the video and graphics quality are quite good, howver the extended cutscene graphics can be a bit of putting and after a while you may get bored of them.\n\nThe "old timey" soundrack seems good at first, but it does seem to get a bit repetitive.\n\nAside from these more superficial problems, the game seems to run really well, so if this is your kind of story and so on, you can be sure you're playing with high-quality software.\n","May 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

You have to stack into other nesting dolls of varying talents, to solve puzzles, in order to thwart the Baron, and save your family and all the kids in your world. The game has a steampunk-ish vibe to it, and an old silent film theme; which means theres no voice acting, only subtitles, so you'll need to be a decent reader (not a bad thing in my opinion!) in order to really understand what's going on or where to go. The puzzles themselves wher not hard, but creatively fun to figure out; and there's hints given, ranging from subtle to "dead give-a-way", for each one in case you get stuck!

Stacking is a puzzle game which teeters on the casual line. It’s gameplay and core concepts are based on the Russian matryoska stacking dolls, hence the name: Stacking. You play the smallest doll of them all, named Charlie, as you set out on a quest to rescue your chimney-sweeping family from the evil industrialist Baron. If you haven’t already guessed, Stacking is set in a miniature Victorian world inhabited by matrioyska dolls. Even the cut scenes are presented like silent movies on a stage. It is not quite to the same scope as Brutal Legend as it is less than 10 hours long, and it’s not quite to the same calibre as Psychonauts, but Stacking upholds the fine name of Double Fine.\n\nStacking does have the charm factor turned all the way up with a saloon soundtrack, a miniature world and an unlikely hero. When all the dolls get excited, they jump up and down, like they’re being moved with an invisible hand. Stacking doesn’t take itself too seriously. It was produced as a small side project while Double Fine were working on Brutal Legend and feels like one too. While I was happy with the $10 purchase, I would not pay more than that as there’s just not enough substance overall.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/08/22/stacking/","August 23, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's an adventure puzzler based on Russian Matryoshka stacking dolls. It oozes with the kind of charm you would see from a good Pixar film. Charlie, the tiniest doll, can fit into to small places and can stack into dolls a size up from him to use their ability. Gameplay involves using abilities, Charlie's small size, or a mix of dolls to solve generally easy puzzles - you can beat the game fairly easily and quickly if you want to, but part of the fun is finding the solutions, as well as the hi-jinks (arbitrary acheivments basically) to get gold versions of some dolls. NPCs are honestly lovable morons, but it's their stupidity that allows the great gameplay to exist. Stacking is easy, yet challenging, and is another fine example of Double Fine's creative work. It's a shame nearly none of my friends have played this on Steam, but I assume some of them have played them elsewhere.

You play as Charlie, the tiniest wooden stacking doll. You can stack into other dolls, thus changing your size and what abilities you can use. In order to solve puzzles, you must find which doll to use in which circumstance.\n\nYou can also combo abilities. For instance, I lit a flame with one doll, but the fire needed to be bigger. Hmm, what fuel could I add to the fire? I found a stinky doll and used his "Flatulate" ability near the flame and it made a huge, satisfying inferno. Apparently I could alternatively have used a doll that spilled oil on the floor, but the farting was much more amusing. *giggle*\n\nWhile you're playing the game, you naturally have to solve puzzles in order to progress. But for each of these puzzles, there is usually around three different solutions. You only need to find one solution in order to continue the story, but if you're a completionist, you can explore the area more thoroughly and find all of the solutions. You can do this as you go along, or you can return to the area later, even after you have completed the storyline.\n\nWhile using different characters with different abilities to bypass obstacles is by no means a new concept, the implementation of it in Stacking makes it feel fresh and fun. The art style is adorable, and the cutscenes are designed to look like old silent films.

I'm a pretty big fan of Double Fine games such as Psychonauts and Costume Quest, but I wasn't sure what to expect out of Stacking.  Thankfully, the game keeps the quirky humor behind Schafer's other games while introducing a mechanic I've yet to see in any other game.  I suppose the mechanic of using NPC abilities for your own purpose has been used before, but not while combining it with Russian matryoshka dolls!  This gives a different layer of puzzles as you can only stack into dolls one size larger than you, and sometimes you need to be sure to stack into several particular dolls so you can use their abilities one after another.  Overall, Stacking is not too difficult unless you intentionally decide to seek out the extra challenges, and the narrative is pretty cheesy and unmemorable (which was a disappointment after Psychonauts).

The hook of this cute little puzzler is that every character is a matryoshka, a Russian nesting doll that can by climbed, or "stacked", into and controlled to command their specific ability, but you can only climb into a doll that's one size larger than the one you currently inhabit. This is where Charlie Blackwell comes in.\n\nCharlie is the runt of the litter, the youngest and smallest of the chimney-sweeping Blackwell family, who've been tricked by the villainous Baron into hard labour across his various business ventures. Being unwanted in the workforce because he's considered too puny to be anything useful, Charles sets out to rescue his family and bring down the Baron and his empire, along with the help of his hobo friend, Levi. What follows is an epic adventure across land, air and sea as wee little Charlie stacks his way into a wealth of loveable characters and straight into our hearts.\n\nEach of the four main locations has multiple challenges that can be solved in multiple ways using the abilities of various dolls. Abilities can range from shaking your tush as a beautiful widow to seduce and distract male dolls, to playing a flute as a pied piper and parading rats through kitchens or exhibits... or even just puking up cookies as a seasick child. There's a huge array of abilities, some useful or necessary, some serving no purpose other than to amuse and have fun with, but all are entertaining and encourage experimentation. I honestly had just as much fun using vital dolls to complete challenges as I did needlessly slapping some poor random waiter across the face with a glove for two minutes just because I could.\n\nThe characters are all incredibly loveable throughout (with even the bad guys being endearingly bumbling in their attempts to thwart our hero), but that's only one part of the wonderful presentation that manages to be so effortlessly charming in every way. Cutscenes are presented to us as a cross between a stage play and a silent movie and accompanied by some perfectly fitting ye olde piano music, all tying together the overall Victorian look and feel of every part of the game. The dolls themselves all have so much charming personality that's somehow amazingly conveyed through mostly static, shiny, painted-on faces, and the world around them largely assembled from everyday objects that stay true to scale next to the tiny little toy dolls. It all combines to an experience that has so much more warmth and heart than just about any other game I can think of and only adds to its already enchanting uniqueness.\n\nIf I had to criticise anything about the game it would be that the solutions to a small few challenges can be a tad, umm... "too imaginative" at times and the sense behind the answers feel a little stretched. But, unless you're a completionist, you only need to find one of the many ways to solve each problem and move forward, plus there are optional hints for each puzzle anyway, ranging from slight nudges to outright step-by-step guides, so no player should become too unstuck at any point. The free expansion, The Lost Hobo King, is perhaps a little less successful in winning us over, with its slightly more random feeling elements, but that's only in comparison to the phenomenal main game, and is still a fun hour or two either way, adding to the 10 or so hours to be had with the rest of the adventure.\n\nMost of my time with Stacking felt like getting a great, big hug from a warm, fuzzy blanket and had me fawning over it with wide, glassy, wondering eyes for with just about every part of it. I really hope there are more games in the series to come and can't wait to see what kind of new characters and abilities we'll get to play with like dazzled kids rolling around with a new puppy on Christmas morning. Until then, the best present you can give yourself is a roll around with a cute little doll called Stacking.","October 26, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The hook of this cute little puzzler is that every character is a matryoshka, a Russian nesting doll that can by climbed, or "stacked", into and controlled to command their specific ability, but you can only climb into a doll that's one size larger than the one you currently inhabit. This is where Charlie Blackwell comes in.\n\nCharlie is the runt of the litter, the youngest and smallest of the chimney-sweeping Blackwell family, who've been tricked by the villainous Baron into hard labour across his various business ventures. Being unwanted in the workforce because he's considered too puny to be anything useful, Charles sets out to rescue his family and bring down the Baron and his empire, along with the help of his hobo friend, Levi. What follows is an epic adventure across land, air and sea as wee little Charlie stacks his way into a wealth of loveable characters and straight into our hearts.\n\nEach of the four main locations has multiple challenges that can be solved in multiple ways using the abilities of various dolls. Abilities can range from shaking your tush as a beautiful widow to seduce and distract male dolls, to playing a flute as a pied piper and parading rats through kitchens or exhibits... or even just puking up cookies as a seasick child. There's a huge array of abilities, some useful or necessary, some serving no purpose other than to amuse and have fun with, but all are entertaining and encourage experimentation. I honestly had just as much fun using vital dolls to complete challenges as I did needlessly slapping some poor random waiter across the face with a glove for two minutes just because I could.\n\nThe characters are all incredibly loveable throughout (with even the bad guys being endearingly bumbling in their attempts to thwart our hero), but that's only one part of the wonderful presentation that manages to be so effortlessly charming in every way. Cutscenes are presented to us as a cross between a stage play and a silent movie and accompanied by some perfectly fitting ye olde piano music, all tying together the overall Victorian look and feel of every part of the game. The dolls themselves all have so much charming personality that's somehow amazingly conveyed through mostly static, shiny, painted-on faces, and the world around them largely assembled from everyday objects that stay true to scale next to the tiny little toy dolls. It all combines to an experience that has so much more warmth and heart than just about any other game I can think of and only adds to its already enchanting uniqueness.\n\nIf I had to criticise anything about the game it would be that the solutions to a small few challenges can be a tad, umm... "too imaginative" at times and the sense behind the answers feel a little stretched. But, unless you're a completionist, you only need to find one of the many ways to solve each problem and move forward, plus there are optional hints for each puzzle anyway, ranging from slight nudges to outright step-by-step guides, so no player should become too unstuck at any point. The free expansion, The Lost Hobo King, is perhaps a little less successful in winning us over, with its slightly more random feeling elements, but that's only in comparison to the phenomenal main game, and is still a fun hour or two either way, adding to the 10 or so hours to be had with the rest of the adventure.\n\nMost of my time with Stacking felt like getting a great, big hug from a warm, fuzzy blanket and had me fawning over it with wide, glassy, wondering eyes for with just about every part of it. I really hope there are more games in the series to come and can't wait to see what kind of new characters and abilities we'll get to play with like dazzled kids rolling around with a new puppy on Christmas morning. Until then, the best present you can give yourself is a roll around with a cute little doll called Stacking.","October 26, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in an era where child labor is still prominent and industrial corporations rule, a mean Baron orders children to hard labor, taking away Charlie's elder brothers and sisters, but not him, as he is too small for labor. Only left with his mother, Charlie sets out to save his father and siblings.\n\nThe game is told like a silent film with obvious stage backdrops during the cutscenes, but the in-game gameplay is magnificent, full of wonderful graphics, models and surprisingly well painted textures. Although Double Fine made this game during the Amnesia Fortnight period, where they were in limbo with the publishing of Brutal Legend, it's clear that they spent the time and craftmanship to make this game what it is, wonderful and joyous.\n\nIt's not a particularly hard game, there are a number of puzzle and a number of ways to solve each puzzle. But the easiest solutions are practically thrown right at you while you have to find, with some mild difficulty, the other solutions. The other solutions are unneeded though, unless you're a completionist, as the game isn't long either, about 4.5 hours to complete the game and the Hobo King expansion.\n\nVery fun.\n\n9.1/10","June 29, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Different dolls have different powers and different sized dolls can fit into areas allowing a decent range of puzzles throughout the game. But what’s really neat is the fact that the game also allows up to six different solutions to each puzzle, each weirder than the last.\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty fun.

It's brilliant and adds quite a lot of replay value.

I had my eye on this game due to its peculiar art direction with the whole matryoshka theme. And, being from Double Fine, it should be good! Although I haven't really heard much about it, which now surprises me.\nI'm yet to play Psychonauts, but so far, this is their finnest! (...)\n\nOn to the game. Stacking is a third person Adventure/Puzzle game, in which you play Charlie, the smallest doll of all. The game is set in the industrial revolution era, a place where there's a tyrannical Baron who exploits workers and/or children. Your brothers and sister and taken by him during a workers' strike, and so you're on your newly found quest to rescue them, and find your father, who disappeared to pay off the family's debts.\n\n\nPresentation\nThe art direction in this game is amazing! Everything shows character and is highly polished. In this regard, I can't find any flaws, really. The screenshots don't do it justice, but you get the feel of it. The cutscenes are done in an old movie style, without any speech and then added text, with fitting music.\nDespite the dolls' shape, their animation gives each of them a very unique feel, even in the way they walk and talk, which isn't something anyone could pull off.\n\nThe music fits every scene really well, with handpicked classical pieces, which contributes to the very unique atmosphere of this game. Even if you're not a fan of classical music, I'm sure you'll find it in its right place here.\nAs for me, this might have given me the will to explore classical music a bit more. It's one of the game's spotlights for me.\n\nPresentantion is simply excelent! I'm surprised with how they've managed to do it so perfectly, I really am. From the animation, to the cutscenes, the music... everything is just awesome and you'll find yourself just stop progressing and look around for the sake of it.\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is where this game is truly inovative, it blends mechanics with the world it's set it, gameplay and the artstyle just fit perfectly.\nDue to your size, no one pays much attention to you. This is where the main mechanic comes in. You can Stack into other dolls that are one size bigger than you, and those can stack into others that are one size bigger than them, and so on.\nThere are Unique Dolls, with a name and a backstory, and a very personal feel to them. Then there are types of dolls, mainly a satirical depiction of their "class", I'd say.\nEvery unique/type of doll has its own special ability that will help you solve puzzles or just interact with other dolls to simply have fun with the game!\n\nIn the main game you have 4 main areas (one of which is like the Hub area, which gets more quests as you progress) in which you rescue your family, solve puzzles and just joke around, each with a theme to it. Another area and sidestory is added in the DLC.\n\nEach area the main quest, divided into smaller puzzles. To every puzzle you have from 3 to 6 different solutions, which are accomplished by stacking with the right dolls and using their abilities accordingly. You only need to solve them once to progress in the story, but replayability is highly encouraged in this game, for various reasons. Every solution is very creative and actually pretty fun, so I'd encourage you to try to get to every solution even after finishing the game, as you can go back to every area at will. The in-game hint system is actually very good, giving you little hints that will definitely help you solve some of the puzzles without spoiling it all for you!\n\nAside from the main quests, you have Hi-Jinks. These are essentially challenges to your creativity with the different dolls and interacting with each other to comical effect. Each area has a bunch of them, and I can't stress enough that you should definitely try them all, every side objective in this game rewards you.\n\nIn the main area of the game, you have the friend you meet at the start of the game, and he essentially keeps track of your progress, and creates dolls, wall paintings and puzzle pieces for each solution and unique doll found. In the end of the game, it's awesome to go meet him and see the whole cast of characters and locations in a sort of secret exposition.\nThis is a reason to do the sidequests and challenges, but do them for the sake of it, because every single one of them is very fun to do!\n\nStory\nThe story is pretty straightforward, but it actually has many nuances to it and follows the world hand in hand, leading with some serious issues in a very casual and humorous way.  It's not something I'd examine very carefully, but I like that it's there, and it helps you understand the characters and the world better.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs if what I wrote was not enough, this was a truly brilliant game, in my opinion!\nEverything fits, the world feels alive and is just eye-candy. While I'm not much of a puzzle game fan, this one pulled me in and made me keep playing until I've absolutely finished everything there was to finish in it!\nIf you're intrigued by it in any way, go ahead and buy it. I'm sure you haven't experienced anything like it so far, and it's great to see some developers doing something they like and being inovative... and succeeding!\n\nFrom the music to the artstyle and game mechanics, the writing... I can't find anything worth complaining about. The only problem one might have with it is the fact that it's a puzzle game, but the fact that it has several solutions makes at least one of them fairly easy to get, even if a couple of them were a bit hard to get if you hadn't talked to the right people.\n\nEnough of this chatter. Buy this game if you haven't already, it's awesome!","February 17, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You got it.\n\nYou play as little Charlie Blackmore in this third-person puzzle adventure. Though he is the smallest stacking doll in the game, you can get bigger by stacking into progressively larger dolls, each of which has a unique active ability. Some characters can play an instrument, or give handshakes, or fart out a green cloud of stink, among dozens of others. It sounds like an odd assortment, but you'll need to use most of the powers in this game along with a little imagination to solve the puzzles.\n\nIt will take new players up to an hour to grasp what this game is about and how to think in its shoes, but once that locks in, the adventure is great.\n\nThere are several solutions to the puzzles in this game, and players are encouraged to repeat the story's challenges to discover them all. You'll use a lot of guess and check, but it's fun to try out different combinations of dolls' abilities in each scenario. In one instance, you are tasked with sabotaging a museum on a cruise ship. You can stack into an illusionist to disguise part of the exhibit, lead rats in to ruin the fun, or just stack into the mummy on display (which happens to be a Russian doll, conveniently) and walk straight out of the museum. Whatever you do, other dolls' reactions will make you laugh.\n\nOther more optional tasks include completing unusual hi-jinks and finding unique Russian dolls scattered throughout the levels. These won't be for everyone, but if you're a completionist with a passion for collecting everything, you'll be right at home here.\n\nThe story is appropriately simple. Every so often the cutscenes drag on and become childish, but this is one of the only complaints about the game. The visuals, soundtrack, and sound effects go together really well.\n\nThis is an artful game that runs at a nice length and pace. I cared about it enough to 100% it in less than a day. It would be difficult to find another puzzle game like this one.","January 2, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The puzzles are quite creative and fun, and there are multiple solutions to each puzzle, allowing for a relatively high replay value.  If you can't seem to figure out a puzzle by yourself, you can always get a hint from the menu.  The third hint will literally tell you what to do to solve the puzzle, so only do that if you are completely stuck.  There are also the "Hi-jinx" that you can pull off in each area, and some of them are pretty funny as well.\n\nOverall, I really liked it.  It's definitely worth the $10 that they are asking for it.","January 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has nice moments, but it lacks quite a few things to be a great game. its attempt on replicating an atmosphere of the early 20th century is rather superficial. Cut scene screen flickering and vignettes are supposed to imitate silent films (for some reason, with theatrical backgrounds). Dialogs expose mediocre writing skills. Although the game characters are all Russian matryoshka dolls, the rest of the game has nothing to do with Russia or Russian culture. The idea of stacking gameplay is fresh, interesting, and somewhat addictive. However, the quests you are given are often depressingly immoral. A player seem to always end up breaking something, ruining something, spoiling something to get things done. The humour in the game mainly manifests itself in characters doing funny things; unfortunately, these things include vomiting, burping and blowing wind, which game creators, obviously, find extremely amusing. I suppose a plastic Chippendale chair imitation with a whoopee cushion would be a suitable analogy to the game's attempt to be artistic.\n\nTo summarise, this game is a nice take on an original idea, but it could have been (so) much better if it were made with a bit more sophistication and taste.","September 2, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't seem like much, but after purchasing this game on a whim(it was 75% off for me thanks to crafting my Killing Floor Badge), I realized just how much I had underestimated this novel of a game. The game mechanics are amazing, and it all feels very fluent and only takes a minute for anyone to catch on and have a blast! The story revolves around Charlie, who is basically a midget child that everyone makes fun of for being so small, and his family, whom, at the hands of an evil Baron, are sent off to slave away mining coal, forced to work on ships, and generally anything that is considered a violation of child labor laws. Charlie, being as he is so small, was left with his mother. He then hatches the brilliant plan to master the art of body-snatching, and sets off on a wild adventure to rescue his family from the Baron by occupying the bodies of keymasters, flatulent old men, an ill-bladdered german boy, and a slew of insanely wild characters, all of which will have you laughing emmensely and enjoying yourself way more than the price tag would infer. If you have ten dollars, and you're on the fence about this one, STOP READING AND BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY!! The story is of moderate length, and a bit lackluster with the progression(you start a level, solve the challenges and progress by train to each other level), but the challenges are the true soul of the game, both simple and complex, all of which have hilarious outcomes(making sea-sick kids vomit on maps, luring rats into a kitchen using Peter Piper's flute, etc). The point I'm trying to make is, it's an awesome game if you're looking for something whimsically challenging, full of comical humor, with just a touch of serious slave trading.","July 31, 2014","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I will never know it, because it just annoyed me to the point of not caring anymore.\n\nI can excuse the freeze when I tried to set the resolution to full HD, since it is an older game and I am running it on Windows 10. But after restarting (and setting the resolution without problems on second attempt), I found out there is no way of inverting mouse Y axis as I am used to, which makes me unable to point in the direction I want to go. Then I found the in-game view has an inch of faded margin around the screen probably for artistic purposes, which somehow has the effect of making me feel very uncomfortable, not immersed in the envirnonment but as if looking out through a narrow slit from inside a tank. And then the second cutscene triggered while I was trying to orient myself, and I was not able to skip it by any key press, and that did it.\n\nEach one of these is just a small inconvenience, perhaps except the mouse thing, but together they managed to make me hit my keyboard repeatedly, then Ctrl-Alt-Del and kill the thing.\n\nAnd then I found out it messed up my desktop icons. Programs sometimes cause icons to move while changing resolution, it's not OK but it happens. But this game managed not just to move the icons, it also set the spacing between icons to like 5 pixels, packing all icons tightly together, requiring me to go on a Control Panel quest to find how to reset it back.\n\nI am not going even close to the game ever again after this, sorry.

The game asks you to do increasingly arbitrary and meaningless gags with the various dolls whose abilities have no use in gameplay and are merely there just to make the world seem not as bland and boring as it is.\n\nCostume Quest and Psychonauts are much better experiences, so if your new to Double Fine games, those are much better games to start.","August 9, 2012","false","21.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/115110/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","So, I usually try to write reviews for games that I've played within the first week or so after I've finished it, or after I've played a significant amount of time for a game that has no flat ending. For this game, it's been just over a week (about 9 days) as I've been pretty busy lately, and I thought I'd sit down and write a review now.\n\nBut funnily enough, I don't even really remember that much about the game, and it's only been a week! I get really involved into most games that I play and just sink myself into them. I don't play games while randomly talking to other people or anything like that. What that tells me is that this game hasn't left a big impact on me at all, sadly.\n\nDoes that mean it is a bad game? No, not necessarily. I thought it was fun when I played it, as the style of puzzles is unique for the most part, as you swap around with different characters who hold different powers, and you have to build yourself up (or drop yourself down) to proper sizes to get around the puzzles.\n\nI remember the locations, like the train or the cruise ship or the station. I remember the game was tongue-in-cheek with its style of cutscenes and self-directed humor. But in the long run, it didn't excite me that much playing it, and I remember very little about what the actual puzzles were.\n\nThe puzzles, for the most part, are really simple in most cases, and you can just use Hints if you get that stuck for some reason. I like that the game has multiple ways to solve most of the puzzles, but it is still not that difficult to find them all, and each solution is usually just as easy as the others. If you don't go out of your way to find all of the solutions or to do the special challenges in each level, then you could probably beat the game in about 90 minutes.\n\nAs I said, the game isn't that exciting to play. I laughed at some of the cutscenes or characters, but eventually the style of the game wore off on me. I completed all of the challenges in the game as well, and while some were funny things to discover, it became annoying when I realized that the majority of them just asked to you repeat the same generic action of one character 10+ times.\n\nIn the end, there is no desire to replay the game, and as I've forgotten most of the details in the levels and the puzzles (short of their general settings), the game won't last with me much in the long run. I will likely forget it in a few more weeks entirely.\n\nDouble Fine is still a good developer, but (please excuse me bringing it up) Psychonauts still remains its best game, and it has stuck with me the longest. I remember everything about it and likely always will. That isn't to say that others won't love this game more than I do, however.\n\nSo if the general idea and style seems interesting to you, likely wait for a sale if you want to try it out. It won't take that long to get through, and it is still decently fun in-the-moment. But looking back on it, its unique theme didn't actually make it that special.","March 21, 2015","false","6.4"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

They tried very hard to set it up. multiple puzzle solutions, new and interesting ways to work with puzzles by stacking into characters with special abilities, and a very charming art style. However they fail to execute.\n\nThe game is enchanting for the first half of the game, until you realize that all the puzzles are generally the same, not always very intuitive, and often involve you needing to back track searching for the right doll to stack. After several puzzles it starts to feel that maybe they should have eliminated multiple solutions and spent more time on making more challanging puzzles. The dolls move around so where you left one you might need later isn't always where it'll be, nor will it be at it's orignal location. The story is overwhelmingly blaise though it's clear it was trying to be tongue in cheek silly, and the stages often have sections with very bad lighting. Even with the encouragment of  expanding your in game musuem of sorts,and little optional objectives it all feels very boring and pointless.\n\nI would only reccomend this game if it was on sale, and if you're just looking to waste some time to get some easy acheivments, and enjoy some cute characters.","January 29, 2014","false","17.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It's ironic that in the train station near the ticket desks there's a poster, showing kids with shovels with a glorious shining sun behind them - this was supposed to represent children, enslaved by capitalism, but the fact is that it's communism that did that. In capitalism children no longer had to work because society got richer, and it's communism that produced such propaganda posters and enslaved both adults and kids with obligatory hard work.\n\nI also didn't like how the whole game was scripted. Similar games, like the eco-fundie Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and the nihilistic Messiah also feature possession of NPCs and puzzles based on this possession, but in these games the NPCs have reactions to your actions, they're suspicious to what you're doing etc. Not the case in Stacking.\n\nI bought most of Double Fine's games twice, I supported their Kickstarter and I don't regret spending money on Stacking because of the general idea that the studio stands for. The fact is that I don't like the games themselves though.","December 15, 2013","false","27.9"," 2 of 23 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","23","0","0"

It tells the fun story of a little dude who goes on a grand adventure. It's a puzzle game where you literally play as the tiniest of of a russian doll set. You go around kind of creepily possessing others and making them do your bidding. But in a fun cute way! Really fun, and having the option to complete puzzles in different ways adds a lot to the game. Not so heavy on the replay value unless you really like hunting down trophies. It could have had more replay but once you complete a puzzle, the puzzle sort of reactivates and allows you to complete it the other ways too. You could just ignore the other ways of completing the puzzle and continue but it is often really tempting to do it all in one go.

It tells the fun story of a little dude who goes on a grand adventure. It's a puzzle game where you literally play as the tiniest of of a russian doll set. You go around kind of creepily possessing others and making them do your bidding. But in a fun cute way! Really fun, and having the option to complete puzzles in different ways adds a lot to the game. Not so heavy on the replay value unless you really like hunting down trophies. It could have had more replay but once you complete a puzzle, the puzzle sort of reactivates and allows you to complete it the other ways too. You could just ignore the other ways of completing the puzzle and continue but it is often really tempting to do it all in one go.

The characters, the settings, the details great and small; like each Double Fine game I've played, I didn't want the leave the world behind when I wrapped up everything. Stacking is deceptively fun; it seems like it'd get monotonous and tedious, but there are so many small possibilities that even walking around and interacting with the characters doesn't have to be boring. The uniqueness of each doll is a stroke of genius; their abilities are unexpected and often quite funny, and as you start to recognize regulars from scene to scene you do start to feel a bit attached to them. Also, the protagonist is adorable. He's the tiniest kid in the world trying to save his family from peril, and he's so brave and optimistic that you want him to succeed. It's a feel-good story for every short kid like me.\n\nOne thing I will say, though, is that like many DF games the color scheme here is very brown and green, with rustic and dingy details. If these sorts of games make you dizzy or nauseated, steer clear, because this one's not very brightly colored and the camera is in constant, meandering motion to navigate around the surprisingly large environments. On my machine I wasn't able to use the camera without plugging in a controller, but once I did, Problem Solved and I had no other issues beyond that.\n\nA short, sweet, clever feel good title.

The stacking doll elements both define the gameplay and also inform how the world itself is designed (think early 1900s environments built out of things you’d find in a toy shop). It definitely feels like a casual game, but the challenges and extra bits are fleshed out enough to make it less shallow than most casual fare. The humor is a nice touch and is present throughout the cutscenes, dialogue with other characters, and even some of the challenge solutions.

Stacking is oozing with charm, humor, and a plethora of small details that make DF games my all-time favorites! If when you play an adventure/puzzle game you enjoy getting every snippet of dialog, trying every combination of items/abilities, collecting everything there is to collect, completing every side quest, and just generally playing with the silly antics the genre can afford, Stacking is a no-brainer.\n\nThe game is *not* a point and click adventure game, though the puzzle solving and general tomfoolery will feel very similar if you're a fan of the genre. Instead it's 3rd person, with a ridiculous amount of unique stacking dolls you can hop in and out of (all of which have unique abilities, even if they're just for playing around with, and often times have unique situational dialog), tons of silly challenges, and a fantastic "solve the puzzle multiple ways" system that will have you scratching your head in the best possible way.\n\nThis is not a game to play if you want to just rush through and beat the "main quest" (ie solving puzzles the minimum number of times, ignoring unique doll collecting, etc). 100% completion is where you will have the best time, and will really push your creative problem solving jiggly bits.\n\nOverall fantastic game, a must-play if you like to solve logic problems in strange and wonderful ways, and a top tier gem of the geniuses at Double Fine. (also, I believe, a successful from-prototype-to-product of the "Amnesia Fortnight" gamejam they do internally from time to time)","September 8, 2013","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The neat thing about it is that there are more than one way to solve the puzzles, and it's challenging to try to figure all the different ways out.  The sound effects for all the special moves certain dolls can perform are hilarious and often you'll find yourself just doing them to hear it.  The graphics are neat and the music does a great job of fitting the scene.  Both kids and adults should find things about this game to like.","March 9, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cutscenes weren't a bore to be skipped through or used for a trip to the kitchen, i found myself laughing at the antics of the dolls even when i wasn't controlling them (and making them do hilarious things).\n\nThe puzzles in this game have multiple solutions, and while one is all that is needed to advance the story, the other 2-6 alternatives all offer more of that great cutscene action as well as introducing new uses for some of the same characters who make repeat appearances throughout the game.  The Hi-Jinks bonus objectives encourage you to fully utilize all the extras in interesting and fun ways.\n\nBeing as i'm a lazy type and enjoy a video game from my bed as much as the next grown man with a full time job, I will add that this game is VERY gamepad friendly.  Not counting the optional menu navigation, it uses a total of four buttons plus sticks, making it super easy to play in the dark, from far away, and on a medium sized computer monitor.\n\nThe ONLY downside I can come up with for this game is that it is short.  I have completed the main storyline quests and Hobo Kingdom extra area in only 20 hours with 100% completion on both.  I suppose it isn't a bad thing for a game to keep it concise with quality over quantity, but if the developers are still monitoring this, I'd love to see some DLC expansions to further explore the world of Charlie and his amazing Stacking world.","April 21, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The classiest game imaginable. This unique blend of Victorian entourage, Romantic orchestral music and literary masterpiece made me explore the vast worlds of Tchaïkovsky’s 5th Symphony and Paganini‘s 4th Concerto. The exquisite vocabulary submerges you into the atmosphere of the noble society of the XIXth century. The level design is incredibly clever, and the game mechanics are so rich that... well, the amount of subtle gags and visual puns is exorbitant. A must-play for all gentlemen, aristocrats, classical music lovers, historians and artists. High art in its purest form yet interactive and humorous. It became my favourite arcade because it really pushed the boundaries of my æsthetic perception like no other game. It is highly recommended for people who want to turn themselves into members of intelligentsia, expand their English to the level of Flowery Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness or just experience some heartwarming moments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLymantAnnex/recommended/115110/","TheLymantAnnex","CharmingViking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLymantAnnex/","66 products in account","Stacking is a unique puzzle game from the creative collective that is Double Fine, and follows a tiny doll named Charlie, who sets out on a quest through a Steampunk land of stacking doll people, using their unique abilities to solve problems and save his siblings, who have been forced into child labour.\n\nWhile the game doesn't offer much more than its $10 price-tag would suggest, this neat little casual puzzle-adventure has a lot more going for it than meets the eye. Using Charlie's skill of hopping inside other civilians – in the way which stacking dolls are known for –. the player must solve various puzzles to progress further and rescue his family. Each puzzles has multiple solutions, so there are multiple paths of thinking for each obstacle, and it allows for an extra challenge should a player wish to discover them all. This gameplay mode in itself makes up the majority of the story-driven aspects of the game, and is both fun and difficult in trying to find those last few solutions by thinking outside the box.\n\nThe game has other aspects to it, however, all as equally fun. Progress towards 100% completion requires more than just problem solving, as unique dolls and sets of dolls (such as a family of tourists or a magician's troupe) can be jumped into and collected, and 'Hi-jinks' can be completed, by completing unusual tasks such as shattering glass using an opera singer doll. This is fun, and entirely optional, so if one gets too frustrating, it can be skipped with little consequence towards completing the story mode of the game.\n\nThe game also has good – if cliched – writing, and an excellent visual style, especially in the quasi-2D designs of the doll characters and the environments.\n\nHowever, this game is not without its faults, and there are several. If long unskippable cutscenes aren't your thing, you may want to give Stacking a pass; its cutscenes, presented in an old fashioned silent movie fashion, are numerous and can get frustrating. Despite this, the game's runtime is still rather short, and I myself reached the end of the story in only a few hours. The controls are also slightly fidgety – to take control of a doll, you have to stand in a specific spot behind it, and groups of dolls can make it difficult to select the correct one; there is also a "Highlight path" function for if you get lost, but it takes a long time to run, during which you can't move, so hitting it by mistake is equally frustrating. The camera angle is also somewhat annoying when stuck as a smaller doll such as Charlie or another child, where it swings awkwardly and focuses on the floor more often than not.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I do still highly recommend Stacking as a fun casual puzzler to whittle away a few hours, and is an excellent package for its price; however, if one is put off by the above-mentioned flaws, perhaps waiting for a sale would be advisable.","November 16, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lovely music and visuals, and some truly inventive puzzlemaking. A bit on the short side, but I suppose that's reflected in the price tag. The game is padded out a bit by the Lost Hobo King expansion, which is a great little addition, as good as if not better than the main game. The gameplay aside, it has a lot to say about neo-industrialist Britain, so it's really as much a social commentary as it is a comedy, and it is great as both.","March 27, 2012","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically a puzzle game with matryoshka dolls, you use your ability as tiny Charlie to borrow the abilities of larger dolls around you; it's a simple but fun mechanic that gives the game its unique edge.  The art design and music are wonderful as well, with cross between Victoriana and an old-fashioned silent melodrama.  The puzzles aren't brainbusters, but they do work your problem solving skills and some have multiple and usually amusing solutions.\n\nThe two main criticisms are what appear to be standard ones for this game.  First, Charlie moves very slowly, and in areas where you backtrack, this can be a pain.  Second, this game has pretty much no replay value once you finish everything in it.  Unless you want to go back again and play it for the atmosphere and humor, there's not much more to it.  The DLC is also very short, but if you can pick it up on the cheap, it's worth a look.\n\nIt's a cute game, and I would recommend it, especially for kids and child-like adults, but be aware when it's done, it's pretty much done.","March 20","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't remember getting this much value and fun for that little money. Even for the normal price I would happily recommend this. It's a great puzzle game with great atmosphere and background music. The cut scenes are of old-school silent movie type and are nice to watch. I've spent 8 hours on this game and have completed about 70% of it - main story and side quests - to give a hint of the amount of hours to expect putting in to it. When focusing only on the main story I guess you could finish the game in two hours.\n\nThe difficulty is on a pleasant level: it's not too hard but the solutions aren't obvious either.

Story is decent and the game presents itself like a silent film, using title cards in cutscenes. There are four (plus one DLC) puzzle areas, each with simple challenges and puzzles scattered around.\n\nEvery NPC model has their own ability (though most are fluff and only needed for achievements) and you have to find the character(s) that can do things to accomplish the tasks. The puzzles aren't too hard and they offer an in-game hint system to help you out when you're stuck. It's hard for me to describe but puzzles didn't really give as much of a 'eureka!' moment where things click together (like Portal or Antichamber) but felt more like solving Scribblenauts puzzles. The challenge isn't necessarily finding a solution that works but rather finding all the solutions that work. The majority of puzzles can be solved by bringing the right NPC to the right location and using their ability, there aren't many combination/multi-step puzzles.\n\nThe way I approached each area was to explore the area, get familiar with NPCs and their abilities/locations, then go back and solve the puzzles. The world is small and detailled enough that I didn't get too lost or bored wandering around. The biggest road block for me was needing to look upwards (for birds' nests, elevated platforms, etc.) but the hint system helped me know where to look when I didn't.\n\nI would've liked a run key so that I could travel to places/puzzle areas faster.\n\nSometimes they move the necessary NPCs closer to the puzzle area (which is fine) but it was annoying when I went to their original place (where I thought they would be) and couldn't find them. This is partly why I wanted a faster travel option (I'd go all the way to the opposite end of a level to find a particular unique character only to have to travel all the way back).\n\nIt's worth a look if you like simple puzzles where you have basic tools and then you pick the right tool for the job.","December 27, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely recommended for puzzle or adventure gamers, and a possible sale buy for other people who are neutral to those genres.\n\nPros:\nQuirkiness: So many unique characters, many with their own special ability, some of which can be used to accomplish objectives/goals or hijinx.\n\nStory/narrative: Main story and side stories are well crafted and engaging for me, building a weird world full of stacking dolls.\n\nIn game guides/tips/hints: This game can be an open ended challenge, or it can be really simple using the game's copious notes, hints, and in-game guide to find where objectives are.  I personally haven't had to use them yet, but I may do it if I wish to 100% the game.\n\nArt & music: They're all perfect for the setting and premise of the game.\n\nAchievements: Not merely Steam achievements, but in-game achievements are rampant with at least dozens per area/level.  Also, each one can be returned to at any time after the main goals for that area are completed.\n\nCons:\nCharacter simplicity: They cannot jump, run, or have items unless related to their special ability or a special event.  Given the amount of in-game help provided, the devs could've made such mechanics work without degrading gameplay, but it may have taken much longer for the game to be released.\n\nPotential gameplay length: Being 3 hours into the game, I've completed more than a third of one of the available two adventures.  So best case scenario, I get over a dozen more hours out of it.  Also, I'm not sure that I'd have the desire to play a sequel or game like this again unless they address my issue with character simplicity.","January 9","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those are the wooden dolls that split in half and reveal a slightly smaller doll inside, which splits open to reveal yet another doll.  You are the smallest one, so you can jump inside the bigger dolls and control them.  Each one has different abilities.  There is one who plays music that attracts rats.

You have to use the dolls' various abilities to open new areas and progress through the game.

To do so you can take control of other russian stacking dolls who all have their own unique abilities, like making shocking alarm noises or pumping out water.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is very late 19th/ early 20th century with a lot of coal/steam power, victorian era fashion and a lot of the story being focused on child labour.\n\nThe controls are nice and solid and it really doesn't take long to master, however you can find that unstacking yourself will get you stuck a few times if you're not careful about where you do it. This wouldn't be an issue if there was someway to rectify mistakes, but if you find yourself stuck you will have to quit to the main manu and reload your save from there.\n\nThe game is only a few hours long if you play solely through the main story without going for 100% completion, but there are plenty of other things to aim for. You can try to collect all the unique dolls in the game, try and complete all of the doll stack series' as well as trying to find all solutions to each puzzle and completing optional challenges in each area.\n\nThere is also an extra adventure but it's basically the length of a single level, not that that's a bad thing as it prevents it from outstaying it's welcome.\n\nOverall the game is well worth playing and considering that it's only going to kill a couple of hours if you blast straight through it won't require too much effort.\n\n8/10","December 19, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles aren't too hard and they offer an in-game hint system to help you out when you're stuck. It's hard for me to describe but puzzles didn't really give as much of a 'eureka!' moment where things click together (like Portal or Antichamber) but felt more like solving Scribblenauts puzzles. The challenge isn't necessarily finding a solution that works but rather finding all the solutions that work. The majority of puzzles can be solved by bringing the right NPC to the right location and using their ability, there aren't many combination/multi-step puzzles.\n\nThe way I approached each area was to explore the area, get familiar with NPCs and their abilities/locations, then go back and solve the puzzles. The world is small and detailled enough that I didn't get too lost or bored wandering around. The biggest road block for me was needing to look upwards (for birds' nests, elevated platforms, etc.) but the hint system helped me know where to look when I didn't.\n\nI would've liked a run key so that I could travel to places/puzzle areas faster.\n\nSometimes they move the necessary NPCs closer to the puzzle area (which is fine) but it was annoying when I went to their original place (where I thought they would be) and couldn't find them. This is partly why I wanted a faster travel option (I'd go all the way to the opposite end of a level to find a particular unique character only to have to travel all the way back).\n\nIt's worth a look if you like simple puzzles where you have basic tools and then you pick the right tool for the job.","December 27, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely recommended for puzzle or adventure gamers, and a possible sale buy for other people who are neutral to those genres.\n\nPros:\nQuirkiness: So many unique characters, many with their own special ability, some of which can be used to accomplish objectives/goals or hijinx.\n\nStory/narrative: Main story and side stories are well crafted and engaging for me, building a weird world full of stacking dolls.\n\nIn game guides/tips/hints: This game can be an open ended challenge, or it can be really simple using the game's copious notes, hints, and in-game guide to find where objectives are.  I personally haven't had to use them yet, but I may do it if I wish to 100% the game.\n\nArt & music: They're all perfect for the setting and premise of the game.\n\nAchievements: Not merely Steam achievements, but in-game achievements are rampant with at least dozens per area/level.  Also, each one can be returned to at any time after the main goals for that area are completed.\n\nCons:\nCharacter simplicity: They cannot jump, run, or have items unless related to their special ability or a special event.  Given the amount of in-game help provided, the devs could've made such mechanics work without degrading gameplay, but it may have taken much longer for the game to be released.\n\nPotential gameplay length: Being 3 hours into the game, I've completed more than a third of one of the available two adventures.  So best case scenario, I get over a dozen more hours out of it.  Also, I'm not sure that I'd have the desire to play a sequel or game like this again unless they address my issue with character simplicity.","January 9","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically a puzzle game with matryoshka dolls, you use your ability as tiny Charlie to borrow the abilities of larger dolls around you; it's a simple but fun mechanic that gives the game its unique edge.  The art design and music are wonderful as well, with cross between Victoriana and an old-fashioned silent melodrama.  The puzzles aren't brainbusters, but they do work your problem solving skills and some have multiple and usually amusing solutions.\n\nThe two main criticisms are what appear to be standard ones for this game.  First, Charlie moves very slowly, and in areas where you backtrack, this can be a pain.  Second, this game has pretty much no replay value once you finish everything in it.  Unless you want to go back again and play it for the atmosphere and humor, there's not much more to it.  The DLC is also very short, but if you can pick it up on the cheap, it's worth a look.\n\nIt's a cute game, and I would recommend it, especially for kids and child-like adults, but be aware when it's done, it's pretty much done.","March 20","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the most fun I've ever had in a video game, but it's that casual "I need a good way to kill an hour or two" kind of fun.\n\nYou play a tiny guy in a world full of people who are nesting dolls.  Those are the wooden dolls that split in half and reveal a slightly smaller doll inside, which splits open to reveal yet another doll.  You are the smallest one, so you can jump inside the bigger dolls and control them.  Each one has different abilities.  There is one who plays music that attracts rats.  There is another who turns a target plaid.  There is one who will put a hat on another doll for you.  There are even special "limited collector edition" dolls you can find.  You have to use the dolls' various abilities to open new areas and progress through the game.  The whole point is to rescue your family from an evil industrialist who is stealing children for his slave labor workforce.  Along the way, there are additional challenges you can complete, mostly for bragging rights.\n\nIt's fun, but treat it as a casual adventure or you will be disappointed.","March 15","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To do so you can take control of other russian stacking dolls who all have their own unique abilities, like making shocking alarm noises or pumping out water.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is very late 19th/ early 20th century with a lot of coal/steam power, victorian era fashion and a lot of the story being focused on child labour.\n\nThe controls are nice and solid and it really doesn't take long to master, however you can find that unstacking yourself will get you stuck a few times if you're not careful about where you do it. This wouldn't be an issue if there was someway to rectify mistakes, but if you find yourself stuck you will have to quit to the main manu and reload your save from there.\n\nThe game is only a few hours long if you play solely through the main story without going for 100% completion, but there are plenty of other things to aim for. You can try to collect all the unique dolls in the game, try and complete all of the doll stack series' as well as trying to find all solutions to each puzzle and completing optional challenges in each area.\n\nThere is also an extra adventure but it's basically the length of a single level, not that that's a bad thing as it prevents it from outstaying it's welcome.\n\nOverall the game is well worth playing and considering that it's only going to kill a couple of hours if you blast straight through it won't require too much effort.\n\n8/10","December 19, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are really well connected and engaging, not to mention the fun abilities of the characters.\nDon't mind the negative reviews, really. People who don't appreciate good puzzles won't like it at all.\nListen from someone that has beaten 100% (including the Hobo Lost King Adventure) of the game.\n\nREALLY RECOMMEND IT. :)","April 7","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
