I don't care if it's due to shoddy workmanship, creative bankruptcy or whatever.  The game sucks.\n\nPop quiz: How many shots does it take to kill an annoying flappy thing?\n\nNo, it's not one.  What do you think this is, a good game?\n\nThe correct answer is four.  Yeah, that's quite a lot.  The little ♥♥♥♥er's headin' right for ya, possibly while there's another obstacle you gotta dodge, and it takes four hits to kill it.  All things considered you're better off just running past without firing at all.\n\nYep.  In a game called Blaster Shooter GunGuy, blasting and shooting with your gun is completely pointless.  Talk about a non-indicative title.","August 11, 2015","false","3.2"," 180 of 272 people (66%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","66","180","272","35","49"

No background or imagery. And no music, which actually feels like somewhat of a relief as you will see.\n\n- The music sounds like overused stock loops from 2006 (♥♥♥♥ING KEVIN MACLEOD MUSIC!! SERIOUSLY!?!?), and the graphics look like they were made in 5 minutes, meaning they also look stock. EDIT: recently, with the rebalance of level 1-4, i was able to make it to the first boss, which uses the exact same music the regular stages for that zone had. This is just terrible.\n\n- The controls feel broken and confusing with the sprinting acting like a dash ability. The worst part about said sprint / dash is that to be able to use it you have to be moving already, which, when compared to how sprinting / dashing works normally in games, is just plain wrong. EDIT: The recent update with controler support did not fix tis issue, however it did make it mildly more tolerable.\n\n- I have not played much of the game but i can say with certainty that the frogs need to be balanced as they are able to jump to my position in one leap even if i just entered it's (very large) line of sight.\nEDIT: the pirate ship fight also needs to be balanced, with the boss spawning pirates too often, meaining i end up with a party of about 6/8 pirates chasing me at one time.\n\n- Thats another thing that feels stock and childish. The enemies, the first three you encounter being a frog a bird and a scorpion. ( i THINK its a scorpion at least)\n\n- As previously mentioned, onscreen instructions for when you die or beat a level flash on and off the screen making them hard to read.\n\nOverall this game does not even feel like it was worth the 65p i spent on it.\n\n2 / 10","August 12, 2015","false","4.2"," 72 of 102 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","72","102","2","2"

The buttons you have to press are are randomly placed along the keyboard and mouse. Running makes you way faster than it should. Besides that, the first level should be a tutorial, not a full demo of what you've just put youself into.\n\nIt is pretty, and could be a good game, but the responsiveness of the controls makes it way harder than it should.\n\nBy the way, the developer should change the death font and make the blinking slower (why does it blink, anyway?), as it is really hard to read sometimes.

This is not a bad thing by any means, it just means that if you didn't like that game at all, you probably will not enjoy this one either.The controls are tight enough, the sound design is competently executed, especially in the later stages, where it goes from good to great. I love the space theme music.\n\nThe bosses were a nice touch, which I really apreciated, except for the dinosaur one, who was more annoying that difficult, because there was nowhere to stand to not get hit by the claw except for the springs, which open you up for the laser attack.\n\nThe whole game has this 90s' feel, but not just because of the graphics or sounds, it's the gameplay itself, the backgrounds and the premise of the game that, while not new , kept me coming back to see its conclusion. Now that I have finished it, however, I doubt I will come back to replay it, or to try to get the trophies or the gems.\n\nI do have minor complaints:\nFirst of all, there are multiple characters, which is good, but they're not just reskins of GunGuy, they actually play different, in the sense that some shoot faster, some deal more damage and so on. I would like to see some sort of description for the characters, in which they're abilities are described or at least hinted at, something like "Gunguy has a knack for finding chicken in unlikely places" or something like that for every character.\nSecondly, can you please make the dissapearing platforms flicker or something before they dissapear, because it's really frustrating to jump at a platform when I start the level, only to find it vanishing below my feet.\n\nAll in all, I recomend this game to anyone who has an itch for old-school "difficult", especially FUN action platformer.","February 2","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are fun and challenging, as well as rewarding when you finally figure out the algorithm, nothing is random here so learning how to manipulate how you approach each section untill you progress past it becomes muscle memory which I love.\n\nI will be updating this as I get further in but I wanted to get a positive review up here asap because it seems this game is getting some un-needed flak from people who maybe bought a game they didnt fully expect what it entailed.\n\nThis aint no easy ride folks play it a couple hours at a time and come back later to progress.\n\n**AS A DISCLAIMER, I HIGHLY recommend playing this game with a controller, I really dont see it being easy to play otherwise, keyboard is too clunky. I tried to bind the keys using the games feature but it doesnt detect my gamepads analog sticks (may cater to xbox controllers) so I used the simple and small program joy2key to bind my keys to my controller manually, this imrpoved my gameplay experience 2x easily, making it feel like I was actually in full controll of my character","August 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

I guess I just like to persevere through things and feel a higher sense of accomplishment upon completing the challenge.

I wrote some suggestions for the dev a month and a half ago since he appears to be active in the community discussions, but he has not addressed them despite responding to the posts above and below mine.\n\nWhat's sad is there is quite a bit of content here that most people will never see because the game is unfair with regard to taking damage. There is no delay between taking multiple hits, so falling in spikes will literally kill your three hearts in about 1 second. The lack of proper controller support is also a complete turn-off. You shouldn't need a third-party tool when the Unity engine supports controllers already.\n\nIf you're really stubborn, you can get through this game. But it's not an enjoyable experience in its current state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/391740/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","Will admit: Came into this with a negative mindset. Any time a game says that they're inspired by IWBTG, that's usually a giant red flag. Still, had the trading card money, figured it'd be funny bad, at least.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nYou play as GunGuy, who's apparently looking for his dad or something, but this is never brought up in game. You go through 7 worlds to accomplish this task. You can do three things: Jump, shoot, and dash. The dash propels you forward at high speeds, and is needed to make difficult jumps. It's also one of the least controllable dashes I've ever used. This ain't a Mega Man X dash, let me tell you.\n\nYou dash so quickly and it's difficult to have precise control over it, meaning you'll overshoot your jumps and end up falling onto spikes, enemies, or pits. Not that jumping normally is that much better:  You can't control the height of your jump, so you'll hit your head on ceilings and other obstacles nonstop. Momentum is really floaty and strange.\n\nShooting works fine: Follows Mega Man rules, even looks like the Mega Buster shot. However, you'll soon learn that you don't want to fight anything if you can help it. Enemies are extremely durable and numerous. It's usually better just to avoid them, unless they're one of the many small, fast flying enemies that chase you, or they are directly in your way.\n\nUnusual for this kind of game, you have a health bar: You can survive three hits before you have to restart the stage. There's no checkpoints or anything, and some of the later levels get quite long. The only way to restore health in stages is to collect chicken from fallen enemies...complete with a pretty annoying sound clip every time you pick some up. However, chicken stops spawning in the later stages, meaning you have no way to recover health at all.\n\nThe level design feels very lazy at points: Time and time again, I found myself going through obstacles that have been used several times before, in the exact same positioning that they were in before. Just a good ol' copy-paste from one level to the next. Again, this becomes more apparent the further on you get in the game.\n\nIn each of the stages, there are gems you can collect. These provide you with money, which unlocks more characters. The new characters don't have any unique abilities, they just provide a slightly different sprite. There are also bonus stages you can play to unlock more characters, if that's your fancy.\n\nLazy level design is one thing, but the bosses are some of the absolute worst I've ever fought. They fluctuate between being pathetically easy, to them being nearly impossible, and requiring good RNG to win. See that orange guy in the screenshots? What's not shown is how fast that thing attacks, how large the hitboxes are, and how unwieldy the springs are. Other bosses have attacks that can track you across the entire screen, and it's all due to RNG working against you.\n\nIt's one thing to have a boss that's hard. It's another to have a boss where I win purely out of luck. Outside of that, the game isn't that hard, the only parts I had any trouble was against said RNG bosses and some bad level design parts, like putting a column of invisible block platforms right under one another, and making it a extreme pain to jump around them if you don't jump in advance.\n\nThe real draw to games like these is frustrating, but good level and boss design, and this game lacks both of those qualities. Certainly doesn't look or sound good, either.\n\nTo top it all off, there's no ending. When you beat the final boss, you just have to manually quit the game. Maybe there's an ending for clearing it 100%, but...no.\n\nDo not recommend.","January 24","false","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

As a masochist of gaming, I was looking forward to this, but I find this game to be too easy. For a game to be compared to IWBTG, I was expecting the worst, but this is actually pretty underwhelming. Maybe it'll get harder, I've only beaten the first two worlds (In about 20 minutes) so far, but from what I've played it's not too impressive. The gameplay is solid, but everything else kinda falls flat. The graphics are flat, the music is just one very short loop throughout the whole world, and the bosses are kinda lame. The second boss almost literally didn't do anything to me. Only once he dropped 3 giant apples at me, but I was able to avoid them without even moving. The levels can be pretty short and I found myself just dashing through most of them. There aren't any real obstacles or challenges, just a few spikes and enemies here and there with the occasional cannons. Again for a game to be compared to IWBTG I was expecting very tight jumps, hazards everywhere, very quick deaths, etc. My main issue though is the controls. SPACE jumps, SHIFT dashes, WASD moves, and LEFT CLICK shoots. It may not sound too bad but it's murder on your fingers especially for a game like this. Would have been so much better if the arrow keys moved, Z jumps, X shoots, and SHIFT dashes. Or at the very least an option to remap the controls would have been super nice! Also, this doesn't affect my review in any way, but some achievements would be great for a game that claims to be super hard because it gives you something to show off your hard work for. This game isn't BAD. For .98 it's pretty great fun, but it does need a lot of polishing up. As of right now I can't recommend it though.","August 14, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"
