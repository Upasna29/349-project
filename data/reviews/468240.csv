I mean, it could be an issue with motion sickness for some people, but it's a cool idea.\n\nThis is pre-alpha though. Don't expect anything else. But I can see it could form into something pretty cool! It needs lots of work first though.\n\nObservations:\n-Boats have no momentum and will turn on the spot. Makes tacking weird, where you don't need to gather speed before making a tack, nor does carrying speed seem to help.\n-No way of knowing the direction of the wind, no gusts (dark patches on water, arrows over water, etc)\n-I rammed someone while on Port and didn't need to do a 360/720 (BONUS!), this is a feature.\n-The guy I rammed proceeded to push my boat underwater with his epic downwind power, like an asshat.\n-No mainsheet/jibsheet, but fair enough for simplicities sake.\n-Switch of hands with tiller doesnt work.\n-Downwind/running is like 5 times faster than upwind, should be 0.2 to 2 depending on how much of a bathtub you're sailing.\n-Reaching is slower than running.\n-Hmm, actually, change the last 2 points for no apparent wind mechanic.\n\nRegardless, I appreciate the free content, and wish you well on your development!","June 4","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The premise is simple. You sail a dingy. You can race or sail in a relaxing manner. The mechanics work well if not overly realistic (water is rarely that smooth). However the simplisic graphics (and whales floating above the water) let the game down. Much better visuals would do a lot for the game (especially in relaxing mode).\n\nIf the game remains "as is" then it's great proof of concept idea. VR sailing could work well with the right styles and enviroments. If however the devs keep working on the game then you've set up some intersting foundations for what could be a very interesting VR game .\n\n","May 31","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is quite relaxing.\n\nI can\'t tell if this game makes me sea sick or vr sick.  Something about the way you are gliding over the water unsettles me.  If there were actual waves causing an up and down motion I would surely vomit within the first 2 minutes.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy sailing because the maneuvering seems logical, I don\'t know if it is accurate because I\'ve never been in an actual sail boat, and there is definitely a strategy to this game though I have struggled to figure it out.","June 1","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not unpleasant. It just feels like it was thrown together in an afternoon and there's really not much at all to it. It has flying whales though, so if you're into flying whales, it's a must have.","June 3","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
