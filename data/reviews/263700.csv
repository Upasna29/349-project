I know this is enough for a lot of people to dismiss this entirely. And I don't blame them, titlescreen, menues and everything look very "tablet".\n\nHowever, Muffin Knight also adds a few tweaks to Vlambeers masterpiece that make this "clone" more playable in my opinion. The most important feature is a hitpoint-system (permanent extra hits cost upgrade-points, you can take up to three hits). Allowing for some mistakes to be made compared to the insta-death-terror of SBC. Also, you have a greater variety in your movement (double jumps) as well as more varied level-layouts here (multiscreens, with teleporters and such) and towards the end of the game they even start mixing up the base gameplay (help Santa deliver gifts, reach the top of a giant beanstalk, fight a giant bossmonster) which I found quite entertaining.\n\nThe level-up system (allows you to upgrade the various characters and buy perks) and grinding for XP is more miss than hit and the most obvious reminder of a dark IAP tablet-past. But there are XP-bonus built in for doing well on the tougher levels, so overall balancing seems to work out. However, the game is so solid - all that leveling business feels unnecessary.\n\nAnyway, it's quite an addictive little game. As every stage has it's own unique kind of rhythm (along with quite nicely done graphic sets) and once you get into the flow of things it really is plain fun. You know, that classic arcade-ish fun. Talking about arcades, I actually think this wouldn't feel too out of place in a 90ies arcade along-side games like Snow Bros. or Bubble Bobble.\n\nTechnically, as mentioned before, the menues and stuff are pretty meh! and have that mobile-look to them (you know, big, colorful buttons and "funny" fonts) - but the actual gameplay looks really nice. Big, cartoony characters, decently animated and good looking backdrops - good sense of color too (with the exception of the Windmill-stage, dat cyan!). Music is a mixed bag, there are some really amazing tunes (love the graveyard!) and also some very annoying tracks (too short, loop too soon, are annoying as hell in the process). Sound-effects are good, but the granny voice-over sounds REALLY amateurish and cheap. Also, I found that in some places hitdetection is kinda iffy and analog-controls on my 360 pad didn't work properly - had to go digital. However, once I changed the controls it was pretty good and feels really precise.\n\nOverall a really nicely done timewaster. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but has a very, very solid core that will provide a couple of hours of 90ies fun. Gotta say, a pleasant surprise.","November 30, 2014","true","6.4"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","31","39","3","0"

Sure, its your standard 2D platformer affair. Not dissimilar to a Mario Bros. Single screen kill/collect top score based fun. But this game has a lot of heart. You collect muffins. That's endearing in itself. Every time you collect one, your character switches which may seem jarring at first until you become familiar with all the attacks. Then it becomes rather strategic.\n\nOne of the more surprising aspects is every second spent in game feels like you're earning something. XP is earned for collecting muffins and killing enemies that goes into a player level which awards you with skill points which can be spent on each individual creature. New levels can be unlocked either through collecting a specific number of muffins in one run or overall player level. Perks and extra lives are also available for purchase.\n\nRespawns are super fast, controls are tight. The characters are adorable and silly (see Sumo Panda) All these features lend themselves to something familiar, easy to enter and super hard to put down.\n\nJust one more run. Then I'll stop.","October 25, 2014","true","8.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/recommended/263700/","hazardgaming","hazzaricks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/","88 products in account","Muffin Knight is a game that looks catered towards toddlers, but is a perfect example of the idiom 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Despite looking very innocent and easy, 'Muffin Knight' is a surprisingly challenging game - especially if you're attempting to 5-star it.\n\nWith a fantastic single-player and multiplayer co-op, Muffin Knight is a fast-paced game full of enjoyment, challenge and charm. Whilst the plot is simple and the graphics are subpar, Muffin Knight excels in its gameplay and can become dangerously addicting. The music is catchy, the controls are fantastically responsive and the added perks and upgrades really add to the game and genuinely make a difference, saving a very repetitive formula from going stale.\n\nMy only complaints would be its lack of more settings, there isn't a lot of availability on how to customise the settings to best suit your PC, plus the menus are pretty awful if you plan to use a controller. Whilst I would highly recommend a controller for its movement flow and simplicity, I would suggest opting for a computer mouse when roaming through the menus.\n\nThe randomisation for the characters can be frustrating, especially as some of the starters are incredibly weak until you upgrade them. Whilst upgrading doesn't take too long, to go from a strong character such as Cyclops or Grizzly, to a ridiculously weak character such as Monkey or Dragon, can really be annoying. Whilst mentioning characters, it is worthy ot note that the order of the unlockables seems very odd as well - whilst only a minor nitpick, I did feel very disappointed that the final unlockable was one of the worst.\n\nOverall, Muffin Knight is an incredibly fun and simplistic game to play. The added perks really help the game to feel different every time, and the challenge bar is at the perfect level for this type of genre. Whilst the plot is weak and some of the power-ups are far worse than others, due to the upgrades and points, you can quickly improve the weaker characters and make them some of the strongest. Muffin Knight is great fun with friends, but is also very enjoyable as a solo game - so go forth and find those muffins!\n\nRating: 4/4","December 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You'll run into enemies a lot (instant death) and every time you'll know that it's your own fault you died. As a casual platformer it's great fun.\n\nHighly recommended.","June 13, 2014","true","10.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There are so many games out there, and so many other people making new ones, that your brilliant idea has probably already been built and released.\n\nEqually, the huge swathe of clones and copycats that bloat the App Store make it even more refreshing when something does come along that's that little bit different. Muffin Knight, from Angry Mob Games, is one such breath of fresh air.\n\nAs original as it is in the context of the App Store, however, it's important to note that Muffin Knight borrows heavily from Vlambeer's excellent Super Crate Box, which is also coming to iOS this month.\n\nKnights currant\n\nYou play a young boy who accidentally scatters a basket of magic muffins to the four corners of a cartoon-style fairytale world. Incensed by your actions, the fairy whose muffins they were turns you into a knight and sends you off on a quest to retrieve the arcane cakes.\n\nThis takes the form of jumping around enclosed levels, killing scuttling pigs and other beasts and grabbing the deliciously enhanced buns. The twist is that every time you pick up a muffin you change class. You'll start as the eponymous Knight, but for the first few play throughs you'll swap between a mage, an archer, and a goblin as well.\n\nThe characters all have different strengths and weaknesses, and as you play through the game you'll unlock new classes as well.\n\nWhile the original four are all quite similar ranged fighters, later in the game you'll have rainbow mine-pooping unicorns, fire-breathing dragons, and claw swiping bears at your disposal too.\n\nConfectionery crisis\n\nYou unlock new classes when you've picked up enough muffins, but you also gain XP for slaying enemies and gathering the small cakes. You can spend this XP on levelling up your characters, making them quicker and their attacks more potent.\n\nOf course, you're never sure which characters you're going to be in the game, so it's entirely possible to swap straight from a super-powered Knight to a one-starred kitten ninja in one muffin-fuelled swoop.\n\nAll in all there are six levels to play through, all of which can be attacked multiple times, and 15 characters to unlock and upgrade. There's a multiplayer mode as well, which lets you connect with other iPhones over a local wi-fi network, to duke it out over who's the muffin-collecting monarch.\n\nBuns of zeal\n\nMuffin Knight looks good, sounds good, and has a great, original idea at its core, but it's not all sweetness and light. The control system isn't perfect, with taps of the on-screen buttons sometimes not registering.\n\nIt's pretty difficult as well, though even failure is rewarded with XP, meaning you'll be stronger the next time around. The lack of levels might put some off, but every play through is going to be different because your character changes are allocated entirely at random.\n\nThese problems are mere niggles, though, and shouldn't dissuade you from playing this hugely enjoyable action-platformer. This is a leaping, blasting, clawing slice of fun that deserves to find a home on as many iOS devices as possible.","March 25","true","35.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Which is really a big thing for a lot of low effort 2D platformers/shooters/whatever the indie studios churn out in shovelware by the tonne every year.\n\nThe sound and graphics really function.\n\nThe art style for a lot of the levels is thematically ripped from a strange combination of Mario and World of Warcraft.   Look, we're in Undercity! Look, we're in Zangarmarsh!\n\nGameplay is nothing new, the basic mechanic is present in literally over 1,000 Steam titles, you jump, you shoot, there's multiplayer jump and shoot.   Goombas totally inventive new enemies like sheep fall out of the sky and you have to kill them.\n\nIt's hard to give this the thumbs down, because the developers achieved what they set out to do.\n\nSo, why the thumbs down?   Firstly - there's not enough technical customisability.  We can't even force the resolution.  The game handles okay today, but next year, the year after, it's going to fail to remain playable on newer systems.   This is a handicap enforced by the multiplatform system (because you know, console gamers and tablet gamers and PC gamers have so much in common).\n\nSecondly, well, what is this game contributing to anything?  I said earlier the developers achieved what they set out to do.   They succeeded in creating a game that fills no special niches, is derivative, and will certainly fail to be remembered alongside hundreds of other 2D indy platformers released every year hoping to be Super Meat Boy.  Was it a good idea to set out to do this? No, even if they succeeded.   This isn't worth the current price of $7 USD on Steam they're asking for.   Go play Super Mario Brothers on an emulator or something if you really have to do 2D platforming.","December 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

So if that's something you wish to avoid, then here's your warning.\nTL;DR: It can be a fun experience, but that's most of it. That aside, it still remains a clone and lacks any love put into it from the developers. If you can get it for really cheap, check it out. Otherwise, stick with Super Crate Box, which is free.\n\n-----full review-----\n\nHow to describe Muffin Knight... Well, I think saying it's Super Crate Box mixed with the graphics of Ducktales Remastered might just be the most accurate thing. But for the people who have never played Super Crate Box, allow me to ellaborate. The gameplay consists of you being put into some kind of arena, in which you have to gather enough Muffins to unlock the next stage, while being cautious of enemies who are trying to ruin your progress. Muffins also unlock new weapons when you obtained a select amount of them. And that is really all there is to it. I would say it's an innovative combat system, if they didn't straight out rip it off Super Crate Box. Some of the weapons do the EXACT same effect, but just having a dual pistol being replaced with an archer. This game is more on the child-friendly tour, so it replaced all weapons and enemies with weapons or mythological creatures.\n\nThe story is very... vague. Protagonist finds a basket of Muffins and boom, he gets turned into a guy who can switch between weapons. Don't know what his goal is, but apparently he just needs to get his muffins back from some... dragonguy. NOTHING is explained in the game, except for the first part.\n\nAt first it creates the illusion of difficult. You can't touch an enemy, or you're dead. Fortunately there are upgrades for that. You really have to make decisions about what to upgrade though. At first it might look easy to level up, but it becomes more of a grindfest at later levels. That is, if we exclude the extra modes this game has.\n\nOh wait, did I say extra modes? Hahaha, aaah, how funny. Where do I begin...\n\nYou start of the game in Knight Mode. Once you have beaten all the stages and defeated the final boss, you unlock a mode. And after you have finished that one, you unlock another. And another. And another. Would this be a problem? Not really, if it wasn't the EXACT same, just with increased difficulty. Why, in the name of Last Order, do this? Let us choose our dificulty, don't force it on us.\n\nAnd those reasons above form my biggest complaint with the game: It lacks love from the developpers. Like I said, I won't show mercy and I definitely won't here. They literally ripped off Super Crate Box, gave it a more child-friendly and HD design, and to avoid having a short game, let us repeat the game over and over again a total of 5 times. It's not even funny.\n\nIf you can get this game for really cheap, go ahead. I definitely won't stop you. When I started this game, I did have a fun time. But over time, it just decreased. If you want to try out a game like this, get Super Crate Box.\n\nNote that I'm not trying to advertise Super Crate Box, but it's not only the same original game, but it's free too.","December 16, 2014","false","8.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/recommended/263700/","CrazyTerabyte","Denilson S√°","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/","919 products in account","TL;DR: Cheap mobile port. Expect nothing.\n\n- No resolution option.\n- No resizable window in windowed mode.\n- No local co-op.\n- Clone of Super Crate Box.\n- Can't see the entire level at once, making it a bit harder to see the enemies.\n- Sometimes the enemies drop from the spot without the cloud (unfairly killing you).\n- Grinding for unlocking characters and for getting points to upgrade characters.\n- No Steam cloud, no easy way to backup the save.\n- Navigating the menus with the joystick can be frustrating.\n\n~ Partial joystick support.\n\n+ Mouse works in the menus.\n+ Rebindable keys.\n+ Anti-aliased graphics if the "high" quality is selected.\n\n-- Full review below --\n\nThis is mobile port. This game is also available on Android, iOS, and even Windows Phone.\n\nThere is a Chrome App version (available for free, playable inside Chrome). If you are curious about this game, play that version before spending any money on this.\n\nWhen compared to the Chrome app version, this Steam version has online multiplayer support (good luck finding anyone else with this game). And anti-aliased graphics. That's all. Otherwise, it is the same game.\n\nTalking about "same game", this is a clone of Super Crate Box. The exact same mechanics from that game are in this game. What else do we have? Grinding for unlocking new characters! Grinding for leveling up and getting points to upgrade characters! And what do you get after you beat the first "boss"? More grinding!\n\nFor a game consisting mainly of grinding, being difficult to backup the progress is a sin. People claim that the save is stored in the Windows registry, but at least one person complained it couldn't restore the save.\n\nThe options menu is a joke. At least it has rebindable keys, but there is no option to change the resolution. Alt+Enter changes to windowed mode, but the dimensions are fixed.\n\nIn a mobile game, it makes sense to keep zoomed in and scrolling the level, because the screen is small. In the PC version, the behavior is exactly the same, unfortunately. I'd prefer to have a zoomed out view, i.e. I'd prefer to see more of the level at once.\n\nThe xmas level has two spots where the enemies can spawn. Before enemies spawn, a cloud shows up. However, in that level, many times the cloud shows at one spot but the enemies spawn at the other spot (at that moment, the cloud teleports to the other spot). Unpredictable, nullifies any strategies from the player, and ends up unfairly killing the player.\n\nFinally, I couldn't find a way to exit from the character upgrade screen, while using the joystick. I had to use the mouse or the keyboard (Esc key) to get out of it. And the digital D-Pad can't be used in the menus.","March 19, 2015","false","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The different levels that you unlock as you go along are pretty much all the same and don't really do much different with the gameplay. The only thing that changes between the levels is the enemies and the layout. The Layouts rarely make the game more interesting to play or change things up, and while the enemies change, the basic enemy types do not. There are the flying enemies, and the small and large enemies, both speedy and regular. I'd have liked to see them add different enemies types as the game progressed.\n\nAnother big problem that I had was the character types that you can play as. As far as I can tell, when you collect a muffin, you randomly change to a different character type, and the problem with that is that the game becomes less fun as it goes on as a result of this. The vast majority of the character types that you play as are terrible, so as the game goes on and you unlock more of the character types, you spend less time playing as the few good character types, and more on the terrible character types. The only character types that I enjoyed playing as are the Knight, the Archer, the Gnome, and the Mage, and the rest were mediocre to outright horrible.\n\nIt's can be a fun game to play for about 20-30 minutes, but it definetly is not something that I would pay money for again.","February 27, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But that's only because I love Super Crate Box. And this is literally Super Crate Box, just a rip off version of the game. Oh and this is the $6.99 version, SCB is free! And better!\n\nHonestly, it's easier to name the differences than the similarities.\n\nOkay where to begin. Differences:\n\nIn SCB, you start with a random weapon each round. In Muffin Knight, I always start with the knight.\n\nIn SCB, there are no popups mid game telling you you leveled up. In Muffin Knight, you have to put down your controller and click to continue.\n\nIn SCB, the controller works perfectly except for a small glitch when going to the menu from your controller. In Muffin Knight, for some reason even though I rebinded my controller, the up on the d pad goes down in game. And there is no button to click to continue when there is a popup on the screen, which is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off a lot. You have to literally set your controller down and click. What if you are sitting on a couch?\n\nIn SCB, when you shoot the grenade launcher into the fire, it falls from the top of the screen. In Muffin Knight, the fire is a stopping point. At least when I tried it.\n\nIn SCB, there is recoil. No recoil in Muffin Knight. You just shoot.\n\nAnd the most obvious, the artwork is different. I like it though! That is a strong part about the game.\n\nSimilarities:\n\nYou literally get a random weapon when you pick up a muffin. The Archer is clearly the dual pistols from SCB. Since when does an Archer ever have 2 bows? I've never seen a dual bow archer ever. Then this game introduces it like it's new, clearly a copy of the dual pistol from SCB. Honestly, most of the weapons are the same from SCB.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of monsters, small, big, and ghosts. They even come out in the same pattern as Super Crate Box! 3 small ones will come out all at once! Or a single monster of any type. This is the exact same pattern from SCB!\n\nKills aren'r score, Muffins/Crates are.\n\nThe Forest map is literally Construction from Super Crate Box. Literally the exact same thing. Not one difference. They literally just reskinned it.\n\nGameplay is exactly the same. Everything about it. Random weapons from each pickup, monsters spawn at the top and follow a path to the bottom hitting walls and turning, when they hit fire they spawn faster.\n\nThis is literally a weaker version of Super Crate Box. I like the art work of this game, it's beautiful. But sometimes it's hard to tell where the edge of a platform is. I found an area where it looks like I'm jumping through the floor. It's in the Forest level, there is the second platform from the top, on the left side. I tried it on the right side but it wasn't as bad. But on the left side of Forest, it looks like you're jumping/falling through the floor. I literally don't know where the edge is, and I don't know why it's worse on the left side, it might be the artwork or something, but the right side feels more solid. That might be a visual thing, they might be the same exactly. I didn't try as much on the right side.\n\nThings I like:\n\nKilling monsters actually helps you because they give XP. In SCB, killing monsters does nothing other than stop them from going into the fire and going faster.\n\nProblems:\n\nThe controller problems really need to be fixed. The controller only navigates in the settings, not the start menu. And the vertical navigation is inverted even though I rebinded. Pushing up does down, and pushing down goes up. But in game, the controls are perfect.\n\nYou can hear the spot where the music loops and wow that is annoying. The music is awesome, but hearing the spot where it loops is annoying for some reason. The Forest level specifically. Or it might have been the first level. But one of the first 2 levels, you can hear where the music loops.\n\nNo recoil. Is there a mode where there is recoil? In SCB, the machine gun has some recoil. In Muffin Knight, the mage (fully automatic shots) has no recoil.\n\nAnyways, I like the game, but it is just a bad version of Super Crate Box. And it costs $6.99 while Super Crate Box is free. If some of the problems I listed are fixed, then I will change my review because I love Super Crate Box and I want to love this game.","March 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It is pretty much a game for toddlers. The gamepad controls suck ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. They are very loose so you fly all over the place without restraint. The game sucks too. You have an attack which doesn't mean much since the enemies are neverending and all you really do is run around and collect muffins. Just kill an enemy if he is near your muffin and repeat until the God awful loose controls cause you to hit a enemy and die or the toddler music causes your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ears to explode. And what is the point of having a bunch of different character classes when the point is to collect muffins in a level which is about every 1-2 seconds and each time you touch a muffin you change classes randomly? So basically you get to play a class for about 1-2 seconds at a time. The sound is for a 6yr old kid and the music is gnomes whistling and sounds like something you would hear on a early morning cartoon for a toddler.\n\nAnd the controls suck did I mention that? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing muffins, lol.

It's a fun concept, and it works great on mobile devices, but this port just doesn't work on a computer. It's just way too simple for a computer, and gravity feels way stronger than in most platformers, which doesn't matter much on a tiny screen but on a computer screen it just feels wrong, especially if you play other platformers with better physics. The layout of the game is exactly like the mobile version, with a level select screen that feels a lot like Angry Birds, or really any other smartphone game. Also, your character changes every time you collect a muffin, which makes it a very fast paced game and it's very hard to have any kind of technique because you never know which character you'll be playing with next. Overall, it's a decent port of a mobile game that just doesn't work on a computer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/recommended/263700/","TheDeluxeTux","TheDeluxeTux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/","305 products in account","Muffin Knight is a cute and simple throwback to older arcade-style games, where the goal is to dodge enemies and rack up points by collecting muffins.  Each time a muffin is collected, your character will lose his current attack ability and randomly select another from a decently long list of possibilities.  Scoring high earns points which can be used to upgrade the effectiveness of each job class.\n\nI found Muffin Knight pretty fun for a little while, but ultimately I cannot recommend the game.  At first, new classes and upgrades and levels come very quickly, but after a short while, it becomes a slog - each upgrade might cost three points, and you have to play the same level a dozen times just to earn one.  It seems as though the game was designed to be more addictive than fun or balanced - something that is not helped by the game's appearance, which looks and feels very much like it was a hastily done mobile port.\n\nThe nail in the coffin for my enjoyment of the game, though, are the cheap deaths incurred from a broken enemy indication system.  Enemies drop onto the board from the sky.  Usually, there's a few frames of smoke as in indicator that enemies will soon be appearing.  However, that indicator seems really buggy - sometimes it appears in the wrong place, and sometimes it doesn't appear at all.  You'll grow used to enemies popping out of thin air directly on to you quite a bit.\n\nYou might enjoy this title a bit, but unfortunately its an experience that wears thin after a while.","April 18, 2015","false","23.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's great fun to unlock new maps and characters, level up your favourites and chase down 5-star ratings on every level.\n\nThe achievements do work, no matter what you read elsewhere. The figures you see next to some of them are percentages which is why so many people are confused. E.g. it SEEMS to say you need to kill 100 creatures using a particular character, but when it shows 5/100 after you've killed about 30 or 40 creatures it really means you've only got 5% of the required number.\n\nThere are also a few glitches which have never been addressed. I've mentioned them all on the discussion forums, but for example you can't join a co-op game unless the host has unlocked the Forest level. You can't play the Santa level in versus because the first person to die with a present in tow leaves the opponent stranded. And so on.\n\nAnyway, this game is highly recommended - if you don't believe me, look at my hours played!","June 7, 2014","true","109.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it says full controller support, the interface does not have gamepads in mind. I certainly have found myself stuck in parts of the menus where I had little choice but to use the mouse. Some things are difficult to do with the gamepad and button instructions are all written for other platforms. I can't really recommend it at the listed price because of the partial controller support, simplistic gameplay and lack of a local co-op mode. The Android version is both better and cheaper.

However on PC I'm shocked with the number of bugs. The panda's invincibility during an attack can fail, the head jumping perk can fail, the knight will use his charge attack randomly if you're just attacking quickly, the damage applied to enemies can be random as hell (for example a close range lvl 3 shotgun blast at point blank range will sometimes not kill a small enemy).\n\nWithout the bugs, this game has a few annoyances that can be overlooked. Some of the unlocks are just plain terrible, but you at least grab another muffin as quickly as possible and avoid that character. But with the extremely frequent glitches, this game is painful on PC. I bought this as I thought it would be way better to play with a controller....but now it's just a painful grind fest to get a decent number of achievements.

However on PC I'm shocked with the number of bugs. The panda's invincibility during an attack can fail, the head jumping perk can fail, the knight will use his charge attack randomly if you're just attacking quickly, the damage applied to enemies can be random as hell (for example a close range lvl 3 shotgun blast at point blank range will sometimes not kill a small enemy).\n\nWithout the bugs, this game has a few annoyances that can be overlooked. Some of the unlocks are just plain terrible, but you at least grab another muffin as quickly as possible and avoid that character. But with the extremely frequent glitches, this game is painful on PC. I bought this as I thought it would be way better to play with a controller....but now it's just a painful grind fest to get a decent number of achievements. Speaking of which....I had 97/100 kills with the monkey for that achievement, and I got about 40 kills with the monkey and it's still not unlocked. Ugh.","April 7","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's great fun to unlock new maps and characters, level up your favourites and chase down 5-star ratings on every level.\n\nThe achievements do work, no matter what you read elsewhere. The figures you see next to some of them are percentages which is why so many people are confused. E.g. it SEEMS to say you need to kill 100 creatures using a particular character, but when it shows 5/100 after you've killed about 30 or 40 creatures it really means you've only got 5% of the required number.\n\nThere are also a few glitches which have never been addressed. I've mentioned them all on the discussion forums, but for example you can't join a co-op game unless the host has unlocked the Forest level. You can't play the Santa level in versus because the first person to die with a present in tow leaves the opponent stranded. And so on.\n\nAnyway, this game is highly recommended - if you don't believe me, look at my hours played!","June 7, 2014","true","109.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No window size adjustment, no resolution slider, no volume slider aside from desktop volume mixer. Gameplay is the same. When in full screen, there is framerate issues that make your character lag. This problem is removed in windowed mode that can only be activated via ALT + ENTER. This is NOT okay.","June 18, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
