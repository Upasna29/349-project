It runs seemingly fine (in DOSBox), at least I didn't encounter any issues in the couple of hours I played so far, so if you want to relive (or continue) old adventures in conquering medieval England and Wales, go ahead.\n\nFor those new to the title a brief overview - you start off with one county under your control and a couple of hundred peasants, a few sacks of grain and some cows, and from that you need to build an economy to arm and support the armies you will need to go out conquering. It is recommended to turn the economy down to easy because normal is fairly authentic in that a couple of bad seasons for weather (or plague breaking out) can seriously set you back, so you probably  need the leeway while learning the mechanics.\n\nSeason by season you will need to assign your peasants to different jobs - tending flocks of sheep, looking after and milking cows, sowing and harvesting grain, tending fields, mining iron ore, cutting down lumber, building castles, smithing weapons and armour, and cutting stone. The agricultural jobs shift from season to season, so for example you need more farmers when sowing or harvesting the grain than the rest of the year.\n\nThe other jobs also have a foible - peasants assigned build up experience and become more effective the longer they do the same job, so you often have to weigh up carefully whether it is worth losing experience miners to sow/harvest more crops this year, etc. You also have to decide on the agricultural front how much to develop each of the 3 crops/livestocks using the limited amount of fields - grain is the most productive for food, but is more weather dependant (risky) and causes a big flux in the number of workers you have spare depending on the season. Cattle gives a constant food source (via dairy), as well as the ability to eat them in an emergency, or once your fields are crowded. Sheep can similarly be eaten in the same situations, but instead of the food from dairy you instead get wool to sell to traders when they come by.\n\nOnce you have your economy up and running you can start making or buying armour and weapons to create an army to conquer your neighbours - initially they will be neutral counties with usually all peasant armies, but there are also the five competing lords who tend to have more formidable armies. If your armies meet, or you try to conquer a county (attacking the county town or a castle as appropriate) you go into a pausable real time battle segment where you can manuevre and engage the enemy troops (or autocalc if you prefer).\n\nEssentially you can see this game as a very, very early Total War type game - turned based meta game on the world map to build up your economy and forces, leading to tactical battles in real time. Now the interest here is opposite to TW - the main map is fairly interesting (if you are into this sort of thing), with lots of tough decisions to weigh up of when and what to build/work on, whereas the battles are fairly finicky and hard to usefully control your troops to do anything than a massive scrum and whoever has the most/best equipped units tends to win (although there are some rock/paper/scissors benefits to certain troop types over each other).\n\nStill this is an old game - so don't expect much help or hand holding while you learn the game - it is from the era where you were expected to read through the manual first, rather than easing you into a game learning concepts one by one via tutorials or easy intros. The hardest part of most LotR games is the first few years while you build up your initial counties economy, and one early mistake can set you back years, especially on normal economic difficulty.\n\nEven if this isn't you thing, if it is close consider LotR 2 - which simplifies the economy slightly (no experience for non-agricultural workers, no sheep), which has its pros and cons, but also makes the interface and management of your burgeoning kingdom much easier, and far improves the combat system.","December 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 69 of 71 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","69","71","0","1"

I know it's obvious when you have won, but at least a message like "Congratulations, you are now the king of England of Wales" or something would've been nice.\nThe missing map is a real issue, though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/254920/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nLords of the Realm is a strategy game developed by Impressions Games and released in 1994.\nNormally I have more to say in the quick review section, but ultimate that's all there is to say about the game, the game is older, it's a classic and fond memory to some, I my perspective comes from someone who played Lords of the Realm 2 and only recently had the opportunity to play Lords 1 and 3. Read on for a more analytical review.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You there! Squire! What year is it? "The Year is 1268, sir!" Blimey, 1268. I dare say we've missed 1492 when Columbus sailed the ocean blue, Sherman. "Whatever will we do Mr. Peabody? The WABAC machine never fails, you say it all the time in your narrations!"\n*Atratzu shakes himself* Excuse me, I've been watching too many 1959 Rocky and Bullwinkle show cartoons.\n\nLords of the Realm takes place in 1268, the king has died, and now everyone is scrambling to get their buttox into the English royal throne. It's pretty much the same setting as Lords of the Realm 2.\nIt seems hardly fair to contrast Lords of the Realm to Lords of the Realm 2, because it's simply not in chronological order. But alas, I will have many comparisons between the two games. In my reviews defense, Lords of the Realm 2 is known much better then it's predecessor, so it will have value, but I still must confess and apologize for the comparison, I feel guilty making it. (But if it helps you decide for or against a purchase, it's worth it.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662121997\n\nGameplay: I would break the Gameplay down into two modes: Economic, and Armies. The Economic aspect of the game comes down to food gathering/maintaining/growing, population increase, wealth from taxes, balancing happiness, resource/field rotation control, resource gathering and weapon production.\nArmies can be summed up into "Medieval: Total War" styled control. It's the type of control where you select a whole group of units, rather then individual commands to each unit. (Is there a name for that genre of combat? If so please let me know!) at the whole combat section is fought in Real Time Strategy style.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662128552\n\nThe similarities between Lords of the Realm, and Lords of the Realm 2 is striking, I was actually able to figure out how to play, based on my experience from Lords of the Realm 2 alone. Now a word of warning, Lords of the Realm is one of those 1990's games which expect you to read the game manual that was packaged along with the game, so you know what all the buttons do. (It's crazy how tool tips make a HUGE difference in strategy games.)\nA large potion of the game is spent trying to strengthen your counties, whereupon you raise an army, and then "conquer thy neighbors". While playing Lords of the Realm I kept finding myself shouting "What!? I can do this here? Why didn't they keep that in the game for Lords of the Realm 2!?!"\nMy personal favorite feature is "Castle Customization". It blew, my, mind. Really some of these older games from the 1990's have more customization features then new releases. True, to a greater or lessor extent it's colorful wrapping paper, but I love customizing my stuff!\n\nIf You've played Lords of the Realm 2 with advanced Farming on, that's pretty much regular farming in Lords of the Realm. Thankfully the crops are rotated for you, but you still need to remember not to over farm your lards, or else your crops won't be as successful.\n\nAdditional note worthy elements I noticed while I played: Difficulty settings when you start the game. Naturally my first play through I set the game to "please don't beat me up too bad". General lower graphical quality from Lords of the Realm 2 (which is expected, I'm not knocking the game for it. It looks great for a 1994 game).\n\nAchievements: There aren't any Steam Achievements for Lords of the Realm. (Are there any for older retro games? none of the 1990 x-com games had steam achievements. It feels like someone just throws games at the steam wall. These games deserve more love then that; thank god there are dedicated communities for them. *gets off soapbox*)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662126375\n\nPrice: Lords of the Realm is priced at $1.99. Atratzu's response to price: Yep. You could probably pick up pennies on the street and be able to purchase this game. And you'll spend more then a few hours learning and refining the strategies in the game. Let alone playing through the whole campaign could take many many more hours.\n\nConclusion: My review could swing either way, I could recommend Lords of the Realm, because it's a solid game, it works, I played it, I love playing older games on my laptop which runs on potatoes. (So it's nice to have options to play games on my other devices.\nIn the end, this game will only appeal to certain types of people. Chances are if you're looking at it, you're either looking at what came before Lords of the Realm 2, or you originally played this game a long time ago and seeing if some punk is butchering it in the review section.\nI suggest this game to anyone who enjoys Strategy games, and doesn't mind playing older games with older graphics. As always, thanks for reading my review, and stay tuned for my review for Lords of the Realm 3!\n\nHere's the URL to see my review for Lords of the Realm 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for Lords of the Realm 3 - COMING SOON","April 9","true","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

Turn based strategy with both economic and military management, but not too much of either. You can just enjoy the game in such a simple way. Personally I hated LOTR2 for becoming more complicated, LOTR1 was always my prefered one of the franchise.\n\nIf they made an updated version of this with a smoother interface but didn't touch the actual game play I would hapilly pay £10 for it instead of the £1.50 I just paid for this.","December 14, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
