Think of it more like The Walking Dead series, where you pay for a season whenever it comes out. You can play any seasons you own indefinitely.\nThis game WILL take over your life. Like the slogan in the old ARG Majestic from EA: "It plays YOU" Will clarify later.\nThe game on Steam is only 25% of the actual game. It takes place in real-life, on websites created specifically for the game, and on social media.Originally posted by Santiak:It's an astounding epiphany to realize just how helpful every thought process can be; overanalysis, stray thoughts, daydreaming, incoherent thought produced by sleep-deprivation, they all have a place of import in the TBW Agents toolbox.\nBefore I start with anything, I would like to make this clear: This game will be one of the most unique experiences you will ever have, and it will take over your life (I am saying this again for emphasis). They will make calls to you, they will send you packages, etc... If they need to contact you, they will, be it social media, e-mail, phone calls, you name it.\n\nBUT, BEFORE YOU BACK UP, SAYING "EHH, THIS SEEMS SHADY", KEEP THIS IN MIND:\nYou absolutely DO NOT have to give them any info. All these things are completely optional and will not work against you if you decide to not do so. They only act to increase the immersion of the game.\n\nYou have FOUR types of Agent Levels:\nRED is the lowest level of immersion. Interactions with red level agents will take place through the mission hub and by email.\nORANGE is more intense: voicemails, references to your area of operation - an aerial view of a nearby intersection, for instance - live streams from your hometown, and even live calls to, say, a phone booth at the end of your street.\nYELLOW is the highest level of immersion conventionally available. It involves phone calls (which might come at any time of day), suspicious packages sent by mail, and real world interactions with NPCs.\nGREEN is only open to the bravest agents. If you are selected to experience the deepest level of immersion, you must submit a full medical exam and sign a personal injury waiver - just in case any harm should come to you during your mission. Green level is not for the faint of heart, but if selected, you will remember the experience for the rest of your life.\nLet me actually clarify some more on the Green Agent level. This is not one for the faint of heart. This is THE most immersion you will get out of this game. Packages in the mail, phone calls, a black van sitting outside your doorstep, really anything! Make sure you have plenty of time if you are going to do this, though. It makes you a mission-imperative agent, and the success of missions will depend on your cooperation.\nOriginally posted by Nikel:[12:03:12] <@nikel> "Isn't this somekind of illuminati witchcraft simulator?"This game covers tons of different topics. Currently, we went over these subjects:\nCryptography\nSocial engineering tactics\nHuman trafficking\nHuman experimentation\nOccult magicks\nPhoto reconstruction\nWiretapping\nGoetic demons\nAlchemy\nSummoning rituals\nStopping the END OF THE FREAKING WORLD\nHow to screw around on the IRC channel instead of actually finish the missions! :D\nWe just reached the end of Season 1, and I am super excited for Season 2!\n\nThe live events are definitely one of the best parts of this game.\nLive Missions are the thing that really make this game that much more immersive. Instead of just adding a new mission to the client, they will send either a phone call to a select few agents, or an e-mail message (usually both). It is then up to the community to do the following:\nFigure out clues that are left in the small amount of info provided\nCommunicate effectively, figuring out solutions that would otherwise be impossible to do alone\nUpdate Dispatch daily with their progress, providing them with information, pictures, or whatever they need at that time\nDo things not just in-game, but in real life! (For example, we all had to find an iron statue, and draw a sacred sigil, aiding in the fight against some crazy cultists)\nMeet up with other agents out in the field, or work together with non-player characters.\nWhat I listed here is only the tip of the iceberg here, folks. In Season 2, it is bound to get even more crazy and more immersive than ever before.\n\nSO, TO SUMMARIZE, WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?ABSOLUTELY!\n\nThis is definitely one of the most unique gaming experiences I have ever been a part of, and I am glad to have this game in my library.\n\nDo you like games that constantly break the norms, and keep you on your toes?\n\nThen this game is for you.\n\nDo you love it when games constantly keep things fresh and interesting, without too much handholding on new missions?\n\nThen this game is for you.\n\nHere are some words from our IRC group:\n\nOriginally posted by AgentFellowship:"Got into TBW late in the season and I STILL had a blast. The Steam client is sleek and makes you feel like James Bond hacking into enemy databases.

It teaches you to think outside the box, analyze details carefully, and especially do your homework and deeper research into the subject in mind. For example, for one scenario, I had like ten tabs open just to research this one point. The sense of reward and accomplishment also in completing the hard task of figuring out the answer to an investigation is just too good.\n\nAnd then, there comes the moment where you have to give out your information. Oh dear. In order to truly rise above the ranks and reach the top (so to speak,) you'll need to give out information such as your phone number, address, and to quote the game, "You may be contacted via phone calls, at all hours of the day or night, receive packages from the mail, and experience real world interactions with our assets in the field." Now, let me go ahead and say that this is not required in order to experience the game. But if you expect to fully complete the game without giving this information out, good luck with that. I know someone who's actually been basically traumatized by this experience, but that's a story for another time that I wish to keep out of this. I understand that some are much more comfortable in giving out this information, and by all means that's A-OK. But personally, that is not something I'm doing any time soon. After all, this is the very nature of a game that's permanent alternate-reality.\n\nTo conclude, some of the game's puzzles (Being the few I've tried, hah,) are excellently thought out and I absolutely love them. The fact that I have to give my personal information out in order to get a full 100%, however, I don't. While I wouldn't personally recommend the game to people like myself, I would absolutely recommend it to others in a heartbeat. The experience doesn't look like any other. Its the type of game you would play if you were unemployed so you can say that you work for a private contractor who specializes in information collection and go through the effort and time of an actual job.","June 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 198 of 246 people (80%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","80","198","246","21","11"

But i will try and keep this review un-biased as i can...\n\nI think first you need to understand something about this game. This is not just a puzzle game. I can imagine the developers had a hard time deciding what they would describe this as, genre wise. And how to market a game on Steam that is more than a computer game.\n\nBecause thats what you have here. Something that breaks down the fourth wall. Not break through, it gets rid of it. you step off the stage as a person, as you. Or at least you if you were in a different reality. Its a game that expects you to put some real work into it. By using real life resources such as search engines, and even websites generated for the game. real websites. Not websites shown by some in-game UI. A real website that you access through your browser of choice.\nThis game asks you bring skills to it or at least learn them.\nThere is even an aspect (which is optional. See below) that requires you to get out of your chair and head into the world.\n\nLets look at that last aspect for a moment. As it is probably the only one i can see being somewhat controversial. There is an aspect to this game that seeks to turn it into a LARP (Live Action Role-Play) like experience. Understand that it is optional. But it is where this becomes a hobby in itself rather than just a game.\nYou may, if you so wish, provide your phone/mobile/cell number. And if you wish to go one step further, your address. By doing this you are immersing yourself in the game world. You can receive phone calls giving you clues to new or existing mysteries. Or a package in the mail that holds some object that is part of a current mystery or is something new. All in the style of an X-files like conspiracy theory narrative.\n\nAnd this game does have a narrative of sorts. As i stated it is a little like a LARP. There is an on-going player driven story. What you and others as players do in the game world has consequence. It affects what happens next.\n\nCommunity is a very big part of this game. Whether you go the full immersion route or not. You all play as a group working together towards a common goal.\n\nI feel this is a game that needs to be experienced to truly appreciate what it is. I just found a new hobby. And all I did was buy an Early Access game. I or anyone else can try and describe this until blue in the face. But I don’t think it can be described. Words don’t do this game justice.\n\nAnyway, this review is long enough.\n\nLook, the small answer to whether you should get this is simple:\nIf you read the description, watched the trailers, and found you were intrigued. I say give it a shot. At worst you will play through the first episode, get some entertainment through the puzzles and then move on. At best; you will be hooked. And you will participate in something you most likely have never experienced that is a work of genius. Something that, as a gamer, you will have fond memories of in the future.\n\nI hope to see you in-game.\n","August 26, 2015","true","11.6"," 145 of 173 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","145","173","11","0"

It's a Permanent Alternate Reality game - meaning that to advance in the game, you have to do things that require you to do it on the internet, or even, if you're brave, in real life. You have to use your brain, social engineering and research. You learn many things on the way - it's extremely fun, I just planned a Mission Impossible infiltration yesterday.\n\nIt's also very spooky since it includes secret organizations such as the Knights Templar or Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. You sometimes have to infiltrate and decode the things sent to them/by them - and it somehow manages to make you feel as if you were actually doing it - extremely realistic.\n\nIf you do decide to buy the game, never look at the things you see in the game generally. They all often require thinking outside of the box and you have to brainstorm to find out what they mean. Tell me if you decide to play - I've finished the game all by myself in twelve hours. I'll help you out.\n\nIf you buy it now until the end of the September, you'll get Season Two for free. I highly recommend it.\n\nEDIT1: The game doesn't end when you finish the missions it throws at you. I just received emails with even more things to decode and research - it's going to be a long-term relationship between me and this game. If you finish it like me, look at your email - there's bound to be something there from Division 66 that requires you and your skills.","August 30, 2015","true","13.1"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","65","82","3","4"

You CAN, but DO NOT HAVE TO, put in your phone number, and address. This puts you in a pool of people who can, but will not necessarily, be contacted by the game with special clues.\n\n2) 'The devs are screwing people by asking for $35 up front. I mean, the game is only in early access, they only have 6 "missions" actually finished!'\n\nThis game works somewhat like a TV series or a Telltale Games game. The content is episodic in nature. 3-4 missions are released every 2 weeks. The "early access" bit is misleading, as all content for the game is pretty much finished, save for the pieces of the plot that the players can impact. The game will be off early access after the first two weeks, assuming that there are no technical problems with the game. As for the price, the developers put the price at $35 based on the ideal of paying $1/1 hour that you can get out of the game. Of course, this is only an estimate, and those gifted with a high intelligence may find that they are completing the game faster than this. This price will drop as the season progresses, because some of the content, such as the live missions, will no longer be avaliable. If you only want to play this game for the puzzles, without any of the community content, I suggest waiting for the price to drop.\n\n3) ‘Full enjoyment of this game can be achieved without too much effort.’\n\nThis is a part of the game some people dislike. The truth of the matter is that this game will require a lot of attention to get the full experience out of it. The 19 missions that the game will have on steam can be completed at your own pace, but other content such as the live missions MUST BE DONE in real time. In other words, if you aren’t keeping up to date with the community, you’ll probably miss out on stuff. One of the major selling points of this game is the community that surrounds it. If you don’t like this, that’s ok. It just means this game probably isn’t for you.\n\nTL;DR: You should probably read up on everything that you should expect, and will be expected of you, before buying this game. It is a unique experience that many other games on Steam cannot provide, but that experience may not be for everyone. Be sure you know what you’re getting into.\n\nEDIT 1: The developers of the game just announced 5 more missions for the first season at no additional cost to those who have and will buy the game. For those with doubts as to the motivations of the developers, this should be a good sign.\n\nEDIT 2: Season 2 announced.

That may seem obvious, but the reason I say it is that this game is most definetly not your "typical" game, and I can totally understand that a lot of people will hate it. If you don't like doing challenging puzzles where you have to look outside the game itself to find the answer, if you really don't like being part of the online "community" of a game, and if you don't have a certain tolerance for bashing your head against puzzles and skin-crawling creepyness in storylines, this game is not for you.\n\nAwesome Thing #1: Permanent ARG\n----------------------------------\nThe concept of a permanent ARG is really interesting. Basically the client is only part of the game, the *real* game is the overarching plot being run by puppetmasters (they are evil and sadistic and we love them).\n\nI'm crap at explaining this, but it's a really cool overal effect of a kind-of-real-world story going on. If you know what an ARG is and/or have participated in them (for example, the ones that were done around events/releases in The Secret World, which were run by some of the same people as this game) then you have some kind of familliarity with how it works. I dunno, google it I guess.\n\nAlso, get used to googling things. And going off on tangents and chasing red herrings and having a really weird and sometimes frankly disturbing browser history.\n\nAwesome Thing #2: The Community\n--------------------------------------\nI've been around this game and its community since the first kickstarter attempt, and first, let me say it's pretty hard to separate the two, and that's a good thing (usually). Unless you are some kind of puzzle solving supergenius, you *will* get stuck at some point, and many members of the community are totally willing to help without being too spoilery. There are also real world missions (yes, really, this has already happened in Alpha and in previous games) so it's actually requred for the community to find someone in a city where the clue leads to go pick up some dead drop somewhere. It is awesome when you get to be a part of something like this, even if it's just watching a webcam feed to see if/when an agent shows up...\n\nNeutral Thing #1: Hard Puzzles\n--------------------------------\nThe solo puzzles can be pretty hard (judging by some of the alpha and beta puzzles) but this version of the game starts you off pretty easy, and there's always the community to help. Check the forums, check IRC etc.\n\nI really like the challenge of the puzzles. I like think-y games more than action games. This is a think-y game x 1000. I get that a lot of people won't like that, but there it is.\n\nSometimes the leaps of logic required can be a *liiittle* too far, in my opinion, but it's generally pretty fair, if hard.\n\nNeutral Thing #2: Creepy ♥♥♥♥\n-------------------------------\nAs for the creepyness, well. It just is. Some of the subjects in the puzzles involve illegal medical/psychological experiments on humans. One previous mission (may or may not be linked to in this game) involved tracking a serial killer. Some folks might find these things too disturbing, and I get that.\n\nMe, I like spooky games. This one is spooky. If you don't like spooky, maybe not a good fit.\n\nNot So Awesome Thing: Missing Out\n--------------------------------------\nMy main complaint for the game is that partly because of my own bad timing/luck I've missed a bunch of the cool things that happened during testing. You really need to keep up with the game and be connected with the community (which may not be convenient for a lot of people, myself included some of the time) or you can miss things. Which leads to being confused as to what the bleep is going on when you try and jump back in to chat/forums, and some dissapointment at missing the coolness that went on while you were away...\n\nOther than that though, this gets a thumbs up from me. I'm really excited to see where this game goes, and I hope it gets extended for more than one season. And that we don't get too many (fictional!) agents killed.\n\n...And that I get kidnapped.","June 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","59","78","4","1"

Unfortunately, The Black Watchmen disappoints.\n\nWith Majestic, the game drew you in with phone calls, faxes, and emails.  Fake websites were created and false news stories were inserted into reputable news sites like CNN via the client software.  The game was an immersive experience.  Characters in the game would frantically call you with secret messages or informing you that their cover had been breached.  This is how the game made all the research fun.\n\nThe Black Watchmen fails to engage.  I've now completed 11 missions and I am not sure if I am interested in playing further.  I'm definately not engaged and while there are some very friendly, helpful people in the forums the promise of the game requiring cooperative effort from the agents is only true because the missions are so badly written that it takes a community to figure out exactly what the game wants.\n\nTo me, this is a huge disappointment.  The story is unimmaginative and the gameplay is unengaging.  The community is for the most part unintersted in working together outside of the forum which would have made the game much more engaging.  I don't want to go into details about what the story is about for fear of spoiling it for someone but just think an episode of X-Files you've seen a dozen times.  As far as the gameplay, the only elements of the story that are woven into the gameplay are those directly related to a "go here and do this" sort of thing meaning there's never a joy of discovery.  So far, after 11 missions I've come accross 2 websites created for the game.  The interactions with the sites is stupid.  Hacking a site results in you magically getting just the file you need at that moment.\n\nI will still look forward to the next interesting ARG.  I really think this type of game has a place and could be done right with just a bit more effort and a better writting team.","July 22, 2015","false","13.7"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","55","73","0","3"

This game is so incredibly unique that it is almost hard to write an accurate review on it. Basically, the "game" is a beautifully-minimal dashbord that makes you feel like you're a secret agent of a paramilitary group almost instantaneously. You are given a Briefing Video that explains the situation (in a very cryptic way), and afterwards you are given a mission. The mission is usually one sentence, then you are given a clue or two (some sort of evidence). It is up to you how you solve it. Use the internet (wikipedia, google translator, cryptography sites, etc.) or maybe go to the library. Whatever. Point is, it's completely up to you. If you're stumped or need help you can "Ask a Senior Agent" or use a "Call for Help". Community is key for this game. You are also given the opportunity to give the game your personal info (phone #, address). If you do this, an "agent" will call you and give you a mission or discuss something with you. You will recieve a package in the mail with evidence in it. This game is so different. It has been getting a lot of negative comments due to the price and the confusion of "Season 1". Basically, you are paying for to own the first season, and the money is going towards the development of the second season. It is very lengthy and completely worth every penny. The money is going towards paying the developers, the writers, the actors, put up all the fake websites, the artists that make all the evidence feel real and more. IT IS WORTH IT.

Therefore, I will no longer update this review as long as I hold that position.\nAlso; to make room for this update, I removed the "Updated" list at the end of this review.\n\nContent:While the amount of content seems limited, it is worth making a huge note that the Content of any ARG is not found primarily in what you are presented with - in this case, what you see when you start the EXE file - it is the secrets you can find based on that initial presentation.\n\nCurrently there are, officially, 6 In-client missions available, in addition to 1 Live-event that's been concluded.\nThe unofficial tally, however, is much more than that; there are hidden solutions for in-client missions, logins on related webpages to uncover, files in archives to discover, and so on.\n\nEdit: There are, in fact, still numerous ongoing investigations based on those first missions, that the community has either yet to solve, or have just recently solved - reports of the current missions being "done and over with in a matter of hours", mainly come from people who never thought to look deeper.\n\nTo name but a few of the yet unsolved puzzles as of the time of this edit, the community is still working on:\n\n- Finding all hidden solutions to 3 of the 6 current In-client missions.\n- Finding the password(s) for websites and communication channels found based on the in-client missions.\n- Finding hidden Archive entries.\n- Finding out how they relate to what we know.\n- Finding out what the meaning is behind the information found in the logins that have been cracked, so to speak, such as images, odd product information, and the like.\n- Solving the significance of a series of cryptic phonecalls to some agents; finding where and/or what they lead to.\n- Participating in the discussion of what our next step should be in preparation for the next Live-Event.\n- And tieing up loose ends left over from the Live-Event, such as an unsolved cipher that the community managed to by-pass.\n\n\nMost of these come from the In-Client missions, with a subset being left over from the Live-Event.\nWith the exception of the hidden mission solutions, none of these routes were "indicated" to the players; they were discovered by the players themselves.\n\nYou can see the potential amount of gametime if you compare the time of this update, with the time TBW was launched on Steam, and the amount of unsolved missions and loose ends.\n\n\n\nLive-EventsLive-Events are not "show-and-tell" via IRC; IRC is merely the place where most Agents brainstorm during Live Missions, while they work on the clues and puzzles that come up in the course of those Live Events.\nMeanwhile the "official updates" during those events can come in the shape of either emails, phonecalls, video or audio files discovered, dead- or live-drops intercepted by players in real-world locations, or Dispatch (Devs) or NPCs (Actors) joining IRC in order to directly interact with all Agents, to name but a few methods that have been used previously.\n\nEdit: Some misconception exists surrounding the Live Events as being the "Bread and butter" content.\nWhile they certainly demand a lot of resources to do - actors and writers willing to interact with Agents at potentially any location in the world, and around the clock - missing them is by no means tantamount to missing out on the majority of the available content.\n\nAs hinted at above, there is a lot more to be found in the In-Client content, and by no means is the majority of content found in the Live-Events, neither in terms of gametime nor money. Nor vice versa.\n\n\nPricing:First and foremost; it is not subscription based. It is Episodic. The distinction is important because;\n\n- "Subscription" carries with it a connotation that one pays a monthly fee, in return for access to a game, regardless of whether or not new content is added. (e.g. MMOs)\n- "Episodic", on the other hand, means one pays for new content, knowing roughly the expected amount of content to be gained. (e.g. Episodic Adventure Games)\n\n\nEdit: As mentioned above, In-client and Live-events make up the content, so it is also pertinent to tackle both of these seperately, in terms of what costs they each involve:\n\n\nLive-Events include:\n- Actors to pose as NPCs, be it at an arranged meeting spot, as people who call or otherwise contact players, and in some cases do so well outside regular hours for their timezone.\n- Writers who "flow" with the actions of the community, ready (and able) to adapt if the community decides something unexpected.\n- Arranging dead- or live-drops, which includes actors, items, and research.\n- Production of videos, audio, photos, and so on.\n- Production of clues, websites, logins, and so on and so forth.\n\n\nIn-Client content include\n- Production of video, audio, photos, and so on. Including hiring actors/voiceactors for recurring roles.\n- Production of missions, hidden missions, archive documents, hidden files, and so on, which must all include a coherent and believable narrative, that is at the same time both "supernatural" in feel, but also very much grounded in fact.\n- Setting up professionally made websites that look and feel as the "real-deal", including customer service phone numbers, email, location, and so on - basically so however much players research, they can never be entirely sure it's not an actual place.\n- Arranging phone-calls or physical objects to be sent out in some cases, or responses to Agents contacting "Dispatch" (Devs/NPCs), either as part of the interaction with the abovementioned websites, or as part of a more elaborate "hint" function than the typical 'press this button'.\n\n\nFree-to-Play Live-Events?\nFinally, another rising misconception is that Live-Events are things that people who haven't bought the game can interact with "for free".\n\nAnyone participating outside of the client will not have the framing - by way of the overarching narrative - to follow the "what" and "why" of what happens in a Live-Event, and the main component of ARGs is exactly that narrative.\n\nLikewise, alerts to Live-events are given out to Agents (i.e. players who bought the game), either via email or the Situation Room (Red level), phone (Orange), or mail (Yellow).\nAs such, anyone who is not actively partaking in the community or did not buy the game, is many times more likely to miss out on the live-events, as they simply do not get an early warning.\n\nIn addition, the first steps of Live-Events have thus far involved the Situation Room, and may well involve entering information into the Client or reacting to updates in the Sitaution Room as the event unfolds.\n\nFinally, you will arguably not be eligible for intercepting a live- or dead-drop if Dispatch (Devs) can not confirm your involvement with them - so you'll also miss out on that potential interaction with the game.\n\n\nIn Summary:What you get out of The Black Watchmen is highly dependent on what you put in:\n\n- If you only start up the client, do the presented missions, and leave it at that, you won't get your moneys worth, nor will you enjoy any ARG.\n\n- If, however, you go beyond the client, look closer at the things you were presented with in the client, wonder what connections there might be, poke at the websites you were introduced to, look at the sourcecode of sites you were pointed to, try to find hidden files in archives, see the correlation between two disparate documents, manipulate images and audio files you find, discuss your thoughts with other agents on IRC, google docs, forums, voice chat, and so on, you get your moneys worth.\nIf not to say a whole lot more than you bargained for.","July 2, 2015","true","162.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riningear/recommended/349220/","riningear","rininge[A]r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riningear/","142 products in account","Now that the first “season” of the game has ended and Early Access is over, I think I can give a more wholesome review of this game.\n\nFirstly, I wrote a guide to navigating this game. If you want to know what an ARG is, look at the first part:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/riningear/recommended/349220\n\nTl;dr it's a puzzle game with some online-RP/LARP aspects.\n\nLet me make this clear right now: No. It’s not for everyone. I really do respect that. Especially with the “Live Missions” aspect -- some of the stuff is time-sensitive, and it can be a lot to keep up with. That’s part of an Alternate Reality Game like this. And not everyone wants to opt into receiving phone calls and/or packages. That’s really fine, but I understand it can leave some players feeling just a bit underwhelmed by the content because of their lack of choice to do so. (If you opt out, you’re not useless -- you can help those players figure out the puzzles. It really does help.)\n\nIf you want to get a feel for what's going on, download the demo, chat with the community in the IRC (there's a guide to that in the guide I linked), and poke around the game's forums to check out the gameplay that's happened.\n\nWith that said, if you do choose to play this game, there’s a lot of considerations to be made.\n\nSomeone I’m friends with at school saw me playing this and asked: “Why Steam?” I think that’s an important question. This is really the first major, recent attempt at a business model for an Alternate Reality Game. ARGs are usually constructed by third parties as promotions for existing or upcoming products -- Ingress, for example, has an Alternate-Reality platform to support its Augmented-Reality platform. In fact, The Black Watchmen is the direct product of The Secret World’s ARG promotions, run by the same company.\n\nWith that said, as someone who joined in during the Kickstarter, reaching out to a broader audience and trying to pull people into a niche from the mainstream definitely is a challenge. I think that’s where I saw a bit of a struggle with the devs, especially with “live” missions. It’s easy to come from a background of appealing to more hardcore ARG players and later have issues trying to ease into something more palatable.\n\nThat’s where we get into something that could have easily made or broken this game -- the devs. I literally cannot have enough praise for them. While many ARGs attempt not to break the fourth wall in helping its players, there’s a mutual understanding between the devs and the players that this is a new exploration of the genre, a real attempt to make something bigger out of what’s been a niche genre. So there’s been a lot of conversation between the players and devs, and I really appreciate that, as both a player and an “investor” (I mean, it was only $25, but I didn’t have much at the time…).\n\nIt really showed in the final “live” mission. All the complaints and criticisms led up to a very involved, very well-thought-out kind of experience that roped in a lot of players. I had my own personal approach to it, but I had no time to manage everyone, and so they did it on their own to great success.\n\nI guess that’s something else that’s kept me in: the community. A strong backbone to an ARG is its community, and this community has always been really warm and welcoming to new players. I had to squeeze in back during a much more difficult mission during the Kickstarter, but now it’s certainly opened up nicely. It’s something you have to get involved in to believe.\n\nFor those of you wondering about the gameplay and puzzles… unless you’re a savant of some kind, you definitely need help on some of these missions. But that’s fine. In fact, the devs encourage it. And these missions are immersive and exciting, especially towards the end, and even if I didn’t have live missions available, the $35 I would have spent (soon $15 for this season after the sale/month ends) would have likely been worth it to more intense puzzle fans. (Though in a market of $10 puzzle games… eh.)\n\nBut some of these puzzles that dig deep into the oddest parts of your knowledge and trivia, and your Google search skills. It’s pretty cool. I definitely recommend at least working through the puzzles if you want to try “something else.” Once you get to know that little noise effect from a successful answer, it'll be your best friend and the warmest feeling in the world.\n\nThe client’s odd and bulky in some parts and we’re trying to exchange feedback about it. A lot of it's left over from the beta versions. But you won't be using it that much anyway, given the game involved a lot of real-world research.\n\nSummary: Great puzzles, great people. Definitely invest if you want to be a part of something new and exciting. But it’s not for everyone -- try the demo, check the IRC, get a feel for it.\n\nJust don’t be rude if it isn’t for you. A lot of the negative reviews are often because people are uncomfortable about the game’s aspects. Don’t fall into that trap -- figure it out for yourself.","September 26, 2015","true","46.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","2"

From "A Friend". She was seeking help. There was a clue in the e-mail, the clue led to a website, a website that had an image on it.  The image had a clue in it, it unlocked in to a forum. What the hell, I thought. There was a sole thread. You've made it.\n\nAs other strangers arrived we got to discussing what the hell was going on, who was this person, why are they seeking our help? What do these images mean? Why us? Why have we been targetted? Over the coming days the buzz of activities heightened, the sense of urgency to solve this mystery was on. We all worked together deciphering images, clues, morse code, sonar radars until we finally uncovered the truth.  It was a viral ARG for The Secret World announcement.\n\nARGs are all about following clues, deciphering images, looking for meaning in things, researching real world events, connecting dots, going down rabbit holes and coming up short, stepping back and realising that you might be overthinking things.  The Black Watchmen does all of that and more. Like others, I was aprehensive about giving out my personal details, but I haven't disclosed one piece of personal information and have had a blast with the first 6 missions so far.  The community is one of the friendliest online communities I have come in to contact with, ever. :)\n\nIf you have any doubts whatsoever about getting enjoyment out of this at Red Clearance level, then put your mind at ease. You can still join in with the discussions on IRC, you can bounce theories off one another in the Forums, you can work together outside of the client to further investigate leads from the client.  Perhaps in time you will feel more comfortable with the idea of giving out your details and decide to become more involved.  It is entirely up to you how involved you want to be, I guess the more you put in to it, the more you get out of the experience.\n","June 28, 2015","true","38.5"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","34","48","0","0"

And what a game it is.\n\n>>AGENT: Ellis\n>>CLEARANCE: Yellow\n>>LIVE MISSIONS: 1\n\n>>START REVIEW:\n\nHave you ever looked into the history of games, and stumbled upon something called " ilovebees.com "?\n\nIt was part of a promotional campaign for Halo 2, that appeared for 2 seconds In one of its ads for E3 (or something like E3) that lead people to investigate details about the site, eventually finding coordinates to payphones around america, and a time for each payphone.\n\nEveryone appeared on time to each and every payphone on time, despite one of them being in the middle of a hurricaine at the time.\n\nThat, was one of the first ARG's, and is probably the most famous one to have existed.\n\nAn "ARG" is an "Alternate Reality Game". And ARG's usually involve investigating websites, history, places, and cryptology to gain details on a fictional story.\n\nBaisically Larping for the digital age.\n\nHowever, the difference between standard ARG's and The Black Watchmen, is that ARG's are normally used for promoting a product, and they usually end at some point.\n\nWhile the former is certainly the case (TBW is part of The Secret World MMORPG's lore), This game's selling point it that its missions don't go away after the ARG is over, but as far as I know (S1 Mission 16), these missions don't involve anything in the real world, and you don't need to go anywhere.\n\nIn Live missions on the other hand, you need to interact with the community via irc chats and their forum to solve specific events (e.g. Using google to Hunt down 5 german buisnessmen for sleeper agents to assasinate, because they know too much), and do tasks in the real world that're related to the event.\n\nHowever, you can also choose how involved you are with the game's world by choosing what clearance you want to be.\n\n>>RED CLEARANCE: Nothing irl will happen to you. You can play the game through the client and interact with the                                                 community, and that's about it.\n\n>>ORANGE CLEARANCE: You may get phone calls by providing your telephone number.\n\n>>YELLOW CLEARANCE: You may get phone calls and packages, and you may have to interact with actors playing a specific role.\n\n>>GREEN CLEARANCE: The most known amount you can get involved. You have to be voted for it, and supply a medical exam for this. Missions will involve you, and they may take more than a day to finish.\n\n>>BLACK CLEARANCE: This has been hung over our heads for a while. We don't know what it is.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd reccomend this game, as it has some very interesting puzzles based around finding codes based around books, the bible, and historical figures, which might end in you learning about something interesting.\n\nIf you have any form of paranoia, I'd STRONGLY suggest researching this game, or asking someone that knows about this game if it's suitable for you.\n\n>>END REVIEW","January 10","true","24.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","4"

It can get frustrating at times, but I love how difficult it can be - it makes it extra rewarding when you work out the problem!\n\nIt seemed a tad expensive when I first saw it, but it really appealed to me - and god-damn it's worth it! It really is worth the punt if it sounds like your kind of game. The user interface is simple, but clean and well polished.\n\nIt's a mix of puzzles, cipher/code breaking, hacking (things like email accounts) and researching (digging for information online). The story is great, if a little far-fetched/fantastical. I love how it ties in with the real world - I've even had real-life mail come through with a mission. The developers seem to be very dedicated to the game, adding many new events, live missions, and extra community sandbox missions.\n\nI've been off on so many tangents whilst researching to complete the missions. You can spend hours looking into the completely wrong thing, but you learn so much in the process. A lot of the story is based on medicine and occultism, and it is interesting to learn about these subjects.\n\nI really hope Season 2 is just as good and addictive.

The ARG itself includes puzzle solving, cryptography and online research.\nNo real life skills are needed however if you have experience with cryptography and if your Google game is on-par, you will enjoy the game. If you are unsure, you can always try downloading the demo before you decide whether you'd like to purchase the game.\n\nBear in mind at this point, you can buy the first season which includes a total of 25 missions as stated in other reviews. Currently sandbox missions are being added, which means user-submitted missions can be played. Once Season 2 is out, you can purchase the missions that come with it.\n\nTell me more about this gameWhile you play the game, you will need to research topics and look online for answers. If you give up easily or don't feel like using wikis and Google is something you want to do, perhaps this game isn't for you and you should look elsewhere. Of course, if you're just having issues with the game you can always look for help in-game as well as in the Black Watchmen official IRC channel (linked in their official website) as well as in the official TBW forums - the community is great and spoiler-free! Furthermore, you can either collaborate with others who are on the same mission as you or seek attention from folks who have already passed the same.\n\nWhat about the staff?From my brief, however positive experiences I can say the staff members are excellent, supportive and exceptionally well-mannered (I tip my digital hat off to Santiak and and Anashel, who were more than happy to provide me with all of the assistance and additional information I needed regarding the game).\n\nSo is it worth it?I have personally enjoyed the game so far. I'm currently on Mission 7, I've been blazing through missions so far and Mission 7 stumped me (Mike is to blame for this).\nShould you buy it? Yes, absolutely.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/349220/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Weekend With The Black Watchmen ARG\n\nThe world is overflowing with mysteries and conspiracy; some are visible to all, but others are less obvious, hidden beneath a layer of secrecy, lies and the occult. If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole you are bound to discover some disturbing things – things almost too plausible to be true. Blood rituals, human sacrifice and experimentation are mainstays of the silver screen, there’s no way that they could be taking place beneath our very noses, or could they? There are agents worldwide investigating these disturbing reports and this weekend I joined them to get to the bottom of some shadowy people and their dealings. This is how I became a member of The Black Watchmen.\n\nI initially mistook The Black Watchmen as just a game, but it is much more than that. I am now part of a secret reconnaissance cell partaking in undercover investigations. My basic training involved learning to crack codes – binary, hexadecimal and rot13 enciphered messages – a cinch given my degree in computer science, but things soon became more difficult. My fellow agents and I were tasked with investigating the disappearance of an antique collector – and that’s when things took a decidedly more sinister turn. The case files we were given, drafted by the first agent on the scene, consisted of nothing but seemingly innocuous images of books, dolls, crucifixes and bottles. The keen-eyed among us were able to identify a rot13 enciphered code in one of the images, which we were then able to decipher manually. The code pointed towards a pastebin link with details of an antique script called “Folio 13″, the kind a collector would love to have in their collection, but how did it tie in with his disappearance?\n\nA Google search for “folio 13″ and “Cipher MMS” lead me down a rabbit hole of religion, conspiracy, secret societies and the occult. I was suddenly in over my head, reading up on ancient Jewish sects and Pope John Paul’s teachings – certainly nothing that could be attributed to the disappearance. I was over thinking things, going way too deep and missing an answer that was right in front of me. The organisation that penned the document wanted it back and was willing to go to any lengths to get it.\n\nAs the case was solved I gave myself a pat on the back and put my feet up, but my respite didn’t last long. The agency had heard word that a clinic tied to rumours of human experimentation had reopened its doors and I had been asked to investigate its staff members for any signs of illegal activity. By cross-referencing each staff member’s employment history I was soon able to establish a link between them and illegal human experiments – all those years of Google-fu were finally becoming useful.\n\nWith a link established it was tie to go deeper and find out exactly what was going on at the clinic. An undercover team was dispatched after closure to bug the building for remote monitoring. And then silence. The agency ceased contact until Sunday when all agents abruptly received an email informing us that the alert level had been “raised to 3″. With urgency we made our way to our usual channels of communication (IRC) and began to converse about what could be happening, and there it was. In our game clients was an image coded in braille.\n\nThe image was surprisingly complex, containing not only the braille code, but a map that could be uncovered by applying various filters, and behind that were words which turned out to be street names. Some very intelligent deciphering later we had uncovered a restaurant in Portland called “The Fried Onion”.  Initial reconnaissance of the location yielded no results, but now as the restaurant opens for business, we have agents on route for a face to face with forces unknown.\n\nNow we wait\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nPreviewed with a promotional key from developer.

I was a little reluctant to buy this game at first because I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a part of the ARG aspect of it. The great thing about TBW is that you don't have to do any ARG stuff if you don't want. Even the live missions can be completed without any of the extra stuff. However, now that I've realized how awesome the game is though, I've started to get into the ARG aspect of the game.\n\nBasically there are 5 levels of immersion.\n\nRed: The lowest level of immersion. The only thing required for red is an email.\n\nOrange: This level is a bit more immersive. You have to register your phone number and will sometimes get phone calls/voicemails for live missions.\n\nYellow: Yellow is the highest level conventionally available. To be a yellow agent you must submit your location and will receive mail and sometimes have to do things in your area.\n\nGreen: To be a green agent you must submit a full medical report and do a ton of real world stuff. Only 8 people are selected for green each season.\n\nBlack: Classified Info\n\nAs you can see, the game gives you a lot of different options to choose from.\n\nNow to the actual game. The game is very addicting and challenging enough to keep you wanting more. You investigate everything from illegal testing to cults to mutants to the apocalypse. The game does a great job of making you feel like you're somewhere you're not supposed to be.\n\nNot only is the game and immersion great, but the community is one of the most welcoming communities I've ever been a part of. You can go to the forums at forums.blackwatchmen.com and the IRC at  https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.blackwatchmen.com/division66\nThe vets will always be glad to help if you're stuck on a mission.\n\nAnyway, I love this game. It's addicting, fun, immersive, and has a great community.\n\n10/10\n\nTL;DR great game, great community, buy it now.","January 10","true","128.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This time, I feel strongly enough about this game that I want to spread the word. If you enjoy puzzles, mysteries in the line of X-Files and the MMO The Secret World, and are willing to put yourself into the game, this will be a home run for you.\n\nThis ARG uses the real world as the surface with you becoming part of a secret organization who deals with those events outside the realm of the police. As a member of the Black Watchmen, you will work alone and with other agents to solve mysteries through ciphering, internet research and more. The puzzles themselves are great and you really feel an AH-HA moment when you succeed. The community is strong and willing to help. We can't solve everything on our own.\n\nThe big selling point for me is the level of immersion. You can play the game without giving any of your information (Red) and still be a part of almost everything. If you are ok giving more personal information, then you become part of the game.  You can get phone calls relating to the game. You can have packages sent to you and even be called upon to go to locations in your area to help in the live events. The potential is huge for this game. The devs have been hands on with the community, quick to answer questions and keep everyone excited about what is on the other side of the rabbit hole.\n\nSome are complaining about the price as it does include the first season (roughly 3 months). This includes not just the game itself, but live events and secret missions. I do feel that you will get your money's worth IF this type of game appeals to you. The more of yourself you are willing to put into it, the more you will get from it.","June 27, 2015","true","59.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The Black Watchmen is an ARG, or Alternate Reality Game. An ARG is a "game" where you have to go outside the boundaries of what you are given to solve very difficult puzzles. The Black Watchmen is advertised as a PARG, or Permanent Alternate Reality Game. That means that it will always be available for other players to experience it. The Black Watchmen does this perfectly by having a forum for newer players when they get stuck, or for new players to collaborate to solve to puzzles. The Black Watchmen also does a great job at integrating story into the overall experience, so you actually know what you are trying to do. Overall, The Black Watchmen is an exceptional game and I strongly urge you to play it.

This whole blending of real-world and game is right up my alley.\n\nBut that's about it for the good stuff.\nOn the con-side however.......\nThe objectives themselves for each chapter are very vague. Add to that, a lot of the clues are bewilderingly worded, so you spend a lot of time either researching things that you don't have to because the answer the game is looking for is right in front of you.\nOr, you spend a few hours doing a hunt-the-hidden-answer, as you try to figure out which of the bits of information you have will actually allow you to progress.\nIf you've ever played some of the old text-based adventure games where you had to find the correct word for the game to trigger correctly, you have an understanding of what is going on in this game.\nIt doesn't exactly help that the difficulty-level is all over the place.\nYou jump from dead-easy into a maze of strangely worded questions that absolutely requires prior knowledge to figure out.\n\nAnd of course, with these types of games comes an inherent shelf-life.\nIf you happen to buy this game a year from now, is there any guarantee that any of the embedded web-sites needed are still around?\n\nIt's a very neat concept, it's just not very well executed.\n\nEDIT: Are you f*cking kidding me?\nA puzzle-hint involving a FaceBook account??\nOkay, first of all, there is no 'clear link' between the Rosenberg Clinic and Superterram Life Sciences.\nOne does neurological research, and the other is a body farm.\nOne is in Montreal, the other in Texas.\nThere are no documents, mails, telephone-taps or anything else that would make this company any more interesting than any of the others.\nThe only real link is that it's the only company-name that actually pops up in the search-engines.\nThat's not deduction, that's just mechanical grinding until you eliminate suspects.\nAnd besides, are you really telling me that we can find a higly classified document re. medical experiments on the intranet, but apart from that we only have a vague browser-history to go on?\nThat is honestly just bad writing.\n\nEven if I were willing to forgive that, using FB as a part of your game is.....\nWell, let me put it this way; if having a FB account is required for completing this game (which it is), I would strongly suggest that you put it on the list of game-requirements, along with processor, GPU and all that.\nHad I known it was a pre-requisite, I wouldn't have touched this game with a proverbial ten-foot pole.\nAnd before you say "Just use a pseudonym and create a FB account".....\nThat would violate the ToS of FB, and is technically illegal.\n\nFirst game I ever bought where I have seriously contemplated going for a refund.\nOh well, too late now.","February 6","false","5.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","6"

Previous free AR games I have played have an obvious love or devotion from the developers, which this is missing.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is that input parameters for deciding if you have supplied the answer are so narrow and specific that you can spend many hours in frustration chasing possible answers, only to later realise you already discoved the real answer long ago but didnt use the correct title. For example while "icecream store" would be incorrect, "Sunny Farms Ice Cream Store Inc Pty Ltd" would be correct.\n\nA further kick in the teeth however is that the game quickly devolves any complexity into in browser "flash games", and "Social Engineering" otherwise known as "email formating games".","September 8, 2015","false","7.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","3"

While playing, you have the chance to exploit many different personal skills, as you work in front of your computer screen (using the game client or accessing the internet as well). In that case, code-breaking knowledge, social media and social engineering skills will be your assets! Many training missions are provided for your preparation as well, and the players' community is very helpful if you are stuck on a single player mission.\n\nFurthermore, you can play with other agents using the game chat assets: you might even have the chance to actually go in field! Depending on your chosen clearance level in the agency, in Real Life you might be asked to analyse objects or document you receive by mail, or to go out in your town delivering documents or, in some cases, to meet actual NPCs, especially in the occasion of the game Live Events that involve collaboration of all TBW agents for a single mission that might go on for some days.\nTBW is a great game, I really think that it is worthwhile to give it a try. You will be surprised!","January 10","true","268.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
