IGT has been the leading company specializing in design, development, manufacturing, distribution, and sales of computerized gaming equipment, software, and network systems worldwide.  You can read more about the company here[www.igt.com].\n\nIGT Slots Paradise Garden is named for the Paradise Garden slot machine present in the package.  The package consists of a total of 15 IGT slot machines.\n\nFunctionally, the machines deliver a game of slots one would expect, especially those that have played these actual IGT slot machines.  For most of the machines I did a youtube comparison and the machines look to be very accurate.\n\nIGT Slots Paradise Garden has two modes from which you can choose.   These modes are Career and Free Play.  For each mode you create 4 profiles.   For each profile you get a club card.  The career club card is broken down into Career Points, Bank Roll and Time Played.  The Free Play club card is broken down into Reward Points and Bank Roll.\n\nThe starting Bank Roll for Career is $1,000.00 and at first you are limited to penny denominations at each of the machines.  Only when the game determines that your career bank roll has grown sufficiently will the denomination be increased.  Denomination enumerations are 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, $1, $5 and $10.  Playing career, it might be a while before you can bet and win big bucks, but then again, for that quick fix there is Free Play until you can elevate your career bank roll high enough to be able to activate the higher denominations.  The starting bank roll for Free Play is $10,000 and you can quickly increase your bank roll playing denominations of $10.\n\nThe denomination is essentially the value of one credit.  Credits you bet and win are displayed when you spin the reels.  When you first sit down at the machine you will be awarded a maximum of 10,000 credits for that session if your bank roll is large enough.  If you have a bank roll of $5000.00 and select a denomination of $10 the machine will display 500 credits.  A selected denomination of a $1 will result in 5000 credits available for the session and so on.  Credits are reset as you scroll through denominations.\n\nEach machine as in real life has a Game Menu button and though I cannot vouch for it's authenticity the Game Menu button has a "Rules and Pays" option that will illustrate how to play the machine.  Oddly, each machine has a functionally duplicate button, sometimes renamed to Game Options that serves the exact same purpose.\n\nFrom a functional view the IGT Slots Paradise Garden package delivers but like all video games there is the concept of immersion.  In other words does IGT Slots Paradise Garden  immerse you enough that you can believe that you are at the casino.  Unfortunately this is where the package falls short.\n\nThere are two casino themes that are available but each looks to be rendered as low resolution FMV and this detracts from the immersiveness.  The reels and icons on the reels are crisp enough to support the maximum 1080P resolution selectable from the game's options menu but the rest of the machine including many of the buttons are rendered in low resolution which also detracts from the immersion.\n\nImmersive game-play is not just defined by video and by graphics but also by sound and music and while the reels are spinning the sounds and music are near authentic, based on my viewing of the machines on youtube.  However, once the reels stop spinning and the payout animations finish the game goes silent.  No casino ambience, no idle ambience, no visual or auditory feedback from the machines.  Further the package does not convey the illusion of video slots.  The reels do not look like they are spinning on a monitor.\n\nFunctionally IGT Slots Paradise Garden delivers authentic games of slots and on this alone the package can be recommended but I wish the developer had gone that "extra mile" and delivered a more immersive package.","September 26, 2014","true","5.7"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","36","46","0","7"

Tons of machines, its like stumbling through the penny slots at 3am after  a fifth of jagermeister without the worry of looking at your bank account the next day and wondering what you did.

I always wanted a slot machine game on steam and this is the first and only one so far. There's a lot of different machines but they are all pretty similar. There doesn't seem to be any of those features you might expect like press buttons to hold reels, gamble double or nothing buttons etc. and while there are some sounds the game badly needs the sound of falling coins and a nice set of 3d coins tumbling out: all you get is a kind of generic beeping noise as it counts up the amount you won.\n\nDefinitely not worth the full price. I'm making it as not recommended for the sheer audacity of the pricing and the lack of coin graphics and sounds. If one of those changed I'd recommend it. I got it for 4600 gems in the winter 2014 auction event which is about 1/6th the price of it on steam when not in a sale.\n\nAnother kind of dodgy thing is that the publishers have been giving out free keys to people to help them beta test or something, and at least 2 of the positive reviews here are people who got free keys, so you might want to bear that in mind.","December 15, 2014","false","0.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","1"

You must do one more spin in hope of that huge win.\nThe career mode and the in game achievements are some nice features that will keep you busy.\nI guess for a slot machine fan this must be a dream but it works very good as a relaxed casual experiance too, just sit back and watch the cash flow in or vanish without any angst of loosing any real money.\n\nMy favourite slot machine is "Super Fusion 7s" It has nice visuals and sound and has also brought the most luck.\n\nRecommended for: Caual gamers and slot machine fans","October 20, 2014","true","2.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Slotmachines!\nIn real life, slotmachines do not make me want to spend money on but I guess there's some kind of thrill about it if real money is involved. In this game however, without any real money, there's nothing at stake.\n\nGameplay, like real slotmachines,  only consists of placing your bet and .... well .. press 'spin' and see if you have earned some credits. There are 15 slots to choose from which, all do the same thing but look a bit different.\n\nYou might ask, 'For 20 bucks, at least the graphics must be amazing, right?'. Sadly, even the graphics are of such low quality you can only find playing the worst casual games and the music/sounds are also pretty annoying.\n\nI do not get the people recommending this game. If you really like slotmachines that much, I'm sure you can find some free slotmachine games on the web instead of paying 20 bucks for a mediocre game.\n","March 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

They are fun and relaxing to play and  the music and sound affects are really nice and well done.

You play in the comfort of your home with out the hustle and bustle of a crowded  casino or trying to find a car park.\n\nThis game could well be the answer for people living with real time addictions, relating to playing these type pokie machines in real life with real money, hoping to get lucky only to be left homeless.\n\nIts a very small price to pay for this game, to get the same pleasure as you would with a real slot machine, only you dont loose or gain real money, but rather you still have the same or simillar satisfaction as you would with the real slot machines.\n\nI can asure you i wont be visiting any casino anytime soon if ever, this game is plenty enough for me.

There should be a option to see the whole screen and the top part so you dont need to scroll up to see what you  heve to get as matches but my biggest complaintand this is from a long time gambler on these machines is they are so confusing way to much stuff some of them have and not enough explanation , i cant imagine a first time player to these types of machine . Also somthing need to be done with the cash every time i go to a table i get automatic funds and that really killed the atmosphere it should be you enter the casino with a set amount and you need to earn cash not have it givin to you because as of now it is pointless to really get into because there is no joy in winning . Plus $21 is very steep the game should be $5 game plus there is no real diversity other than instead of cheris its wolfs or somthing .
