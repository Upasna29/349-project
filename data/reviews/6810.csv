I played the first two games in the series to death back when they came out.\n\nImpressions:\nThe game stands up today much as it did when it came out. It's a damn fine strategy game that's a blast to play and highly rewarding. However unlike it's predecessor this game is more of an expansion pack, with only 8 missions they instead ramped the difficulty to near frustrating levels.\n\nWhile still fun and rewarding for the most part I really started to detest the 'mansion kidnap', 'rail yard' and final mission for the sheer bloody minded difficulty of sections those missions where trail and error started to get irritating.\n\nThere are some missteps for sure with elements that are seemingly only solvable in a single method and theres one right in the first mission that can leave you stranded just as you thought you were done and you have to go back a few saves or even start again.\n\n\nFixes:\nAs with Behind enemy lines there are a number of serious issues with the game on a modern PC that make it almost unplayable.\n\nSee the page on the 'Commandos Wikia' for 'Commandos: Beyond the call of Duty Fixes' for a collection of bug fixes to stabilise the game and make it playable.\n\nhttp://commandos.wikia.com/wiki/Fixing_Commandos\n\nThe Good:\n*A classic formula that stands up today for it's simplicity and functions.\n*Missions can be tackled many ways.\n*The settings have a historical context and introduced as such.\n*Missions are huge and diverse.\n*Fast save/load system makes experimentation less frustrating than you'd think.\n*Huge sense of triumph from executing a plan that takes out even a single awkward guard.\n*Looks pretty good considering it's age.\n*New mechanics, some of which are interesting and alter your tactics.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Installs ok on Steam but multi-core affinity issues requires some manual tweaking.\n*Many missions have sections where there is only one practical solution.\n*The difficulty level is a massive leap up upward over the original game.\n*A new character only appears in a single mission.\n*Cigarette packs effectively give everyone a Decoy box, messing with the balance.\n*Shorter tougher campaign.\n\nRecommended for: War, Action and isometric strategy fans and fans of the original.\n\nConclusion.\n7/10. Once the stability issue is fixed it's a reasonable follow up to the original.","November 26, 2013","true","22.6"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/6810/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 83%Beyond the Call of Duty is like an expert mode for Behind Enemy Lines. There are only a handful missions, but they are all incredibly long and incredibly difficult. If you want a great and challenging game, look no further.\n\nLong version:Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty is a stand-alone expansion pack for the critically acclaimed classic isometric strategy/stealth game, Behind Enemy Lines.\n\nLike the base game, it features a group of commandos in eight scenarios, who must complete a set of objectives– mostly sabotage– deep inside enemy territory. Although all missions are loosely based on historical events, there is no actual plot, only short briefings.\n\nBtCoD is notorious even among old Commandos fans for its difficulty. The levels are not only gigantic– larger than the biggest one in BEL– but they are also full of enemies placed in the most nefarious ways possible.\nTo combat this, all commandos received new abilities. Some are unique, some are universal: for example, anyone can now distract soldiers by throwing rocks, or lure them with cigarette packs.\nThere is also a non-lethal way to deal with enemies now, letting you take hostages to use as distractions. On some levels it’s almost impossible to progress without using these “puppets”.\nThe imbalance between characters wasn’t really addressed, since you still need to use the Green Beret or the Spy to silently kill or knock out, and to carry enemies. Therefore, the role of the others is mostly reduced to hostage controllers.\n\nStill, this difficulty is what made BtCoD more memorable, and probably even more loved than the original, which will seem way too easy and short in comparison. So, if you ever want to experience some difficult game that is not just another indie platformer, you can always rely on Pyro Studio’s classic.","July 23, 2015","true","26.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoimingmissile/recommended/6810/","hoimingmissile","hoimingmissile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoimingmissile/","620 products in account","While it has fewer missions than Behind Enemy Lines each of Beyond the Call's missions is as big as the largest-size missions from BEL. Altogether I liked this game just as much as the first BUT the addition of several new abilities counteracts the added complexity of the longer missions. In fact, I feel they went too far and made the game too easy.\n\nThese abilities have been granted to all characters:\nPuppet - Basically, the character holds an enemy soldier at gunpoint, allowing you to control the soldier. The soldier has one ability: Distract. This single ability allows any character to have a Spy-lite in their pocket at all times.\nStone - When thrown it causes all soldiers in earshot to look in the direction of the impact for a few seconds. If you instead use it to pelt a soldier several times directly he'll leave his post to investigate. Again, it just made things too easy.\nCigarettes - Usually has to be salvaged from a dead soldier. When dropped within view of most enemy soldiers they'll leave their patrols/posts to pick up the pack and smoke them in a corner somewhere.\nAll three of these abilities are usable by any character and it really takes away from the puzzle aspect of Commandos that I really loved. The Green Beret's Decoy's thunder has been stolen and split 3 ways and the Spy... while he's not rendered obsolete he's definitely not as indispensable as he used to be.\n\nCharacter        Ability                Green Beret        Handcuffs - Pre-requisite to Puppeteering\n\nFist - Pre-requisite to handcuffing             Driver        Rifle - Basically, the pistol with 30% more range. It's unsilenced and therefore not very useful for most situations but it doesn't have limited ammo like the Sniper's rifle.\n\nClub - Same as the fist, but the Driver doesn't carry handcuffs so it's really only useful for a two-pronged attack when you want to quickly knock-out two soldiers in rapid succession.             Spy        Hanger - Unlike BEL, the Spy's disguise duties are no longer super simple. Previously, he just had to worry about getting ahold of the officer's uniform and after that he was untouchable. In Beyond he can/must usually steal his uniform from handcuffed enemies. The easiest to obtain is the common soldier but officers are not fooled by this disguise. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that officers usually patrol with several machinegunners in tow and are therefore impossible to knockout and handcuff. (You can't steal uniforms from dead enemies.)\n\nEther - Same as the fist, but again, only the Green Beret carries the handcuffs so you'll need him to finish up otherwise the enemy will wake up and sound the alarm shortly.\nIn conclusion, I liked Beyond but not as much as Behind. The mission designs are somewhat more complex but this is watered down too far by the new, shared abilities.","April 20","true","18.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It also introduces a few deceptively simple, yet interesting, abilities. You can knock enemies unconscious (to gain control to distract other guards), divert with stones or lure with cigarettes (a particular favourite). Fortunately this doesn't detract from the ruthless difficulty that this game has thankfully retained.

It is impossible to react to anything since everything moves too damn fast. Stealth is a must when you play this game, but since everything is in super speed, you won't be able to time it correctly when trying to avoid the enemies line of sight. If you are seen, they will kill you in the blink of a eye and all you can do is just start up a new game since you cannot even save or load your game! This game is one of those games where saving and loading on the fly is very important, but there is no way to do that for some unknown reason. What is even worse is that Steam is actually selling this game online without fixing it. Yea, it was not that expensive, but someone is still making a pretty penny off of this games sales. It is sad because this game is actually good, it's just these bugs that prevent it from being playable. The least they could do is patch it up or if all else fails, take it down the store. If the glitches were fixed, I would definitely recomend buying it.","March 3, 2014","false","0.1"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","2"

Maybe even harder this time, but the joy of finally managing to escape after completing all objectives is definitely real. It may be a bit outdated, but this game still has it, in my opinion. Challenging, but definitely doable. Dozens of different strategies to beat each map, moments of real suspense, realizing you just quick-saved after being spotted and god knows where your last proper save is... those are just some of the things you'll encounter playing this game. If you liked the main game, you're in luck because besides being sadistic, you'll find more of the same original commandos right here.

It's annoying, but not as annoying as dying over and over again trying to beat this expansion.\n\nSome new mechanics, new scenarios and well, just as hard as always. Maybe even harder this time, but the joy of finally managing to escape after completing all objectives is definitely real. It may be a bit outdated, but this game still has it, in my opinion. Challenging, but definitely doable. Dozens of different strategies to beat each map, moments of real suspense, realizing you just quick-saved after being spotted and god knows where your last proper save is... those are just some of the things you'll encounter playing this game. If you liked the main game, you're in luck because besides being sadistic, you'll find more of the same original commandos right here. Yes, don't you dare think you're done just because you got to the end of behind enemy lines, you still have one more to go, officer. Good luck!","January 20","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorrorFox/recommended/6810/","HorrorFox","Horror Fox :3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorrorFox/","343 products in account","Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!\n\nThis is a Strategy Stealth world war 2  game.\n\n\nInterface/Menu/Settings\nThere are some Resolution sizes.\nThe Music and sound volume has a slidebar.\nYou are able to turn off the Commando voices/Enviroment and in-game music,\nThere is a manual/introduction in the game.\nThere are no tutorials.\nAble to toggle "ignore enemy soldier on halt".\n\nMultiplayer requires IP and Port Forwarding. THIS STILL WORKS!\n\nAbout the game.\nYou play with a couple of commandos and each commando has their own equipment and skills. The game is very difficult by itself and their is even a difficulty level settings too. Just if it is too easy. There are 8 mission/Maps and You have to complete each mission by fulfilling the subjective. Destroying things, to freeing, capturing and so go on. Enemy soldiers/vehicles has an eye of sight which is marked with Dark green and light green. Dark green means you have to crouch or otherwise the enemy unit will see you. Light green he spotted you and could fire on you. Your commandos are able to take hostage by enemy Sergeants (usually patrolling with units). There is a chance that they will rise alarm if they see you, if that happends. You might load game. Because things will get 10x harder if they have raised their alarm. Whenever a mission starts you will be told what you have to do and you get some hints too.\n\n\nAble to throw stones, throw cigarettes, capture and take enemy units hostage.\nAnnouncer that is giving you some tips and hints and what you need to do in order to complete the mission.\nMusic is good.\nIt has some old graphics but it's fine to be honest.\nEnemies could be difficult to see sometimes due the graphical background.\nYou have a map on the right side and a hint next to the map.\nAlot of Error and trials.\nMultiple save slots. Which are needed!\nEach commando has their own Voice. But the voices are a bit meh in this version.\nPathing is sometimes weird.\nAnimations are sometimes slow.\n\n\nOther things.\nYou could see this like a DLC for the First version. But this has only 8 missions has some new feature but most of all. Difficulty in this game is extremely higher. Sadly enough you are only able to play with the new characters in 1 mission.\n\nI have enjoyed it very much, some missions are a pain in the ♥♥♥, but there are no mission the same. Sometimes a little bit of luck is required too.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 8/10","May 4","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
