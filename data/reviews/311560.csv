They were both released close together, yet Unity got all the attention, despite how horrible unoptimized and downright unplayable it was for a time. But forget Unity. Assassin's Creed Rogue is where it's at. Taking on the role of Shay Cormac, a cocky, headstrong fledgling Assassin trained by the Assassin Brotherhood of Achilles, you are taken on one hell of a journey that brings to light what the Assassins have in store for the world. In light of certain events, Shay decides to turn his back on his Brothers, betrays them, and then joins the Templars. Using the skills he learned under Assassin tutelage, Shay is now an Assassin Hunter. Taking place in 18th century North America, Assassin's Creed Rogue is the first game in the acclaimed series where you play as a member of the opposing faction: the Templars.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nWe all know how Assassin's Creed plays. The series has been around for many years now. You are an employee at Abstergo Industries, using a device called the Animus to explore the memories of different figures from the past. In this installment, you dive into the memories of Assassin Shay Cormac. The main draw of Rogue is the story, the turns it takes, and the likeable and downright badass main character, but it uses many of the familiar mechanics and control schemes of previous titles. A lot of the mechanics and features from Black Flag return for Rogue, including sailing your own ship and upgrading it. Though there isn't nearly as much of the ship element involved as there was in Black Flag, it's been refined and is much more enjoyable. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is the saying that comes to mind.\n\nAssassin skills only carry Shay so far, and for everything else he depends on the various tools at his disposal. In addition to the basic tools of the trade (such as the Hidden Blades), the pistol set, the dagger/sword set, and Eagle Vision, Shay also has access to a number of other tools to aid him in his journey. As you progress the story you will slowly unlock these tools. The first of which is an Air Rifle. Naturally silent, the sleek Air Rifle fires 3 types of darts: Sleep, Berserk, and Firecracker. Sleep darts put the target to sleep, berserk darts cause their target to enter a state of uncontrollable rage, attacking anything nearby, and firecracker darts are used to create lures or distractions. Along with the air rifle, you also have a prototype grenade launcher. A smaller version of what we are used to from other game, this grenade launcher has 3 different grednades: Sleep, Berserk, and Shrapnel. Sleep and Berserk grenades work the same way their dart counterparts do, exact in a small are of effect. Shrapnel grenades are essentially small bombs that take down targets in their radius. Another smaller tool is the Rope Dart, which can be used to grapple and drag targets around, or outright hang them.\n\nA new mechanic introduced by Rogue are the Stalkers. These are NPC assassins that hide everywhere and are out to kill Shay. These are introduced after a certain part of the story, and easily the mosty annoying feature of the game. They will jump from on top of buildings on top of you as you are going to your next objective and backstab you, oftentimes killing you before you even know what's going on. Luckily, the game provides you a sort of compass to find them before they find you in Eagle Vision. You also know when you get close to one when you hear whispering.\n\nCollectibles make a return from previous installments, and there are a TON: Animus Fragments, Templar Maps, Prosperity Gems, Shanties, and Chests are scattered around every location. Half the fun of the game is finding all of these collectibles. Some of them, such as the Prosperity Gems, will benefit you in some way, by increasing your income from various sources. Templar Maps points you to hidden treasures at certain, very specific locations. Shanties unlock new songs for your ship's crew to sing while traveling on the sea. Some chests contain Blueprints, which are basically your ultimate ship upgrades. Crafting makes a return, using items you skin or gather from animals you hunt. Also outfits.\n\nSome new mechanics you will also find are Renovations and Gang HQs/Economic Centers. Renovations are buildings scattered about that can be rebuilt using resources you find, such as stone, cloth, and wood. Gang HQs and Economic Centers are small strongholds that can be taken over to provide you permanent income and act as Fast Travel points. These Economic Center and Renovations both provide income, which can be collected from the Bank in your Captain's Quarters on your ship, or at Banks in each Economic Center. All of these are worth investing in, as soon you will have more money that you'll know what to do with.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nRogue looks just as good as Black Flag. Absolutely stunning. All the little details really stand out, such as facial hair. It looks very realistic. Assassin's Creed has always been one of the leaders in video game graphics, alongside other companies like Square-Enix, and it shows in Rogue. The UI seems a bit more cleaned up than in previous titles, and the map is very clear and expansive.\n\nSome of the best looking moments are when you are sailing the high seas. Whether in the frozen northern areas or the warmer climates, the water looks absolutely stunning. Your ship also behaves on the waves as real ships do. It's this attention to these small details that really set things apart from others.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe soundtrack is rather good. The main theme of Rogue, featured on the title screen and in a very few cutscenes, has some amazing yet haunting vocals, and some other influences.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmlCudR3JPk\n\nSound effects are great. Gunshots sound authentic, and sound true to 18th century weaponry. Sword clashes are awesome, as well as cannonfire from your ship. Nothing is really out of place, and sound great.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI had no issues whatsoever with Rogue. 60 FPS at all times, no lag or stuttering. PC Specs on my profile. The game didn't crash, ever, and while it does require Uplay, I barely noticed it at all. Once I activated the game on Uplay, the only time I ever saw it even existed was for a few brief seconds as the game launched.\n\nI highly recommend playing with a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls work, and are alright to use, but I feel a controller is the way to go. The game just feels better this way. The default control scheme was perfect. I didn't have to make any changes at all, as the defaults were comfortable and easy to remember.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nAssassin's Creed Rogue is probably the best game in the series thus far. Offering a viewpoint from the Templars on the opposing side of the war, it shows us a great story viewed through the eyes of a very likeable character. Fun new weapons/tools, improved ship handling and mechanics, coupled with tons of things to do and collect make Rogue a great addition to your Steam (and Uplay) library. The only downside is that the story is rather short. It only took me about 10 hours to complete all the story missions. However there are enough side missions and objectives, as well as collectibles, to keep you playing for upwards of 40-50 hours.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/YKRRjMQ0YH4\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighl Recommended\nBe sure to check out and follow Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 12, 2015","true","25.3"," 623 of 668 people (93%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","93","623","668","29","12"

If you have any questions about running the port, I can't answer them!\n\nIf Rogue is the Ubifuture, then it is an ubifuture I want to ubilive in.\n\nAssassins Creed Rogue was the little brother of Unity, both releasing on the same day. For reasons unknown (They're totally known) Ubisoft delayed Rogue for Pc by like 5 months. A bold move that paid off.\n\nMy machine is poop garbage. GT 640, i3. Turrible. Black Flag at 20 FPS. I had no hopes for Rogue, but damnit, it proved me wrong. 60 steady fps on medium settings, it really never dipped at all. The game looks the same as Black Flag, but it isn't badly ported.\n\nThe story of Rogue is a tale of tragedy. We follow Shay Patrick Cormac, Assassin and five time winer of the coveted, 'Most Irish Name' award. Cormac is guided by Achilles, Connor's angry black mentor from Assassins Creed 3. After it turns out that Achilles is literally black Hitler, Cormac runs away and is adopted by the Templars. Now he  is quite angry, and wants to assassinate his former assassin brothers, in a cruel twist of fate. The story will finally wrap up the Kenway saga. It will Link Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag, Unity, and even WATCH_DOGS.\n\nThe gameplay is like Black Flag, with a little bit of Black Flag thrown in. You sail your boat, burning boats and doing pirate things. (You're not a pirate.) It also has a bit of AC3 in it, with a frontier styled map. There are also a TON of collectibles. I love collecting things. And stuff, can't forget stuff. I've spent at least 20 hours just collecting and admiring the scenery. For a game set in such a horrible era like the 7 year's war, it sure is damn pretty.\n\nThe music is a a mix of all the previous AC themes put together in beautiful Frankenstein harmony. The main theme consists of Ezio's Family, with a bit of AC4 and AC3 thrown in. It's to symbolize that this is the end of the previous gen of Assassins Creed, and a new, buggier generation has been birthed.\n\nThe bad parts about Rogue is the fact that it is about 8 hours long if you do nothing but the story. There are bugs that have transfered over from Black Flag that they never fixed. Most (Like 95%) of Cormac's animations are borrowed directly from Edward Kenway, and the new ones are very stiff and awkward looking.\n\nRogue has become one of my favourite PC games by Ubisoft in recent years, especially since it's not a horrible monstrosity.","March 12, 2015","true","46.3"," 483 of 525 people (92%) found this review helpful 190 people found this review funny","92","483","525","190","11"

Do not issue a bad rating on the merits of you entering in the franchise. Sorry, friend, this review is not for you.\n\nThis game can also be described as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag 1.5. When I finished, I almost wondered why the Installation didn't come with patch notes instead of a features description. Don't get me wrong, it's good, bloody damn good, but read this for a minute to understand why.\n\nThe Good "Patch Changes"\n\n- The new Air Rifle is amazing, and doesn't look as, and I hesitate to use the word here, racist or shoe-horned as a bow and a blowpipe. It provides a lore-friendly way of dispatching your foes as well as later receiving a Grenade launcher, which allows you to stun, berserk or just explode a large group of enemies. It opens tactical opportunities to spark a large group of enemies to berserk instead of just one.\n\n- The Outfit selection takes a big dump on the "15 colours of robes & hoods" thing and presents you for once with varied outfits that don't require dlc. I completed the game in the uniform of a Royal Navy Captain.\n\n- The Environment is much more varied. The River Valley is - as the name would suggest - a large map of rivers where you can encounter medium-sized ships and set up clever ambushes. The Ocean map is much wider and you can capture Man'o'War ships there.\n\n- You are a templar now, which means the United Kingdom won't bother you anymore, unless you want to, atleast in the cities. backstab, shoot and murder to your hearts content!\n\n- You can now murder civilians in a lore-friendly way. Instead of arbitrarily getting de-synched at the third mishap like a kindergarten boy being sent home because he threw gobs of sand around, you will now have tough-as-♥♥♥♥e bounty hunters sent after you. they will kill you unless you are smart and shoot them first. But it's lore-friendly and more immersive that way.\n\n- Say goodbye to the always-on, required-to-progress Kenway's Fleet! That's right, the Fleet now is entirely offline, and gives you not only junk househlod decorations but also some very nifty Items and beautiful cosmetics. Also, it's optional, so if you are not interested in the Naval Campaign, good riddance for you, but it will generally give you money, as it works on the ingame currency now, the pound, instead of the arbitrary-a*s "Gems" that were ripe for mobile mini-transactions from the word go.\n\n- New York makes its return from AC3. I find it to be the more ugly of the two cities, boston was always more to my liking, but they managed to spice the city up by restoring the burned-down districts and adding a less depressive day-night cycle. Since I played AC3 the colour orange gives me spontaneous cataract!\n\n- Getting boarded is fun. It eventually ends like the other boardings, you can only be boarded by assassin brigs and pirate-hunters and you might lose up to 7 crewmen, but it's fun.\n\n- The Elite Upgrades for your ship are not buried in some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ places that you will only visit once for the entire game\n\n- You now have frequent ammunition chests in the cities to refill your special ammunition for free. It gives a shoddy amount of bullets, but I'll get to that eventually.\n\n- The sailors of the Morrigan look like Royal Navy sailors. BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES!\nThe bad changes... and yes, there are some.\n\n- When you capture an enemy fortress, your boarding crew does not follow you on land, which is sad. I liked the atmospheric fortress battles even though the teleporting ship crew in ACIVBF incited philosophical discourse with other players/co-workers at the water dispenser.\n\n- The highest-Level set of pistols and the only pair of the main game that kills grenadiers/captains/assassins in one shot is locked behind a challenge. Alternatively, you can buy the DLC and aquire the Russian Flintlock pistols. It's just a scheme to funnel more games into buying the DLC.\n\n- Shay, the Protagonist, is a dunce at looting conventional bullets from corpses. While Edward could restock himself twice over by just stabbing some guards in the middle of the street, Mr. Cormac needs his reading glasses whiped for him because he only loots one or two cartridges off a rifleman. This is a big deal, because in the marine sessions, assassins hunts and time-based objectives as well as the main missions, you will be heavily relying on your pistols. Unless, of course, you are sneaky. Which I ain't.\n\n- Ammunition does not refill when you get onto your ships. They really don't have a crew chest where I could "borrow" some of these precious blackpowder lifesavers? REALLY? Edward Kenways crew was cool about that. meh.\n\n- The story is a bit short for my taste, but that is only because they had to develop this game alongside the *spontaneous irony* colossus of cultural value and perfection *irony end, cough cough* that was Assassin's Creed: Unity.\n\n-IN SHORT-\nIf you couldn't already guess, I am going to recommend this game, because my complaints are all tiny things.\n\nSo, that's about all I got so far. I might add more grins or gripes in the future. Keep the discussion in the comments civilized. And have fun if you decide to buy! I guarantee you almost certainly will.","March 15, 2015","true","39.3"," 348 of 386 people (90%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","90","348","386","57","6"

They took everything great from Black Flag and improved on it. The story was so perfect that I didn't care it was a couple sequences short. I wish it kept going but it was so perfectly laid out I didn't mind so much. We finally got a game with the assassin's being our enemy and they executed it flawlessly. The signature moves were used against you as well as you performing them. Shay is a great protagonist, his decisions are well thought through and makes sense why he would go "Rogue". Rogue ties in with  Unity, AC3 / and Black Flag perfectly while answering and also revealing so much more to the assassin creed universe. This game had all the elements to be a masterpiece and it succeeded. Worth every penny.

It runs off AC4's engine and reuses most of the same assets. It's a very overlooked and underrated game that was overshadowed by it's inferior brother Assassin's Creed Unity. The game serves as a prequel to Assassin's Creed 3 and a sequel to Black Flag, with character appearances from both games.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed Rogue you play as Shay Cormac. An Assassin who becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood and joins the Templars. The storytelling in AC: Rogue is the biggest thing the game does well. The Templars in AC: Rogue are portrayed as stalward defenders of peace and order, wheras the Assassin's are well intentioned extremists who want freedom by any means necessary. This game actually started to make me view the actions you undertook in previous games in a completely different light. The Assassin's are portrayed largely as criminals who Shay tasks himself with destroying. It feels like a much more politically Conservative game as a result. You're not a revolutionary overthrowing a despot. You play as a man who wants to protect the things he cares about. This all feels very fresh and makes the game stand out to me compared to other games in the series. It's also one of the few games in the series where the protagonist's default outfit lacks a hood.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it fundamentally is the same as Black Flag. With a few changes here and there. They replaced Assassination missions with Interception missions, where you prevent assassinations. They also introduced enemies called Stalkers. Who hide in areas like haystacks and bushes similar to the player and abush you. Using similar tactics that you have employed in previous games. You also explore rivers and valleys in the Northern Atlantic as opposed to an ocean in the Carribean, so the game does have a different aesthetic style.\n\nNow while I do like Rogue and do recommend the game, it's not perfect. The game is shorter than both Black Flag and AC3. And while I did enjoy the storyline it took a lot of time to really get interesting once you became a templar. The general gameplay also felt far too much like a stand-alone expansion pack to Black Flag. It feels too stuck in Black Flag's shadow and it's probably the biggest reason I cannot recommend this game at full price. If you didn't like AC4 then you also will not like this game either because of how similar it is.\n\nThe best thing I can really say about Rogue is it did what it set out to do very well. I was worried that this was another example of a game with missed potential, and I'm glad to say I was completely wrong.","October 12, 2015","true","17.3"," 136 of 152 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","136","152","6","9"

It NEVER crashed, NEVER stuttered, NEVER glitched and NEVER dropped frames. I actually believe that it is the most solid and technically sound game in the franchise at this point. It appears to be built upon the same engine as Black Flag, but unlike BF it never felt like it was ready to break apart at any second. It is incredibly refined and looks great.\n\nI am a sucker for stories like this but I was hooked immediatly. It isn't exposition driven and as a result you come to share an empathy with Shay as events unfold. You see things from his point of view (In this case from the side of the templars) and it makes him very relatable as his actions seem JUSTIFIED. I dig it. ;)\n\nIf I had to pick a fault with the game, it would be that with the franchise itself. Simply put AC games are getting HUGE in terms of the game world and to prolong the experience; devs are craming in as many collectables as possible. I understand the reasons behind it (open world, forces exploration ect...) but it is just at the point where it has NOTHING to do with the story and is simply distracting. It is beyond filler content and if they could tone it down somewhat or give me a reason to 100% everything, I feel Ubisoft should go for it!\n\nDo I reccommend this game? Yes. A huge resounding yes. It is pretty, technically sound and very enjoyable. In fact, the church mission in Lisbon delivered probably my favourite assassins creed experience to date!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/311560/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Assassin’s Creed Rogue ties up the America Saga, rounding out what happened between Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed III. The story follows Shay Patrick Cormack as he begins his stabbing journey as an Assassin, working together with the likes of Adewale and Achilles. Shay is a much more cynical character than previous assassins, questioning the value of the brotherhood’s actions and even having personality clashes with some high ranking members.\n\nAfter an event that leads to the death of innocents, Shay renounces the assassins, going rogue and eventually joining up with Templars, including Haytham Kenway. There are references to Haytham’s father, as well as his son, Connor, and it helps to show the characters in a new light. Just as many of us have questioned the motives behind and implications for actions taken in Assassin’s Creed games, these characters are the most insightful and interesting – offering deeper questions while still retaining enough personality to avoid it becoming a morality quest like Assassin’s Creed III.\n\nWithout giving any spoilers, it is this story and the characters within it that make the game so worthwhile; these aspects elevate the experience to new heights, giving the franchise something that it so desperately needed – believable characters who are more than mindless killers. The ending of the game is superbly executed, perfectly setting the scene for Assassin’s Creed Unity and offering an ending that has stuck with me long after the credits finished rolling.\n\nBut it’s not just the story or characters that show Ubisoft’s learning curve in this iteration of Assassin’s Creed. The gameplay is also excellent, with tons to do in a much more varied way. By combining the sailing and exploration of tiny ports with a sprawling rendition of New York, players get the best of both an urban and rural experience. There are a variety of areas to capture, from forts and gang hideouts to settlements and warehouses. Resources can be used to upgrade your ship, and there is even an entire optional strategy game in the form of a naval campaign with ships under your control. There are tons of collectibles ranging from hidden treasures and parkour high points to new shanties and secret puzzles.\n\nThese innovations are best exemplified by the hunting of assassins. Once you go rogue, you will notice that assassin’s are amazing at hiding and stabbing you from out of nowhere. Shay needs to use eagle vision to find these stealthy killers; assassination missions now include defending the target from assassins hidden throughout the map. These battles aren’t easy, but they are incredibly rewarding when you feel like the best sneaky stabber of the bunch.\n\nCombat is still the same, unfortunately. I still find this one of the greatest let downs of the Assassin’s Creed franchise – combat becomes a boring combination of waiting for attacks, countering, and occasionally kicking a heavy guy first so I can break his guard before killing him. It’s all very uninspired and feels particularly clunky after playing similar games that execute this gameplay aspect so well.\n\nAnother element that seems to fall short is the parkour. While much of it is excellent and there is nothing like running across New York rooftops or synchronizing an area from the top of a shipwreck, the contextual movements can often feel sluggish or lead to unintended actions. I had numerous encounters where I wished to jump across to a tree branch in order to assassinate a target only to jump right in front of the target instead. Not ideal.\n\nA final point of criticism would be the loading times. It is very clear that this game is being played on old generation consoles – loading times when moving from one area to the next, or between sequences, could feel long. While this was to be expected, it got rather frustrating after desynchronizing from a mission only to have to wait in order to try again.\n\nIt’s understandable why loading times are so long, though – the environments are truly massive. Each area feels huge, with tons to do, explore and discover. Exploration is further rewarded by offering unique upgrades through blueprints that can only be found in obscure areas. Want the best possible cannon or mortar for your ship, you will need to unearth the plans in a remote area. Beyond simple exploration, there are forts to take over and settlements to claim, each with unique victory parameters. Add to that convoys to rob and man o’ wars to conquer and the game’s scale seems to just keep growing.\n\nEach area is also incredibly well rendered. Sure, it’s still clearly old generation – foliage doesn’t look right up close and shadows on faces look like blurry messes, but the actual set pieces and textures are excellent, making the most of the older console’s power. There are some stunning visuals, particularly when sailing towards the Northern Lights or even into a blizzard. The audio is similarly lovingly created, from a dynamic sound track to some excellent voice talent. From Shay’s Irish accent to James Cook’s Scottish brogue, each character offers emotional and compelling performances.\n\nThe controls are fairly familiar now, having played Assassin’s Creed games in this form for a while. New weaponry is fun to experiment with, although I still found myself using the usual tactics that I’ve used in previous titles. That said, when I did mix it up with some of the new toys, I found that I had a lot more fun and a much more varied experience.\n\nThe out-of-Animus experience is also fun, although less light-hearted than Black Flag’s. Again, you play as an employee of Abstergo Entertainment, but from the start you are more aware of some conspiracies at play. While wandering the halls collecting abandoned tablets and hacking other people’s computer terminals, Ubisoft has filled the present day experience with tons of Easter Eggs, nods to gaming industry controversies and clues to future projects. It’s never heavy handed, though, and if you want to completely ignore it, time spent out of the Animus will be limited so that you can jump straight back into the parts of the game that you enjoy.\n\nUbisoft has a notorious record for launching below par PC ports, and you wouldn’t have to look further than Assassin’s Creed Unity or Watch_Dogs for proof. Assassin’s Creed Rogue is running on the same Anvil engine that powered Black Flag, and it seems like that’s the reason for it’s stable, uncompressed performance on PC. Ubisoft have launched two games with the engine on PC already, so I assume they’ve learnt what works, and what doesn’t\n\nAssassin's Creed: Rogue is a great ending to the American saga of the franchise, and a great game in its own right. Ubisoft has also done a fine job with the PC port, making it an easy recommendation to any fan.","November 30, 2015","true","94.1"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","74","83","3","0"

I am playing this on a laptop with a GeForce 860M and I am maintaining a very steady 60fps on High/meduim graphics with 1080 resolution. As of now the story is pretty great, especially if you played the other AC games. There are cameos of a bunch of old characters like Adewale and Achilles. So far, the game is shaping up to be pretty awesome. So, if you like AC games (especially AC 4- Black Flag), then you shoud definately keep your eye on this game. (It shows promise for better obtimization from Ubisoft in the future. . . hopefully lol)\n\nEdit:\nUpon playing more of Rogue I have come across a few issues that I think I should address. All of these have only happened once, so don't panic. I got stuck in a loading screen when transitioning between to areas (it just did not finish loading - it sounded like it did but I had to restart the game to fix it). I also loaded in once and could not move. This one might just be a problem with my laptop, but if not I thought I should mention it.\nNevertheless, the story is even more intriguing as it progresses and the gameplay, though mostly the same as Black Flag's, has its own elements that make it stand out as its own game (i.e. avoiding assassins trying to assassinate you, etc...)\n\nEdit:\nI just wanted to mention that I did bring my graphics up a bit and I still maintain about 60 fps (once in a while it drops to 50, but that is during really intense battles). But there was one time during the story when I was taking down a man-o-war that my fps dropped to like 35ish, not unplayable but definately noticeable. Besides this, the story is coming along nicely, and I am curious to see how it will end.\n\nStory Completion:\nI have to say that this is an overall good game. I did experience a few bugs, all of which are mentioned above, but only a few. The story did feel a little on the short side compared to Black Flag, but it was still a decent length (about 9ish hours I'd say). Shay is a cool character and this game really ties all of the other ones together (even Liberation). It is fun and a great addition to the AC series.","March 9, 2015","true","9.5"," 210 of 285 people (74%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","74","210","285","18","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rileydelacroix/recommended/311560/","rileydelacroix","Riley de la Croix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rileydelacroix/","131 products in account","I'm not going to tell you that Assassin's Creed: Rogue is a good game. Since AC:3 it's my firm belief that Ubisoft has gotten out of touch with what makes Assassin's Creed such a great francise. Gone are the days of mystery and intrigue, of skillful assassinations and deep character development. In my opinion AC:1 was an absolute masterpiece, with AC: Revelations finishing off Ezio's story perfectly. Since then Assassin's Creed's quality as a series has diminished. Technologically the Assassin's Creed series has flourished, with the world and people becoming much more beautiful. However the story has fallen flat, the idea of 'genetic memories' and Abstergo is being stretched thin beyond its limits. We all thought after Ezio we would finally see the modern day AC game, but that does not seem to be within Ubisofts sights. They wish to continue milking the series with progressively worse off games. Unity was a turning point for Ubisoft. If they mess up the next game, thats it for the series in my eyes.\n\nAll of this aside, AC: Rogue does make me happy. It may not be technologically the best AC game, with last gen graphics and none of the improvements that AC: Unity recieved (Although this is more of a blessing considering how shoddy Unity's engine was) However AC: Rogue story once again makes me giddy to play the game, to push forward with the new character, Shay Cormac, my new favorite protaganist. He is the first Assassin to become more self aware since Altaiir, and see that the world is not so black and white, Templars and Assassins. After seeing the darkness and ignorance of Assassin's he goes off on his own, to seek his own path. This leads him to become Templar, and therefore fufill his wish to help the world and atone for his sins.\n\nCormac is easily one of the best protaganist since Ezio, with an amazing voice actor and real emotions and a true goal. Not only that, but he is also the most well-equipped of the protaganists. Not since Ezio has an assassin had so much gear to choose from. This makes playing as Cormac exciting to play both as a stealth character and a fighter.\n\nThe game also loses out on having Assassin minions but it gains the fresh mechanic of constantly being hunted by Assassins, which you must dispatch.\n\nIs Assassin's Creed Rogue a good game? That you will have to decide for yourself. As a whole it is one of my favorite in the series, with the best leading character, the biggest arsenal, fully realized naval warefare, new mechanics, and the chance to be a Templar. The story is short but intense, it took me 15 hours to complete with slight deviation, and I have barely scratched the surface with extra content, as usual AC games are satisfying to complete 100%.\n\nI have changed sides. The Templars are humanities salvation. See the world through Shay Patrick Cormac's eyes and decide for yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/311560/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Honestly, using AC III + IV + icebergs to sum up Rogue is not patronising, at all. Alternatively, as many have already put it in various reviews, Black Flag 1.5 is also a good alternative name for this entry of the Assassin's Creed series. Or, the way I call it, it is Black Flag Winter Edition which should be considered an expansion - if you remember this fancy word from before the introduction of DLCs and Season Passes. An expansion pack always upped the ante of the original game by adding new stuff and a bit of a higher difficulty level but - ultimately - a shorter story to complete.\n\nNow, the above means that if you really want to play something new - i.e. have the next generation Assassin's Creed experience - you have to skip this one and move to Unity where you have the next-gen graphics and the new characteristics such as new gameplay elements and a completely new storyline in a new setting. However, do bear in mind that if you do so, you'll leave two of the greatest assets of the AC series (so far) behind:\n\n1) a memorable protagonist who - unlike his predecessors before - joins the templars and kills assassins\n2) the naval combat that was first introduced in AC III but we saw its full potential only in Black Flag\n\nNow, Shay Cormac's story is - for me - very interesting from start to finish. The reason why he leaves the assassins and joins the templars made sense and I found it intriguing. And no, he doesn't just make up his mind and by joining the templars does not start desperately searching for his old pals from the brotherhood to eliminate them once and for all. It is a little bit more complicated than that - all the more reason to believe the assassins' and templars' ongoing (never-ending) conflict cannot be described as the story of Good vs Evil, Yin and Yang, etc. Shay's story is worth seeing it through till the very end.\n\nGameplay-wise, at one point when you turn and join the templars strolling in various settlements becomes even more exciting - you are hunted by assassins! The hay cart, for instance, your favourite spot for hiding, can now be occupied by assassins who are constantly looking for hurting you. You will not get desynced immediately if you fail to notice them in time but their one stab can significantly reduce your health. Your Eagle Vision helps you notice them from afar and when the vision is turned on you have the same compass helping you locate them than the one you used in the competitive multiplayer mode (which is now completely missing from this instalment).\n\nToo bad the game is ridiculously easy this time. With all the easy counter system and the sleeping / berserk darts it was already very easy, however, Shay now is in possession of a grenade launcher. While two of its firing modes basically mean the same sleeping / berserk dart solution (but with area effect), an exploding grenade as the last resort is also available for you. AC couldn't have gotten any more steampunk, right?\n\nThere's also an interesting activity / side mission type labelled assassin interception: you first find their target then within the allotted time you need to find all assassins. This search mainly goes for the bonus - if you are unsuccessful the would-be victim will start their walk towards their destination and while along the way you can still protect the person - you'll just have a more challenging time.\n\nThe rest is pretty much the same. In fact, the creators desperately tried to introduce new stuff such as the destructible icebergs during naval battles that can harm other (mainly smaller) ships. Or the new narwal whale whose tusk is a must to craft some pretty nifty outfits / upgrades to your inventory. Since the North Atlantic map is constantly giving you the winter season it's better to remember not to swim for long as Shay can freeze to death! Also, the penguin effect looks great!\n\nAbout maps: comparing the game to AC III is obvious once Shay sets foot in New York. And while we - again - have two maps with lots of water only one of them focuses on the ocean. The so-called River Valley has - well - a valley with long canals and many small settlements and the area is full of hills and mountains.\n\nSo, is Rogue worth the purchase?\n\n+++ Yes, 3 new maps accompanied by a new story and so far - arguably - with the most interesting protagonist this time.\n+++ Once again the open world is quite big with dozens of collectible items and to have everything found and obtain almost all achievements it took me 60 hours. Not bad for an "expansion", right?\n+++ It nicely connects some dots - references can be found to AC III, IV as well as for Unity.\n\nSo, no negatives then? A must-have in the franchise?\n\n--- While Shay's story feels unique it is much shorter. We have half of the memory sequences now compared to previous entries in the series. Make no mistake the game has its applicable pace to tell the story (not rushed, at all) but since there are so many collectibles I would have expected the same amount of main missions, too, for accompaniment purposes.\n--- There's nothing really new here beside the story. Some new side missions / activities and what the winter season can add to the gameplay. It is not necessarily bad but since everything is more of the same the annoying stuff remains, too: the occasionally annoying target selection during naval battles (when you board a ship) and the too easy gameplay - there's next to no challenge once Shay gets his hands on the grenade launcher.\n\nRogue is a must have for all AC fans! The rest of you can just decide based on above review or by reading some more - after all, while I consider this more of an expansion its price tag could be a bit lower due to the same.","January 19","true","61.5"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","2"

This game is the ultimate branch between these games, with a young Achillies from AC 3, and old Adewale from AC 4, and a special apperance from Arno's father, who is in Unity.\n6:Great graphics, Ubisoft really pulled off the rugged north of Vinland and the Gulf of St.Lawrence\n7:Playes very well into the actual historical events of the 7 years war (or the French and Indian war here in Merica), you see many prominant figures, including James Cook, George Washington and more.\n\nCons:\n1:New York from AC 3 is ported straight over, and shows the lack of dev time avalible due to Unity.\n2:Short, if I had not 100% the game, I could have done the main story in about 6 hours.\n3:Characters needed more time, Characters you meet who end up dying, you are supposed to feel somthing, but you met most of them for five minutes at the beggining of the game, and then again at the end.\n4:The switch to Templar is way to fast, Shay goes from a Assassin to Templar in the first act of the game, so about 1 hour. I think he should have been with the creed a bit more to show why he left and to develop the other assasins.\n5:Collectibles, it wouldn't be an Ubisoft game without hundreds of random collectibles all over the map for some stupid outfit you will never wear.\n6:The hacking mini game in the real world, very tedious and boringly easy, or very hard.\n\nOverall:\nA good game that could have been better, if given more dev time. If Ubisoft hadn't put out two AC games in one year and just focused on Rogue then Unity, most of my cons would have been addressed. I would say pick it up if you enjoy AC games, the naval combat of AC 4 or 3, or want to see how a developer can pull of the frozen north well. Otherwise, pick this game up on sale.\n","April 28","true","44.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

The characters are so fresh and interesting and Shay is portrayed really well so far. I have now played 4.2 hours an definetely feel that sam addicting vibe I had from ACIV:\n\nGameplayThe mechanics are familiar to anyone who played Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. The best way to describe it it going in methodical, but also quick so as to get 100% on missions. So far only playing as an assassin is identical to Edward Kenway in Black Flag as you start off with dual weapons, a sword and knife, but new animations are nice and its cool to see Shay fight with the smaller weapon. The parkour/movement is next to perfect as you'll occassionally wonder if you can climb some rocks or materials or simply take a few tries to climb trees or builidings. The naval battles come back again and are as fun as ever with the 4 direction shooting system being directly taken from Black Flag, which I thought did much better than Assassin's Creed III. Long story short: If you loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag gameplay combt and movement wise, you'll love this game as well\nUpdate of 4.7 hours played The air rifle is pretty hany and I feel really cool to have. I just started getting into the Assassin hunting mechanics which are actually really fun. If you played the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer portion, you will feel at home as you have a compass whenever you are going up against assassins in which the compass will start to fill up whenevr you are close to an Assassin. You also however can be stalked by the assassins and actually do have to pay attention more than usual.\n\nGraphicsSo if you read in the community hub, you can see that a lot of people are reporting on great optimization. That may or may not be true however. This game looks nice but is hardly current gen graphics. The graphics are definitely not as high quality as Black Flag and may be in between or on par with Assassin's Creed III. The hair and textures do not look very realistic at all and detract if you look long enough at them, although you really only notice this during cutscenes. Another major complaint is the lack of antialiasing options as Ubisoft only gave FXAA, despite having MSAA and TXAA in both Assassin's Creed Unity and in Black Flag. While the game does run nicely, I would appreciate it if I could make lines less jaggy with better AA tools. Character Animations are smooth and cool to watch as you get to watch and appreciate how Assassins move and kill in this game more than before. Another big selling point about this game is again how little hardware it takes to run as I can max it out on my laptop which as an intel i7-4710hq @ 2.5ghz (3.5 turboboost) and an GTX 860m 2gb graphics card.\n\nSoundA great addition to the game is the music, as I loved Black Flag and Assassin's Creed II's soundtracks. The only bad thing I've heard music wise is just recycled sea shanties from Black Flag. I found it so great that they made a new updated version of the Assassin's Creed II song "Ezio's Family" (btw one of my fav songs from that game) for the title sreens and it sounds great. I also just like listening to the background music while playing, osmething I did not really remember or enjoy from both Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed III.\n\nVerdict Overall I would recommend getting this game for now as it definitely is polished for PC and I have had no bugs yet. The voice acting is great and the characters aren't simply cutouts or meaningless cameos. The gameplay is as tight and fluid as ACIV but for sure not as pretty looking as ACIV. You also should not have any trouble running this game as it works well and is easily maxed.\nUpdate of 4.2 hours played I just finished the assassin part of th story and wow, it was amazing. I felt real emotion and understanding towards Shay and really am excited for my days as a Templar.","March 9, 2015","true","27.0"," 91 of 145 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","91","145","9","4"

While the space angel thing was toned down once again (Thank You!), it was still a big thing in the end, just like Black Flag, and especially also when you were suddenly transported back to Abstergo HQ in Canada where you then lost the ability to move faster than a snails pace. Going by what Unity has shown, this will hopefully be the last time we are seeing the present day setting and thank the higher powers for that.\n\nThe main mission is considerably shorter than both Black Flag and Unity, but there are a lot of settlements and places to explore on the two maps used for sailing.\n\nHere is a list of the elements re-used from the earlier games:\nAC3’s New York location and hunting\nBlack Flag’s sailing, trading mini game and current day part/location\nFreedom Cry’s restocking warehouses and POW/Slave ship battles\nUnity’s alternate location scenes (Paris in lo-def)\nLiberation HD’s length of main storyA few good and bad points:\n+ Carry and hide bodies functionality is back\n+ Settlements, warehouses and what have you on the River/Sea maps are great side missions\n+ Grenade launcher is a fun weapon\n\n- Too many timer based missions\n- Hunting is 99% filler as most high level animals are only available at 1 or 2 locations, and only show up one at a time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHyperion1/recommended/311560/","SourHyperion1","The Spanish Inquisition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHyperion1/","282 products in account","Overall, Assassin's Creed Rogue shines bright out of the post-Desmond AC games. A combination of excellent story, the return of well proven game mechanics as well as Black Flag's incredibly successful naval combat, and a brilliant soundtrack produce a brilliant secondary title that ties together the events of ACIII-AC Unity.\n\nStory: The story focuses around Assassin turned Templar Shay Cormac. The length of the story is not nearly that of other AC titles, but is far more rewarding. Admittably, I wish they'd spent more time building an attachment to every major Assassin, but the manner in which the story shows Shay's motivation for turning allows the moments when you do have to kill an Assassin to be enjoyable. There are parts where it seemed to run on a bit, I was not nearly as engaged in naval gameplay in this as I was in Black Flag thus those sections seemed far more irritating for me. The out-of-Animus story once again takes place in Abstergo Entertainment where you will intermittently be interrupted by Templar Agents to fix a server. Not the best, but it's better than Unity's.\n\nGameplay: Black Flag+Revelations+ACII. The game included the return of the zip line (sadly no hook blade), a new "lift", and the return of managing the city's economy. Of course there was Black Flag's naval combat and the movement felt identical to Black Flag. The gameplay of the ground missions reminded me most of ACII, though, possibly from the soundtrack.\n\nGraphics: Do not expect a massive improvement on Black Flag. There are areas where the game looks very nice, but other areas, such as the city you visit in the last memory, do not shine as much. Overall it is pleasant to look at, I ran it on my machine (i7, GT760, 8 gb RAM) very smoothly on max settings.\n\nOverall: I have to be fair because I was extremely disappointed in Far Cry 4 because it was just too similar to Far Cry 3. Rogue is very similar to Black Flag, but I do not share that disappointment with Rogue. While New York definitely gives off a more tropical vibe than ACIII, the game stands strong on its own. It is a fairly big world to explore that definitely looks dated when compared to titles that were not hindered by the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but still looks remarkable in certain areas. The story, if nothing else, is what you absolutely need to experience. It is a refreshing look at both orders that might turn your opinion slightly, but more importantly, it sews together the last several AC titles.","April 22, 2015","true","41.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/311560/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","Intial ThoughtsI was a little apprehensive in buying this game after AC Unity.  I wanted to skip this title because of the poor state of Unity in general upon release, but I am a fan of the series and so I blindly pre-ordered it taking yet another risk.  I can safely say this game so far is very well done.\n\nGraphicsThe frame rate seems smooth and although I expected the graphics to look no better than Black Flag, being on the same engine, I have to say the games looks better in almost every respect.  It is no AC Unity by any means, but the anniemations, physics, and details are pushed further than Black Flag with improved frame rate.  AC Rogue runs great. It is obvious the extra six months in developement for PC was worth the wait.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is smooth and what you would expect from AC.  The game plays just like AC Black Flag. I am not saying this game is without glitches, but I have not experienced any crashes at all.  I have however jumped out of trees and landed under part of the map structure like a rock twice.  Porting out to another area solves the problem, but remains an inconvenience. I also dislike the camera view that oddly puts me out of combat at times and I must center my view to correct it.\n\nStoryThe story line is impressive and sets the transition for you to become a templar. I never thought Unbisoft would pull this story off so well after seven years of killing templars (release of Assassin's Creed 2007).  I found the story itself a little lacking in that it seemed rushed at times or like a book that has had several chapters cut out to meet a page limit. But overall, the story does what it is ment to do and it does it well. Spoiler alert, if you have played AC III, you may have some mixed feeling about this story line.\n\nConclusionIf you have played earlier Assassin's Creed games, specifically Black Flag, you will feel right at home.  If you have only played Unity, it is a step down in just about every respect except the bugs and lack of polish found with Unity's release.  AC Rogue is designed on a dated engine for last gen consoles but it truely offers one of the best AC experiences to date.  I honestly feel Ubisoft should have pushed Unity back another six months to a year and completed the release on Rogue on all platforms rather than holding Rogue back for PC only to push Unity for next gen.  Unity was obviously not ready for release on any platform, especially PC while Rogue clearly is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527093179","March 11, 2015","true","78.3"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","26","35","2","0"

He feels guilt for killing people unnecessarily. He actually says no to those in charge because of morality. He feels like a human being. He gets sad. He gets angry. He feels guilt. He feels sympathy. He feels like a real person and the story, despite it being only about 6 hours, expands on that and throws you into this emotional twist of a game game that is his struggle to find truth and to seek his personal redemption. It is different from the other Assassin’s Creed story while, yes, it has the typically Assassin’s Creed revenge aspect, it is not focused around it like the other Assassin’s Creed games are. It is one of the best stories in the Assassin’s Creed franchise.\n\nAdd that ontop of the beautiful open world where this time, the world actually encourages you to explore it. You feel the need as the world, whether it be the Arctic or River Valley (or the recycled New York city which is done better here than Assassin’s Creed III, don’t get me wrong, I just expect Assassin’s Creed games not to recycle main locations), it feels fresh and immersive. I spent a good 10 to 15 hours just exploring the River Valley and the Arctic and loved every moment of it!\n\nAnd to visit the city of Halifax was one of my favourite things! I have been there in real life but to see Ubisoft’s historical version of it was beautiful and immersive and I loved it!.\n\nOverall, you have to give this game a try. I spent almost a good 30 hours on it and most of it was exploring the beautiful open world. The only downside, the story is short, 6 hours for me and I took my time. Shorter if you rush it.","April 9, 2015","true","31.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Although being a gorgeous piece of eye candy to look at, nothing is new under the sun in the North Atlantic.

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just gets old. A few really well done set pieces tie together this game, clearly designed with a "drag and drop" method of level design.

Even if it sometimes feels like it plays like AC Black flag 1.5! It has all the good bits of Black Flag with extra stuff and a new well put together story line.\n\nOnce again it has the same interface with the future that Black Flag had. Where you are a non seen, non talking minion who goes round hacking and doing shenanigans before going back to the game of the past. I kind of like that style. It makes you feel like the modern protagonist is actually you.\n\nThe game is fun and the new character is kind of cool, especially once he leaves the Assassins. In my opinion he was a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as an assassin. As a Templar he is awesome though, I found I liked the character even though I still dislike the Templars. The actual past story I feel flows together well, and is well written. I was a bit sceptical of his leaving the Assassins but it fits in at the end. Also it is nice to see things from the Templars eyes. It adds a perspective that is nice. I am not spoiling the game by telling you that this is the story of a renegade Assassin.\n\nThe best bit is when it fills in story blanks from other AC games in my opinion. This game has a few of those. Also this game nicely ties things together. The history of the world and the conflict of the Assassins versus the Templars interlink.

But I can't agree to that. His judgement is emotional. His inner doubts aren't revealed sufficiently. And the whole transition from an assassin to a templar feels rather rushed. I'd say Shay has the personality of a teenager and his worldview is rather naive. His willingness to do good and sense of fairness are admirable, but it's about the only side of him that is portrayed. I can accept such a flat personality in a video game, but real people are more complicated.\n\nNevertheless, playing as a templar was a fresh breeze to the series. Especially, because having played all the previous titles, I've started to doubt the whole Assassin's cause. Only few people have the capacity to use their freedom wisely. Most people need guidance and control and the Templars offer just like that. Whether their methods are justifiable – that I doubt, but nonetheless.\n\nRogue story takes place between the events of the Black Flag and AC3. It ties together the characters of both previous titles: Edward Kenway, Haytham Kenway, Conor, Achilles Davenport and Adewale.\n\nThis is the last AC game created on AnvileNext engine and as such it works perfectly. You have all the usual AC stuff, but at its best. For example, I struggled with ship controls in Black Flag. I had problems with manouvering and the camera. But, in Rogue, it's very easy. I even took the Legenday ships down with no problem at all. Well, perhaps, this is partially explained by the fact that Morrigan is a sloop-of-war, but Jackdaw was a brig. Smaller size means greater manouverability. I felt that there are not enough dry-land areas in Black Flag and I grew tired of the huge emphasis on naval battles, whereas, in Rogue it's just the right balance. I really enjoyed exploration and taking down hostile settlements and forts.\n\nRogue has no multiplayer. And I really don't mind it. Who even plays AC MP? It's dull and gets boring soon. However, the MP's stalking and killing part was transfered to the SP and you fight AI stalkers instead of other players. I think they really overdid this, because even after taking down all the gang HQs and hostile settlements, there were stalkers everywhere. It's distracting and just too much. You can't get rid of them permanently.\n\nIf you buy all the DLCs, there's really a lot of weapons, outfits and collectibles you can obtain. They all are nice and cool. But I feel that the game was artificially made longer through these optional collectible and economical missions, hiding the fact that the main story is quite short. There are only six short sequences and few short present day tasks between them. I'd say, if you ignore the collectibles, forts and outposts, you can finish the game in about 10 hours or even less.\n\nAlso, with each new game released after AC3 it starts to feel more and more that Ubisoft just sticks to a certain recipe. It's, as if the market department is the one writing the stories and deciding which concepts to keep and which to introduce. Sadly, AC starts to feel like a generic experience.\n\nNevertheless, AC: Rogue is my second most favourite AC title so far. I really liked the gameplay. The story was good, too, although somewhat primitive and rushed.\n\nMy overall rating: 8.5/10","May 21","true","58.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You have to love "clearing" cities and other locations, as you will be doing this alot! I allso recomend going for the deluxe edition with the DLC packs as they do save you a lot of time and frustration. Allso adds a lot of options for making your ship and character more "personal". The game have the old mele-combat-system from "AC III", however you do get some awsome new wepons and the pistol setup from "AC 4". The controles are a bit different but you adapt quickly. And I will save the ship to ship combat for you to explore yourself. I personally love this and want a DLC that gives you the ability to have the "Jackdaw" in the harbor next to the "Morigan" just to change things up a bit. Allso a new seamap with much more shipwrecks ice and exploring type elements would be lovely, as that is exactly what this game is all about.\n\nThe storryline was not the best, but it worked. It was a short one though, need them to be longer next time. You sometimes become a bit bored of the main missons, however that is totaly fine because of all the exploring and sidequesting you can runn off and do :)\n\nOne more thing I like about this game is all the refferences to other AC games.\n\nI this game there is only one "proper" city. However, it fitts the bill perfectly for uss that lovet the "Ezio" series. Lots of small streets landmarks, tall and smal buildings, and perfect rooftops, no nocense! However I do still miss the by and refurnish part when it comes to stores and banks. There is one realy effective way to set your personal marking on the cities, towns and other locations, and it is a good one. But I would still realy love to have some more ways of doing this. Also bringing back the factions like brothels and thieves would be cool. I do see some of the tricks from the old games in the game, but not the full tricks, just references to the other games during missons.\n\nMy conclution for this game is that it is great when it comes to sidequesting, detracking and exploring. But the storryline could have been better and the main missons could have been more "interesting", however the plot is GREAT! The combat system is sometimes a bit slowish, maybe work on making it more fps friendly and making the reaction-time shorter. Allso it is great to have a lotof tools at your disposal. But maybe you should calm down a bit on the amount of sidearms one can have. You tend to get a bit overpovered sometimes. Ship combat system is great! But I do miss a way of making the ship quicker in combat(Maybe some purchesable upgrades, better sails, more sails, oiled ship, new mast, ect). I felt like I allways had just a little less speed then what I needed. However, same does not gofor turning, turning is perfect! I loved the exploring part, but for a game focused so much on exploring the ice I still feel like I got to little. More frosen water and ice please! As with both "AC 4" and "AC Rogue" I feel like we need the oportunity to bring bigger ships to the playground, maybe a DLC for a bigger ship at your diposal or something like that(but no "Man O' War", too OP). Allso miss some of the better elemnts of the old games. Maybe something for the next full game? I am left behind with a possitive feeling of this game and I do definetly recomend it. However do not try to save money on the limited game. These games do work best when you have all the content. Allso for the players that have never played "AC" before I do not recomend this to be your first. I recomend you play "AC II" first, then "AC III", after this "AC 4", and then this game. If not then i do struggle to believe you will understand the storryline and the plot.\n\n4 out of 6\n(Yes, this is lowish, however the game is still great. It is just the fact that it could have been som much better)","May 7, 2015","true","59.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

These characters believe in something and stop at nothing to achieve it, but they also use their brains. Playing a Templar is also a lot of fun, since they tend to be more than the usual two dimensional angry-man characters we get with the Assassins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/311560/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Assassin's Creed: Rogue, released in 2014, is a game published by Ubisoft and developed by Ubisoft Sofia. Rogue is a fictional and historical third person action-adventure game set a year after Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Rogue is set in the French and Indian War of 1754-1763 that consists of the French Army, Native American Army, and British Army. The two main factions in the game are the Templar Order and the Assassin Brotherhood. The game is seen through the perspective of the Templar Order and played through Shay. You, the player, play as Shay Patrick Cormac, a tough and confident Assassin and Templar. The game is a very solid game that has a good story, a very strong set of side missions and excellent technical performance.\n\nRogue has a good story. It takes you through the period in-between Assassin's Creed III through Achilles and Haytham Kenway and Black Flag through Adewale. It's your typical AC story. Whoever you may be you are to find the Pieces of Eden with shocking outcomes based off those artifacts. Shay, who mainly plays alongside Haytham in the later stages of the game, is in a race essentially against the Brotherhood. The missions are fun. The graphics spice up the atmosphere of certain missions while the naval combat enhances the game because there are missions in the ocean, allowing the game to have a nice balance with land and sea missions. I completed the game in 19 hours and 45 minutes so I would assume I completed the main story within 15 hours. I will note players can probably get at least 40 hours of the game. But, I would say the campaign was rushed in certain parts notably the ending. The ending was solid but not better because the story overall was limited. The game concluded stories including the story of Hope and Shay but it could not complete other stories such as Achilles because the game was set before Assassin's Creed III. The final cutscene was interesting but again it did not close the story with Shay particularly, it just left it open to interpretation, which I felt was not the right ending.\n\nThe side missions were excellent because the side missions actually added to the game. There are a boat-load full of content in the game, which is great too. But, tons of current games feature side missions that are filler to add playability to the game. However in Rogue, the side missions add further to the background of the series and have other stories that cover situations within Abstergo Industries among other missions. For instance, you, the unspecified player working in the Animus in the game, have to fix the cores of the computers with a mini-game and once completed you garner a nice and simple video that discusses things within the company such as events that had occured. The stories for example are nothing extreme though they do add some context to the company's operations or the first civilisation, and so forth. As for my experience, I completed 52% of the game, which is the main story and some other content. I do not find the incentive to play more of the game because the main story is finished, that is the only reason. If the main story was not finished I would have played through most to all of the content in the game.\n\nThe technical performance is extremely stable and smooth in Rogue. In comparison to ACIII that was released two years prior, this exceeds the performance of that game in every aspect. I achieved a constant 55-60FPS throughout the game whereas in modern times I achieved a stable 30-45FPS. In ACIII I was on a 45-60FPS for the majority of the game and 15-25FPS for modern day. I praise the developers for successfully optimising this game as this was a port from Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.\n\nThe game featured good new characters in Rogue but also characters that you come to expect from Black Flag and III. Shay is a great character with his mannerisms and his brilliant voice acting. Shay's dialogue is strong because he is very confident in his actions, particularly his saying of 'I make my own luck'. His voice acting meets the different circumstances in the game. For instance, if he was bleeding from the stomach and he had dialogue you could tell the difference as he would struggle to speak. If Shay was angry you could tell in his deeper voice tones. This was something that lacked in ACIII as many characters in that game had a a lack of variety in voice tones. The other new Rogue characters are good. Hope is a standout with her elegant personality and her viciousness in action.\n\nThe only negatives I encompassed with the game were minor. A notable glitch was the sound. Frequently throughout the game there would be a double sound for animations such as in the sword fighting. Secondly, accessing the naval campaign was annoying because there was no simple entry into it like in previous games with their variations. The naval campaign is contract based, equal event to brotherhood missions in previous games. Again though, nothing major but a slight annoyance. There were other very minor bugs but are not big enough to list them as I noticed them maybe twice.\n\nOverall, AC: Rogue is a good game. It was not a good game but it was not average. The story in Rogue was good but had an abrupt ending. The side missions in Rogue were awesome and added a lot of context to the background storylines of the series. The technical optimisation is a hit as the game was smooth and stable throughout. The characters were really good adding a vast mix of personalities from previous games and a line of new characters. I would recommend this game. At $32.95 I would recommend a full purchase because it really is a nice game that has not many issues at all. I would not recommend the Digital Deluxe Edition at full price but if on sale I would recommend. 7.5/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

The mechanics are very similar to Assassin's Creed IV, and it plays well on my build, maintaining 60 fps on ultra.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Buy and play AC III and AC IV, then buy this game instead of AC: Unity.\n8/10 would turn templar again.\n\nEdit: 12 hours in. Game is still great.\n\n9/10 would continue to templar further.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, I have finally finished the game. The concept is very interesting. It lets you see the side of the AC universe from the Templars view. The ending is very preditable and let climactic than the other AC games, but overall it was a good experience. I'm glad I picked this game up, and I will continue to open all the chests and fragments until I get to 100%.\n\nOne thing that did bother be about this game was the weapon variety. The airgun is cool, as it comes with darts and grenade, both with different kinds that you can load into your weapon. However, the darts are a simple one person shot, while grenades are an AOE kind of shot. It was kind of sad to see that this huge potential of a new weapon was short-cut with an AOE and single target option, but it still was fun to experiment with it.\n\nDespite the game's main story being fairly short, it was still extremely fun and it held my attention.

I think it's best to compare to AC Liberation. Liberation introduced a character tied to Connor Kenway in AC3, much like this game introduces a character connecting to Haytham Kenway, Adewale, and Achillies Davenport. I feel that, in terms of lore, this game holds a lot more weight than Liberation and is overall a more polished and envigorating experience. It returns to the excellent naval gameplay of AC4 whilst bringing back some favorite characters from AC3. In addition, Shay Cormac allows us to experience the Templar Order in a new light. When we got to play as Haytham Kenway in AC3 we got a glimpse at what the Order was really about and how their goals aren't so different from the assassins. Shay offers this same opportunity - as players used to fighting for the assassin cause, Shay enables us to question their true motives, making for a really interesting story.\n\nThis game was really overshadowed by Unity in many ways. With Unity being the 'bigger' title of the year, Rogue was out on it's own plane. As one who has finished both games, I can honestly say that Rogue is better in almost every way and it's seriously underrated. I hope that this game gets more attention because people deserve to know that this game carries great weight in the AC universe and it's concepts could and should be given the opportunity to return later on in other games to continue to delve into the understanding of the ideological war between Assassin and Templar.","March 15, 2015","true","35.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Love the see it through the eyes of a templar aspect. Also it mixes elements from AC3 and Black Flag which is neat. I'm only roughly 1/3 of the way done though but I'm already loving the game. I've only noticed two bugs and experienced no crashes. Bug 1 was a dead body flew 2 stories into the air and crash landed. The second is a deck hand glitched off the ship during a battle and fell into the water and died lol. *Spoiler* I like the going Rogue aspect in this one but I side with the assassin's in all the games. This one though I lean twords the templars.

The ♥♥♥♥ is this game? Why did I never hear of this before?" That was because of Unity taking the limelight while Rogue was hiding in the shadows. From all the nonsense I've heard from Unity and the  botched launch, I figured that Rogue was going to follow the same route. I was wrong.\n\nMy friend gifted the game to me and I told myself that I should at least try it, despite having Uplay attached to it and the stigma for being an Assassin's Creed game. So far, I've played the first, second and Brotherhood, so I never knew what would happen with the storyline of the series from then on, until I played this game.\n\nTo my surprise, I've clocked in 17 hours into the game, doing some side activities and the main storyline; I'm beyond impressed on how fun and immersiveful this game can be and the lore behind it pushing the envelope for the series' storyline\n\nObviously, given the description of this game, you follow the tale of Shay Cormac, a once loyal Assassin following Achilles, the Brotherhood's Mentor of the American Colonial, who became a ferocious Templar Hunter, taking down his past brother in arms. I won't give you much of the story, because would deny you of the pleasure this game has to offer. Simply put, it offers you the perspective of the Templar Order, giving you insight of the eternal war Between the Assassins and the Templar.\n\nAlthough the story itself is quite commendable, the lore scattered around in the game just simply enhances it completely, giving you incentives to explore your surroundings and understanding the characters you meet in the game. It also offers you many audio logs, which just pushed it even more, giving more life and character to the world of AC.\nThey're quite lengthy and very enjoyable to hear, should you pursue all of them, but that doesn't diminish the game's storyline should you ignore them.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite fun and smooth, from my experience playing, although there are some hiccups here and there, concerning the counter move against several enemies, but that might be just me playing badly/not paying attention enough. It also offers a lot of variety in taking down enemies, such as using darts to make civvies go "berserk" or putting snipers to sleep while darting your way towards your assassination target. You have bombs, darts, pistols and other such tools to achieve your success, giving you more freedom as to how you want to complete a certain mission.\n\nThe game is absolutely wonderful looking and I'm surprised how well I'm running the game, at a solid 60FPS with everything at maximum capacity. You'll have an easy time getting those beautful shots of the sunset while sailing in the North Atlantic, or panoramic views atop a church. It truly is a beauty playing this game.\n\nAlthough I'll keep this rather short, since I can go on and on and on, I'm grateful for my friend gifting me this game and I'm planning to finish the game completely, with nothing amiss. So for now, it will be under construction and Assassin's Creed Rogue really is a game worthy of bearing the title of Assassin's Creed.\n","March 15, 2015","true","20.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have to give them credit though because there wasn`t much that the developers had to do to make this game. The re-use of GFX and characters from both 3 and 4 with some new additions and the exact same mechanics and game flow as 4 with a new story line pretty much sums up the making of this game.\n\nThe first thing that stood out to me was that this game to date was the smoothest running right after being released; I was able to max out everything and got a solid 60 FPS 95 percent of the time. The scenery was another thing that really stood out; the colors and dynamics are really beautiful in this game and I often had to stop just to look around, this is a nice change in pace from other darker themed games. You`ll see where a lot of buildings/characters and scenery were re-used, but at least this time when your sailing around you`re not looking at the exact same landscape like you did in B.F. and running around in the snow made a comeback which was really fun in 3.\n\nSo we finally get an Irish Assassin and he turns... well.. rogue =\ Even in video game land we can`t catch a break! It is interesting that the writers went down the templar route to keep things fresh. The story brings back some characters, but if you didn`t play Unity, 4 or 3 you`ll be in the dark. The big problem? The campaign/story was short, in fact the shortest in the series which is why I call it a DLC, you spend most of your time exploring and gathering treasure and if you just play the campaign you can be done in under a few hours. Also, the short story also didn`t leave time for you to find the cool treasures like the different armor and Altair's sword set let alone be able to use them during gameplay like in brotherhood and the wolf armor.\n\nNY was laid out like Boston was in 3 and there`s no horse so you had to run around or fast travel which sucked and the stalkers really became a huge pain. You can`t run while in eagle vision so you don`t know where they are and have to rely on the annoying whispers to know when they`re close, but it didn`t really matter unless you were exploring and finding treasures because you didn`t spend much time in NY during the story.\n\nHunting, crafting, ship upgrades, naval campaign and legendary battles all made a return in this game (legendary battles are much easier which was a bummer). The developers really took the best parts of AC 3 and 4 and made this game which made it really enjoyable to play, it`s too bad it was too short and we didn`t have the stealth movements of Unity because this could have been the best AC game to date, especially after Unity`s failed attempt at upgradable weapons/armor/character and multiplayer campaign; I mean if I want to play an in depth RPG I`ll play games like Baldur`s Gate and if I want to play with people I`ll play games like WOW, but not the place for the AC franchise, stick with what works, stay unique.\nAs of March 24th 2015 there are still some movement bugs and climbing issues that really make you want to throw your mouse, I even got stuck off the playable map a few times and had to reset/fast travel to reset.\n\nSo if you loved 3 and especially 4 than this is worth the money, if you`re a fan of the series but didn`t like 3 or 4 wait for the sale.","March 24, 2015","true","53.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you were bored towards the end of BF and wonder if starting what is essentially BF2 will keep you interested, wonder no more as it should suffice. This is no DLC or add on, it is a fully fledged AC game with at least 40 hours of gameplay. There are two giant open sea maps to explore and an update to AC3's New York area. There's dozens and dozens of small coastal towns, green foresty areas with hunting challenges (all pretty easy unfortunately) ice fields, ice bergs, forts to conquer, whaling from BF is back, no underwater areas this time though, or at least that i've seen so far. The voice acting is top notch, apart from the hilariously bad performance of your first mate. The guy sounds like he's taking the ♥♥♥♥. The fact that the game is a port of the 360/ps3 version and not a port of a xbox1 game like BF was, means that certain graphical elements are left out.

I have to say this installment really tickles me in a special way! It gives the feel of AC 3 and Black Flag and touches base with both in a really good way.\n\nThe highlight to me was, getting a ship almost out of the box. That was something I really enjoyed about 3 and Black Flag, but it seemed a bit stifled in 3 and narrow in Black Flag. With Rogue, they opened the doors wide from the first moment and let the player run free with the ship. In Black Flag there was one map to explore and sandbox in, it was fun and I loced it, but it felt narrow. This installment I'm only on act 3 and have 2 full maps to explore and conquer and New york for those times I want to play on the ground. Trust when I say New York is nothing to sneeze at either, giant sandbox to run and do side quests as well as main missions.\n\nOne down sie so far I have found, in this version there are these hidden people in New York and elsewhere. It may be fun for some to have to walk around in eagle vision trying to find them and kill them before they get the drop on you, but for me it is a real headache.\n\nJust one small issue in an otherwise wonderful game.

For example, since you play a Templar, you have sidequests to protect assassination targets instead of killing them. You get a silenced rifle for the sleep/berserk darts, with an extra dart type to detonate explosive barrels or attract attention to where it was shot. You also get a grenade launcher that has explosive/sleep/berserk grenades. All of this is fun to use to fool around with the enemies, who mostly aren't a challenge (unless you're always trying to not get spotted).\nPiracy, whaling, hunting and crafting are back, diving is gone, those super ships are in again, there's a lot more areas to explore and convoys to raid, ship weapons are mostly the same, there's more types of collectibles, and the British soldiers are your friends this time (sort of).\nLike AC4, it's not a game that's very concerned with stealth. There's the occasional (side) objective to not get spotted, but you can generally kill a whole street worth of dudes to escape.\nOne annoying addition to the game: hidden assassins. You'll hear whispers growing louder as you approach an assassin who's hidden in the bushes, on the roof, or in a crowd. If you come too close, they'll dart out and stab you, then run away again. There's a LOT of these dudes, but fortunately if you kill them, they stay gone.\n\nStory-wise, it takes place between AC4 and AC3, and uses characters from both. I assume it would be pretty hard to follow if you hadn't played both AC3 and 4 before. There's a visit to another AC game later on, but it's more of a cameo. It's an absolutely non-essential story if that's all you're here for, but then they've all kind of felt like that since Ezio's trilogy ended. The way the main character defects from the Assassins and how steadfast he is in remaining with the Templars are kind of wonky, as is the main character's Irish accent. Thematically it's a new spin on things, with you hunting down your old associates, but not enough time was spent with them beforehand to really have that make an impact.\nThe meta-story takes place in the same setting AC4 did; Abstergo Entertainment - a Templar front company. I don't think you're the same character from AC4, but it's not that clear. While AC4's meta-story had hints of what happened to the First Civilization, this one doesn't. It's honestly not essential either, but the documents you find do flesh out the backstory somewhat.\n\nSo if you want more AC4, here you go. If you want the next evolution in Assassin's Creed mechanics, or a story that feels like more than a stopgap, look into Assassin's Creed Unity (pretty underrated from what I've played so far).","May 25","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/recommended/311560/","nusensei","nusensei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/","342 products in account","It's ironic how Unity was promoted as the big next-gen game while Rogue was underplayed as AC 4.5 for current-gen. As we've seen in the past few months, Unity has flopped horrendously while Rogue has stood out as a worthy successor to the AC franchise. Sadly, much of this is mostly because Rogue is simply NOT Unity.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Rogue WORKS. The game is pretty much an extension of Black Flag. It doesn't change much, if anything, but that isn't a bad thing. Black Flag was exciting. Great soundtrack, fast-paced combat, huge world and naval exploration. Rogue has a somewhat smaller scale, but has more areas in New York, the North Atlantic and North America. But it has the same charm and the same feel. Perhaps it could've used its setting more effectively - lots of locations aren't used and New York is mostly a backdrop to several story missions, while Black Flag took you everywhere. But it's still better than Unity.\n\nThe story works well too. Ubisoft seems to be trying very hard to make memorable characters like Ezio but in the span of only one game compared to the AC2 trilogy. Shay Cormac is a relatable character - not as epic as Ezio, but within the constraints of only one game, Shay's story comes across very nicely. Sure, it's a token rogue story, but Shay pulls it off really well, going through the moral conflict, becoming jaded with the Assassins and becoming an integral part of the Templars.\n\nPerhaps the most underrated part of Rogue is how it connects the AC universe together. It brings back Black Flag and Freedom Cry through its heritage of older characters. It serves as the prequel to ACIII, with references to George Washington, Haytham Kenway and the fall of Achilles. And, as an extra bonus, it links into the events of Unity. If anything, Rogue stands out by making the other AC games better. The supporting ensemble complement Shay nicely, making the cinematic experience more enjoyable than Arno's attempts in Unity.\n\nThe modern-day story is also very well developed. You are once again an Abstergo Entertainment employee, but this time under the control of the Templars directly. It introduces new supporting characters and a whole new aspect of the modern story while retaining the familiar setting from Black Flag, It really does play out as a sequel to Black Flag, and is executed far more fluidly than Unity's excuse for a modern story. In fact, it seems that Unity was made by Abstergo rather than Ubisoft as a ploy to make Assassin-based games utter crap while making Templars games really good.\n\nAnd that would make a good plot twist.\n\nUltimately, Rogue stays true to a working formula. There are elements that don't make a lot of sense, but we've come to expect that from open-world games and the series. The story is satisfying, the gameplay is sweet and the soundtrack is epic. Surely, there can be no greater nostalgia trip than when you open the menu and hear Ezio's and Connor's themes mashed together. Rogue respects the series and in turn forms a deep bond with everything that came before it. Perhaps it is a greater unifier than Unity.","March 28, 2015","true","32.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

In a way, it is the AC: Brotherhood to Black Flag's AC II. It kind of almost has too much to do in it, really, as I just beat it after spending a lot of time doing side activities and I still finished with quite a lot of stuff left over to do and about a 76% completion rating. Hell, half of New York isn't even used in the game but you can still explore it, collect items, and complete side activities there. Speaking of which, this game is pretty huge. There's tons of land to explore across multiple different maps, with smaller story-related locations, too. Much like Black Flag this game is a damn fine pirate simulator, with a lot of ship sailing, plundering, and ship combat. While it doesn't look as nice as Black Flag, for a last-gen game it comes pretty damn close and looks great. The soundtrack is also really well done with some really good voice acting, too.\n\nYour enjoyment of the story depends on how much of a fan you are of the series as a whole, but this is a direct sequel to Black Flag, so even if you only played that game there is a lot to enjoy about this game and how it relates to the events that unfolded during Black Flag. Even better, if you played AC III it ties very heavily into the story of that game, as well, and leads directly into the events that will unfold in AC: Unity. Plus, if you complete side activities there are a ton of little bits and pieces that talk about the events of prior AC games as well as providing introductions to characters of future AC games such as the trilogy of AC: Chronicles games, Unity and Syndicate. The whole game feels like a love letter to fans of the series, so if you've stuck with it for this long then you'll be handsomely rewarded for your time invested.\n\nIt plays like an Assassin's Creed game through and through, though, so for some people out there this game still won't do anything to convert them. For others, though, such as fans of the series or even people that only played Black Flag or either avoided Unity or were disappointed by it, this is a really solid game. As an added bonus it is also nicely optimized. I played on an AMD FX-4350 CPU, Radeon R9 270 GPU, along with 16 GB of DDR3 SDRAM with maxed-out settings across the board and I had a solid 60 FPS from start to finish. I could barely maintain 30 FPS on AC III and that wasn't even maxed out, so this was a really pleasant surprise.\n\nHighly recommended for AC and/or Black Flag fans.","March 16","true","65.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After playing all ac series, i need to accept to playing templar is more fascinating and enjoyable. Shay is hunting them and taking vengeance. Main menu theme soundtrack is awesome. Legendary ship battless are amazing and templar outfits more charismatic and stylish. I was planning to start tu unity after complete black flag but i saw in the market. There will be sale again, Rogue and unity packet at low price. Don't miss it. This game is looking like snack between black flag and unity. Give it a chance. Don't try to finish it quickly. Shay's story will take you away and maybe at the end of game, you will be hater of assasins and become most dangerous templar. There is a huge three different maps. Its wonderful feeling and eye show at sunset traveling with your ship throught to ice mountains.

It added many new weapons from its predecessor (Black Flag), though the only one which was actually really *new* was the grenades, and added an admittedly interesting gas mechanic to the game. It also was much more filled and felt significantly less grindy than Black Flag; these were all great improvements to the series from the previous title, but unfortunately, these are the only positive things I can say about this game. What this game made up for in being playable, it lost in a dissapointing lack of charm.\n\n**The remainder of this review contains massive spoilers, referrencing the end of the game**\n\nEither due to false marketing on the community's behalf or on Ubisoft, we're lead to believe that the main character, Shay, is the victim of a massive betrayal and seeks revenge against the brotherhood. This story sounded interesting, and for many of us, it was the first time we'd see the story from a Templar's point of view. Or at least, that's what I expected, but not what I recieved. Shay was never the victim of a betrayal, but rather the victim of a mistake in which no one was guilty. Rather than confront his Mentor about what he witnessed, which would be the logical thing to do, Shay gets unrealistically emotional about the situation and blames everything on his Mentor. He then consciously decides to betray his brotherhood, and is retaliated against accordingly.\n\nWhat follows isn't a story of revenge against the backstabbing brotherhood, but rather a convoluted scheme to stop a man who ends up listening to his own conscience in the end anyways, rendering Shay's entire mission completely pointless. He decides, for no other reason than one of the British officers was nice to him while he was injured, to help his hated rivals, the Templars, and eventually join their Order and assist the British in winning the Seven Years War.\n\nMy biggest complain about this game is that under no point of this game do you ever see the positives in joining the Templar Order. The Templars were never painted as the good guys, rather the game regularly reminds you that they are the bad guys, and the reasons for Shay's complete dedication toward the Order seems to entirely ignore his high moral stance which directed him to betray the Assassins. There never seems to be a point, other than the rosey tone of a single man who dies before Shay even makes the decision to join the Templars, where I (the player) feel like I should actually want to be a Templar.\n\nAs if the feeling of "why on Earth am I killing the good guys?" wasn't enough to make the game feel horrible, the ending seals this game as completely unnecessary and makes no sense. I'm not referring to the mission in Versailles (though the mission itself feels like an unnecessary and shoe-horned-in shameless advertisement for Unity), but rather the Naval Missions. I was quite confused while trying to complete the Naval Missions (which must be completed if you are to unlock much of the best stuff in the game) in that they no longer let you complete them until you "progress further into the story." This was right before the last mission of the game.\n\nIn case that wasn't clear, let me restate this: The final 5 Naval Missions, which are required for completion and for unlocking some of the best gear in the game, doesn't get unlocked until you've COMPLETED the game. Why? Were the developers afriad that I'd be cheating with Altïar's Swords on a mission which doesn't even let you use anything other than your Hidden Blades? Why was this required? So that people would be forced to play hours more of the game after they already completed the story? Who thought this was a good idea??\n\nOverall, I think the game is fine. I never felt like I was doing the right thing, but so what? Plenty of games let you play as the bad guy (though they usually leave out the high sense of morality that constantly reminds you that what you did was morally sketchy and highlights that you're actually the bad guy in this game). The Naval Missions is a cheap and pathetic move on the fault of the developers, but hey, **at least the game plays on PC, Montreal!!**. But would I recommend it, though? No. It doesn't add much from Black Flag, and unlike this game, Black Flag had characters I actually could **care** about. I couldn't have cared less if the characters died; the fact that two of them were Haythem Kenway and Achilles Davenport defeated the possibility of that happening anyways. Comparing that to Black Flag, or more accurately Black Beard, it was geniunely disastrous watching Edward Thatch die. We had actually come to care about him and his death was genuinely devastating. In AC: Rogue, however, none of the characters invoke that amount of compassion. None of the characters seemed to have any real life. When they died, it was difficult to really think anything of it.\n\nThis game is fine, but you'd be better off playing Black Flag.","July 23, 2015","false","48.8"," 41 of 75 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","41","75","2","9"

There are alot of places that look climbable but they're actually not, they are found mainly in the islands. While they are not that common in big towns, like Albany, New York, etc.. You will be spending most of your time on the islands and not in the main cities. You can see how bad the parkour system is when you have to chase someone, or something, like a shanty for example. Having said that, I don't really care for parkour in AC games, that's why it's not a big deal for me.\n\nThe combat is pretty much the same thing as it was in Black Flag, even though Shay has a new type of weapon (sword and dagger) it's basically the same thing with one or two new animations slapped on so you can't say it's just a reskin. Shay has reduced health and can't take many hits even with max upgrades, which makes Blazing your way through a fortress filled with snippers, dozens of armed men,grenadiers and captains slightly harder... It is still very possible and easy to do so though.\n\nThe naval battles have changed a bit, for example, heavy shot and mortars in Black Flag used to be all you needed to win, atleast that's how I did it. Here... Not so much, those weapons are pretty much just as effective as the rest of them.\nThe explosive barrels (Not sure what they were called in English, I only know their name in my language) have been replaced with fire...Fire... On the sea, it is not explained why you can leave a blazing trail of glorious fire on the sea.\nRegardless, it's just as useless as it was in Black Flag... I think they tried to make the combat a bit more challenging, because I did notice the enemies became a tad stronger and more resistant to my attacks, I've only seem that in the lesser ships though, e.g: schooners to brigs, beyond that they are really easy to take down, in fact the Men 'o War are ridiculously easy to destroy and board, hell, even the legendary ships were a walk in the park. Having said that, I think they were just as fun, epic and awesome as the previous game.\n\nStealth mechanics are the same as Black Flag, but enemies sometimes do have x-ray vision and can spot you through a wall a mile away, snipers will sometimes shoot you through the wall... That's all I have to talk about for stealth.\n\nNew mechanics: Most of what I'm about to tell you is not explained in the game, you have to go to the tutorial section and look for them there.\nThere's a new elevator system, basically it's 3 walls made of wood where Shay will just wall jump his way to the top in the worst animated way ever, there is also  2 hooks connected through a wire between rooftops so you can do basically what you did in revelations to go around slightly faster, just so you can't complain that the cities are too sparse, you can sometimes swing from a rope to another building like you used to do on your boat. You can renovate buildings that are spread around the map, that increases your income, when you renovate all of them you get an achievement, an abstergo challenge and a ugly sword with good stats. When you renovate the buildings you'll most of the times not even see the difference, it will look just as run down as before, there is also a thing called prosperity rewards, it means when you collect five of them you get a boost to goods you salvage of boarded ships and to your income which brings me to the final new mechanic: Income. Every 20 minutes you get an X ammount of money depending how much prosperity,buildings you renovated and settlements/areas you've freed. At first it's a miserable ammount, but by the end you'll be swimming in money.\n\nYou also have your fleet which you can capture ships and send them there so they can complete missions and earn you rewards, like money,figureheads,sails,collectibles,wheel,swords,pistols,and,outfits. At first the missions will be really short, like 10 minutes or so to complete a mission, but in the later levels, like 20 and up it will take you nearly 2 hours JUST to complete one mission, this is specially bad when you've got nothing to do and you're just waiting for the timer to tick down. This is just an excuse that Ubisoft got to make the game seems longer than what it actually is. Which brings me to my next point: Game length.This game is VERY short. I have completed EVERYTHING to do in the North Atlantic, completed the main story, did all the side quests collected 62 abstergo challenges, collected every costume but two, got all the upgrades for both Shay and the Morrigan, got every sword but two, collected all the pistol sets,took down every gang HQ, every settlement, every fort, discovered every location,got all the templar maps,completed all assassin interceptions,all legendary ships, almost every hunting challenge. renovated almost every building and completed every single naval mission and I've only played 28.6 hours. It would be even shorter if Ubisoft didn't make you collect a ridiculous ammount of stuff just to unlock an outfit or whatever.\n\nThis game is a very good port. When I try to run Black Flag I get about 40fps at 768p on medium, but here I can turn it up to ultra on 768p and I play at a constant 60fps and the games have the same spec requirements, sometimes, when you're in a very intense situation with alot of ships, smoke everywhere, everyone firing, it can dip to 40fps-ish. But other than that, you're fine\n\nIn conclusion, this game is very fun and addicting, there were times where I would be up until 6 a.m playing this game. If you're a person that enjoys these games for the parkour, jumping around and climbing everything like a monkey or you just cannot tolerate glitches that break immersion on your game then this game is not for you. However if you're looking for a fun pirate game, with some awesome combat mechanics and don't mind having your character flip out, jump into the clouds or killing someone and they looking like ragdolls flying everywhere then this game is for you\n\n","July 13, 2015","true","42.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You could vary your run speeds between a jog and a sprint which really helped on rooftops making quick 90 degree turns... in this game? You have walk and sprint... no jog. The sprint key is also your parkour key... but if you use spacebar or E with sprint? Cormac will then go into "unsafe" parkour jumps or parkour dismounts where he can (AND WILL CONSTANTLY) leap to his death or do something to enrage you greatly. For a game with such an emphasis on parkour? This game is riddled with bugs in so many different town and areas... not being able to straddle a short dirt wall but two feet over Cormac will... if you're trying to do a quick escape and Cormac won't climb a wall because it looked like the 2x4's could be used for climbing? You have to release the SHIFT key and then turn at walking pace before holding SHIFT again or Cormac will endlessly loop trying to climb that same wall since he's so sluggish to turn with SHIFT held down sigh... and getting stuck! I've done an air assassination on a guard poking a hay bale and then Cormac was stuck in a stationary crouch and I couldn't move and guards wouldn't attack me! I had to fast travel elsewhere and lose all my progress on a fortification capture because of that! GRR!!\n\nNext? The bugs... oh the bugs! Here's polygons floating in the air...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=566082047\n\nand more floating polygons same mission...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=566082024\n\nMain storyline? I've had to force a mission restart because NPC's would do stuff like attack each other WHEN THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM and then they wouldn't continue walking towards our objective and they wouldn't be able to kill each other... or the first time I got a boat on the tutorial mission? I escaped the zone and the prompt kept saying to escape the zone... so I sailed half the map and realized after checking the map that the game was bugged and had to restart the mission sigh...\n\nHere's Colonel Monroe fighting his own men..\nhttp://imgur.com/AZZK1ri\n\nRestart the mission? They get along just fine and walk in formation...\nhttp://imgur.com/AeJzDxu\n\nSo yeah... buggy, frustrating parkour system which is bugged compared to Black Flag... which is a shame since the storyline is actually good and it's refreshing to see a story from the Templars side of things... but... these bugs will make you give your monitor the middle finger a lot... so unless it's really... and I mean REALLY cheap and you really want an AC game as a Templar? Then and only then bother to buy this game. I bought it for $15 and I feel it was ok for $15... but I feel I should at least try and rush through the game and finish the storyline so at least I feel like I got my $15 worth.\n\nHere I fight the floating pistol and sword in holsters...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=568106912\n\nMy adversary the floating pistol and swords return in a different fight!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569522461\n\nAC Syndicate might have a terribly optimized game engine compared to AC Rogue... but the core gameplay is a lot more solid and I've only experienced bugs with tackling and kidnapping which were minor compared to this game and the parkour is amazing on AC Syndicate... I'd rather play a game I cap my framerate on purpose to 30fps and have worse performance than a game that runs good but the gameplay is bugged like crazy...\n\nOh, another prime example of the lack of care put into AC Rogue? You know how AC IV Black Flag had that companion app for iOS and Android to control Kenway's fleet? Well, Cormac's fleet in AC Rogue doesn't get the same treatment... no companion app. sigh.","December 2, 2015","false","16.8"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","22","40","2","7"

Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer.\n\nMy main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations.\n\nObviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it.\n\nTouching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.\n\nSome things i disagree with:\n- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)\n- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic.\n- Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.\n\nGive this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less "land play" which made me happy.\n\nHave to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable.\n\nP.s Dont take the ship away again.\n\nCheers,\n\nLordelicious.","March 13, 2015","true","41.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The story is set in the mid-18th century during the Seven Years' War, and follows the story of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar. Gameplay in Rogue is very similar to AC Black Flag with mixtures of ship-based naval exploration and third-person land-based exploration with loads of new features added. Naval aspects from the previous games will return with you controlling Shay's ship, Morrígan. A New feature include new ship-based weapons including releasing an oil slick which can then be ignited, Puckle guns, and the ability for enemies to board Morrígan during ship to ship combat. The arctic environment also features into naval gameplay and exploration, as certain icebergs can be rammed with an icebreaker. In combat, the game introduces a air rifle, which now allows Shay to silently take out enemies at a distance. The air rifle can be outfitted with a variety off different projectiles, such as firecrackers. Also you can use a grenade launcher, which fires shrapnel grenades and berserks. Hand-to-hand combat has been slightly altered, now the enemy attacks also can be countered with timing, similar to the Batman: Arkham game franchise. Enemy Assassins feature archetypes similar to previous games, using the skills you used throughout the series; they can hide in the bushes, blend in with crowds, and perform air attacks against you. The poison gas can now be used as an environmental weapon, and now Shay also has a gas mask that can mitigate its effects. Reflecting on Shay's role as a Templar, the game now introduces a new side mission: Assassin Interception.They mirror the Assassination side missions in previous games. After you intercepted a messenger pigeon that is carrying a assassination contract. He must prevent Templar agents from being assassinated by finding and killing Assassins hidden nearby. I would give Assassin's Creed Rogue an overall rating of 10/10 stars. The PC port is very well done with no FPS or any kind of other issues. This is definitely a MUST buy for fans because I'm just absolutely without a doubt 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Rogue will not disappoint at all!.","March 9, 2015","true","142.2"," 48 of 91 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","48","91","4","1"

I've played every single game so far and have loved every one of them (don't get me wrong, some installments are weaker than others such as AC Revelations and AC 3 but I still enjoyed them nonetheless). I played Unity and heavily enjoyed it, despite what everyone has said about it's technical problems. But I loved it and so I ended up pre-ordering this game. I then played through it and I must say, this game blows some of the previous games out of the water because of it's rather darker storyline and the insane amount of stuff to do in the world, surpassing even Black Flag's scope of activities and side stuff. It really is an absolute shame that this game will be passed on by most gamers for 3 reasons. 1. It's a last gen game and everyone is more interested in next gen tech and gaming. 2. Unity's bad reputation has turned many people off from the series which is really unfortunate because they'll miss out on this amazing iteration in the series. and 3. Simply because it's a AAA title. This game is an amazing tie in to AC 3, AC4, and Unity. I would say that this game is pretty perfect on all cylinders. My only real complaint is that the campaign is probably the shortest campaign yet in the franchise, comprised of only 6 sequences. But it makes up for it with the amount of stuff you can do outside of the story. I would easily say this game is a 10/10, will play again.","March 17, 2015","true","53.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Irish Edition). It's literally the Black Flag engine copied over and slightly modified, but with entirely less tedious ship travel. I 100% this game, and I genuinely enjoyed the experience. The story was pretty decent, but not nearly as good as some of the other AC games, but it did tie together AC3's and Unity's story which was a pretty nice touch to make up for the fairly dry overall story. Depending on your skill, you will either be hunted by assassin's or be the assassin hunter, which is a very appreciated touch to the general idea of being a deserter of the assassin brotherhood, and the game made the creed of the assassins actually appear fairly unappealing, which leads into questions that never otherwise were apparent in any of the other games. With all that being said, it's a decent addition to the series and it's only worth a buy for those who want to follow along with the story, have some time and money to kill, and actually want to play the game rather than just look up videos that show everything. Just wait for it to go on sell (if it ever does).","May 21, 2015","true","45.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblelyon/recommended/311560/","noblelyon","Lyon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblelyon/","131 products in account","Oh boy.\n\nPRO\nGreat story. Ace writing.\nAC Rogue is a thoughtful story. Character motivations are complex and (like in real life) sometimes only make sense to them. The ending was amazing.\nUpgrades\nLong have I hated the upgrade system for AC games. There is never enough stuff and it's always horribly tedious to get. I guess the idea is that you're supposed to literally become more powerful while playing the game but come on, this is ridiculous. None of the basic items are expensive enough to justify this position. In this game, though, the system is a lot better. Ship upgrades are meaningful and you can actually feel the firepower difference (unlike with the Jackdaw up until it's ultimate set.) The tedium of collecting ultimate items is still kind of there. Some outfits provide bonuses now, though it's not always clear what they are or if they even exist. A "sturdy-looking uniform" is just as likely to provide a bonus to defense as a "somber coat designed for stealth" is likely not to give a bonus to detection.\nLong gameplay\nA lot of people disagree with me on this. I think Rogue has a decent amount of gameplay going for it. It's supposed to be a short game: it's an interim sequel for Black Flag and the gateway game for Unity. The story is short and concise: characters are revealed by their database entires rather than long interaction scenarios, and it feels pretty good.\nCON\nRoach Motel\nIf this game reveals anything about Ubisoft Montreal, it's how F$*&@ked up their development cycle is. This game uses the exact same engine and base game as black flag. The interface is almost an identical skin except everything is in silver/blue instead of gold/google. The problem with this is  some things that were fixed in patches for Black Flag for bugs that existed before this game was released were never fixed in Rogue  to this day. One specific example is how climbing masts would cause Edward to dance around and never land on that sweet spot to jump up to the final platform holding the ship's flag. Edward no longer dances, Shay still does the shimmy tango while his crew dies.\n\nSo many F@$^%king bugs please fix.\nToo Much Stuff\nOkay. Real talk here. Many of the side missions are BORING. The interceptions are the same frustrating minigame over and over again and everything else is "collect and find 10/20/50/100 of X." It's uninspired, even for an AC game. The only redemption is in the Legendary Ship battles, which are kind of easy compared to the legendaries that popped up in Black Flag.\nWardrobe Malfunction\nI know that I've already done bugs here, but the way that the client renders models is unacceptable. Things will just vanish for seemingly no reason, even in big cutscenes. I think most games nowadays render their cutscenes with the game engine to preserve player perks like skins and recolors, but this works out so badly here. I think there would be no love lost between fans and the studio if the cutscenes were rendered in video. Yeah, it's that bad.\nClunky Animations\nI know this game didn't receive the attention of some other AC titles, but Some of these are so lazy. It looks like parts were animated by a 6th grader doing stop-motion for art class. The bad animation really ruins the immersion.\nAs a movie, AC Rogue is crap. As a game? I wish the publisher had put a little more effort in. I would definitely play it for the story though.","May 7","true","118.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game runs on the same engine, uses many of the same assets, and uses the same Abstergo office building in the present day plot. This game similairly revolves around a lot of ship combat, which also uses the same mechanics from AC4. If you liked AC4 you'd almost certainly enjoy this game, although it isn't quite as good.\n\nPros\nGameplay\nThe gameplay formula here is pretty much the same as whats sold all AC titles so far. The only real difference is now you can make enemies go berserk a whole lot easier and from greater range. There are a few new enemy types, but its enough to make attacking enemies still mildly entertaining. The ship combat is probably the best of any AC game so far.\nYou play as a templar\nThis isn't really an important feature, but I have to give ubisoft credit for actually trying something new.\nArctic Setting\nMuch of the game takes place in the North Atlantic, and the game does a great job of selling the cold climate. Barren trees, icebergs, freezing water and the sound of wading through heavy snow make the setting all that more convincing and makes much of the game feel like a Robert Frost poem.Cons\nRecycled Content\nThis game is borderline DLC for AC4. Its not that long at all, and much of the time comes from collecting crap and repetive missions. Its not like that's any different from any other AC game, but it feels more lazy when so much of the game is recycled. Several entire maps and locations are just pulled out of previous games.\nLevel Design\nThis game is so linear you could use it to calibrate lasers. There are a few side missions where the game feels slightly more open, but pretty much every on-foot mission feels like you're just a train riding a track through the level. The "Escape From Lisbon" mission is especially horrendous. Its a misnomer to call it a "freerunning" mission because there really is no freedom involved.\nMap Design\nWhile the scenery itself is exceptional, the map design really doesn't do it justice. The maps are really small, and huge portions of them are unaccessible. This makes the map themselves almost linear, as movement is confined only to strict cooridors. The result is that its really hard to buy into the locations. For example, Albany feels more like a museum reenactment of the city than an acual bustling frontier town.\nPlot/Writing\nThe present day plotline is pretty average, but the main historical plotline is just terrible. Characters are introduced and killed off in rapid succession, the twists are obvious a mile away, and the charachters actions are entirely inconsistent.\nCharachters\nQuite a few of the charachters are really terrible written, have bad lines, and terrible voice acting. A particular scene where one of the antagonists tries to poison you, and then leaves the room so you can easily escape on the path ubisoft put directly in front of you, comes to mind.\nBecause of the clear lack of effort put into this game, I simply can't reccomend it. Personally I got this game when it was on sale, at which point it was sort of worth the reduced price.","March 10","false","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

seen in the franchise\n- 3 large open worlds - including, New York, The River Valley, and The North Atlantic all of which look amazing\n- Likeable main character and in my opinion my favorite Assassin/Templar in the franchise\n- Improved game mechanics\n- New game mechanics\n- New missions based on points from a Templar - such as assassin contracts, you end up intercepting a pigeon by quietly sneaking up on it once grabbed you read the contract and then you must kill all of the assassins before they kill the Templar not just this but there are other missions which are opposite from the other creed games\n- Lots of replay value - with probably up to 150 hours and more\n- New enemy types - including enemy ships boarding you, Gang HQs, and more\n- New ship gameplay features - including Rams, rapid fire puckle guns, and more\n- Famiular Faces - Old characters from previous Assassin's Creed games including Adwele, Achilles, Haythm Kenway, Benjamin Franklin and 1 I can't mention( beat the campaign and you'll know ;) and sorry for butchering those xD\n- No Crashes - I've never had even one crash and that's saying something becuase I'm honestly running on a system thats nowhere near the best\n- Very few minor glitches - with lots of hours on this game it has ran almost perfectly and so smooth unlike Black Flag in which I had to turn off every graphics option and it still doesn't work smoothly, I've also heard that Rogue had the best launch for any Creed game on steam\n- No more tailing missions - yes finally it's about time that one Assassin's Creed game has got it right, there is no more tailing missions in the game except for one ship one which is pretty quick and easy, but yes that's one great chip off my and your shoulder\n\nCons- Needed A Longer Campaign - Though a great campaign it was short as it's 6 sequences compared to Black Flag that has 13 and could have been longer\n- Don't to upgrade your ship - or Shay that much to progress/finish though campaign\n- No multiplayer - though single player can be great enough for some\n- DLC  - for the great but short campaign that we got a new DLC campaign wouldn't hurt and the current DLC is mostly collectibles\n- Needs More After Campaign Motivation - After campaign there is so much to do though you don't have as big as motivation to do so unlike Flag unless your a perfectionist\n- Assassin's Hunting you - throughout the game assassins will hide in bushes, hay, rooftops, crowds, doors and more, and try to kill you just like you do to Templars in other games yet this feature is overdone and discourges exploring New York as there are around about ever corner which gets very annoying\n- Basic Rogue Outfit Glitch - The basic outfit in which Shay is seen is his Templar outfit which is the best costume in the game sadly with all DLC added but when you got to Conflict zones he pulls on/down a hood in which he doesn't have so it just looks stupid\n- To Close To Black Flag At Times - This game is still amazing yet it does sadly feel like it's trying to do what Black Flag already did as I mean that theres still lots of new cool features but not enough to make it stand out which is maybe part of the reason that this game is underestimated, but it needed even more new features then it added to the series\n- 1 Frustrating Mission - And my biggest issue/frustration with the game was when you have to Kill Hope, that was the most frustrating B.S Mission I've ever had to do it was extremely difficult and if done wrong can go on endlessly\n- No steam achievements/steam trading cards - which idk why all Ubisoft games do this\n- Uplay - its about time Ubisoft no one actually likes this $hit and you know it\n\nFinal VerdictThis game is flat out AMAZING and well worth it's of $30 or $40 in my case and is one hell of a steal if bought on sale, and is just so fun to play, though it does have some Cons as ever game does, once you finish the campaign the ending to me was so good it changed my thoughts on the game 100% and had me freaking out, it has lots of content with or without DLC to give you tons of more hours and you still won't come near to finishing it, and once you finish this game trust me you'll be rooting for the Templars for a long time, all in all I'd have to give this game a 9.4/10 and I usually don't give anything that high, so make to add this game to your wishlist or cart RIGHT NOW!!!

It has a few fixes up from Black Flag so if you haven't played Black Flag before I would suggest running with this instead (unless you care about the overarching story). However, most of the gameplay consists of a couple of story missions (like 5), the rest of the story missions are just introductions to the various time sinks around the world which, while quite a large one, is mostly consistent of the same few setpieces over and over again. Littered with the same positioned collectables, completing the game fully is more of a chore than an experience.

I've played AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4 (Black Flag), the latter used to be my favorite before this one came out.\n\nThe Good:\n- The ship battles improve on Black Flag's\n- The story is interesting\n- It was a nice break to play as the Templars.  Sure they're aristrocratic jerks, but those Assassins and their reckless behavior will destroy the world (according to this game, anyway)\n- The graphics are impressive\n- The "Lite" RPG system is well balanced.  Powering up your ship, pacifying cities by taking over bases, and improving your personal armaments is fun.  If you grind, the latter levels will be easier because your ship will be extremely powerful.  If you don't grind, those levels will probably be harder\n- Being constantly hunted - instead of hunting, like in every other AC game - by Assassins while in cities is a new and really fun mechanic\n\nThe Bad:\n- The player controls, as usual.  Be sure and run halfway up every tree and wall you see\n- The final levels turn in Super Mario platforming, as ususal\n- Level repetition, as usual\n\nBasically, the Bad is: it's an AC game with all the inherent clunkiness that implies.

The setting this time is on New York and the North Atlantic with most of the action developing at frozen waters. The story is really interesting as you get to play as Shay Cormac who turns into a templar, in his journey you get to meet old characters like Benjamin Franklin, Haytham Kenway, Adewalé, Aquilles, and G. Washington; it is always nice to have a connection with the other games. It takes about 10 hours to beat the game (this is one of the shortest AC along with Revelations) and it certainly feels that the game was rushed because there are jumps in time referred to as glitches when that is how the studio had to do to shorten the story. This game really feels like it could have used a few more months of development because the map is huge but many areas are left untouched as you progress through the story. This game could be an extremely polished AC IV but Unity had a lot more resources and attention leaving this game as a second tier title. The graphics are good as it runs at smooth 60fps with everything maxed out. I experienced about 5 glitches that made me restart a checkpoint (not game-breaking but annoying). I recommend this game only to the hardcore AC fans and especially those who played at least AC3 and Black Flag, the final scene also establishes a connection with Arno from AC Unity. 8/10","March 16, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When launch day arrived, I saw that people were giving it good reviews so decided to get it. I'm glad I did.\n\nShay is an interesting and worthy character. This is an interesting and worthy game with a story that I appreciate having the privilege of experiencing. Yes, it can get uncomfortable at times having to do the things Shay does. However, it was also innovative of them to have a game from the point of view of someone that goes rogue.\n\nRogue feels and plays a lot like Black Flag. However, story wise, it seems more fitting as a companion piece to 3. There's even a connection to--well, I won't spoil it but if and when you do see it coming, it's quite a neat little addition.\n\nIt's not perfect and I admit that graphics wise, it does feel somewhat dated compared to Unity. However, the simple fact is that, Rogue is a fun game, a lot more fun then Unity. Some will find the combat too easy. While it is easy (aside from some opponents that can be a pain to fight) compared to Unity, or at least easier, it's still a good game.\n\nYes, as with Black Flag, there are ship upgrades you more or less need to have, some of which require a lot ship boarding to be able to afford that can get repetitive. Wether this is an issue or not depends on how much you enjoy the ship combat sections. If you don't, it is a bit of a drawback. However, unlike Black Flag, there are far less of the at times infuriating tailing missions that plagued Black Flag. So, at least we have that.  Also, unless I'm remembering wrong, there isn't quite as much emphasis on the ship missions (though there still are plenty) so the issue of having to upgrade the ship while there, isn't omnipresent.\n\nHaving played the main story through to completion (with plenty still left to do side activity wise), I admit that Rogue doesn't feel quite as large as the other games. However, it's still an overall worthy experience where the annoyances that pop-up from time to time (that in all fairness are a part of just about any Assassin's Creed game) don't seem to drag the overall game down. In fact, the annoyances are the sort you may well forget about or at least try to forget about as to not taint the game because of one small annoying part or part of a mission that went wrong etc.\n\nI'll end this review saying that this *is* an Assassin's Creed game. It's a good game that shows us some interesting things that we perhaps didn't know we were missing from the more recent games. Even though it might feel uncomfortable to play the role Shay plays at times, I think making a game where you do as such was innovative and a diversion that we needed.","March 16, 2015","true","52.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anyways, Rogue is a further refined version of Black Flag, with a fun, gorgeous, and expanded naval section and the same Creed land based stealth we've grown to love (or hate). For me, as one who loves the classic AC experience and adored what AC3 and BF did with the Naval parts, this game is the true next-gen sequel in place of Unity. While Rogue visuals aren't quite as detailed on land as Unity, the sea and ships are stunning.  And while Rogue doesn't let you crank up the visuals like Black Flag did to show off its lush jungles, in exchange, you get a vastly smoother experience. Black Flag was very difficult to keep running at 30-45fps without the aid of 3rd party drivers and while I can't speak for Unity's PC counterpart, I doubt it eclipsed 30fps on console or PC in its first few months. Rogue, on the other hand has not dropped below 59fps in my 20+ hours so far (i5 4690k, gtx970) and the few visual options it does offer do make look very pretty indeed.\nIn short, if you're a fan of Black Flag and are looking for it's true successor, then look no further..","March 20, 2015","true","46.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

You betray your creed because they do not realize how powerful the artifacts of the Ones That Came Before are and are continually investigating on precursor sites and destroying cities. This game shows that not all Templars (especially Haytham and Shay) are bad guys and not all Assasins are good guys. Oh yeah, and the guy at Abstergo.

You only play as him when you need to fix Abstergo servers to unlock the other parts of Shay's story. Everytime you pop out of Shay's story just to fix servers, try... not to smash your screen ok? Like I said, this game is short but amazing. It only took me 12 hours to finish the story and not the side quests.","June 4, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That said you don't have to had play 3, but you'll recognize some things and people. Furthermore, this game connects details and facts from AC3, AC4, and AC Unity, its incredible.\n\nStory (8.5/10) - One of the best all around naratives in AC for a while no. Believe what the description says about dark, turning back on your friends then hunting them down leaves a bit of your soul feeling dirty. Overall, it creates a wonderfully mature narative that many will enjoy.\n\nGameplay (7/10) - Give it a 7 here just because its still the same all AC that we saw from 4, just with more content. Cormack is given some new weapons and tactics but nothing revolutionary. Same old AC gameplay here, but fun none the less. (Less Buggy Feeling)\n\nReplayability (Medium) - Ok, so I love games that let you keep going on after the story itself is over (like GTA5 and Fallout 3 w/ DLC), but a lot of things that you can do just don't seem to have a point to them. However, if you are a completionists, there is absolutely an unfathomable amount of content here.\n\nIn total, I highly recommend this game to anyone who may have overlooked this game due to Unity, and past fans of the series, as well as new that may have some background knowledge of the game. If you are looking for just fun gameplay with lots of mechanics thrown in, this game will also be perfect for you.\n-Hope you guys found this review helpful, and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did!","June 29, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It looks like the delay was actually used well. The game runs perfectly fine with no performance problems.\nThe game itself is also pretty great. It's got the most interesting story in the last couple of Assassin's Creed games, and it works to tie together AC3, AC4, and Unity, and does a good job doing that. The game has a perfect mix of AC4's open world ocean and standard AC gameplay, rather than focusing mostly on the naval side like in 4. I wouldn't necessarily pay 60 dollars for it (I got it for 30 in the Summer Sale), but overall AC Rogue was a very pleasant surprise.\nStill wait for reviews before you buy Syndicate later this year though. You never know how that port will be.

That your opponents now use assassin equipment and moves and that your ship can be boarded in naval combat add a much needed strategic depth to the game, often making conflicts seem like more of a struggle. To be honest, I dread the inevitable return to Assassin protagonists - the Templars simply do not provide the satisfying challenge level to hunt that the Assassins do.\n\nThe story is one of the most complex and compelling of any of the series to date, with a lot of new information both about the present-day conflict and the struggles for power between the Templars and Assassins leading up to the French Revolution. The minigames are interesting and the sidequests are conveniently broken into settlements and neighbourhoods, making them feel much more digestible. The dialogue is satisfying and well written and the major characters are all interesting and likable.\n\nThe game exceeds Unity not only in being less buggy, but because of this separation of the game into smaller but accessible regions. As a player I find it more satisfying to clear out a settlement than to chase a particular subquest chain all across Paris. Unity's crowd blending and management was mechanically interesting, but not as refreshingly so as Rogue's counter-assassin play.\n\nThat said, the experience was still not perfect. There were bugs on occasion, particularly surrounding the boarding mechanic. More importantly, it suffers from the quest armors not having any noticeable abilities - after scouring the world for the totems or the Templar keys for unique armors, the fact that they do not have any statistical advantage is unsatisfying - the Precursor Armor from 4 is a perfect example of quest armor. For example, the Native Armor could have allowed blending in treetops (to avoid sentries while moving around forts) and the Medieval Templar Armor could have granted immunity to air assassinations (which are not difficult to deal with anyway, but it would have been something). In future I hope that quest armor provides a noticeable improvement over the base armor - particularly since it's usually less fashionable.","May 25, 2015","true","45.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him in-game.\n\nPart of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad ♥♥♥.\n\nEven if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier AC's to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of it's own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film (lets just hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up).\n\nSome of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to meta-game kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.","July 31, 2015","true","27.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Rogue felt like an extension of ACIV, and it maintained my interest in the mechanics of the previous game.\n\nStory:\nOur story begins with Shay, an assassin who is a pupil of Aquilles, the assassin who teaches us in ACIII. An action by the assassins severs Shay's trust in them and begins his descent toward the Templar side. On our way we begin to understand more about the Templars and really see the other side of the coin. The present day storyline is still present, and we still play as the same Abstergo employee from ACIV. This time we're given even more backstory and introduced to a few new characters that bring us closer to understanding the Templars.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is just like ACIV, with a few new gimmicks and weapons for our character and ship. The part I enjoyed most was the range that the Air Rifle introduced. Taking down an entire compound with it was very easy and fun to do, though it did make fights too easy and took away the challenge of having to hide in haystacks and around corners like in ACII. Also from ACIV we don't have 4 pistols anymore, only 2. We maintain our 2 swords and many other weapons like the rope darts, berserk/sleep darts. and of course our hidden blades. A few new additions are added into the game, such as an enemy type that strikes quickly and quietly like an assassin would, but the game makes it easy to find and kill these enemies if you pay attention. Also there are gang compounds which you can clear out and take over in order to access your fleet and bank. The ship combat is pretty similar to ACIV with some new ship additions and we still have "Legendary Battles."\n\nBugs/glitches/What I hated\nAMD GPU users are at a loss with this game, something caused the game to crash as soon as the story was launched if the environment setting was set beyond normal even if your GPU is more than capable of running the game. This title still suffers from the age old AC problem in which your character will sometimes not respond to commands and plummet to his death instead of jumping to a nearby ledge. One of my favorite glitches was with an assassin we had to kill falling into the ocean and his marker sinking and sinking until I had to restart the mission. Some of the things I hated include the large amounts of animus fragments and the fact that gang HQs really gave no advantage and were just another way for you to see your fleet and visit the bank. There really weren't many new outfits, cool guns, or swords either.\n\nFinal verdict:\nGet this game if you enjoyed ACIV and would like more of that great ship combat, this is a very solid title and defenitely should be picked up on sale. It adds just enough to feel like it's own story but is pretty plain when compared to ACII or ACIV. I enjoyed playing this game and had fun with it, maybe you will too.","April 7","true","23.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a reskinned version of the great pirate-themed Assassins Creed that came out the year before, but with a few nice refinements. The story is very short and basic, and not that interesting. I never really warmed to the main character that shifts from Assassin to Templar after being betrayed by them. His motivations to change sides seemed pretty shallow, and strangely the Assassins that you deal with in the game act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the Templars act like bros, so it just felt like in this instance, it felt right to swap sides. If this character had been working with another Assassin brotherhood, this would not have happened.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid though, you can run around an outpost swapping between stealth and combat pretty easily, and the naval combat is as fun as ever. You just don't feel invested in wanting to unlock everything or see every location like you do in Black Flag.\n\nIf you are an Assassin's Creed fan, and you can get this cheap, it's worth a run through. It's just not that interesting as a whole. It does however come with a nice revelation at the end that links it into the next game in the series (chronologically) which is Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nPros\n- Solid gameplay mechanics, refining all the skills and features introduced in the previous games\n- Probably one of the easiest to use, and most lethal characters to play as in the franchise\n- The game looks and runs great\n- Nice ending that links up with Assassin's Creed Unity\n\nCons\n- Short and simple story that isn't that interesting in comparison to the other entries in the series\n- You don't end up caring about any of the characters except for the few that were present in other entries in the series\n- Doesn't really reveal anything new about the Templars that we didn't know before\n- No Templar specific skills or weapons. You are basically an Assassin working for the Templars.","May 7","true","21.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I make my own luck."\n\nAssassin's Creed Rogue; The 7th main game in the series (Well main console game in the series. following the events of AC Black Flag, acting as a prequel to the events of Assassin's Creed III. In the first of two recent games in this mighty franchise, we follow the accounts of Shay Cormac, an aspiring, moral-yet-crass Assassin whose only wish is to make the world a better place. From the get-go, we feel a bit of a connection with Shay, but at the same time, you don't really get that strong of a connection until a bit later. After a string of successful missions, Shay learns of an artifact that has been the focus of all the games: The Apple of Eden. Upon learning of its true power, he begins to wonder if what he's doing is the right thing. When things unfold, he is betrayed by those he once called brothers, and is picked up by the Templars and eventually becomes one of them. With a new mission and a new outlook, he hunts down the Brotherhood to prevent them from destroying the world.\n\nI won't spoil more than that, cause that's pretty much the box text, but now to the review itself....I loved this game. It is fantastic. It is definitely a shorter game than its predecessors, but to pack as much as they did in 15-20 hours and still make it compelling? Brilliantly done. This game...was more intense than the majority of the games. In terms of that intensity, I think it rivals that of the Ezio trilogy. Specifically Revelationss. You can feel the deep-seeded hatred and regret that Shay feels for the Brotherhood. He bled for them, and he was willing to die for them...only to have it thrown in his face...I held my breath more times than any other AC game thus far. If you're a fan, I definitely recommend it. I have nothing else to say other than you need to play it. You feel for Shay even if he logic isn't entirely sound at points. The only negative thing about it?...ummm....the combat was a bit choppy when fighting on ship decks and it made chain kills a bit difficult. Aside from that, well done, Ubisoft.

That being said, I'm quite disappointed with this game. I have had nothing but problems while playing it. This has probably the WORST combat and parkour mechanics in the entire series. They're so bad, I just finished a Frontier Clash with so many problems, I felt the need to immediately review this game. Here are a few examples of how the combat and parkour are atrocious:\n\n-you will sheathe your weapons IN THE MIDDLE of combat. Shay just sheathed his swords 4 times while enemies were still around me during the Frontier Clash\n-it's almost impossible to fluidly attack people without an NPC getting in between you and your opponent during a skirmish\n-even if you have a target highlighted, Shay will not attack him but rather someone 10 feet away\n-you sometimes will simply not attack when commanded to and you will have to mash X until he does something\n-the game can't tell whether you want to step off a box or jump off a building\n-EXTREMELY sticky parkour\n-actions are horribly unresponsive!\n\nHere are other reasons why I'm disappointed:\n-the enemies are incredibly stupid\n-the camera is ridiculously bad, i.e. the camera will not follow you properly during combat and especially during a contextual finisher\n-animations are somtimes glitched during cinematics (after saving Gist, the cinematic played with me not being present, then I suddenly desynchronized and fell on the ground dead)\n\nI do not understand why some people consider this to be the best game in the series. They adopted SO MUCH from Black Flag. The combat animations are identical to Black Flag's,  the graphics aren't any better than Black Flag, they literally copy and pasted the inside of the merchant store from Black Flag for christ's sake... The only way this differs from Black Flag is obviously the plot, the fact you're being hunted constantly by Stalkers, the fact enemies can board you ship, and some weapons and minor details. The combat in AC3 is VASTLY superior. I mean, absolutely night and day compared to this. Why they didn't adopt AC3's combat system is far beyond me.\n\nI only recommend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the series. If you don't care about the story or the series in general and want to play casually, do not buy this game. If you are a fan, I'd recommend only buying this on sale.","November 29, 2015","true","40.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A story that is worth while mentioning in this polarizing franchise. Rogue manages to tell a story about an Irishman that decides one day "hey ♥♥♥♥ the assassin's! They can be a-holes for the majority of the time. Lemme join the Templars". Interestingly enough, it works.... and it works well.\n\nFighting assassin's is a lot harder than fighting templars and that's what completely shifts the game mechanics compared to previous entries. Story hasn't been this interesting since maybe Brotherhood. Gameplay is the same as Black Flag with a few minor improvements but still the same. Music is great. Shay is great. Only things I disliked was just how uninteresting the setting was and how poorly textured everything was. It was optimized fine for how simple the engine is but the textures looked like dough compared to Black Flag.\n\nOverall, this was a good experience. I had minimal expectations for this game but it proved to be better than both Unity and Syndicate.\n\n8/10 would sail into Halifax again","February 27","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Assassin's Creed Rogue isn't my all-time favorite AC game (that honor goes to Black Flag), but it makes for an excellent runner-up.  Very solid gameplay, rich in story content, and a view into the Templar order that I've only gotten a chance to see in AC3's prologue makes for a very entertaining and satisfying experience.\n\nThere are bugs, of course, and sometimes I end up yelling at the screen because of the stupid stuff it does, but from what I've read it's nowhere near as buggy or bothersome as its twin sibling Unity, which unfortunately I don't have a copy of (and won't, either, unless it goes on sale for a ridiculously low price in the future).  It's a last-gen game, and was released on the same day as Unity, and of course since Ubi spent all their time focusing on Unity, Rogue feels more like a filler game than a full-on setup.  But as someone who cut her AC teeth on such a filler game (Revelations), I feel that Rogue is good enough to stand on its own as a major title.\n\nSo like I said, great game, very close second-place for best in the series in my opinion (second only to Black Flag), with solid gameplay and a great story that gives a unique look at the "enemy" faction, the Templar Order.  I highly recommend Assassin's Creed Rogue.  It is a very enjoyable game.","March 16","true","50.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Runs much smoother than Black Flag on similar hardware as some Nvidia specific features such as PhysX are not present on this title. In the modern era, the game's graphics will be well handled by a mid-range rig, and a solid 60FPS gameplay experience is possible without any glitches.\n\nStory:\n\nThis game takes us on to the side of the templars, featuring legends such as Haytham Kenway, Shay Patrick Cormac, the great assassins Adewale, and a lot of other memorable characters. I would strongly advice any new player to grab copies of Assassins Creed III and Black Flag before diving into this game, and prerably play Assassins Creed Unity to get a feel of the whole story.\nCharacter development, the game's length and the gameplay intertwine to create a stoey that tells of a man turned by guilt against his brethren to join the Templars, and in so doing becomes driven by purpose and principle, above all else. We see Shay Cormack transform into a lethal Assassin slayer, having to counter visages from his past life using the very skills they taught him. And your part in playing his memories through the Animus is to learn to couner attacks from assassins and to raid their camps. No small feat, and you will be absorbed over tens of hours exploring the open world here.\n\nAudio/ Sound work: Excellently done. The music in this game is expertly composed, and the shanties are a timely and welcome addition to the deep, well-crafted in-game environment. Also, quite memorable.\nThe english speakers are quite fluent, and all in all, a high quality recreation of the characters they represent.\n\nGameplay: Reminiscent of Assassins Creed: Black Flag, the action is split about 65:35 land/sea in missions, and there's a ton of side activities, exploration, assassinations, and naval expeditions to execute in this exhilirating chapter of Assassins Creed. A slight drawback (in my opinion) is that combat , naval expeditions and assassinations feel a bit repetitive (a common ailment of the franchise) and not much innovation has been done to the aging combat system in this franchise. The new story arc does introduce new gameplay elements such as reverse boarding and an easier transition to legendary naval battles, and these are welcome improvements over Black Flag's offerings.\n\n\nOnline/ Multiplayer:\n\nSelf-descriptive. Prepare to spend much of it on land, though. Take hints from the DLCs in that regard. Your mileage may vary, knowing how unreliable Uplay's network connectivity can be.\nI'm aware console gamers may have a better experience here compared to the PC version.\n\nRecommendations: Buy this game in a steam sale, and do not purchase it as part of a Ubisoft bundle as it will cost you more. Buy it separately.\n\nOverall rating: 10/10 , must - own (If you liked Assassins Creed Black Flag).","April 2","true","57.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's nice having the story told from the bad guy's perspective, but it doesn't make them look like the bad guys.  The biggest jerk in the AC series, Achilles, gets what's coming to him & explains why he becomes such a degenerate do-nothing weener in AC3.\n\nIt plays exactly like Black Flag, so I wasn't interested in doing all the side quests and extra stuff as it's basically a rehash of AC4.  Even some of the shanty songs are the same.  I didn't spend much time upgrading everything since it was made from the same game, and as a result, the game is pretty short.  The main story, while good, is extremely short.  If you're not doing all the extra sidequests, be prepared for a short game.\n\nThe rest:\n\nHaytham Kenway has still done nothing wrong and this further proves that Connor should've sided with Daddy in AC3 over that worthless turd Achilles.  Shay is a good guy, doing good things, for the bad guys and quite possibly, the wrong reasons.  Despite him being right and Achilles being wrong, Achilles still doesn't learn humility at the end of the game and calls him out for a "lack of respect" which just about made me yell "oh ♥♥♥♥ off you waste of life".\n\nI hated Achilles in AC3 and he's an even worse character in this game (on purpose though) and while I know Connor did the right thing & sided with the good guys in AC3, it made me mad that he did it so hastily and they never explored what it would've been like if he had sided with Haytham instead.  Granted this takes place 20 years prior to Connor undoing all of the Templars' stuff in America, but it was a nice story to explore.  I like the ending that ribbons over to the beginning of AC Unity.  Too bad I don't have the computer to handle that game yet.\n\nFinal verdict: 8.5/10\n\nMore consistent story than Black Flag, even if it's on the same engine.\n\nEzio > Shay > Altair > Haytham = Edward >>>>>>>>> 50 feet of dog turds > Connor","January 10","true","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I make my own luck."\n\nAssassin's Creed Rogue; The 7th main game in the series (Well main console game in the series. following the events of AC Black Flag, acting as a prequel to the events of Assassin's Creed III. In the first of two recent games in this mighty franchise, we follow the accounts of Shay Cormac, an aspiring, moral-yet-crass Assassin whose only wish is to make the world a better place. From the get-go, we feel a bit of a connection with Shay, but at the same time, you don't really get that strong of a connection until a bit later. After a string of successful missions, Shay learns of an artifact that has been the focus of all the games: The Apple of Eden. Upon learning of its true power, he begins to wonder if what he's doing is the right thing. When things unfold, he is betrayed by those he once called brothers, and is picked up by the Templars and eventually becomes one of them. With a new mission and a new outlook, he hunts down the Brotherhood to prevent them from destroying the world.\n\nI won't spoil more than that, cause that's pretty much the box text, but now to the review itself....I loved this game. It is fantastic. It is definitely a shorter game than its predecessors, but to pack as much as they did in 15-20 hours and still make it compelling? Brilliantly done. This game...was more intense than the majority of the games. In terms of that intensity, I think it rivals that of the Ezio trilogy. Specifically Revelationss. You can feel the deep-seeded hatred and regret that Shay feels for the Brotherhood. He bled for them, and he was willing to die for them...only to have it thrown in his face...I held my breath more times than any other AC game thus far. If you're a fan, I definitely recommend it. I have nothing else to say other than you need to play it. You feel for Shay even if he logic isn't entirely sound at points. The only negative thing about it?...ummm....the combat was a bit choppy when fighting on ship decks and it made chain kills a bit difficult. Aside from that, well done, Ubisoft.

Anyways alhough I do really like this game, I can'g help but feel like this is just AC4 the expansion pack. Yes this game runs buttery smooth on most decent machines, but the graphics are nowhere near as good as AC4 and thats because this game was made specificaly for inferior hardware like PS3 and XBOX 360, which are extremely outdated. Thats why at a $49.99 price point its just not a very good deal. This game should have at least been $10 cheaper. But ultimately I am giving it a thumbs up beacause Im always up for playing more AC4.","March 14, 2015","true","21.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I've been playing it for a couple of hours and so far it's as identical to AC4: Black Flag as FC4 was to FC3. And as good as AC4. I recommend it only if you want more of AC4.\n\n\nUpdate. After a few more hours with the game I found a few things I don't like.\n\nFirst I found a glitch in a fort where the door was closed and I couldn't kill the captain. I'm looking for a way to open it but I'm not very hopeful.\n\nSecond Uplay. That poor excuse of a DRM is harming the legitimate players like me who bought the game and does nothing for the pirates who torrented the game without ever being annoyed by the stupid thing. Uplay is down? You can't play, but a pirate can. Uplay deleted your savegames? Has happened in AC:Unity for some people. Pirates don't have that problem either. Yesterday I had a message coming up during launching the game that said achievements have failed to synchronize or something. Today it's still coming up but somehow I can run the game now.\n\nThird, why does every Ubisoft game have to be packed with collectibles. I'm kinda obsessed about that sort of thing, what they call OCD but it isn't OCD obviously, but in this game they just drive me nuts. Chests, Animus fragments, templar maps, viking swords, prosperity and more. All they do is clutter up my map.\n\n\nUpdate two.

Set between the opening acts of ACIII and Unity (AC:U), the curtain opens to find Assassin Shay Cormic struggling between obedience to his betters and following his conscience.  This story ties into the events of ACIII, Black Flag (AC:BF), Freedom Cry (AC:FC), and AC:U in a way that no other game has yet done, and it does it with remarkable success.  While a step back from the fancy shmancy graphics, details, and crowds in AC:U, Rogue suffers from none of the many bugs that its sister game did, and its seemless gameplay combined with Shay’s compelling story certainly make this game very much worth picking up.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n-	More of the duel naval/land action and side quests that made AC:BF such an interesting game.\n-	Compelling new characters, and a few more chapters with some old favorites.\n-	Largely bug free, relying and improving upon the mechanics developed in AC:BF\nNEUTRAL:\n-	It felt sometimes like a huge AC:BF DLC due to the similarities in game play.\nCONS:\n-	There are only 7 sequences as opposed to the amount that we have come to expect from AC games.  That said, this did not necessarily feel like a short game – there is plenty to do – but I do wish it had been longer.\n","March 28, 2015","true","78.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Get used to that because it's gonna be the focus of the following...\n\nAs you may know Rogue follows the exploits of a assasin turned templar. Some have complained that the whole "Templars are bad guys" angle gets skewed here. Well first off its been stated numerous times that both factions want the same thing but go about it in dramatically different ways. That stills holds true here.\n\nGameplay wise the game feels like Black flag 1.5, this should be a good thing and for alot of parts it is, they've done their usual polish on this and that, streamlined a few features and added some fun new gameplay elements\nThere are alot of visual adders that make the game feel cool too, like excessive powder smoke when you fire your cannons in quick succession its neat.\n\nbut unfortunately alot of the cons still outweigh these positives.\nThe game for the most part runs well, minimal drops in frame rate, occational pop in but only at farther distances and aside from the odd glitch things run well.

Yes this game runs buttery smooth on most decent machines, but the graphics are nowhere near as good as AC4 and thats because this game was made specificaly for inferior hardware like PS3 and XBOX 360, which are extremely outdated. Thats why at a $49.99 price point its just not a very good deal. This game should have at least been $10 cheaper.

The rest is used primarily for crafting, upgrading. And the only thing you can do with tobacco is to sell it. You still have to go through the motions of "selling" it. This shallowness of the series has turned it into an entropic death.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of the series are great, however unchanged and poorly developed over the last decade.

Assassin's Creed Rogue isn't my all-time favorite AC game (that honor goes to Black Flag), but it makes for an excellent runner-up.  Very solid gameplay, rich in story content, and a view into the Templar order that I've only gotten a chance to see in AC3's prologue makes for a very entertaining and satisfying experience.\n\nThere are bugs, of course, and sometimes I end up yelling at the screen because of the stupid stuff it does, but from what I've read it's nowhere near as buggy or bothersome as its twin sibling Unity, which unfortunately I don't have a copy of (and won't, either, unless it goes on sale for a ridiculously low price in the future).  It's a last-gen game, and was released on the same day as Unity, and of course since Ubi spent all their time focusing on Unity, Rogue feels more like a filler game than a full-on setup.  But as someone who cut her AC teeth on such a filler game (Revelations), I feel that Rogue is good enough to stand on its own as a major title.\n\nSo like I said, great game, very close second-place for best in the series in my opinion (second only to Black Flag), with solid gameplay and a great story that gives a unique look at the "enemy" faction, the Templar Order.  I highly recommend Assassin's Creed Rogue.  It is a very enjoyable game.","March 16","true","50.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/recommended/311560/","DeathlessOne","Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/","95 products in account","And now, a review of Assassin's Creed: Rogue.\n\nThis one is hotly contested in the same review rank and weight as Assassins Creed: Black Flag as both games have similar mechanics (Albeit minor improvements in this title).\n\nAs the spiritual successor to Black Flag, combat, game play, game length and the story transition smoothly into the next, and the room for character development and upgrades in this massive open world experience is plenty.\n\nNotes:\n\nGraphics: Sleek and beautiful. Runs much smoother than Black Flag on similar hardware as some Nvidia specific features such as PhysX are not present on this title. In the modern era, the game's graphics will be well handled by a mid-range rig, and a solid 60FPS gameplay experience is possible without any glitches.\n\nStory:\n\nThis game takes us on to the side of the templars, featuring legends such as Haytham Kenway, Shay Patrick Cormac, the great assassins Adewale, and a lot of other memorable characters. I would strongly advice any new player to grab copies of Assassins Creed III and Black Flag before diving into this game, and prerably play Assassins Creed Unity to get a feel of the whole story.\nCharacter development, the game's length and the gameplay intertwine to create a stoey that tells of a man turned by guilt against his brethren to join the Templars, and in so doing becomes driven by purpose and principle, above all else. We see Shay Cormack transform into a lethal Assassin slayer, having to counter visages from his past life using the very skills they taught him. And your part in playing his memories through the Animus is to learn to couner attacks from assassins and to raid their camps. No small feat, and you will be absorbed over tens of hours exploring the open world here.\n\nAudio/ Sound work: Excellently done. The music in this game is expertly composed, and the shanties are a timely and welcome addition to the deep, well-crafted in-game environment. Also, quite memorable.\nThe english speakers are quite fluent, and all in all, a high quality recreation of the characters they represent.\n\nGameplay: Reminiscent of Assassins Creed: Black Flag, the action is split about 65:35 land/sea in missions, and there's a ton of side activities, exploration, assassinations, and naval expeditions to execute in this exhilirating chapter of Assassins Creed. A slight drawback (in my opinion) is that combat , naval expeditions and assassinations feel a bit repetitive (a common ailment of the franchise) and not much innovation has been done to the aging combat system in this franchise. The new story arc does introduce new gameplay elements such as reverse boarding and an easier transition to legendary naval battles, and these are welcome improvements over Black Flag's offerings.\n\n\nOnline/ Multiplayer:\n\nSelf-descriptive. Prepare to spend much of it on land, though. Take hints from the DLCs in that regard. Your mileage may vary, knowing how unreliable Uplay's network connectivity can be.\nI'm aware console gamers may have a better experience here compared to the PC version.\n\nRecommendations: Buy this game in a steam sale, and do not purchase it as part of a Ubisoft bundle as it will cost you more. Buy it separately.\n\nOverall rating: 10/10 , must - own (If you liked Assassins Creed Black Flag).","April 2","true","57.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's nice having the story told from the bad guy's perspective, but it doesn't make them look like the bad guys.  The biggest jerk in the AC series, Achilles, gets what's coming to him & explains why he becomes such a degenerate do-nothing weener in AC3.\n\nIt plays exactly like Black Flag, so I wasn't interested in doing all the side quests and extra stuff as it's basically a rehash of AC4.  Even some of the shanty songs are the same.  I didn't spend much time upgrading everything since it was made from the same game, and as a result, the game is pretty short.  The main story, while good, is extremely short.  If you're not doing all the extra sidequests, be prepared for a short game.\n\nThe rest:\n\nHaytham Kenway has still done nothing wrong and this further proves that Connor should've sided with Daddy in AC3 over that worthless turd Achilles.  Shay is a good guy, doing good things, for the bad guys and quite possibly, the wrong reasons.  Despite him being right and Achilles being wrong, Achilles still doesn't learn humility at the end of the game and calls him out for a "lack of respect" which just about made me yell "oh ♥♥♥♥ off you waste of life".\n\nI hated Achilles in AC3 and he's an even worse character in this game (on purpose though) and while I know Connor did the right thing & sided with the good guys in AC3, it made me mad that he did it so hastily and they never explored what it would've been like if he had sided with Haytham instead.  Granted this takes place 20 years prior to Connor undoing all of the Templars' stuff in America, but it was a nice story to explore.  I like the ending that ribbons over to the beginning of AC Unity.  Too bad I don't have the computer to handle that game yet.\n\nFinal verdict: 8.5/10\n\nMore consistent story than Black Flag, even if it's on the same engine.\n\nEzio > Shay > Altair > Haytham = Edward >>>>>>>>> 50 feet of dog turds > Connor","January 10","true","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

If you liked Black Flag, you'll like this too, it's very similar.. They made some improvements in the gameplay that are really good.. Then, why do I not recommend this game?\nI was really looking forward to this game, to try what it would mean to be a Templar.. Unfortunately, you can't, because after, what, 7-8 games where the Assassins were ''the good guys'' and the Templar ''the bad ones'', Ubisoft decided to change that.. If you don't watch the cutscenes, you'll feel like an Assassin fighting against Templars, where it should be the opposite..\nLet me say why I feel this way..\nFor 8 games, the Templars have always had the advantage, right? Even in the present, they have the advantage.. Well, in this game, Ubisoft decided that Assassins should have the advantage.. They've gangs set up in every city, with headquarters, leaders and power, while the Templars, that ALWAYS had the advantage, even from the crusades, now are nothing more than a bunch of 3-4 guys that fight against the control of the Assassins.. In 8 games, it has always been the opposite..\nAnyway, if this reason's not enough for you, there's another one..\nTemplars are the bad guys, right? They want to control the world, they want to put everyone at their feet, right?\nNo. Wrong! In this game, the Templars are the one who want to see the colonies become a place of prosperity and freedom.. I'm non exaggerating, those are the exact words of one of the Templars' General.. And the Assassins? The Assassins are the evil gang that, in a mission, create poisonous gases to use against innocent citizens.. INNOCENT CITIZENS.. And you, a Templar, stop them and save the city.. Oh, and don't we forget about the part where the Assassins nearly destroy the world for error, and who's there to stop them again? Oh, right..

There are some gameplay details that are slightly improved/extended and a good bunch of new areas to explore. It's neither reinventing the wheel nor moving away from proven ideas and as such solid/good enough in gameplay ways.\n\nBut there are story/character details that are bugging me.\n\nThe Assassins vs Templars thing is getting old, least when done like here. Other reviewers are praising how the Templars are shown less evil, but that happens by what felt as a cheap switching of sides. The labels "Assassins" and "Templars" were basically exchanged. It's the same concept that I may have seen too many times: An "arms" (Precursor sites) race between both sides that ends in just another undecided semi-tie. Your present self being - like in Black Flag - an uninteresting name-, face- and voiceless Abstergo employee referred to by another character only as "numbskull" (and openly so - perhaps he should quit the job or submit a complaint about bullying?) roaming the same Abstergo Entertainment offices as you did in Black Flag, albeit less crowded, to relive/play through the life of an Assassin/Templar that is never mentioned elsewhere and brings no conclusion to anything (there is a small tie-in to Unity, but it doesn't look like there was much to it) hardens the feeling that Ubisoft stalls the progression of the overarching story to keep up the facade of a reality-imitating, self-advertising and never-ending franchise.\n\nShay turns his coat for an event that - despite its severe impact on parts of civilian life - could be seen as a petty misunderstanding. "Dude, just talk to them again, don't be so hasty!" one might want to tell him. It feels forced. More so by how the Assassins, least those Shay is opposing, are now supposed to be reckless mass-murderers who suddenly don't care as much about their buddies or civilians and who are now sharing some of the same silly speeches upon facing death as your cliché Templar baddies. ("Hah, we tricked you all along you fool! But since I got nothing better to do while dying in this puddle of blood before you I'll just give you a hint towards our super-secret plan to rule/free the world regardless only so you can foil it! And while we're at it: Please take this Precursor artifact as well, I won't need it anymore, dead as I'm soon going to be!).\n\nIt even feels like a kind of insult that the Assassins you fight - some important figures from previous games - seem to be lacking their own skills. They are sometimes prancing about small areas of objectives literally waiting for you to air-assassinate them only with nameless grunts/thugs as meatshields. (Apparently trying to stay "under the radar" has become irrelevant to the Assassins, a bunch of people that can only be called  common gangs put a variant of their signature symbol all over places and are bullying and terrorizing civilians on their behalf). You can kill them as easily as any stupid Templars. They hardly feel different, and it's just as hard to actually regret what you are doing. They are depicted as sort-of-madmen throughout many parts. (They lack the evil voices and cold-blooded slaughtering of disobedient minions, but they aren't far from it). Shay is often voicing doubts about his actions against either faction (if he isn't pronouncing cockily for like the twentieth time that he "makes his own luck"), and his voice actor is doing rather good, but it won't help the overall feeling that things are forced and shallow. The intention must've been to blur the lines between both factions but despite probably best intentions it's done in an unimpressive, predictable, boring manner.\n\nShay has no great motivations. Proper reasoning has never been the strength of the series but it falls flatter here than ever. He feels very non-descriptive, siding with whoever would help him best in his vague concept of saving civilian life. And as luck would have the Templars are there when he just bailed the Assassins and got away against all odds - how convenient. He has lost no family (Ezio, Connor), he wasn't genuinely wronged by anyone (Altaïr), he has no social injustice to deal with (Aveline, Adéwalé), there is no one for him to swear true revenge to. What he cares for aside from all the factions bickering is hardly given any exposition and if it weren't for rather lucky or unlucky circumstances no one necessarily intended to have happen he might have never joined any faction to begin with. At one point he compares the lustful ladies of different places but that kind of character trait was already served with young Ezio and Edward Kenway. Even the latter with his fits of greed and wishes for an "easy" and "good" life he would want to "taste" was more tangible and sympathetic than what the rather cold and blank Shay can muster. Him switching sides happens rather quickly, you don't get warm with his friends/co-Assassins either, and a minute after having met them you pretty much know you are going to fight them so why even bother?\n\nSomething schizophrenic: You can kill civilians without desynchronization. Fans of the series might have secretly wished for that in years. But it's highly anticlimactic considering Shay betrays the Assassins only so he can save civilians instead of mass-murdering them. Even if you cast that faulty logic aside: It's not much fun killing civilians anyway because bounty hunters will be "sent" after you almost immediately (they spawn close to you out of thin air once your "wanted" level hits stage one - after three civilian kills - and they instantly jump you) who annoyingly block/parry a great part of your attacks in an otherwise highly unchallenging and massively forgiving game. A lack of difficulty isn't something bad per-se, I play the series mainly for story/characters/exploration, but such ways of artificial difficulty spikes aren't exciting to deal with when done so bluntly and a real bummer when meant to throttle down on a new feature before it had even a chance to prove itself. But I guess there had to be strict limits to this or else age ratings might have shot up a level.\n\nWhat genuinely disappoints/annoys me is that the present-time story is absolutely not progressing. Some dubious Abstergo superior is trying to tell you your work is oh-so-important and stuff, acting and talking to you in irritatingly vague and mysterious ways spurting hollow and meaningless phrases ("You will understand soon", "Be prepared for the coming time" etc. - I had to roll my eyes whenever I heard such lines, I'd consider quitting such a seemingly trivial job if people started talking like that to me). I believe the present-time story is one of the more interesting aspects about the series as it holds more potential and freedom in writing than the past-time scenarios that are necessarily forced to roughly follow historic facts and to avoid time paradoxi (balance of power) making even the best of them predictable in ways. But I guess the present-time story cannot be progressed as much without leading the entire series to an end, so as long as Ubisoft won't be willing to do that it will not advance at all or only at a snail's pace. Which is a ♥♥♥♥ing shame.","November 27, 2015","false","51.9"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","18","37","3","0"

Yes, that's what I was lead to while being persuaded to buy a "game" that was on sale. After waiting some time for the game to download, and when finished I was ready to play the game. Adjusting my seat in front of my setup, slipping on my headset, activating the product on Uplay, I then launch it. The usual stuff "Multicultural influances, staff, historical stuff, blah blah." Then Ubisoft logo, Abstergo Industries, then the game title logo comes up "Assassin's Creed Rogue", lastly it shifts to the title screen with the caption of "Press a key".\n\nThis is where the magic happens. I press Enter, strangely nothing happens. Press Space bar, Nothing. I press W, nope. A, S ,D , Shift, Ctrl, Left mouse, Right mouse, Nothing happens. It then goes back to showing the usual AC game start up stuff, and pressing keys skip through the individual bits. I was appalled to what was happening and escaped thanks to the magic of Alt+F4. I launched the game again to see if I could get past the Title Screen, and to disappointment I could not. Then what I soon concluded was, I bought  Assassin's Creed Rogue, a AC game start up simulator edition. I looked online to see if others had this version of the game and found that only a few others had this.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the usual keys get you through most of the logo stuff, there's not much of a story, the color palette of what there is consists mostly of blue and white. I suppose Ubisoft intended there to be a game here and all I got was this, $11.99 and 8.2 GB for a Start up simulator.","February 11","false","45.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","1"

I absolutely loved Black Flag -  after Unity being such a flop and hearing good things about this, I decided to pick it up. More Black Flag I thought - yay! However, from the moment I started playing I got very bad texture flickering. After a quick google search I found it was to do with Nvidia drivers and rolling back (which I'm not prepared to do) would fix the problem. Disabling V-Sync also worked, however I now witnessed horrific screen tearing. This really subtracted from the experience for me and seemed to remind me more of the fact that this game is "last gen". Added to this were numerous other graphical glitches (invisible enemies, low res houses etc...) that I wouldn't have minded if they had been distributed over the entire course of the game. For them to occur so frequently in the first hour however...... well I wasn't filled with that sense of awe I'd had when playing Black Flag. Shame. I was dissapointed with the setting (the snow just didn't cut it in the same way that the Carribean did) but that's just personal preference. The story seemed promising so far but the voice acting let it down. Combat seemed bland and buggy (sound effects at the wrong time, enemies randomly stopping/running into each other).

Tried a few fixes I found online, like moving the files into a different folder (from steamapps/common into another harddrives equivilant). Nothing has worked, and there is no support from Ubisoft. I actually know two people in my personal life who have this same problem, and the statistical unlikelyhood of that happening (plus seeing all the similar complaints online) leads me to believe this is a common problem.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clehjett/recommended/311560/","clehjett","Frye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clehjett/","29 products in account",""I make my own luck"\n\nThese are the words that define a hero. Shay Cormac was young and idealistic. But throughout his life, he remained loyal and compassionate.\n\nAs a hardy AC fan, I was reluctant to get this as this is the story of an Assassin going rogue, turning coats and crossing over to the dark side - especially since I heard great things about Rogue. But I had never been more wrong or more clear in my love for this game and the others\n\nPrevious AC games were quite 'traditional' in the sense where the bad guys were bad and were easy to hate. But as said in my review of AC3, it started to blur the lines. This is where the Kenway line comes in. Beginning from Connor and Haytham in AC3, the grey areas of the Assassin-Templar conflict shift and change. It is not just about right and wrong anymore, but the means and intentions of achieving peace and such.\n\nThis is the story of a man living in time when the Assassin Brotherhood struggled hard to maintain righteousness. This game truly sets the tone of the question - 'Are all Templars evil? Are all Assassins' good?' From here on out, its a devil's trap, and you cannot help but see the grey and its A LOT harder to pick sides\n\nGameplay is much the same as the AC3, AC4 world. The naval combat and ground combat is the same as before, but set in a new and crisp environment. The graphics are way more stable than Black Flag, with no point in gameplay where glitch nor bug appeared - for me at least. The famously annoying amount of collectibles has returned, and its up to you if you wish to catch them all.\n\nPlot is the compelling masterpiece. Not only does this tie in AC3 and AC4, but also a branch into the French Revolution in AC Unity. By this point, it would be good to mention - for maximum emotional impact, to play this first prior to ACU. Shay's story is dark and riddled with emotional turmoil. Betraying his former ideals and betrayed by his own brothers - the Creed is suddenly dark and unforgiving, something not seen since the Altair days.\n\nSet in the Seven Years war which was a significant historical event which arguably was the impetus of the fall of the British hold on America - starting the American Revolution, and also the fall of the monarchy - kicking of the French Revolution. During this time, you will understand why Achilles in AC3 was so bitter and sad, how he learned life the hard way, and why he tries so hard to make Connor see it too. In this time, you feel the echoes of Black Flag, with the confrontation of Adewale, and his former captain's son. This game shows you the effects of the novelisation of AC3, Forsaken - Haytham choosing Templars over his conscious self and turning aside emotions.\n\nShay has to cut and kill his way through friends and family, to protect the world from pride and war. The Assassins are no longer the good guys, and Shay - a new Templar, is seemingly the only one more concerned with the lives of innocents than the conflict itself.\n\nSomething most other Assassins cannot say they have done.\n\nBy the end of this, though short but bittersweet, the emotional wallop is compelling. Be ready.","January 13","true","42.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, they still look good. They are improved from the 360/PS3 versions and the game runs at 60fps on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop with an Intel GPU, and there are plenty of PC options to customize, so the PC port is good.\n\nGameplay\nTo sum up the gameplay quickly, it is basicly a big expansion to Assassin's Creed IV. All of the elements from IV return and are either the same, or improved in some way. A few new minor mechanics are here too, but there isn't enough to say it doesn't fell like an expansion. The game is about an assassin turned templar, so a new mechanic where assassins hunt you is here. They dress up as citizens and when they attack you, they take off a huge chunk of your health, so you better watch out for them. The platforming can be a bit clunky, but other than that, it's a great game.\n\nReplay Value\nAfter you finish the 15 hour or so long story mode, you can explore the open world, which has tons of different side activities. Overall, you can probably get about 30 or so hours out of this game.\n\nScore\n8/10","December 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's billed sort of like "Black Flag 2", but it's really more of a Black Flag beta. The animations are jerky and inaccurate, the voice acting is gratingly horrible, and the story makes next to no sense whatsoever. I really liked Black Flag, and I even liked AC 3, but this is just a really blatant cash grab. I think Unity was shaping up to be a POS (and it mostly is), so Ubisoft panicked and cobbled this together to keep the cash flow coming in.\n\nDon't waste your time.

It lacks the in depth story telling from AC1 through Revelations. All the gameplay mechanics are still there. I'm not much of a fan of the ship game play as it feel tedious to me. none of the missions really stood out to me either. The game took me about 2 months to finish as it failed to keep me interested enough to play it through in a short amount of time. Being a fan of the series I forced myself to keep coming back to it incase there's anything important story wise for any future games. The ending also sucked and came about what felt very abruptly. It didn't even really feel like achieved any particular goal by the end of the game.\n\n(Edit: After starting Unity, I see why it ended where it did. It still didn't really feel like the ending was much of an end goal though. It's basically a prequel to Unity showing some events leading up to where Unity starts. Doesn't change my opinion on the game much though)\n\nIf you're a fan of the series it may be worth picking up for what little story continuation it offers but otherwise I wouldn't bother or get it on sale.","February 6","false","22.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I remember seeing the March release date for PC, but I forgot about it. I went to get Syndicate the other day based on a friend recommendation (AC was my favoite franchise, until Unity ruined everything, lore-wise. So no pre-ordering anymore), and saw a 11/19 release. Well, I needed my AC fix I was set on.\n\nAfter scrolling through a couple reviews and seeing the 'very positive' rating, I went ahead and purchased it, full price. I could not have been more surprised and pleased.\n\nThey took the good things from Black Flag, and spun the story around. It was incredibly refreshing! The redundancy of the Assassin's actual creed, missions, and beliefs were starting to get to me. Their story was always told with the Templars being the ultimate evil, while hinting that what the Assassin's were doing wasn't much better.\n\nIf you're an AC lore junkie like me, you will be very fulfilled with Rogue. Lots of goodies just like Black Flag. It's not without some terrible controls and parkour "stickiness," but they are minimal and you learn to cope. The ship battles are improved, and the world is as big, if not bigger than Black Flag! Lots of side areas and places to go.\n\nThe ONLY downside is I feel the main story is incredibly short. A couple more sequences would have been nice.\n\nSome might complain about the gfx, but it's obviously a last-gen console port. On highest setting it is still immersive and good looking. Sound is good, and music is great.\n\nOverall, I would give this a 8/10","November 1, 2015","true","74.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was actually a big fan of Revelations (I liked seeing the end to Altair and Ezio's chapter in the same game, and I really liked Constantinople setting, despite the reviews) and this game rivals that. I think the story of why Shay chooses to revolt and turn "evil" is very well explained with the scene that unfolds in Libson. I did feel that more backstory for those who associates with would have helped. The constant assassins trying to attack you seems annoying, but it actually makes sense from a story point of view, I just may have handled it differently how the mechanics work.\nThe good things from Black Flag remain, yet the New York setting is superior to any of those in Black Flag IMO.

As someone who has played every AC game (minus the portable/tablet games), I would actually rank this one the lowest.\n\nTo me it feels like a glorified expansion for AC4. It recycles all the mechanics from AC4, with a few minor tweaks, and calls it a new game. As someone who has played a lot of AC3 and 4, there was really nothing new here, and I found it rather boring. Even the story, which is mainly what I was interesting in checking out, was a waste. The characters are all two-dimensional, and the protagonist's motivations are paper-thin. Sure, this has become standard for AC at this point, but still sad to see the wasted potential here. All the interesting stuff is actually hidden away in Templar letters that you must seek out as side objectives. And to top it off, [Spoiler Alert!] I was not happy to have to kill Adewale. Wasn't worth it! [End Spoiler]\n\nThis should have been a $20-30 stand-alone expansion to AC4. As such, I recommend to anyone still debating buying it to just wait for a good sale on it. Rogue is a game that was clearly made on a shorter timeline with a smaller budget, and to do that they simply recycled assets and ideas from previous Assassin's Creeds, cut the story short, and generally put out a subpar experience.\n\nAnd I think I'm in the minority in saying this, but I had much more fun with Unity and I would recommend spending your money there instead.","March 22, 2015","false","22.9"," 47 of 96 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","47","96","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squishyderpy/recommended/311560/","squishyderpy","Squishy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squishyderpy/","324 products in account","Well, I can not in good conscience recommend the game.\n\nFirst of all, there are no improvement over black flag, if anything, it is a lot worse.\n\nThe map designs are as bad as they are in most  AC games, unfortunately. Free running, but only on paths the level designer allow. So, you end up in many spots, where the ground is just above your knees, and you can neither climb, or jump. You can however take the long way around, which the level designer decided was the only option.\n\nAt least, it does not have all those stupid dancers/fighters for hire :).\n\nIt does however, suffer from AC1 syndrome, which is grind... Blackflag was grindy, but the amount remained reasonable, coupled with the ship/pirating which was kinda new(with the boarding mixed with all other naval stuff going on). Rogue does not benefit from this "new feeling", on top of this, the map is a LOT bigger than AC4 it seems... sound good right? Well, not so much. When you have only about 5 things you can do, but you need to do them, a LOT. That is grind, it's not enjoyable. AC1 had the same issue imo...\n\nThe game also suffers, like most AC games, from consoleportization, an unfortunately common disease these days... As such, every climbable points, will look exactly the same, as usual in AC games I guess. Once you've seen the 3 or 4 possible climbable textures, well, you know how it goes in other AC games... I wish they'd reworkd the maps and textures, pc's are not console, they can handle a little variety... please, enough with level designs made entirely of copy/paste from like 20 items :(.\n\nSo the levels feels a lot like AC3/4 materials, slightly altered, and off you go. It does not feel like they bothered to design new models or textures. If they have, the addition is invisible.\n\nThe voice acting from the non cinematics is atrocious. If you do not speak french, you'll probably be sorta ok. If you speak french, prepare to be annoyed very quickly... The npc's keeps repeating the same 2 sentences, over and over and over and over and over... It is utterly ridiculous, and there is no immersion at all. AC4 felt a lot better on this point imo. This is particularly bad after helping out soldiers in those mini battlefield side activities. At the end of the fight, they just keep saying there'll be double ration, the captain is an idiot, and we won, non stop, forewer it seems :S. I am hoping it is just a bug, and will be fixed, as it is truly annoying. NPC's in towns/villages also seem to do it, with their not so random chatter, it is breaking the poor amount of immersion there is.\n\nIn short, they ♥♥♥♥ed it up :)\n\nI'm nowhere near done with the story, because the game bores me so much, it is actually hard to finish it, due to boredom.\n\nA new "activity' was added, which consist of helping soldier in small battles. You'll get a couple of different objectives, which includes destroy something (one or more), kill the captain, and cut the flag. So, same as a boarding, except it happens in a forest... and this is where it screws things up... to cut the flag, you need to be anoymous, while the flag is usually surrounded with enemies... PRoblem is, if the allies all die, you loose and have to wait to a reset... which means, because they are usually utterly worthless, you'll have to run to the flag, and hope no enemies tags you, otherwise, you'll usually be screwed due to the AI being utterly stupid.\n\nCouple of new weapons have been added, which are the same as before, but with a small AOE effect on them, so hardly "new" per say.\n\nAnother addition is "stalkers". Assassin's trying to kill you. While I understand the concept of it, they are simply annoying. While you're trying to hide from guards, or simply exiting a mission area, being surprised by a stalker is fairly annoying. I don't really like those, sure they fit the lore, but do they REALLY need to be that many virtually everywhere? I mean, 7 stalkers, in a non mission area, in a forest, with only 2 collectibles, no village nothing? They certainly want me dead if they're stalking virtually dead spots on the map just waiting for me... Once again, immersion breaking. It makes no sense that they can be present virtually anywhere, including in places only there to make the world seems larger, and are not included in the actual story :).\n\nAll in all, get it if it's on sale, as in a really good sale, like 75% or more, otherwise, don't waste your money :)","March 21, 2015","false","46.4"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","22","46","2","0"

Basically the exact same gameplay, but with a new world, characters, storyline, and freezing water.\n\nThe world is broken up into different smaller sections you have to load in to, instead of being one big map.  I haven't come across any storms (tornadoes, rogue waves, etc) so I don't know if they exist (one of the things I loved about Black Flag).  Blowing up ice bergs in battle is neat as it causes a small wave that damages smaller ships.  The story feels like it is lacking a little bit right now, it's not really explaining much of anything.  Hopefully that picks up.  Combat mechanics are fluid and ship battles are still epic even without the storms (again I don't know if they exist or not).  By the way, you can pick up bodies and toss them in the bushes which is a big plus.\n\nI do feel that it doesn't quite live up to the epicness of Black Flag like I had hoped, but fun nonetheless.  It is pretty much a gigantic expansion pack worth about $35-$40 in my opinion.  I'd wait for a sale, but if you don't mind spending the money go for it.

I was waiting for this game to come to PC as they announced this at the time  of the console release so I was busy playing AC Unity and other games on PS4.\n\nThis PC version contains the bonus DLC (deluxe edition) so is well worth the purchase. That is, if you want to play it now, if not pick it in a sale in a year or so. Ubisoft have returned to that style of naval combat with a typical assassin's creed style ala  'AC:Black Flag'. I have yet to join the templars so I am intrigued at how the story will play out,\n\nA very well done port, nice polished graphics which run in 1080p+ at 60fps fully optimised with nice controllable gameplay.

The reason I say this is that I have only played fully AC1 to Revelations + a little bit of blackflag. I have heard from others that there isnt too much new content when compared to AC3 and Unity but if you havnt played those then this is just a fantastic game. The description of the story in this one doesnt do it credit. I expected some decent plot about a betrayed assassin who decides he wants revenge, the story is so much better than that though and it only makes playing as a templar more vivid and complex. So if you wish to play this game and you havnt played the recent ones (fully, 10 hours or so into one or two should be fine) then I recomend this game. If you have played every recent game, then I suggest you check out the content a bit more to see how much is genuinely new before picking up but the story is still worth it.","March 11, 2015","true","24.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

On one hand, it has a tendency to be INCREDIBLY inconsistent, as evidenced by the bungled release of Unity. Yet, for some reason, I continue to come back to it. Maybe it's because I'm a history buff, and few 'casual fans' of this series actually appreciate how many of the depicted in-game events actually happened. For example *SPOILERS* in the opening sequence of this game you find yourself in Lisbon in 1755, site of one of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history.\n\nI sank (haha, because pirates) a HUGE amount of time in ACIV. I'm new to PC gaming, so I played on console, but I would guess I played for 60+ hours total. It had an awesome setting, good protagonist, and was brimming with stuff to do. I'm reviewing this game a bit early, having currently only played for about 8 hours. Thing is, it doesn't take an AC veteran like myself long to figure out what this game is. It truly is just a redeployment of the ACIV forumla. Luckily, it was one HELL of a winning formula, and this game succeeds BECAUSE it emulates it predecessor. Based on what I've seen you can take the number of things there was to do in ACIV and TRIPLE it. This gaming is BURSTING with stuff do. If you liked Black Flag, you'll like this game all the same.","April 14, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story. It's all about perspective, anyone can be a villain or a hero based on their choices.\n\nWhat I didn't like about AC: Rogue? It was short, compared to other Assassin's Creed games. There are six sequences with some short bonus memories for Shay. The extra missions outside of the main story, well it just didn't feel as organically designed as Black Flag. There is quite a bit of travel back and forth, and navigation in the River Valleys is really annoying. There's more side activities than I think actual story - but don't get me wrong.

I don't know why, or how, but I can completely max it out on my rig with pretty steady 60 fps whereas AC IV and even AC III would make my computer bleed.  I think Ubisoft secretly released an amazingly optimized, fully-formed, and enjoyable AC game in the wake of Unity (not even going to try to run that mess on my PC).\n\nAs for the story, I LOVE it so far.  It picks up where AC IV left off in a way, putting you in the shoes of a selfish and hardheaded outsider.  Only this time, you're (hurrr spoiler) the "bad guy," a Templar, dispelling those self-entitled and whiny Assassins.  As a pretty big AC fan, I have to say, it is weirdly satifisying to dispatch members of the Order, almost disconcertingly so.\n\nOh, you know how awesome it was messing up fools on the high seas in AC IV?  You can do that too, with improved and expanded combat, new weapons, and NEW SEA SHANTYS.\n\nGraphically, it looks like AC IV but runs like a dream.  Granted, I'm on a discontinued AMD 6100 and a GTX 770, but for me, it's really quite nice.  I guess it only took Ubisoft 2.5 games to get their engine optimized for PC...\n\nAfter AC II, this is my favorite in the series so far.  If you're a AC fan, buy it now.  Otherwise, just buy it on sale.\n\n8/10 (incomplete review)","April 3, 2015","true","18.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomad22/recommended/311560/","nomad22","Nomad22","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomad22/","197 products in account","A Creed worth fighting for\nDespite being released on last generation consoles in November the PC release of Assassins Creed: Rogue has been one of the best releases from Ubisoft in a few years. It is not haggard by bugs and general Hiccups like Assassins Creed: Unity which up until recently, began to be playable. However, was it worth the wait, is this a Assassins Creed: Blackflag with a different skin.\n\nWe trade the gorgeous Caribbean for the cold bitter North Atlantic. It shows within the few moments of gameplay when you no longer see the lush turquiose waters and see dark blues. Considering that this game uses the same game engine (Anvilnext) as Black Flag, you should not expect any ground breaking graphics like with the case with Unity. If you played Black Flag, it is basically the same. If your toaster could run Black Flag, you could run this game, and then some as with the tweaking for optimization was already done for Black Flag. One can assume that a lot of the areas are copy and pasted from Assassins Creed 3 such as New York, but in fact, those maps have been Redone to have the same amount of "life" as the towns in Black Flag had.\n\nWhat makes Rogue stand out, is the fact that you play as Shay Cormac, who is a Templar. The theme of the predator has turned into prey is enjoyable, as when you do hunt for assassins, they do employ assassin tactics on you. Rogue is best if you have played Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag, and Unity. A lot of characters from those games do appear in Rogue as either some from Shays time, or from Connors time. But for new comers, the game does provide excellent detail on each character, as well as historical videos to catch you up to speed as rewards in some puzzles. The story is predictable, but it does show insight on the Templar way of thinking.\n\nIf you played Black Flag, then Rogue is similar in it's play style. Assassinate people, ride a boat, and be a privateer. However, there are new elements to the game, such as having a dart gun, using your ship to break the ice, and actually having to be weary of other ships attempting to board my ship.\n\nThe game however is not without its gripes, it is the same formula. Black Flag was ground breaking in the sense that you had new mechanics in the game. To be honest, this feels like a cash grab, but a cash grab in the sense that Ubisoft cares a tiny bit for the players that the game itself is actually playable on launch.\n\nIs this worth $50? Yes it is, well to me that is. It is the same content but creatively used to provide a refreshing experience. It is a good thing that this is not priced at the normal premium of $60. Quite honestly, this is one of the most refined Assassins Creed that has used the AnvilNext engine, and we would have to wait a few more games after Unity to get the same refinement.","March 12, 2015","true","22.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game, after sequence one, begins to open up, and while Shay's mechanics are the same(except for a gas mask, which makes him immune to smoke bombs if you pull it on time) but no more diving segments. However, here's what makes the game unique: You are a templar, so, now, instead of fighting the Templar guards(Don't worry, normal guards are still there and you can fight them), you fight the assassins. Fitting of how the assassins have always worked, they will hide and take cover to stay out of shay's sight. Get too close, and they perform an assassination, effectively taking out half your health, then run away(Like the Stalkers in AC:R). But, since they are now trained enemies, don't think you can chase them and just stab them, no, that is how you die. Instead, shoot them.\nBut, better off, you can use your eagle vision to search them out and kill them. You can approach their hiding spot and just stab them(though you have to be quick for that), or shoot them. But, if you aren't fast and out of ammo, shay has several options for getting them out of cover. I haven't played too far into the game, but this is a unique change in gameplay, intercepting assassinations and others of the such.","March 11, 2015","true","42.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

Namely, this time around, not only can you board other ships but they can board you as well. And there's a grenade launcher.\n\nYou get to see things from the Templar's perspective this time around, and instead of handling it in a "these are the bad guys, these are the good guys, the end" type of way, it really greys the line between the Assassins and Templars. The game sets the scene for both 3 and Unity, dealing with characters from both games. Adewale makes a return as well.\n\nThere's not much else to tell, really. You can read about the synopsis elsewhere, and as far as gameplay goes, like I said, it's pretty much the same as Black Flag.

They didn't even bother changing fighting animations so fighting with a sword and dagger looks awkward as Shay uses dagger as Edward used a second sword. Lazy production, £40 quid is only worth if you are a big fan. Ubisoft seem to exploit us, as now I feel like I have to thank them for optimizing game well, which is their job anyway.\nI am dissapointed in Ubisoft. They tried new generation of consoles with AC Unity, but the fact that they were unable to produce a good quality game, but managed to get this one fairly OK, shows that they are not ready for next gen. They cannot handle it yet. After months AC Unity is still unplayable. AC Rogue is good enough though, for £20, not more.","March 10, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

The game was not properly optimized to play well, at least not with an AMD graphics card.  It crashed at least once an hour, sometimes 10 times in an hour.  The plot isn't fantastic, either.  AC4 had a very satisfying story, and I was constantly looking forward to finding out more, but Rogue just didn't have that for me.  The premise was great, and it looked like it was going to be fantastic, but they really didn't do a great job with it.  I did enjoy the new mechanics to ship warfare, but that does not justify buying the game, because all they did was adjust a few small things and add iceburgs.  If you want a solid game with a better story and exciting ship battles, stick with Black Flag.  The story in this game did not even touch half of the locations on the map, and the crafting plans for some of the upgrades call for animals I never even came across.  I ended up just buying the pelts in the store.  Whaling is exactly the same as Black Flag, except for chunks of ice that you might end up hitting.  All in all, I'd give it a 3/5, simply because Black Flag was twice as good in every respect that matters.","May 21, 2015","false","24.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

I didn't know I actually had to wait a few months for the pc version to come out shortly after the console version came out until I looked it up myself, but considering the fact that ubisoft is trying to straighten there so-called "relationship" with pc gamers, I guess they decided to hold off releasing the pc version to make sure that it had a good port.\n\nBecause of this theory I made up, I decided to stay up till 12 am so the game can come out, spent 60 bucks for the deluxe, become everyone's guinea pig, and was ready for yet another badly ported game. Turns out I was wrong\n\nNow the question you ALL been waiting for. Is this game a good port?! The answer: yes (My specs: evga gtx 970 FTW w/ intel core i7-4790K @ 4 ghz)\n\nI know I may be criticized on saying that its good since I only played this for 1 hr (since I was tired and all) but let me tell you, the numerous problems known in black flag and unity? Well, you can kiss all that goodbye. There's no capped fps or lag (ahem...black flag) and no crashing, even worse fps, lag and glitches (ahem...unity). Ubisoft kept me waiting for this game, and if they DID try to straighten there relationship with pc gamers, they certainly fixed MINE up, not all the way, but for the most part.\n\nNow is the game perfect? no, obviously not because you gotta consider, this game is still made by ubisoft. During my first hr, I experienced very. VERY little lag and bugs, but none that can ruin the overall game itself.\n\nThe next thing I wanna cover is the graphics. If you looked up this game, you might know that this game was made off the black flag engine, not unity. But keep in mind that this game doesn't actually look as good as black flag and looks more like the graphics off of ac3, even with everything maxed out, but the game still looks gorgeous anyway, and the snowy envoronment definetely adds on to that category. Also note that the game does have some references from past AC games starting with the first one, so if you want to fully understand on what or why this event is explained or why this person is said even though he's not in the game, it's best to play all the past AC games to get a full understanding.\n\nAll in all, this game is definetely a good port, and definetely playable by all means. One thing I hate about ubisoft is there ability to create such great games only to have it thrown in a compactor and crushed because of a lack of porting and optimization and both black flag and unity are perfect examples of that. But I loved the AC series so much that I put almost 400 hrs into unity even WITH capped 20-30 fps simply because it had a great story, gameplay, and really indulges into the french revolution. You can say that I was torturing myself, but when it comes down to rogue, I honestly do believe that no one will experience any problems in this game unless there really picky with lag and bugs (its really barely noticable to be honest). So to put it bluntly, yes, I do recommend this game to anyone, and maybe at the current price tag as well.\n\n\n","March 9, 2015","true","23.3"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","15","40","0","0"

But I think I should get my money back.  Parkour seemed fun at first, but it doesn't really rely on the player skills. Rather, the game does the job for you.  Also, the character movement (maybe this is a problem for the PC version, I don't know) is far from smooth/natural compared to other PC games I've played - unless this series does it on purpose like some non-action horror games do to frustrate the players. It made me feel sick looking at the movements.  I truly don't understand the hype.  To me, it's one of those games that make players at any skill level feel awesome while there is nothing so challenging about it - except the unnatural movements/commands.

The remainder were mediocre at best, Unity and Liberation are both disasters which I still haven't finished. Especially Unity with it's overly clunky climbing, clunky link-in to "companion app" and the awfull gameplay in general don't make for an impressive game, especially after such an excellent effort as AC4. (I am aware of my excessive amount of black screen hrs, but this is due to some kind of executable which didn't close down even after both Steam+Uplay apps were forceably closed down, and no I never shut down my gaming rig).\n\n01-Oct-2015:\nTwo weeks ago I tried running the game again, after a full reinstall, changing my dual screen to single screen.

The optimization is damn near perfect, the seamless control switching from controller to mouse+keyboard is amazingly easy.  The touchscreen menu functions are great for people playing on a touch laptop.  Gameplay wise, it's pretty much the same as Black Flag, except now there are more incapacitation options.  The locations are beautiful, the story rival's Ezio's in quality.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic.  Though no game is perfect, and Rogue is certainly no exception to that.  Like every Assassin's Creed game, the parkour system is imperative to the game's success.  The free-running in Rogue is amazing, the terrain was well built and designed for fast paced running and killing, though the place where the parkour falls a bit short, are in settlements and New York, where there are many buildings with angled roofs.  Now there is a slight problem with climbing up an angled roof from the side.  This problem makes it so you occasionally freeze in place and can't climb up or down until you shuffle to either side before you can move again, even though you should really have no problem with climbing up.  I'm sure this will get patched soon, as it is an easy fix.  The ocean combat is pretty good too.  I haven't played much of Black Flag, and I hated the ship combat from AC III, but I hear it's great in Black Flag, and it's not that big of a deal to keep something that works very well in another game that involves the same kind of setting.  Since this is an Ubisoft game, the enemy spawning is awful, and none more so, than in the ocean.  There WILL be times when you board a ship after incapacitating it, and after you are through collecting your stuff, there would be another ship bearing down on you.  Believe me, when you get good at handling the Morigan, you will be able to dispatch these fools easily, and you will even be able to take on a Man-o-war without much trouble.  But then again, if you are coming to this from Black Flag, you would already have plenty of experience with ocean maneuvering.    Combat wise, it's pretty great.  A major step up from the AC III engine.  Now, there are no longer whole platoons of soldiers that track you down to kill you for bumping into someone.  Hiding is pretty easy, because there are bushes pretty much everywhere, and you can always use them to sneak around and take out a couple of guards, or you can play it non-lethally and just sneak.\n\nAll in all, Rogue is an amazing game compared to previous installments in the AC series.  I would highly suggest Rogue over Unity (if you are looking for story quality)  Unity was a bland, dry Ctrl C+ Ctrl V of Ezio's story, Rogue has the main character (as well as you) thinking about your allegiance to the Assassins, and how your ideals may differ greatly from them.\n","March 19, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The character Shay Cormack was an assassin with high expectations and was sent on an inportant mission that goes horribly wrong leading to a chain of events that put Shay into the templar order.\n\nBut the doesnt make him a ruthless killer as through the story he hasnt got any full aligences with the templars e.g when you are sent to kill a friend from the assassins Shay will be all I dont know if I can do this (spoiler: he does) and he says it didnt have to be this way.\n\nOverall Shay Is a great charecter and only die hard assassins creed fans will hate him only because he is just a templar.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf you liked black flag you will love this game. The naval combat is back with a few tweeks like leaving a trail of burning oil on water, rapid fire swivels (now called puckle guns but dont worry they still sweetspot) and a more offensive front weapon called carronades.\n\nTheir is one problem I have now this could just be my com♥♥♥♥r but when boarding a man oh war or frigate I get quite a frame drop which can be a bit annoying but it could just be me :D\n\nThe combat is the same as black flag, nuff said\n\nOvarall good controls and if you think the naval combat controls are terrible your just bad at the naval combat. B)\n\n\nContent: This game has a okay ammount of enjoyable content and you will get rewarded as most stuff can get you a really good outfit or weapon OR ship decorations.\n\nOvarall good ammount of content p.s I didnt want to spoil the types of side missions there are just so you get more excited. :)\n\nVerdict:\n\nPros: Good story, Great Protagonist and Quality content\nCons: Short story, Frame rate drops while boarding a ship and NO LEGACY OUTFITS PLS MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR UK AND OTHER PLACES THAT DONT HAVE THEM, thank you :)\n\nOvarall: 8.5/10\n\nIf you want ubisoft to get to work on the legacy outs fits error please retweet this disscussion to them\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/311560/discussions/0/617330406664648098/","March 29, 2015","true","72.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the story is still pretty bad for it, when in Rogue the story is great.\n\nIn Unity I barely got to know any of the main characters, aside from Arno, Elise, and Bellec. However in Rogue you get to see characters that you met in prior games, but also new, fun characters. Also you gotta love the naval combat.\n\nAnother thing that was wrong with Unity's story was how it was arranged. That Bellec fight shouldn't have been in the middle of the game, but at the end, and should've had it be a sub-plot in which he was killing members of the Creed and Arno was trying to uncover the mystery. In Rogue, though, they aranged it perfectly, from being an assassin in the beginning, becoming a Templar in the middle, and finally at the end finding out what was up with those messed up memories.\n\nThis game did much more to further the Assassin's Creed story in a whole than Unity did, in my opinion. Also it wrapped up the Kenway games. I felt this game should've been the main one.","March 25, 2015","true","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you loved Black Flag, you will love this one even more. Gameplay is somewhat similar to Black Flag, that includes hunting, crafting, being a pirate, upgrading your ship, combat, collectibles, taverns, etc. However, there is more than that. There are new additions to the games which makes the game pretty much awesome to play, I am telling that from what I have encountered so far, but there could be more interesting things to do in the game. You can even hunt polar bears now, and they have added more animals you can hunt. But, that's only the minor upgrade to the game, there are other nice additions as well.\n\nAt first, the gameplay looks like another Black Flag with different environment settings, but after hanging on to it for a while, the game turned out to be pretty good with a good story line to follow. Nice graphics and minor neglictible glitches. If you have second thoughts about buying this game, don't, go ahead and get this one and enjoy the game.\n\nGG.","June 9, 2015","true","44.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

AC Games haven't had the best reputation on pc after AC IV: Black Flag and AC Unity. But I can for safely say that this game is very solid.\n\nI got this game on the steam summersale with the Unity-Rogue bundle and I am not dissapointed.\n\nPROS\n- In the terms of graphics this game is no stunner. Almost similar to AC IV: Black Flag with a few improvements. Then again it's surely not an ugly game either.\n- The setting is great, sailing in frosty seas, and the game really does a good job giving you that feel.\n- Even out of the Animus, there is lots of interesting things to find, as you repair computers and find notes. Much more interesting than in AC IV: Black Flag. Some things could for examble be a video with a interesting take on a charrecter we have interacted with or seen in other games!\n- Even though this game seem alot like AC IV: Black Flag and surtainly plays alot like it. They have managed to create a new game out of old stuff.\n\nCONS\n- The story is short. I completed this game in around 14-15 hours, with me slagging a bit. (Doing side objectives and so on) There is still more I can do and explore, but as for the main story it falls a bit short.\n- Price: For as good and solid game this is. It is not worth 50€. Especially if you have played both AC III and AC IV: Black Flag. Not to mention it's short story compared to the price, and many of the sideobjectives are nearly identical to the ones in AC IV: Black Flag, just with a little twist.\n- Bugs... Ah yes, what is an AC game without it's bugs? I have played them all, and I have found a bug in each one of them. It being console or pc they are still there and this game is not free of them either allthough very minor. The bugs I incountered: Assassinated a npc in a bush and your charrecter froze completely and couldn't move, where I had to restart the game. / Stuck on loading screen. / Unable to block even though I clearly pressed the button in time.\n- As a one last con... Uplay.... This game requires a 3rd-party DRM (As all ubisoft games do on steam.) and I can tell you that it just doesn't work. Crashing, half of the features not working, and very clunky to use. Especially because it doesn't work well with steam. So if you buy this game (Or any game from ubisoft) do be aware that.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll in all this is a good game with a heavy pricetag on it for what it is. Basicly an AC: IV: Black Flag game in AC III settings, with you playing as a templar. If you can get this game on a sale, it's definetly a win! Especially for the AC fans out there.","July 5, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/recommended/311560/","thelolrusgamer","The Lolrus Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/","176 products in account","Truly amazing compared to Unity. They really should've focused on this instead of Unity and added a hell of a lot more to the game, but hey, it's kept me occupied for almost 70 hours trying to 100% it (Howwever, many of those hours may have been me in the pause menu doing somerthing else as the in-game statistics say I've spent about 38 hours. I don't know way really. Anyway, it's good). Anyway, to the review.\n\nGameplay: Almost identical to Black Flag except instead of being in the Caribbean you're in the North Atlantic and some place, I believe in Canada, known as River Valley. You're also are allowed to revisit New York from AC3 only it is a hell of alot more attractive and somewhat larger. This game is essentially AC3 and 4's love child. Some new features include being hunted by Assassins and being able to turn the hunter into the hunted by taking out the Assassins. You can also be borded yourself now by enemies, and you will be forced to defend your ship. They've also brought ziplines back, I don't remember if they were in AC4. There's also gases now which you can counter the effects of by equipping a gas mask (basically a bandana). There are some bugs, check the cons section for more info. Also, free running can be a bit of a pain like previous AC games.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are a bit dated but they are better than 3's and either a little worse than 4's or as good as 4's. There are also quite a few graphical options to tinker with. New animations seem a little clunky though, and a lot of animations are recycled from previous games. The game performs a lot more smoothly than Unity.\n\nPlot and protagonist (or I suppose in this case Anti-villian): This is seriously the most satisftying plot I have ever encountered in an AC4 game. The ending - my god the ending - is so damn awesome. The only problem is the story is very short - only six sequences, and if I recall correctly, sequence 5 is only 2 missions. D': Anyway, you are Shay Patrick Cormac (oh, and some unnamned guy/gal in the modern day), an Assassin turned Templar after he begins to doubt the Assassin order (or is it just Achilles brotherhood?) and their intentions. That's pretty much as far into the plot as I'm going to go in this review, however. Character's previously seen in the series include: Benjamin Franklin, George Washington (shortly), Achilles Davenport, Adewalé and Haytham Kenway. Most new character's are quite interesting even though they aren't on screen very long as the story is short. Shay is a fresh character, although a bit too selfless and doesn't seem to care much for himself (or perhaps his goals only seem selfless? Personally, I think his character was just made far too selfless) and he seems to have an obsession for the phrase, "I make my own luck!".  Just in case anyone's wondering where he came from, he came from Ireland, so I suppose this may explain his obsession with luck! (PLEASE DON'T HATE ME, THAT WAS A JOKE! D':)\n\nMusic, sound effects and voice acting: Shanties are back! Weigh-hay and up she rises, Weigh-hay and up she rises, Weigh-hay and up she rises... right, yeah, sorry... Got a bit distracted there... Anyway, the music is mostly either recycled or a slightly altered version of a previous song from a previous games soundtrack. Still it's good quality and sounds good. The sounds are again mostly recycled but are good quality. The voice acting is for the most part quite good. Gist's american accent sounds far too exaggerated though (if that's the voice actors real voice... Well it's just so stereotypical!) and whenever you finish hunting any natuical creatures - whales, sharks, etc. - the crew yelling "Yeah, All right!" sounds really outdated and is awful quality. Other than that, it's pretty good.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nPros:\nFamiliar gameplay with new elements.\nFresh, satisfying and interesting plot and protagonist.\nLot's to do.\nPlay's smoothly.\nA good comeback for the AC series, if only it was a main game that was focused on more.\nYou're playing as a Templar! That's good in my book! I love 'em more than Assassin's! Sorry! In all seriousness, that offers another side to the story.\n\nCons:\nQuite an awful lot of recycling, but it is in a big series of games that have been going for quite a while, so it's expected\nWould like a few more new gameplay elements.\nSome, but very little, voice acting is shockingly bad, or at least of bad quality (Only really one line though, although it's repeated a fair bit).\nShort story.\nAlmost a signature of the Assassin's Creed series; free-running can be a pain.\nSome bugs... I got stuck inside my god damn ship and died in the freezing Atlantic Ocean... Twice! Also, I once encountered floating weaponry fighting one of my crew members when bording a ship. By that, I mean, an enemy model was invisible.\nSome new animations are clunky looking.\n\nVerdict:\n\n8.5/10\n\nA real fresh comeback for the AC series which is actually fun and mostly plays well. Fun, character, fun gameplay, fun story. If you're a die hard AC fan - and if you like Templars more than Assassins (like me!)... You do NOT want to miss out on this!","August 24, 2015","true","69.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story actually makes sense which is nice and the choices made by the character are sense and have a nice payoff. The settings are varried between North America and the North Atlantic giving some variety which I appreciated. The property management system of Brotherhood is back which adds time and things to do. There is a ton to do in the game alongside the mainstory. I completed the main story and some side objectives in just over 20 hours.\n\nThe game takes place during a time where well known historical figures are alive but are not shoved down your throat like they were in ACIII which is great.

About how while I applaude them making the parkour much better, especially for PC, it's performance is terrible and requires a rig that only the tiny minority will actually have. Plus it isn't that good of a story to begin with.\n\nThis game is different though. It's treated as a side story. Something that is unimportant to the main storyline, something more for the diehard Assassins Creed fans, or at least the ones that didn't want to buy a new console. But the story is really good, much better than it's Unity brother. The main character's story is much more interesting. Seeing the Templar side of the story made me actually sit back and question the overall question that Assassins Creed as a whole asks. "Is it better to have peace through freedom or through control?"\n\nBefore playing this game I was firm in thinking that the Templars are wrong and that they are bad and evil. But then I played this game to see the otherside of the fense. While the thought of giving up freedom is something that we as humans fundimentally are against, the cost of having said freedom often leads to outcomes that aren't necessarily for the benefit of everyone as a whole. I often questioned whether or not the Templars maybe be in the right. Afterall we all willingly give up some freedoms that we as humas can do with laws. We give up physical freedoms with rules that we have implimented for the benefit of us all.\n\nOf course what's most important is the gameplay, not the philosophical aspects of it. Basically saying, if you liked Assassins Creed IV's gameplay, you're going to enjoy this game greatly. Sea chanties, slowly pased options to finish levels without alerting anyone, AI that isn't terrible in comparison to Unity. It has everything to love. Although I do have to say the whole Abstergo Entertainment portions of the game are the weakest parts again. It's cool if you're into the lore of the Assassins Creed universe, for most it's just a waste of time.\n\nSo all in all is this game worth buying? Well that's up to you. Unfortunately it does follow the curse of the yearly franchise. Not much changes but it's still a good game. If you've not played Black Flag definitely play this game. It's got the best story tie ins in all of the Assassins Creed games, intertwining with Assassins Creed 3, 4, and Unity in a VERY fantastic way.","July 4, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is excellently optimized. I'm running it in 1920x1080 on a Core2Quad Q9400 @ 2.66 GHZ, 8 GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 650 1GB, and except for some of the post processing options (e.g. volumetric fog) turned off, everything is on high or normal and the game looks fantastic. Steady frame rates throughout, whether on land or at sea. A little frame drop happens after some bigger ship battles when a lot of smoke and fire have to be rendered during boarding operations, but it's still perfectly playable at that point. A slight sluggishness feeling is the best way to describe it. You could try and tweak overall performance by lowering the resolution a little and then potentially add more effects to see how far you can push it, but that's personal preference. The game looks great regardless.\n\nGreat job Ubisoft! I was actually very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe controls are all fully re-mappable as well; both on foot and for ship controls, so you can choose whatever you like at your heart's content. Considering this isn't an option at all in "Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China" at all, to me, that's a great plus.\n\nStorywise I can't really say too much just yet, I've only scratched the surface (will update this review when I know more), but so far it's fun and the scenery is actually really, really beautiful. I suppose you could just blast through the storyline, but I actually enjoy just roaming around a little, procuring some resources for crafting and generally checking out the area.\n\nBottom line: Whether you're an AC veteran like myself and enjoyed the entire franchise so far, or whether you're new to the Assassin's Creed games, this is one of the best installments of series, and if you want to give any game of the franchise a go without being too picky to play them in order (important plot elements from past games are explained well enough for you not to miss out all too much), I would either go with this, or with Assassin's Creed II.\n\nEdit, July 5th, 2015:\n\nHaving played this now for some time, I can definitely say this is as much fun as Black Flag. It's a bit more of a "civilized" and "tactical" warfare than the random privateering you get in Black Flag, but it's definitely worth it. I'd probably call Black Flag "GTA IV" where Rogue would be "Watch_Dogs". Don't let that comparison frighten you though (if you don't like either or one of the comparisons). It's a great game, you can manage a fleet, resources, follow the much more on-track mission, or just free-roam for as long as you like. You definitely want to grab another hide for that pouch you always wanted. Despite the role change, Shay does grow on you, and the added possible attacks by your former brethren at any turn, definitely are a nice touch. Great game. I stand by it.","June 17, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a ton to do in the game alongside the mainstory. I completed the main story and some side objectives in just over 20 hours.\n\nThe game takes place during a time where well known historical figures are alive but are not shoved down your throat like they were in ACIII which is great.

It was realized alongside Unity, but feels much more akin to games from the last few years. There's a sailing sandbox much like Black Flag had, now set during the 7 years War in the 1760's, the hunting and crafting mechnianc that's been there since III and the old "Capture enemy outposts to claim teroritory" thing from Brotherhood. So it's pretty much Black Flag 1.5.\n\nNarratively it's a bit more interesting, picking up from the plot thread in Freedom Cry(the mysterious Templar) Package, Shay Patrick Cormac, is a new assasin who slowly turns his back on them and goes to work for the Templars. The result of which is the destruction of the Colonial Brotherhood, leading into it's miserable state Conner found it in III.\n\nSo essentially it's a bridge game. It fits in the gap between IV(and Freedom Cry) and III, with a story connection to Unity as well. It fits in much the same way that Revelations did for the Ezio games, in that it's a little different but an awfully lot of the same. Sadly playing as a Templar is much the same as playing as an Assasin, except that every so often the Assasins will pop out of nowhere to try to murder you(though, having played as an assasin, you should have a pretty good idea where they would hide).\n\nIt's a fine game and an interesting chapter in the series, but it's not going to be anyone's favorite AC game.","December 8, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhilgeman/recommended/311560/","jhilgeman","jhilgeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhilgeman/","596 products in account","The most important question: Is this game fun?\nAnswer: YES!\n\nLike everyone else has said, it's pretty much like Black Flag with a few minor additions and a very slight change in scenery, so if you liked Black Flag, then you should enjoy Rogue, too.\n\nThat said, it's not AS polished as Black Flag was. It feels like maybe they skimped on the QA process with this game in order to get it out the door.\n\nTypically the AC games have had a polished introduction that walks you through all the major concepts, and gives you a good sense of who your character is, but not Rogue. Not only do you have no idea who your character is besides his name and that he's somehow associated with some kind of crew, but this game starts you out on an island where you can start picking up collectibles and treasure maps and all that stuff right off the bat, so it sort of expects you to be familiar with the mechanics... but then later walks you through concepts that you've already done. There were all sorts of questions that remained unanswered ("Am I an assassin already or am I enroute to becoming one? Who are these other characters around me? How did we get here if the captain's ship is miles away? What are we doing here?").\n\nIn the very first intro mission, one of the optional objectives is to not be detected by the guards while you take them all out. However, the game doesn't really explain what constitutes detection. Does the appearance of a red circle indicate detection, or is it only when it's filled, etc...? I hadn't played Black Flag in several months, so I couldn't remember off the top of my head and I restarted that memory several times trying to achieve complete stealth. It was only AFTER all of the mission criteria was completed (rescuing the prisoners, not just killing all the guards) that I was awarded the optional objective. So again, several small things that could have felt a little more smooth, but it was still fun to play.\n\nThere have been a couple major bugs that I've come across. For example, at the end of one mission, you're suppose to air assassinate a bad guy to get 100% synchronization. However, the guy was stuck in some water and therefore did not go anywhere and could not be air assassinated. I could still shoot him to finish the mission, but if you're the type that likes the 100% success rate, you might need to replay some of the missions. In some cases, I was never informed of a second optional objective until AFTER the mission was finished, making me have to replay it for that 100% rating.\n\nThere are LOTS of medium-sized, annoying bugs like getting trapped inside a wall, having your body (or other bodies) disappear on rare occasion, and stuff like that. The most annoying bugs have to be the little navigation/free-running bugs, where you are standing next to a completely climbable wall, yet the character will simply refuse to climb unless you run AWAY from the wall and then come back to it. There are also short rock walls that should definitely be climbable (running up them even puts half your body above the next level, but he just falls back down), forcing you to find an even shorter wall. Shay also seems very a little too eager to jump off into the middle of nothingness and fall to his death, even with a perfectly good haystack or other leap-of-faith-catcher mechanism nearby.\n\nSome bugs are just minor glitches with easy fixes - when I first ran the game on a 1920x1200 monitor in a multi-monitor setup, the setup menu didn't detect my resolution, and so it left it as "Unknown" but when I tried to switch to the windowed mode without setting the resolution first, the game would crash. Again, small things, easy fixes.\n\nAs far as the graphics go, I don't know what other people are whining about with graphics - I think they look pretty good. Maybe people are getting spoiled and expect leaps and bounds with every single new release of a game. I feel like Black Flag was a little brigher and more colorful, whereas Rogue has a more dreary/darker color palette, but it's not like they're bad graphics by any means, and the game runs fantastic with all the settings turned up.","December 8, 2015","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first is ok but really hard towards the end, seriously that one has some frustrating sword combat, which is amazing considering the cakewalk the combat become in all subsequent games. The second one has the most rounded and fulfilling story and gameplay.\n\nThen after that one Ubisoft f*cked the modern story sections where you played as Desmond. I'm glad i didn't bother playing revelations or 3. Black Flag was the only game before Rogue that i actually really enjoyed and that i didn't have to force myself to play, and that is mainly due to it being a pirate game first and an Assassins Creed game second.\n\nRogue is now my favourite Creed game, it has slightly more refined ship to ship combat than Black Flag, and they added smoke effects after you fire your cannons, so you can't see sh*t in front of you, which forces you to use tactics and change position rather than just sit in one spot firing your cannon balls. It also has mainly wintery enivronments as opposed to Black Flags tropical ones.\n\nThe other cool thing is that this is the first Creed game that has your character join the Templars, so you see most of the game from their point of view which is really cool. There is also one part that without spoiling it caught me completely off guard, i actually can't remember the last time a game had an event happen that genuinely surprised me and was also f*cking awesome.\n\nIf you have never played a Creed game before then start with Black Flag and then this one. These two games still have all the building climbing and assassinations of the other games, but also when you get bored of doing that you can sail around blowing ships out of the water and harpooning sharks and killer whales to your hearts content.","December 10, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This takes place after AC4 and before AC3 ( AC3 happens after 4). This is VERY similar to AC4. You get an air rifle that shoots darts and small grenades. Some missions have you stop assassins instead of just killing someone which is nice. Did I mention this is similar to AC4? They added the multiplayer system to the game, which means that some npcs will hide and do huge damage to you if they catch you. Its ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when they get you while your busy doing something else. Im REALLY glad that im almost done playing in the same environments in 3 games. All the locations look the same in this and AC3 and 4. Next is Unity which is in Paris. EDIT: Don't bother playing any Assassin Creed games on pc ever. Ubisoft is leaving pc users in the dust.\n\nLike the other Assassin creed games, there are times when it can get very frustrating. You often will just want to kill people instead of being stealthy. You have to go after your friends who you betrayed, but catching them is so ridiculous and difficult that you actually want to kill them. They run through groups of guards who can outrun you and stop you, and they drop poison gas bombs and randomly turn around to shoot you, which cant be dodged. And if you are out of bullets you are screwed. I will often have to restart a chase because I ran into something like a chair  and tables which you can't climb over. Sometimes when you are climbing to get away the climbing system screws up and you suddenly cant grab something you clearly should. As Im typing this Im waiting for the 30 min long credits that you cant skip. This is also kinda like AC4.","November 4, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The masterpiece, Rogue was left in the shadows. This game is AMAZING. It's as fantastic as Assassin's Creed 4 (No doubt because it has the fantastic sailing mechanic, alongside many of AC4's mechanics). The protagonist is interesting, so are the other characters. Even for a last gen game, it's still pretty and the performance is great (I've encountered a good solid framerate, only sharply dropping once or twice for me for no more then a few seconds). What dissapoints me is that this game was left behind and not focused on, while Unity, a buggy, poor mess got all of the attention.\n\nAs per usual for Ubisoft games though, it's got that annoying Uplay stuff which is utterly annoying. Ubisoft really should scrap it. Still, it doesn't affect the game as much once it's initially launched.\n\nAs someone who's played all of the Assassin's Creed games, Rogue stands strong as one of my favorite games in the series (Very slightly behind AC4: Black Flag) and I strongly recommend that anyone who enjoyed any of the Assassin's Creed games should get it.","December 31, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shey is a relatable character and you definitely care about the characters by the end. there is an over world like in black flag with its own charecters and plot. script was good set pieces were good voice acting was good bla bla bla. the exciting part is it beautifully pulls together assassins creed 3 4 and unity in a marvelous way by the end. no spoilers. if you have played all three of those games and then moved on to unity and syndicate and felt jostled or like you missed the jump that's because you didn't play this game. really i cant stress how cool it was to see the missing link here. i really don't want to spoil anything so i'm going to move to closing.\n\nthis game marks the end of in my opinion the second trilogy of assassins creed. hear my out. this is the last of the last gen assassins creed games and it really feels that way. you have assassins creed 1 which was a proof of concept and kind of a stepping stone to get away from the prince of Persia. the ezio trilogy self explanatory. then came 3. where 1 and 2 drooped you in a city that you got to explore through out the game (or 1 of like 3 major cities) 3 introduced a more open platform. they gave you some land to traverse. it really made you feel like the journey was more important then the destination. black flag definitely followed suit on that. it was all about exploring islands and sailing on your bad ♥♥♥ boat and being a pirate. rouge as i have said is more black flag and there you have it. the second trilogy. to bring it home rouge is a more mature black flag. they fixed the awful tailing missions and really focused more on narrative then the characters. it marks a clear end of an era and syndicate and unity start a new one. we probably wont ever get another game like black flag or rouge and that's OK. we have gone back to 1 big open city and that's fine.  rouge doesn't make you feel sad to see it go. you feel a sense of closure. a sense of fulfillment. like saying goodbye to an old friend. i really liked this game and i really recommend it to any fan of the series.","December 29, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game several months after Unity, which I played once and it crashed my system. I returned Unity and decided to take a break from Assassin's Creed for a while but kept seeing advertisment for this game. So after a while I buckled and bought this game and I have to say that I was not disapointed. This game built on everything that was great about Black Flag and put more on top. While some feature of Black Flag are not included, being able to weild four pistols and being able to dive for treasure, it honestly didn't drag down the expirence.  I logged about 49 hours on this game so far, I finished the story in about 35 hours, taking my time going for upgrades and becoming slightly obssed with the fleet missions. However the two most disapointing aspects of this game I would have to say is the way that you are yanked out of the Animus, ruining the immmersion. Secondly the fact that this time around outfits are disapointing and require you to make all this effort with slight benifits. However if you are looking for a good Assassin's Creed game to sink your teeth in, I would recomend this highly. For those who are into 100% for cool rewards I would temper your expectations.\n\nOverall Score:\n9.5/10","February 25","true","49.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are memorable as well as likeable, the setting is fascinating, the music well crafted, and the gameplay that was started in AC3 is perfected here. New features to ship combat and land weapons make for interesting new scenarios and the story serves as a nearly flawless prequel to AC3 and lead in to Unity with references to various points in AC history that keen-eyed fans will love to see. The framerate is also very impressive as it runs mostly around 50 FPS if not greater and only stutters in snowy regions of the game.

An assassin question the creed's cause after the massacre caused by attemping search for pieces of eden, and finally become anti-assassin.\n\nBut the details, well, I don't know it is careless or the plot is written by different group of people, some of them seems mismatch with previous sequel.\n1. Master Franklin, Master Cormac\nWhen first see a templar call Franklin as Master Franklin, "What? Franklin is a templar? Then why Haythem did not know him or vice versa?". And when Munro call Shay as Master Cormac, I am speechless. It seems templars calling anyone respectable as master in this sequel while this did not appear in previous sequel, not mentioning how weird would the person not templars feel while being called Master.\n\n2. Killing civilians\nGenerally, assassins don't kill innocents, so do some templars like Haythem and Shay. Throught out the series desynchronisation would be engaged if you killed 2-3 civilians. However in this sequel, despite the warning "This ancestor don't kill civilians or domestic animals", nothing happened.\n\nGameplay\nWhen I reach sequence 3, I am so happy the renovation system is back! Generally the gameplay seems like a well mixture of revelation, blackflag and unity, except too much collectibles. The freerunning puzzles for pillar and templar map are good, while the other seems like the same of just dfferent set.\n\nAnd bugs, yeah, annoying bugs, so do glitches:\n1. Why the hell would I fall while climbing the second level on a tree? This tree is just the same with others!\nAlso appear in little building. Well inherited from AC: Unity lol.\n\n2. How fascinating the camera is buried into objects, in the scene after upgrading ship or Eagle Sensed Templar Cross!\n\n3. Graphic glitches too often, hover over ground, fingers nailed into wood or stone during climbing or grabing somthing. It looks like Ubisoft applied Blackflag's motion data while it is not calibrated with new character model.\n\n4. Another bug inherited from previous sequel. Unexpected interruption of motions/skills\nSome motion or skills would be disrupted by high profile movement like climbing and falling. Players will understand that, of course you can't change bullet while climbing. What players not expected is, running or walking down a mild slope will often produce slight jumping or cripples, thus interrupted changing bullets, etc. Similar happens in AC:Unity also while the disguise is ended because you walk down the one step in front of a shop.","April 4","true","48.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I immensely enjoyed that game for the most part. When I sat down to play this game, it felt familliar. Almost too familliar.\n\nAt times, Assassin's Creed Rouge can feel like a bit of a rehash of AC4 in terms of it's mechanics. It just feels simillar. However, that doesn't take away the quality of the game itself. All of the things that it's utilizing from AC4 are good. The story is very interesting, and different. The main character Shay is an Assassin who betrays the creed turns to the Templars. The reason why he did this was very understandable if that makes sense. Now, the Abstergo Entertainment office work is, well, it's there. Nothing too interesting, and on par with AC4's Abstergo segments. The ship mechanics are pretty much exactly the same as AC4, along with the combat and assassinations. If I had but one flaw with the game, it would be that the story felt a couple hours short. It felt like I beat the game fairly quickly, even while taking my time and getting stuck on missons.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed Rouge is a great entry into the AC franchise. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise, or if you're just looking to play a really solid game.\n\n8.5/10","April 5","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The chainball cannon gun at the front of the ship is replaced with two cannons that fire two normal cannon balls.\n-THERE ARE NO EAVESDROPPING MISSIONS.(But there is like one small part where you tail a ship)They were terrible and boring in previous AC games.\n-The main character Shay isn’t a super memorable character, but he acts way more like an assassin (especially an evil one) than other assassin characters in the franchise (Connor in AC3 was very immature and boring).\n-There are lots of returning characters from AC3 and Black Flag that have some really good performances (Adewale was my favorite returning character.)\n-Like Black Flag, you are an employee working in Abstergo Entertainment (different person though). I’ve always liked walking around the office and finding collectibles instead of playing annoying Desmond in a dark cave.\n-The combat on land is still very well done. The finishing animations still look awesome.\n-There are these new enemies called the Stalkers (They are assassins that would hide in areas you would hide) These enemies actually make Eagle Vision useful and essential.\n-There are still the same pistols and darts that you can use as well as the new 3 grenade launchers (Sleep,Beserk, and Shrapnel) are excellent additions to your arsenal to take out a large group of enemies.\nThere are lots of references to previous Assassins creed titles (Especially 3 and Black Flag) that tie in really well with the story especially in the end.\n-There are a couple of fun missions that take place in foreign places like Portugal, London, and France.\n- The 7 Years War plays a fitting part in the story.\n\nCONS\n-Some of the new characters (especially on the Templar side) are super boring and bland (The worst is your quartermaster Gist.)\n- There is not much character development for some of the "villains" you will be trying to kill.\n-The main story is 9 HOURS long. (Black Flag was about 21 hours)\n-The ending of the game seemed abrupt and out of place (like a cliffhanger ending, but the ending with the employee at Abstergo was okay)\n-The new Puckle Gun that replaced the swivel gun seemed WAY overpowered during the boarding of ships. Also there is too much ammo for the gun.\n-The enemy (not ship) A.I is still bad. You would be slicing a captain of a ship with your swords while his officers and privates just stood there and watched. It was rare to see more than one enemy attempt to kill you. They are also terrible at spotting you when you are sneaking around.\n-Some islands and areas in the game seemed completely empty with nothing to do but run around and climb trees.\n- Before some tough naval missions, the game would not tell you to upgrade and restock your ship before beginning the mission. (One instance was I had to fight a frigate AND a brig, then right after a MAN OF WAR.\n- The boss battles seemed way too easy for what they were built up to be. The bosses (except Hope and Le Chasseur) were basically weak like the normal enemies in the game.\n- There were not many puzzles and when there were puzzles, they were way too easy (Especially when you have to access the terminals when walking around the Abstergo buildings.)\n- There would be glitches when boarding an enemy's ship, the ship's floor would look completely white for some reason (Not because of the snow).\n\nFinal Thoughts- With many AC fans being disappointed in the next generation AC Unity (I have not yet played Unity), Rogue in my opinion is a solid large expansion to AC 3 and Black. But the game is still plagued with the usual bad A.I and took a step back with taking away some of the creative puzzles that I enjoyed from previous AC games. With a creative story that gives you different perspectives of the Templars and the Assassins, the story shows that Ubisoft still knows how to make creative storylines. Also it is cool to see some of my favorite characters from AC 3 and Black Flag make a return to the series. While I do have to say that there are some new weapons and combat mechanics (Grenade Launcher, Being Boarded by ships, Ship Weapons) that make the game more fun, Rogue is more of a mix of AC 3 and Black Flag. If you did not enjoy those two games, do not buy Rogue. But if you enjoyed any one of the two, I recommend Rogue as your AC game this year (since there is not one coming out this year). Just remember that this game is way shorter than previous AC games. If you are new to the franchise, I recommend starting out with Black Flag or some of the earlier non ship games (Brotherhood,AC 2) to find your preference.\n\n7.5/10\nRecommended for AC 3 and Black Flag fans","February 18","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game I have very mixed feelings about, for while it is undeniably a good game, I can't help but feel some sense of disappointment, as I think it could have been so much better...\n\nPerformance: It works!!! After the absolute disaster that was Unity, I refused to buy another AC game for PC without waiting to see the community's response (Still can't get Unity to work for me over a year later). Obviously Ubisoft is making an effort to improve their treatment of PC releases, as this game runs, for the most part, beautifully on my machine with the graphics settings pretty much maxed out, and I run it on a laptop with a core i7, 2.5 Ghz processer, and an AMD HD8970 graphics card, so we're not talking about a particularly beastly computer here. The only real issue I encountered was a consistent crash to desktop as soon as the game started, unless I set the environment quality to normal, which seems to have been a somewhat widespread problem. However, this issue was easily resolved and hasn't affected my enjoyment of the game at all, so I'd say it's mostly negligible.\n\nGraphics: The game looks beautiful, with some really breathtaking environments. Assassin's Creed is one of the only games that after years of play, I still find myself just stopping and looking around at the environment, in awe of the level of detail and love that went into crafting these historical recreations. Of particular note here are the stunningly reflective waters of the Riverlands, and the sprawling and lively cityscape of New York. With that in mind, however, it should be noted that many of the models and animations are ripped directly out of previous entries in the series. A lot of what you see comes from AC3 or AC4, and while this didn't bother me in most cases, one thing that greatly disappointed me was the animation set for Shay, the main protagonist. Almost all of his combat finishers and free-running movements are virtually identical to Edward Kenway's animations from AC4, who already borrowed animations from Connor in AC3. It really took away from Shay's characterization, and I found it especially disappointing considering Ubisoft went to the trouble of crafting new animations for Adewale in Freedom Cry, which was merely a DLC expansion for Black Flag. You'd think a full release with a new protagonist would get special treatment, but instead they just lazily recycled animations we've already seen before. Bad form, Ubisoft.\n\nSound and Music: I got chills when I started up this game and heard the opening theme. This brilliant piece weaves together themes from throughout the series' history, including the AC3 main theme, "Ezio's Family" from AC2, and a very Irish take on what sounds like the "British Empire" theme from Black Flag. It really brings on the nostalgia for the greatest moments of the series, and leads you to believe that you're about to witness a pivotal moment in the series' overarching plot (sadly, this doesn't quite come to fruition). Overall, the music is really great in this game, epic and grandiose, and I loved the Irish flavor they brought to the table to accompany the series' first Irish protagonist. As always, they really hit the nail on the head here. As for sound effects and voice acting, you'll hear a lot of familiar sounds from AC4, which didn't need improvement, and the voice acting is as good as ever.\n\nStory: To me, this is where the game really failed to deliver. We were promised a plot that would turn the series on its head, showing us the world from the perspective of the Templars, blurring the lines and making us see the humanity in both sides. Unfortunately, I would argue that the opening sequences of AC3 already accomplished that much better than this game ever did. I wanted to like Shay Cormac, our rogue-ish hero, but I just never really cared all that much. Especially after the emotional rollercoaster of Edward Kenway's pirate adventures in AC4, everything here just felt cold and disconnected. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that Shay's motivations for defecting to the Templar's just didn't make sense, and the portrayal of the Templars seemed completely off-base compared to the rest of the series. The game just tries too hard to make you like them, and instead of feeling like we're getting a closer look at the humanity within the Templar cause, it just feels like the same old "honorable, compassionate good guys" vs "cold, inhumane bad guys" story we've experienced before, only with the names of the factions switched.\n\nThere's also a modern day story in between sequences, but it's largely uninteresting (though Osto Berg does seem like an intriguing character), and the little pieces of lore you find  by hacking computers seem more like Assassin's Creed wiki entries to flesh out popular characters than anything else. I miss the mystery of deciphering Subject 16's encoded messages in AC2, and even the hacked information in AC4 had some level of intrigue that's largely missing here.\n\nGameplay: It's Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag through and through. Almost nothing has changed in terms of mechanics. You'll still free-run and counter kill your way across the land, and you'll still sail for miles and engage in furious naval battles across the North Atlantic. However, the series does add in some new features. Shay has a couple unique weapons, the air rifle and the grenade launcher. The air rifle is virtually identical to the blowgun from AC4, but it's still a cool weapon. The grenade launcher, however, is new. You can fire sleep grenades, berserk grenades, or shrapnel grenades, and it can be great fun to fire one into a group of enemies from a high tree branch and watch chaos ensue. Otherwise, however, Shay's weapons are pretty much the same as Edward's.\n\nAnother new feature is the new Stalker enemies. They will hide in places traditionally reserved for yourself as the Assassin. You can find them using a compass-like indicator only available using Eagle Vision. Then, you can either walk by and let them come at you, only to counter-kill them, or you can smoke them out and hunt them down. It makes traversing the city more interesting and more dangerous, as the Stalkers can pose a real threat if they get a hit in.\n\nA lot of the game will be spent at sea, sailing and engaging in naval combat, and it's as fun as ever. Shay's ship, the Morrigan, is notably faster and more maneuverable than the Jackdaw from AC4, which really helps streamline the naval gameplay. The ship is also equipped with new weapons. The first is the Puckle Gun, an automatic side-gun that actually makes boarding ships too easy, as you'll probably take out all the enemy crew before your ship even gets close enough to jump over. The second new weapon is the burning oil, which allows you to leave trails of fire behind you, and is much more effective in losing a tail than the explosive kegs from previous games. Finally, you get an upgraded ram that allows you to actually control your charge. Another new naval feature worth mentioning is that you can now be boarded by enemy ships if they ram into you, which is a surprisingly exciting and chaotic experience.\n\nBesides the main missions, there's a ton of side content. You can conquer the gangs of New York, raid forts, hunt animals to craft upgrades, and pick up a ton of various collectibles, including chests, animus fragments, the new prosperities which increase your income, viking swords, templar crosses, and more. The naval campaign also makes its return, and if you're really bored, you can just go play checkers at a bar.\n\nMy final score: 7/10 Great game in many ways, but I'd probably wait til it's on sale to pick it up.","January 3","true","38.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhilgeman/recommended/311560/","jhilgeman","jhilgeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhilgeman/","596 products in account","The most important question: Is this game fun?\nAnswer: YES!\n\nLike everyone else has said, it's pretty much like Black Flag with a few minor additions and a very slight change in scenery, so if you liked Black Flag, then you should enjoy Rogue, too.\n\nThat said, it's not AS polished as Black Flag was. It feels like maybe they skimped on the QA process with this game in order to get it out the door.\n\nTypically the AC games have had a polished introduction that walks you through all the major concepts, and gives you a good sense of who your character is, but not Rogue. Not only do you have no idea who your character is besides his name and that he's somehow associated with some kind of crew, but this game starts you out on an island where you can start picking up collectibles and treasure maps and all that stuff right off the bat, so it sort of expects you to be familiar with the mechanics... but then later walks you through concepts that you've already done. There were all sorts of questions that remained unanswered ("Am I an assassin already or am I enroute to becoming one? Who are these other characters around me? How did we get here if the captain's ship is miles away? What are we doing here?").\n\nIn the very first intro mission, one of the optional objectives is to not be detected by the guards while you take them all out. However, the game doesn't really explain what constitutes detection. Does the appearance of a red circle indicate detection, or is it only when it's filled, etc...? I hadn't played Black Flag in several months, so I couldn't remember off the top of my head and I restarted that memory several times trying to achieve complete stealth. It was only AFTER all of the mission criteria was completed (rescuing the prisoners, not just killing all the guards) that I was awarded the optional objective. So again, several small things that could have felt a little more smooth, but it was still fun to play.\n\nThere have been a couple major bugs that I've come across. For example, at the end of one mission, you're suppose to air assassinate a bad guy to get 100% synchronization. However, the guy was stuck in some water and therefore did not go anywhere and could not be air assassinated. I could still shoot him to finish the mission, but if you're the type that likes the 100% success rate, you might need to replay some of the missions. In some cases, I was never informed of a second optional objective until AFTER the mission was finished, making me have to replay it for that 100% rating.\n\nThere are LOTS of medium-sized, annoying bugs like getting trapped inside a wall, having your body (or other bodies) disappear on rare occasion, and stuff like that. The most annoying bugs have to be the little navigation/free-running bugs, where you are standing next to a completely climbable wall, yet the character will simply refuse to climb unless you run AWAY from the wall and then come back to it. There are also short rock walls that should definitely be climbable (running up them even puts half your body above the next level, but he just falls back down), forcing you to find an even shorter wall. Shay also seems very a little too eager to jump off into the middle of nothingness and fall to his death, even with a perfectly good haystack or other leap-of-faith-catcher mechanism nearby.\n\nSome bugs are just minor glitches with easy fixes - when I first ran the game on a 1920x1200 monitor in a multi-monitor setup, the setup menu didn't detect my resolution, and so it left it as "Unknown" but when I tried to switch to the windowed mode without setting the resolution first, the game would crash. Again, small things, easy fixes.\n\nAs far as the graphics go, I don't know what other people are whining about with graphics - I think they look pretty good. Maybe people are getting spoiled and expect leaps and bounds with every single new release of a game. I feel like Black Flag was a little brigher and more colorful, whereas Rogue has a more dreary/darker color palette, but it's not like they're bad graphics by any means, and the game runs fantastic with all the settings turned up.","December 8, 2015","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An assassin question the creed's cause after the massacre caused by attemping search for pieces of eden, and finally become anti-assassin.\n\nBut the details, well, I don't know it is careless or the plot is written by different group of people, some of them seems mismatch with previous sequel.\n1. Master Franklin, Master Cormac\nWhen first see a templar call Franklin as Master Franklin, "What? Franklin is a templar? Then why Haythem did not know him or vice versa?". And when Munro call Shay as Master Cormac, I am speechless. It seems templars calling anyone respectable as master in this sequel while this did not appear in previous sequel, not mentioning how weird would the person not templars feel while being called Master.\n\n2. Killing civilians\nGenerally, assassins don't kill innocents, so do some templars like Haythem and Shay. Throught out the series desynchronisation would be engaged if you killed 2-3 civilians. However in this sequel, despite the warning "This ancestor don't kill civilians or domestic animals", nothing happened.\n\nGameplay\nWhen I reach sequence 3, I am so happy the renovation system is back! Generally the gameplay seems like a well mixture of revelation, blackflag and unity, except too much collectibles. The freerunning puzzles for pillar and templar map are good, while the other seems like the same of just dfferent set.\n\nAnd bugs, yeah, annoying bugs, so do glitches:\n1. Why the hell would I fall while climbing the second level on a tree? This tree is just the same with others!\nAlso appear in little building. Well inherited from AC: Unity lol.\n\n2. How fascinating the camera is buried into objects, in the scene after upgrading ship or Eagle Sensed Templar Cross!\n\n3. Graphic glitches too often, hover over ground, fingers nailed into wood or stone during climbing or grabing somthing. It looks like Ubisoft applied Blackflag's motion data while it is not calibrated with new character model.\n\n4. Another bug inherited from previous sequel. Unexpected interruption of motions/skills\nSome motion or skills would be disrupted by high profile movement like climbing and falling. Players will understand that, of course you can't change bullet while climbing. What players not expected is, running or walking down a mild slope will often produce slight jumping or cripples, thus interrupted changing bullets, etc. Similar happens in AC:Unity also while the disguise is ended because you walk down the one step in front of a shop.","April 4","true","48.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reuses a lot of Black Flags assets but, this isn't unexpected, they use the same engine and do many of the same things. If you enjoyed Blackflag (which if you like Assassins Creed or Pirate Games, you did).\n\nNow, lets address the issues -\n-It's essentially Blackflag with a different story, not very many new things are introduced.\n-Theres this one chase sequence that is very easy to ♥♥♥♥ up, and end up chasing them around New York forever.\n-The same occasional thing where you're looking just barely the wrong way and Shay spazzes out and won't move.\n\nThe Good fun Naughty Bits -\n- The story is good, it's a perspective you don't usually see from these games.\n- You get the Rope Dart really early on, it will become your best friend, I honestly didn't know it could do so much when I played Blackflag\n- You get an Ice Ram. It rams through Ice. It's a fun time.\n- You get to be an Irish man who makes his own luck, fresh every morning, like in olden times.\n\nAll in all. If you like Asscred gams, buy this one. It actually runs, unlike unity, from what I've heard. It's more of Blackflag, and is actually a really solid link between the high seas of Black Flag, and the gangs of Syndicate. You see more of Haytham Kenway, seeing as the game spans from 1750ish to 1776, it's his term as Grand Master of the Templars. Your first mate is a cartoon character, the second one, after you get into the meat of the game. All in all, really solid Assassins Creed title, if it's on sale, get it.\n\n\n","March 21","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only other AC I've played was Unity (on my PS4 after they fixed all the bugs) and I LOVED it.  Sure, the main story wasn't remotely good, but there were so many other missions to do in Unity that it made up for all of that.\n\nWhile Rogue was released at the same time, it definitely feels like a step back, because of the lack of things to do.  There aren't tons of missions on the map that you can do, it's the main quest and then some occasional others... so for people who want a huge environment to flip around in, kill people, do some detective work, etc, I'd rather recommend Unity or Syndicate.  I know I'll definitely be buying Syndicate.\n\nBUT Rogue redeems itself with the ships! Pirating is so much more fun (and so much harder) than the general running-and-flipping-and-stabbing.","March 27","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reuses a lot of Black Flags assets but, this isn't unexpected, they use the same engine and do many of the same things. If you enjoyed Blackflag (which if you like Assassins Creed or Pirate Games, you did).\n\nNow, lets address the issues -\n-It's essentially Blackflag with a different story, not very many new things are introduced.\n-Theres this one chase sequence that is very easy to ♥♥♥♥ up, and end up chasing them around New York forever.\n-The same occasional thing where you're looking just barely the wrong way and Shay spazzes out and won't move.\n\nThe Good fun Naughty Bits -\n- The story is good, it's a perspective you don't usually see from these games.\n- You get the Rope Dart really early on, it will become your best friend, I honestly didn't know it could do so much when I played Blackflag\n- You get an Ice Ram. It rams through Ice. It's a fun time.\n- You get to be an Irish man who makes his own luck, fresh every morning, like in olden times.\n\nAll in all. If you like Asscred gams, buy this one. It actually runs, unlike unity, from what I've heard. It's more of Blackflag, and is actually a really solid link between the high seas of Black Flag, and the gangs of Syndicate. You see more of Haytham Kenway, seeing as the game spans from 1750ish to 1776, it's his term as Grand Master of the Templars. Your first mate is a cartoon character, the second one, after you get into the meat of the game. All in all, really solid Assassins Creed title, if it's on sale, get it.\n\n\n","March 21","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you play the game you play as Shay Patrick Cormac, who is an assassin which later in the game turnes to a templar and travels a new path for the templar order. This game takes place during the Seven Years War. Like AC4 black flag Shay commands a ship. In this game it has a new location in the artic. I personally loved the open world it gave the player lots of freedom like in the previous assassin's creed games. The story is great you normally see characters from the previous games like Adewale and Achilles. Though the story is great it feels too similar to AC4 black flag and AC3.

Shey is a relatable character and you definitely care about the characters by the end. there is an over world like in black flag with its own charecters and plot. script was good set pieces were good voice acting was good bla bla bla. the exciting part is it beautifully pulls together assassins creed 3 4 and unity in a marvelous way by the end. no spoilers. if you have played all three of those games and then moved on to unity and syndicate and felt jostled or like you missed the jump that's because you didn't play this game. really i cant stress how cool it was to see the missing link here. i really don't want to spoil anything so i'm going to move to closing.\n\nthis game marks the end of in my opinion the second trilogy of assassins creed. hear my out. this is the last of the last gen assassins creed games and it really feels that way. you have assassins creed 1 which was a proof of concept and kind of a stepping stone to get away from the prince of Persia. the ezio trilogy self explanatory. then came 3. where 1 and 2 drooped you in a city that you got to explore through out the game (or 1 of like 3 major cities) 3 introduced a more open platform. they gave you some land to traverse. it really made you feel like the journey was more important then the destination. black flag definitely followed suit on that. it was all about exploring islands and sailing on your bad ♥♥♥ boat and being a pirate. rouge as i have said is more black flag and there you have it. the second trilogy. to bring it home rouge is a more mature black flag. they fixed the awful tailing missions and really focused more on narrative then the characters. it marks a clear end of an era and syndicate and unity start a new one. we probably wont ever get another game like black flag or rouge and that's OK. we have gone back to 1 big open city and that's fine.  rouge doesn't make you feel sad to see it go. you feel a sense of closure. a sense of fulfillment. like saying goodbye to an old friend. i really liked this game and i really recommend it to any fan of the series.","December 29, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It uses the sailing mechanics of Black Flag with some of the places, characters and climbing of AC3. That said, it is perhaps the best parts of each of them.\n\nThe only problem was that it was too short, only 6 sequences. It felt much more like a place-holder or an explanation of the intervening years, than a full entry. Before I knew it, I had already accidentally finished most of the side missions and made it through the story.\n\nThe main character is interesting though and it's clear why he does the things he does, but the problem isn't with Shay. You never have to ask why he turns against the Assassins, but you will wonder why the Brotherhood is doing what it is that makes him leave. And the Templars don't have any better motivation in their grand plan other than just combating the efforts of the Assassins.\n\nThe modern day storyline is similar to Black Flag in that you play as another nameless, faceless Abstergo Entertainment employee who gets to go around providing IT support for coworkers while they're away from their desks. Every now and then you're pulled back to modern day to run an errand and find some misplaced iPads and then you get to go back to Shay. Sadly, Abstergo has gotten better at covering up their dirty laundry and the only information you get from hacking computers is about the people you're working with and the upcoming projects that Abstergo/Ubisoft have in the works. Maybe some day they'll actually make good on their teasing for a full-fledged Assassin's Creed entry set in China or Japan or India.","January 4","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It added many new weapons from its predecessor (Black Flag), though the only one which was actually really *new* was the grenades, and added an admittedly interesting gas mechanic to the game. It also was much more filled and felt significantly less grindy than Black Flag; these were all great improvements to the series from the previous title, but unfortunately, these are the only positive things I can say about this game. What this game made up for in being playable, it lost in a dissapointing lack of charm.\n\n**The remainder of this review contains massive spoilers, referrencing the end of the game**\n\nEither due to false marketing on the community's behalf or on Ubisoft, we're lead to believe that the main character, Shay, is the victim of a massive betrayal and seeks revenge against the brotherhood. This story sounded interesting, and for many of us, it was the first time we'd see the story from a Templar's point of view. Or at least, that's what I expected, but not what I recieved. Shay was never the victim of a betrayal, but rather the victim of a mistake in which no one was guilty. Rather than confront his Mentor about what he witnessed, which would be the logical thing to do, Shay gets unrealistically emotional about the situation and blames everything on his Mentor. He then consciously decides to betray his brotherhood, and is retaliated against accordingly.\n\nWhat follows isn't a story of revenge against the backstabbing brotherhood, but rather a convoluted scheme to stop a man who ends up listening to his own conscience in the end anyways, rendering Shay's entire mission completely pointless. He decides, for no other reason than one of the British officers was nice to him while he was injured, to help his hated rivals, the Templars, and eventually join their Order and assist the British in winning the Seven Years War.\n\nMy biggest complain about this game is that under no point of this game do you ever see the positives in joining the Templar Order. The Templars were never painted as the good guys, rather the game regularly reminds you that they are the bad guys, and the reasons for Shay's complete dedication toward the Order seems to entirely ignore his high moral stance which directed him to betray the Assassins. There never seems to be a point, other than the rosey tone of a single man who dies before Shay even makes the decision to join the Templars, where I (the player) feel like I should actually want to be a Templar.\n\nAs if the feeling of "why on Earth am I killing the good guys?" wasn't enough to make the game feel horrible, the ending seals this game as completely unnecessary and makes no sense. I'm not referring to the mission in Versailles (though the mission itself feels like an unnecessary and shoe-horned-in shameless advertisement for Unity), but rather the Naval Missions. I was quite confused while trying to complete the Naval Missions (which must be completed if you are to unlock much of the best stuff in the game) in that they no longer let you complete them until you "progress further into the story." This was right before the last mission of the game.\n\nIn case that wasn't clear, let me restate this: The final 5 Naval Missions, which are required for completion and for unlocking some of the best gear in the game, doesn't get unlocked until you've COMPLETED the game. Why? Were the developers afriad that I'd be cheating with Altïar's Swords on a mission which doesn't even let you use anything other than your Hidden Blades? Why was this required? So that people would be forced to play hours more of the game after they already completed the story? Who thought this was a good idea??\n\nOverall, I think the game is fine. I never felt like I was doing the right thing, but so what? Plenty of games let you play as the bad guy (though they usually leave out the high sense of morality that constantly reminds you that what you did was morally sketchy and highlights that you're actually the bad guy in this game). The Naval Missions is a cheap and pathetic move on the fault of the developers, but hey, **at least the game plays on PC, Montreal!!**. But would I recommend it, though? No. It doesn't add much from Black Flag, and unlike this game, Black Flag had characters I actually could **care** about. I couldn't have cared less if the characters died; the fact that two of them were Haythem Kenway and Achilles Davenport defeated the possibility of that happening anyways. Comparing that to Black Flag, or more accurately Black Beard, it was geniunely disastrous watching Edward Thatch die. We had actually come to care about him and his death was genuinely devastating. In AC: Rogue, however, none of the characters invoke that amount of compassion. None of the characters seemed to have any real life. When they died, it was difficult to really think anything of it.\n\nThis game is fine, but you'd be better off playing Black Flag. "","January 4","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him in-game.\n\nPart of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad ♥♥♥.\n\nEven if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier AC's to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of it's own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film (lets just hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up).\n\nSome of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to meta-game kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.","January 11","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I didn't want to give the Assassin's Creed franchise another shot, but I'd heard good things about Rogue and seeing it was a year old already and quite a bargain I thought to myself, why the hell not. So I bought it and I don't regret it.\n\nYou play as a templar this time, which is pretty interesting, though it took me a while to get along with that - I always really liked the assassins and betraying them felt kinda... awful. But I started to grow fond of Shay Comac, he's a bit of an idiot, but likeable. The story, too, is quite interesting - at least while you're in the animus. I never really cared much for the stuff you do at Abstergo.\nWhat I really enjoyed in Rogue was the map you got. They gave you all kinds of stuff to explore: you get New York City, the rich landscapes of the Riverlands and the icy cold North Atlantic with a lot of bad weather, fish to hunt and ships to board. I've loved Black Flag for its marine missions, and I wasn't let down by Rogue on that. I spent so much time on the water, because it just felt pretty damn good.\nHowever, Rogue, like any other of the latest Assassin's Creed games (though I haven't played Syndicate), is just that: an Assassin's Creed game. It's not really all that different. The only thing that makes it stand out from the others is the afore mentioned fact that you're a templar now. Ergo you have assassin's following you like all the time (which got annoying pretty soon, they aren't hard to find or to kill, but there's just so many of them, it bored me).\n\nRogue isn't as special as it'd like to be, but still worth playing if you've liked previous AC games. They could have made the templar-thing more interesting, but it's still a nice game to spend your time on, especially if you're into sailing and discovering.","January 13","true","74.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game several months after Unity, which I played once and it crashed my system. I returned Unity and decided to take a break from Assassin's Creed for a while but kept seeing advertisment for this game. So after a while I buckled and bought this game and I have to say that I was not disapointed. This game built on everything that was great about Black Flag and put more on top. While some feature of Black Flag are not included, being able to weild four pistols and being able to dive for treasure, it honestly didn't drag down the expirence.  I logged about 49 hours on this game so far, I finished the story in about 35 hours, taking my time going for upgrades and becoming slightly obssed with the fleet missions. However the two most disapointing aspects of this game I would have to say is the way that you are yanked out of the Animus, ruining the immmersion. Secondly the fact that this time around outfits are disapointing and require you to make all this effort with slight benifits. However if you are looking for a good Assassin's Creed game to sink your teeth in, I would recomend this highly. For those who are into 100% for cool rewards I would temper your expectations.\n\nOverall Score:\n9.5/10","February 25","true","49.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him in-game.\n\nPart of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad ♥♥♥.\n\nEven if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier AC's to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of it's own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film (lets just hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up).\n\nSome of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to meta-game kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.","January 11","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sithsister/recommended/311560/","sithsister","turians","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sithsister/","99 products in account","I picked Rogue up during a Steam sale when it was 66% off, because I felt really let down by Unity. At first I didn't want to give the Assassin's Creed franchise another shot, but I'd heard good things about Rogue and seeing it was a year old already and quite a bargain I thought to myself, why the hell not. So I bought it and I don't regret it.\n\nYou play as a templar this time, which is pretty interesting, though it took me a while to get along with that - I always really liked the assassins and betraying them felt kinda... awful. But I started to grow fond of Shay Comac, he's a bit of an idiot, but likeable. The story, too, is quite interesting - at least while you're in the animus. I never really cared much for the stuff you do at Abstergo.\nWhat I really enjoyed in Rogue was the map you got. They gave you all kinds of stuff to explore: you get New York City, the rich landscapes of the Riverlands and the icy cold North Atlantic with a lot of bad weather, fish to hunt and ships to board. I've loved Black Flag for its marine missions, and I wasn't let down by Rogue on that. I spent so much time on the water, because it just felt pretty damn good.\nHowever, Rogue, like any other of the latest Assassin's Creed games (though I haven't played Syndicate), is just that: an Assassin's Creed game. It's not really all that different. The only thing that makes it stand out from the others is the afore mentioned fact that you're a templar now. Ergo you have assassin's following you like all the time (which got annoying pretty soon, they aren't hard to find or to kill, but there's just so many of them, it bored me).\n\nRogue isn't as special as it'd like to be, but still worth playing if you've liked previous AC games. They could have made the templar-thing more interesting, but it's still a nice game to spend your time on, especially if you're into sailing and discovering.","January 13","true","74.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Achievements or any other Steam integration might have helped a little but Ubisoft rather add their Uplay garbage instead.\n\nYou play as a Templar most of the game but it doesn't change up the formula much, for some reason the Assassins start behaving just like the Templars used to with big visible forts and such. It's a little weird and a missed opportunity gameplay-wise. There are a couple bones thrown in like being hunted by hidden assassins but that really just serves to fill your ear with creepy and annoying whispering and doesn't add much.\n\nThe story is really good but way too short. It seems like they cut a lot of it or it just wasn't fully worked out, I wanted to see more but it just rushes you through. It might be the most interesting story in the whole series about the series itself, it pulls a lot of pieces together and for that you should play it if you are into it.\n\nOtherwise this is just an overpriced bit of standalone DLC and I was mostly dissapointed given the hidden gem status this game has. If you really like the Templar vs. Assassin story in the series by all means play it (or watch it on Youtube). I don't recommend it though because it costs too much for what it is, don't pay more than $15 for it.","January 18","false","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I didn't want to give the Assassin's Creed franchise another shot, but I'd heard good things about Rogue and seeing it was a year old already and quite a bargain I thought to myself, why the hell not. So I bought it and I don't regret it.\n\nYou play as a templar this time, which is pretty interesting, though it took me a while to get along with that - I always really liked the assassins and betraying them felt kinda... awful. But I started to grow fond of Shay Comac, he's a bit of an idiot, but likeable. The story, too, is quite interesting - at least while you're in the animus. I never really cared much for the stuff you do at Abstergo.\nWhat I really enjoyed in Rogue was the map you got. They gave you all kinds of stuff to explore: you get New York City, the rich landscapes of the Riverlands and the icy cold North Atlantic with a lot of bad weather, fish to hunt and ships to board. I've loved Black Flag for its marine missions, and I wasn't let down by Rogue on that. I spent so much time on the water, because it just felt pretty damn good.\nHowever, Rogue, like any other of the latest Assassin's Creed games (though I haven't played Syndicate), is just that: an Assassin's Creed game. It's not really all that different. The only thing that makes it stand out from the others is the afore mentioned fact that you're a templar now. Ergo you have assassin's following you like all the time (which got annoying pretty soon, they aren't hard to find or to kill, but there's just so many of them, it bored me).\n\nRogue isn't as special as it'd like to be, but still worth playing if you've liked previous AC games. They could have made the templar-thing more interesting, but it's still a nice game to spend your time on, especially if you're into sailing and discovering.","January 13","true","74.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shey is a relatable character and you definitely care about the characters by the end. there is an over world like in black flag with its own charecters and plot. script was good set pieces were good voice acting was good bla bla bla. the exciting part is it beautifully pulls together assassins creed 3 4 and unity in a marvelous way by the end. no spoilers. if you have played all three of those games and then moved on to unity and syndicate and felt jostled or like you missed the jump that's because you didn't play this game. really i cant stress how cool it was to see the missing link here. i really don't want to spoil anything so i'm going to move to closing.\n\nthis game marks the end of in my opinion the second trilogy of assassins creed. hear my out. this is the last of the last gen assassins creed games and it really feels that way. you have assassins creed 1 which was a proof of concept and kind of a stepping stone to get away from the prince of Persia. the ezio trilogy self explanatory. then came 3. where 1 and 2 drooped you in a city that you got to explore through out the game (or 1 of like 3 major cities) 3 introduced a more open platform. they gave you some land to traverse. it really made you feel like the journey was more important then the destination. black flag definitely followed suit on that. it was all about exploring islands and sailing on your bad ♥♥♥ boat and being a pirate. rouge as i have said is more black flag and there you have it. the second trilogy. to bring it home rouge is a more mature black flag. they fixed the awful tailing missions and really focused more on narrative then the characters. it marks a clear end of an era and syndicate and unity start a new one. we probably wont ever get another game like black flag or rouge and that's OK. we have gone back to 1 big open city and that's fine.  rouge doesn't make you feel sad to see it go. you feel a sense of closure. a sense of fulfillment. like saying goodbye to an old friend. i really liked this game and i really recommend it to any fan of the series.","December 29, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really hate having to grind through all of the ship combat just to get from A to B.\n\nI was relieved to arrive in New York and put all that identikit island grinding  behind me but no sooner had I landed then it became clear that most of New York is effectively level-gated and there is no way to earn the requisite powerup without progresssing the main plot.\n\nNo surprise then that as soon as you land in New York you are whisked off to travel around the same set of identical islands again. Jeeeez.\n\nThe naval battles pass the time but it remains a massive chore just to travel around the oceans, all those settlements look identical. A journey inland doesn't help and the natural environment is irritatingly inconsistent compared to the towns (can I climb a 100 ft sheer cliff face? yes, as long as there are white marks on the rock. Can I climb a boulder as high as my shoulder? No! That's a natural obstacle.)  The islands are not free-roam paradises, the islands and settlements are simple mazes with one of two fixed routes through them. It's galling that the series still does this with everything outside cities.\n\nThe NPCs also fare worse than preceeding installments with Benjamin Franklin somehow assuming a prime role yet doing absolutely nothing of value and voice-acted as an irritatingly bumbling fool. If I could I would stab him myself.  The rest of the cast are unfortunately an array of cardboard cutout villians with "good sides" that our hero finds out about.\n\nThe plot is even worse than AC 3 with a meandering campaign chasing after artifacts that no-one seems to know about and pitched so badly that the player is inclined to skip cutscenes. Compared to Unity and to a lesser extent, Syndicate, this really is terrible waffle and unfortunately you are made to spend too much time listening to it. There are numerous points when you are made to get out of the Animus and carry key A to room A and key B to room B on some pretext of fixing a corrupted computer system.\n\nBuy when on sale, avoid otherwise. New York is fun, the main plot is poor.","December 29, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It uses the sailing mechanics of Black Flag with some of the places, characters and climbing of AC3. That said, it is perhaps the best parts of each of them.\n\nThe only problem was that it was too short, only 6 sequences. It felt much more like a place-holder or an explanation of the intervening years, than a full entry. Before I knew it, I had already accidentally finished most of the side missions and made it through the story.\n\nThe main character is interesting though and it's clear why he does the things he does, but the problem isn't with Shay. You never have to ask why he turns against the Assassins, but you will wonder why the Brotherhood is doing what it is that makes him leave. And the Templars don't have any better motivation in their grand plan other than just combating the efforts of the Assassins.\n\nThe modern day storyline is similar to Black Flag in that you play as another nameless, faceless Abstergo Entertainment employee who gets to go around providing IT support for coworkers while they're away from their desks. Every now and then you're pulled back to modern day to run an errand and find some misplaced iPads and then you get to go back to Shay. Sadly, Abstergo has gotten better at covering up their dirty laundry and the only information you get from hacking computers is about the people you're working with and the upcoming projects that Abstergo/Ubisoft have in the works. Maybe some day they'll actually make good on their teasing for a full-fledged Assassin's Creed entry set in China or Japan or India.","January 4","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly, the naval combat of IV is here in full gear, even improving it a bit. And the overall setting and locations are inspired on III. Let me clarify. In this game, there's 3 main locations. First, there's the icy North Atlantic, which is your main playground for the excellent naval combat. There's an open sea with plenty of icebergs, and winter locations to explore. Secondly, there's the River Valley, where despite the ability to travel with your ship, naval combat is almost non-existent. Instead this area is reminiscent of the frontier in III, with more locations to explore and in bigger forest areas. And lastly, there's the city of New York. However, it doesn't feel like a ripoff of III's New York, and i think this New York is more cohesive. However, there isn't much to do in here, besides some missions and collectibles. So, there's a place for naval combat, a forest place and a city place. And this game doesn't need more than that. The gameplay is what you'd expect, but the developers added some new things. For example, this time your ship can also be boarded by the enemy, and you'll be hunted by assassin's. And speaking of which, the story is really good, with an interesting main character and with new and returning side characters. You'll have a better experience if you have played the previous titles. But the story is a bit short, unfortunately. To 100% the game, there's a lot of collectibles scattered around, and it'll get repetitive after a while. The soundtrack is also decent. The graphics show some age today, but they are good considering that this was a 7th generation game. In the end, this game is a great choice if you want more of the amazing naval combat, even if it's mostly more of the same. Because even with the added content, you won't like this game if you don't like the franchise. But still, a surprisingly good game nonetheless.","February 17","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chronologically, the bulk takes place between AC4 and AC3, bridging the gap between the two.\n\nGameplay and story wise it takes the best of both games and blends them together to create something that fans of either game can enjoy, whether its the open world sailing and piracy of AC4 or the dark colonial story of AC3.\nThis time, however, you play as a templar, giving you an up close and personal look at their operations, ideology, and methods. Portraying them as keepers of the piece and status quo in the rather anarchic world of the fledgling American colonies. In this way it portrays them in a new and sympathetic light as opposed to the Saturday morning cartoon villain treatment they got in the Ezio Trilogy, or the manipulative puppet master treatment they got in virtually every other game in the series.\n\nIn addition Familiar faces return as new allies and enemies including Haytham, Achilles, and Adewale.\n\nThis being said there are a few drawbacks to AC: Rogue. The Collection quests are a bit of a frustration as the items you get for competing them are only marginally better or not unlockable until after the main story has been completed. In addition, the hardest legendary ship battle requires precision timing that some may not be able to achieve with keyboard and mouse controls.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed Rogue is a great game with only a few minor drawbacks that provides a fresh and sympathetic look at the series traditional villains the Templars.","February 16","true","66.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It added many new weapons from its predecessor (Black Flag), though the only one which was actually really *new* was the grenades, and added an admittedly interesting gas mechanic to the game. It also was much more filled and felt significantly less grindy than Black Flag; these were all great improvements to the series from the previous title, but unfortunately, these are the only positive things I can say about this game. What this game made up for in being playable, it lost in a dissapointing lack of charm.\n\n**The remainder of this review contains massive spoilers, referrencing the end of the game**\n\nEither due to false marketing on the community's behalf or on Ubisoft, we're lead to believe that the main character, Shay, is the victim of a massive betrayal and seeks revenge against the brotherhood. This story sounded interesting, and for many of us, it was the first time we'd see the story from a Templar's point of view. Or at least, that's what I expected, but not what I recieved. Shay was never the victim of a betrayal, but rather the victim of a mistake in which no one was guilty. Rather than confront his Mentor about what he witnessed, which would be the logical thing to do, Shay gets unrealistically emotional about the situation and blames everything on his Mentor. He then consciously decides to betray his brotherhood, and is retaliated against accordingly.\n\nWhat follows isn't a story of revenge against the backstabbing brotherhood, but rather a convoluted scheme to stop a man who ends up listening to his own conscience in the end anyways, rendering Shay's entire mission completely pointless. He decides, for no other reason than one of the British officers was nice to him while he was injured, to help his hated rivals, the Templars, and eventually join their Order and assist the British in winning the Seven Years War.\n\nMy biggest complain about this game is that under no point of this game do you ever see the positives in joining the Templar Order. The Templars were never painted as the good guys, rather the game regularly reminds you that they are the bad guys, and the reasons for Shay's complete dedication toward the Order seems to entirely ignore his high moral stance which directed him to betray the Assassins. There never seems to be a point, other than the rosey tone of a single man who dies before Shay even makes the decision to join the Templars, where I (the player) feel like I should actually want to be a Templar.\n\nAs if the feeling of "why on Earth am I killing the good guys?" wasn't enough to make the game feel horrible, the ending seals this game as completely unnecessary and makes no sense. I'm not referring to the mission in Versailles (though the mission itself feels like an unnecessary and shoe-horned-in shameless advertisement for Unity), but rather the Naval Missions. I was quite confused while trying to complete the Naval Missions (which must be completed if you are to unlock much of the best stuff in the game) in that they no longer let you complete them until you "progress further into the story." This was right before the last mission of the game.\n\nIn case that wasn't clear, let me restate this: The final 5 Naval Missions, which are required for completion and for unlocking some of the best gear in the game, doesn't get unlocked until you've COMPLETED the game. Why? Were the developers afriad that I'd be cheating with Altïar's Swords on a mission which doesn't even let you use anything other than your Hidden Blades? Why was this required? So that people would be forced to play hours more of the game after they already completed the story? Who thought this was a good idea??\n\nOverall, I think the game is fine. I never felt like I was doing the right thing, but so what? Plenty of games let you play as the bad guy (though they usually leave out the high sense of morality that constantly reminds you that what you did was morally sketchy and highlights that you're actually the bad guy in this game). The Naval Missions is a cheap and pathetic move on the fault of the developers, but hey, **at least the game plays on PC, Montreal!!**. But would I recommend it, though? No. It doesn't add much from Black Flag, and unlike this game, Black Flag had characters I actually could **care** about. I couldn't have cared less if the characters died; the fact that two of them were Haythem Kenway and Achilles Davenport defeated the possibility of that happening anyways. Comparing that to Black Flag, or more accurately Black Beard, it was geniunely disastrous watching Edward Thatch die. We had actually come to care about him and his death was genuinely devastating. In AC: Rogue, however, none of the characters invoke that amount of compassion. None of the characters seemed to have any real life. When they died, it was difficult to really think anything of it.\n\nThis game is fine, but you'd be better off playing Black Flag. "","January 4","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him in-game.\n\nPart of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad ♥♥♥.\n\nEven if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier AC's to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of it's own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film (lets just hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up).\n\nSome of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to meta-game kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.","January 11","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it has bad world/map design, which only serves to advance the story and allow you to kill time. Unlike other AC games, exploring the world doesn't actually tell you anything about the world, and so the greatest draw of the series is missing in this game. And outside of Shay, the Irish couple you meet in New York, and Juhani Otsu Berg, the characters (including the one you play in present day), feel flat or rushed.\n\nAn AC game with this story would have been so much better if it had taken place in a better developed environment.\n\nAnd if you like the mechanics of Black Flag... just stick with Black Flag, because sailing the open seas is so much better than hugging the coast of an overly convoluted, pooly designed river valley or arctic surrogate. I mean, this game has you sail in a worse ship than Black Flag because it's more manuverable around the coastlines, not because it makes combat and actual sailing more fun.\n\nNot recommended.","April 16","false","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is my favorite AND at the same time most hated ac game of the franchise. Rogue showed me that even some of the asasins creed's morals are to be questioned. anyway i absolutely loved this game even with its few flaws, some including, very short main campaign length, shays voice is absolutely annoying, and not enough side objectives. that being said the story was great, the game is a filler between ac3 and ac4 aswell as a prologue to ac unity. the unique weapons u got were very fun and were kinda op at times haha. hunting asasins never felt so good even though they are tought( ie they can stealth in brush, more alert than regular ai, use smoke and pistols too well). the game is also the most optimized video game on pc to date, becasue it was intended for old consoles unlike unity which were made for the new console generation. everything was perfect though if you count out shays annoying as voice, short story however it left me confused as to which side i rather like now, assasins or templars. imagine this, would u want donald trump(templars) running the country or having a purge anarchy libertarianism type government where everyone is free to do their own will(think about it carefully)....i recommend the game but dont expect to be playing it for too long","April 9","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
