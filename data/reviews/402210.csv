All you do is monitor the incoming planes and try to find a gap to send departing planes on their way. It starts off simple, but gets progressively more difficult as the sky gets busier. This happens until you lose enough attention to cause 2 planes to collide. You then swear profusely at how stupid you have been, think about rage quitting. Then instead of exiting, you press the retry button again and again until it's 4am. It's a form of self inflicted torture, but you cannot stop playing. You have to beat your previous score. This has been true of Airport Madness 4 and World Edition.\n\nSo along comes Time Machine. I found the demo on their website, and got immediately hooked. I'd often play it at work out of boredom, and the hours fly by (pun intended). So when it came to Steam, I was all over it like a rash.\n\nInstead of Airport Madness 4 or World Edition's several airport levels where you just attempt to accumilate enough score until you collide 2 jets, and then try to better it because you're stubborn. Time Machine takes you through numerous levels/years of just a single airport. From a basic field in 1925, you go year by year, watching the airport expand and take shape until you get to 1970 where you've got to deal with more aircraft than Heathrow and LAX combined.\n\nEach level presents new challenges, from new runways, new facilities, to having to deal with military and civilian aircraft in World War 2 at the same time. Then even more...\n\nOnce you get to certain stages in the game. You also unlock a Victorian Style steampunk airport and an airport from far in the future. These present further challenges and add a nice change of pace from trying to beat each level in the main part of the game. This means more fun and more addiction!\n\nTime Machine stands as my favourite in the series for the different direction it takes. It doesn't matter how many of these games Big Fat Simulations release. I will always buy them on launch, because they are just really, really fun to play. I look forward to the possibility of seeing Airport Madness 3 on Steam and their current development, Airport Madness 3D in the new year. For me these are "Must Buys"...\n\nI suggest you go to their official website and play the demos on their site. Discover the addicition, and buy the series here on Steam. You'll be hooked in no time!","September 18, 2015","true","10.9"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","38","40","7","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/402210/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4509 products in account","A surpisingly deep strategy game. In Airport Madness: Time Machine you run an airport by deciding when and where planes are allowed to takeoff and land. You have to keep a steady flow going of takeoffs and landings, without causing crashes.\n\nThe game begins in the early 30s and each level is one year later, each year introducing new features such as additional runways, faster planes, priority transports, etc..\nWhat starts out really simple with simple queuing up planes quickly becomes a deep strategy of making sure runways are /just/ cleared when a new plane has to land or take off, dealing with multiple waiting planes and deciding the optimal order for them to launch, etc..\n\nVisually the game is really underwhelming but the graphics do their job.\nOn my system the game started fullscreen stretched across three monitors, but fortunately pressing ESC once made it windowed.\n\nSound: music is limited to looping time period [ieces. Soundeffects are basic and limited to plane engine sounds.\n\nControl can be done completely via the mouse, or by using keys 1 through 5 on the keyboard once a plane is selected.\n\nA fun game that won't bore you too quickly, with decent length levels. Recommended for anyone who likes management strategy games.","September 26, 2015","true","24.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Well worth the couple of bucks it costs. It takes you through the history of an airport from the 1930s up to about 1970. And two bonus fantasy scenarios. Your job is to coordinate arriving and departing planes. Each level offers varying runway, taxiway and aircraft configurations. Even the music changes, depending on the decade. But there may be more to come with future free updates. It would be a blast to get some more decades.\n\nSo overall, it is one of the best of it's kind. I'd love to see more of that. There are some small issues still to fix and some details to improve. But even at this stage, right after release, it is a very well rounded game.\n\n\nWhat could be improved?\n- a few more decades ;-)\n- there are still some minor bugs. For example, sometimes, not too often, flying planes decrease speed dramatically. That seems to happen occasionally (maybe once per hour at most) when those planes are directed over paved parking areas and remains until the plane has landed. It's not a game breaker, but should be fixed.\n- I may just not have found it yet, but there seems to be no way of getting to the bonus scenarios, once they are unlocked, other than to finish the last level again.\n- Some levels are over too soon. For that, there is an endless-play mode. But I'd prefer just to have a harder game mode. So here is how I'd implement that: Once a player gets through the game, a new button gets unlocked in the main menu. With this button, the player can switch between 1x and 2x mode. 1x being the normal  game, 2x being the very same game, but starting at the first level again (meaning that all levels for this mode have to be unlocked again) and with twice as many aircraft to handle per level. Once the player has played through the game that way, a 3x mode becomes available. And so on.\n- It would be great, if the prices for other Airport Madness games were decreased a bit. Also, it would be great to see Airport Madness 1 and 2 as a bundle on Steam.","September 24, 2015","true","91.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Totally frustrating. There is a lot of functionality missing that actually helps you manage the airport. The buildings are just cosmetic. All you get are more space for the planes and more runways.\nWorst thing is when planes landed and are told to leave the runway but doing so at different speed. Even the same type of plane are sometimes fast and somestimes slow. This is a joke. I lost so many games because my calculations were wrong. It´s like gambling. Another thing is that you can´t tell planes where to start from. You can only do that when they land. And for now ♥♥♥♥ing reason they want to cross runways to go the other hangar. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does not matter where the terminal is, the planes just go where they want. Totally random. You can plan nothing.

Unlike the other games, you have only one airport to play, but it expands over time.  You start in the 1920s and play your airport until 1970, unlocking one year at a time.  After you complete 1970, there are some bonus missions set in a steampunk 1800s and a futuristic 2100s airport.\n\nYou have less control of the planes on the ground in this one, as you can't direct them to which runway to take off from, but you can still control your planes in the air and have them land on a different runway.\n\nOverall, I think I like Airport Madness: World Edition better (but you pay more for that one).  This title offers the opportunity to watch an airport grow over time and play with some more classic airplanes that you don't see outside of museums and airshows today.\n\nThere were a few bugs (planes crash on the ground inexplicably in the 2100s airport), but nothing really gamebreaking.  Each year you play is maybe 5-10 minutes so I never felt that I lost a lot if I did have a crash.\n\nI completed the game in 8.6 hours.","November 29, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can usually redirect airplanes to a different runway when landing only, as well as change the direction/speed  manually. So yeah it is fun, especially seeing your airport grow into this huge airport. You can set the planerate before you start the game as well as the year you want to begin with and which era. Mind that you need to unlock levels by playing one level, that leads to the second level and so on (same for era's). About era's, you have 1925+ (to 1970), fantasy and the future era.. after that the game will just start over to the 1925+ era.\n\nBugs?\nYes, there are those. One I've had two times is the planes stand still in the middle of flight, which was really stange. When you are too close to a runway to land the the plane can not make it's turn to land it will just keep circling, this happens when I redirect planes sometimes before they collide. There seems to be a few more out there from what I saw on the forum, but I've only had these two.\n\nDo I recommend it?\nYes I will, but I am a bit hesitant because I thought it'd go on from 1925 to the future in one go. I missed choppers, fighter jets like the F16, Fokker planes, also newer planes and planechatter.  The era's should've been, in a different order. I played this game out in a few days, took me less time than Airport Madness 4.","October 4, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
