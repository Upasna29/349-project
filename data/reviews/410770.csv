There is no multi click (something I didn't like at first), but the game offers you gradually more and more villagers and you will be soon 100% loaded with all the tasks.\n\nSomething rare, the story is nice. It's short (a few panels every 10 levels), but it is surprisingly effective.\n\nI got all levels on the expert rating, and I can say that the level design and the difficulty are well done. In the last levels, I had to use all the tricks I learned previously.","October 25, 2015","true","29.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's no cursor. You literally can't see where you are clicking unless you actually manage to highlight something.","January 23","false","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Once u  decide to play it get's you right into the game, No loading time at all and never experienced any bugs or crashes. It is one of those games to play when you feel bored and got nothingg to do, it'll take your time  away. 5$ is perfect price, I would buy it even if it was  for 10$","October 18, 2015","true","20.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much, given that I only paid 3 dollars and change for it, but it provided me with quite a few hours of fun.","October 17, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I won't spoil it though; this is something you MUST experience for yourself. It's an absolute masterpiece in modern storytelling. Who knew Road Simulation could be this fun?","October 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","5","19","4","0"
