My hours are not high but many of them were not logged to steam. Consider this a shared experience based on what I have not only experienced directly but witnessed many other players experiencing. The unhelpful votes at the top are most likely going to pile up as the griefer guild and admins find this post. Just look at its contents and decide for yourself.\n\nDon't get this game. It might look ok at first but the melee combat is roughly based on circling around the opponent repeatedly and smacking them in the rear quarters then rinse repeat. The diversity is mostly just reskin of the same character types.\n\nIn addition, PVE is full of griefers which we as well as several other groups on the server were suffering from due to their use of exploits and/or hacks to grief while in PVE. They would hack into bases and destroy generators/shields/etc of every other player that wasn't from their little group. The server in question was EU 9 and the players in question do not attempt to hide their actions even on the forums admitting to it. That is the treatment new players were given once they had set up a protected base that should be protected from destruction. We had plenty of wood for 5+ days in the generator but exploits were used against us and basically every other player on this server. Due to the fact the moons are connected it means other servers were effected as well.\n\nWhat happened when we tried to bring this to admin attention via email and steam correspondence? We were blocked and the players are still doing exploits and destroying peoples protected pve structures to this day.\nWow. Talk about -fantastic- moderation.\n\nAlot of people would say to move to a new server however in this game that would require starting over and this player seems to do this kind of thing on multiple servers and/or moons so that wouldn't really help. If admin action were taken, like it should have been, the problem would be solved.\n\nCurrently, expect to lose your stuff to griefers even in PVE and expect the admins to do nothing about it.\n\nYou might ask WHY it is that noone has done anything about *names omitted due to political red tape in steam TOS*?\n\nBy my research of simply looking at publically available shared friends lists and the fact that I was ignored by the admin as are their griefing posts on the forums.. I'd say they know each other. There you have it. Nepotism. It is the only rational explanation I was able to come up with to explain the ultimately either lazy or malicious lack of action.\n\nA player that uses hacks and/or exploits to glitch into peoples PVE bases and destroy everything including chests and spends 90% of their time bragging in global chat that they are on their "train" of destruction then also brags on the forums will get away with it due to poor support for this game.\n\nThe game wasn't really anything to write home about before the fact that exploiting griefers can destroy your chests even in PVE game modes and force your entire guild to start over on a new server that may suffer the same problem.\nThe game looks somewhat flashy but there really isn't anything to do for a sandbox and the building and gameplay are rather limited and poorly balanced. A similar game that is in development that might need support is Planet Explorers. Really, there are several similar games with better support if you toss a stone in a random direction.\n\nIt is grindy and it feels grindy.\nThings are a palette swap if they are any different.\nNo cheat protection that I can discern so enjoy the large amount of hackers/exploiters in pvp OR pve.\nThe graphics really aren't that great and the cartoon polish doesn't fix it.\nThe combat feels kind of basic.\nLarge amount of unnecessary resources which get dropped even in pve which require you to put it in a chest at your protected base and log on frequently otherwise even in pve other players can and will destroy all your things and get rid of all your belongings if you choose to not carry them around into dangerous areas. Even if you do keep your base protected by filling the generator some players will exploit and destroy it anyway. Cements fact 1 that the game is grindy.\nBuilding system uses very limited supply of polished yet uninspired structures.\n\nThere is no end game, people complain about this constantly on the forums. Go check it. Our favorite griefers complain about this as well and had stated that they decided the endgame was griefing other players and use this as an excuse.\n\nWithout the griefers I'd say a 7/10 at best at this point especially when compared to other similar games.\nWith the griefers the game is unplayable unless you plan to deal with your friends and everyone losing their bases to some jerky griefers and have to rebuild every time you log onto the servers. 5 or 6/10 at that point at best. I would like you to simply look at the number of negative vs positive reviews at the time of writing. 500 vs 1500. That is not a good satisfaction rate by any stretch of the imagination. This game might still sound good to you but I request you support one of the other similar games with a friendly community and people who care.\n\nI would consider changing this review if I am given evidence that action is being taken against such players who grief in PVE or hack. I have screenshotted it and am prepared to post it to various other popular websites if it is removed or swept under the rug as I am sure will happen. If this happens I have the resources to go straight to the higherups at steam who will be curious as to why negative opinions of the game are being censored.\n---------------------------------\n\nTLDR;\nEven if you are planning to play this game, I humbly ask that you rate this helpful so that people can at least go into the game knowing about the inner workings and happenings which may ruin their and their friends experiences and so that people know at the very least to avoid EU 9 due to its toxic community that is simply being enabled by the developers. Or avoid the game entirely because you can expect no support by the mods or admins.","September 18, 2015","false","17.0"," 747 of 816 people (92%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","92","747","816","27","37"

Only hint I got was get wood and fossils to make an armory (they have added a great tutorial that gives you exp and mats as you do basic tasks now).  Saw a giant flying alien bug and poked it with my knife, it expolded with a squish sound.  Repeated several times to hear the squish sound.  Accidentally ran into a bug that made me make a squish sound.\n\nMade an armory and got a rusty gun and killed the bug that squished me.\n\nFound a cave but there was a big pit in it.  The monsters chased me to the edge of the pit.  I fell in.  Second time I built a bridge over the pit and stood there pointing and laughing at the stupid monsters.  Monsters destroyed the bridge while I was standing on it.  They pointed and laughed as I fell to my death again.\n\nThis game is a blast!  It has survival elements, but no so hard core that you have to count how many M&Ms you have left in your pocket before you die.  It also has RPG elements where you can upgrade some skills (active and passive) and get new jobs that have a new set of skills with them. And you can build.  Building is fairly simpled but lots of fun.  You can also make a variety of weapons, armor and vehicles...like monocyle, jetpacks, tanks and jets.\n\nYou will die...you will laugh...and you will die some more while you learn.  The folks playing are helpful and fun.  This game is more than worth the money right now and is being patched frequently.\n\nMy best advice is to build a little base as soon as you get a shield generator blueprint.  Use it to store your extra mats so if you die you don't loose much.  You DO NOT drop your armor, ammo, or weapons when you die, just a percentage of your mats on hand.  You can also train a skill up to reduce how much you drop.\n\nThere are PK gankers of course, but there are anti-PKers as well that tend to balance it out.  You will get PKed.  The best thing to do is Don't Panic!  You are much more likely to survive if you keep your head and fight back.  Or run around some cover and pop and invis stim and run away.\n\nUpdated a bit.  There has been much patching and improving recently.  The game is better than ever.  The player base has grown after a recent free weekend.  There is so much to do in this game you shouldn't get bored.\n\nYes it can be a big grindy at times as some people have asked.  I don't find it bothersome.  You can have about 8 different jobs, which are like classes.  You can level each one seperatly or just focus on one.   Each comes with benefits.  I don't find lvling up other jobs that hard as I gather mats while I level.  You can hot swap any job at any time just in your inventory screen and any passives that you train remain no matter what job you have active.\n\nOpenworld, scifi style sandbox survival and building.  Try it!  You just might like it.","March 12, 2015","true","176.8"," 303 of 319 people (95%) found this review helpful 258 people found this review funny","95","303","319","258","7"

Most people tend to cooperate and explore with each other and disregard PVP. The potential is very very great in this game, I personally love it. The building, resources. Visuals are stunning. 10/10. The other negative reviews probably are just on the wrong servers and doing the wrong things. I'm having a very smooth time and so far there are no game killing bugs as of now. Respawning is designated with a craftable item and putting away resources is also achieved by making an item. Both that are very easy and cheap to make. See you in game!\n\nUpdate: After an extensive amount of gameplay I quickly grew tired of it, I constantly stuck with the game hoping that an update will fix lag issues and after some few updates it did, but what got me was the leveling and crafting. Grinding was like a Job, you are forced to do it or you won't get anywhere. I'm talking in the sense that building a decent base will take almost half a REAL life day. Then the amount it takes to actually make the item takes away almost half of your resources you spent grinding for about 30 minutes. I am sad to say that I have left this game, it has potential yes it does but the image it's creating now is not the image I saw in my head when I saw this game on greenlight. I expected Borderlands/Minecraft/Terraria. Crazy adventures and fast paced action with some nice base building that is easy and fast. Maybe next time I'll come back to this game but for now it's out of my To Play List.\n\nJUNE REVIEW\nSo I just took a look at the summer trailer and it still displays so much misleading and flashy visuals that can instantly capture a person who takes a big interest in suvival open world games such as me.\n\nDefinitely not Open World, It's just one piece of a huge land with only mobs and resources laying about with a few dungeons, nothing to interact with, just a barren wasteland. The combat is a looping cycle of meleeing and backing off, or with guns it's just unloading bullets on the mobs.Jetpacks take years to make, the fuel it uses is also a pain to get. PVP is still laggy and somewhat broken. Monocycles don't go as fast as you really think they do. Building the "claim" in this trailer would take IRL days to make considering all the resource farming you'd have to do. Still waiting for that lovely overhaul to resource gathering and actual things to do in the game rather than just kill mobs, farm dungeons.\n\nNOVEMBER:\nSo I just wanted to jump back on GRAV because of the Reborn update and not much has really changed it's still the GRAV I knew back in early 2015, the UI has improved greatly though so props for that. The environment and the world design has greatly improved too, the world isn't so barren and random anymore. It looks like an actual world and not some dream world. The vehicles look great but I have yet to obtain them. The multitool harvesting has slightly improved with a bar on the bottom indicating your progress during the harvesting. The combat is repetitive as ever and the noises during battle are still so poorly timed a revamp to the combat system is needed to immerse people in a fight, instead of just wacking things then backing off then repeat, the gun's still haven't really changed either, the reload animation is still the guy rubbing his gun "Sweety refill your clip now" kind of thing.\nOverall I think the game is slightly improving but not enough to have me recommend it, but they're getting there with these recent updates.\n\nDue to this review being quite popular, it's drawn much attention of course but with that also comes a flood of angry fans and players. Yes I dislike the game you love oh so much. I don't care, this review is meant to give the devs a kick in the head and try to look into a problem that not only me but many others find very horrible. So I please ask you to keep your insults to yourselves, take it to an online message board, and put it there, ideas and suggestions are welcome, however if you really do must write a comment of disagreement be civil and show no hostility to an individual and be humble. Thank you for taking time to read this review! Have a good day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust adding this here, completely optional and has nothing to do with the review:::\nGo play Trove, it's just like this game but not sci fi focused, There's base building, a fairly large world to explore and generate. There's exp gains and leveling. Also a loot system. Character customization, wings, mounts, and also guns and exploration. It's free to play but is not broken with Pay to win. Like I said I'm just leaving this here for people looking for games to play with this kind of genre. COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO THE REVIEW AND OPTIONAL.\n\nOh right another edit (November) Wouldn't recommend Trove anymore the little innocent sheep has grown into a devil goat, Trove has expanded quite alot and now they're adding a lot more grindy things, PVP is a real thing and eventually people will start building PVP characters and the game will probably feature PVP exclusive gear so GG to those who want to have a good casual time and still maintain good gear.\n\nThe F2P element has also bloated with their cash shop too theres alot of advertising now and almost everything you do in the game will make you think about buying something with IRL cash.\n\nSorry if none of this makes sense to you if you don't understand that's fine I'm just sharing my thoughts and taking no time to revise what I'm saying it's sort of like a free write.","June 16, 2015","false","34.4"," 1,295 of 1,497 people (87%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","87","295","1","57","63"

It's radically different from what the game was, so in my opinion most of the reviews prior to mine are no longer accurate.\n\nI'll keep it short.  This is one of the most unique games I've ever played, it's essentially a dedicated-server based online RPG with some slight survival influences, extensive base building, fun sci-fi, and an awesome resource centric progression system.  It's very much like starbound in this fact.\n\nPros:\n\n-You can travel to other planets as you level up, they rotate on a loop about 3 planets per tier so it never seems to get boring.\n-Very diverse crafting system\n-Persistent vehicle like Dune Buggies, tanks, jets, etc.  Prepare yourself for epic endgame battles over territory.\n-Territory system!  You can conque grids and form mini kingdoms on each individual planet having separate grids.\n-Class system - allows you to specialize or diversify, this game is all about choice\n-This game is very fun with friends\n-Complex PvP and raiding system.  Guys can't just show up with pickaxes and raid your base like some survivals\n-It's a very playable Alpha game, DEFINITELY worth it for the price\n-PvP is balanced, gear is a factor but a dude with a t1 pistol can very realistically challenge a top tier player\n\nCons:\n\n-This could be a pro or a "meh" depending on your mindset, 3rd person combat system, can make PvP inconsistent\n-It's grindy, but a very rewarding a fun grind especially if you're with friends\n-Get ready to break your mouse with semi-autos as you crush your LMB!  Haha!\n\nMeh:\n\n-Community, this is server-dependent.  Noob zone is easily camped, sometimes it is sometimes it isn't.

Let's sum it up:\nPROS\n-nice graphics\n-the idea of multiple planets and moons with different hazard conditions\n-official servers divided on PvE and PvP\n-the game has a lot of potential\n-lots of weapons to choose from (also balanced)\n-many different resources to get\n-great community (at least on EUR PvE server, which i played on)\nCONS\n-resources' and monsters' grindfest to the point of extreme boredom\n-more than half of all planets (except homeworlds) look similar or identical\n-only around 11-12 type of monsters\n-building anything more complicated than a simple cube is frustrating\n-there is a single player mode, but use it only for a tutorial to learn basic things - advancement is impossible there (unless You play 1000 hours) because of the way resource nodes spawn (multi is fine)\n\nAnd the last, most important one - LITTLE TO NO UPDATES SINCE HALF A YEAR! There were some small patches, that brought new hats (hooray...) and a few changes in game rules on official servers, but there's a complete lack of new content since October and no major bugs were fixed throughout those few months. The devs' support and contact is also greatly lacking.\n\nWould i recommend this game? Right now - no. As i mentioned - great potential, but squashed by people with no heart to finish their product.\nIf so, then why did I play it for so long? I guess I just like to finish things, also other people on the server made it more fun to play.","April 3","false","266.5"," 234 of 273 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","234","273","9","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercuie/recommended/332500/","mercuie","Mercuie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercuie/","275 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGame is ruled by high level players.  Being there is 0 risk to them they spend most of their time taxing (as in they gain a percentage of all the resources you farm) and killing low level players and destroying anything they want whenever they're bored.  You can't do anything to stop them but watch what you have built be destroyed and you have start over.  Luckily your levels and equipment don't reset on death, but you'll lose most your resources and the people who killed you can take the rest.  At least with other survival games, the risk to them is bigger the more they have.  So you're not always constantly attacked.\n\nThe combat is also boring.  You have several jobs to try to make the game look like there is a reason to keep grinding.  The jobs offer new passive skills and active skills to use, but don't offer any gameplay differences.  They are there strictly to drain your time.  Because when you start a new job you start with level 0 stats.  Even with your more powerful gear you'll have to go through the same grind as when you first started.  You'll have to do this on all the jobs if you want all the percs.  But unlike a MMO where the classes/jobs would offer unique gameplay, Grav offers no such thing and it's strictly there as a time sink.\n\nAnd all the monsters of the world are pretty samey as well.  Even as you gain new levels and go to new places you'll fight the same monster over and over.  And most monsters even of different kinds have the same attacks.  Most have some sort of spit attack and those that don't have a small AoE.  That's it for diversity.  Speaking of the worlds.  They’re pretty small.  Those big worlds they show in the trailer?  That’s about the size of em.  Very small.\n\nSo there you have it.  Grav, a game where you get tortured and picked on by the few high levels, while grinding against the same boring monsters, farming the same resources, so that one day you can be a high level to pick on the low level guys as well, because there is no endgame besides that.\n\nIt really isn’t worth your time, this game has nowhere to progress.  A cross between a survival game and an MMO and not very good at either.","December 1, 2015","false","41.0"," 311 of 377 people (82%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","82","311","377","17","15"

It seems like combination of Rust and your average RPG, combined in a Multiplayer experience--don't get this confused with an MMO experience. The world looks amazing right now, but what else would you expect from a UnrealEngine game. The base game seems to be a level grind and resource grind to build your house/town/city!?

I don't review things unless they really make an impression.\n\n\n/Started the game with an open mind, which really means "Why did I buy this?Well lets see what kinda mess this is.."\n/I was pleasantly surprised.\n/Picked a server from the extensive server list and joined.\n/After weeping at the view, I start to wander.\n/Met a higher level player, may his benevolence continue to shine, for I was not murdered instantly.\n/I fought some monsters, and surprised at how you need a tad bit of skill for even basic ones.\n/Of course I got hurt. Built a campfire and danced.\n/I could FEEL the music. Someone said 'Hello' and joined the fire-dance, The music got better.\n/I realized after the dance was over the 'someone' was an NPC... OMFG WHAT! NPCSARESOCOOL\n/talked to NPC.  NPCS are ok...\n/Gathered resources and got lost. desperately tried to locate my fire for hours.\n/Gave up, and made a new one, realized how cheap it was...Shame.\n/Crafted a small 2 room 'base'  (hovel) and put assorted crafting structures around it.\n/Lost it all to a walking bomb or two.\n/Rebuilt the base, realized how expensive it was...Shame.\n/Broke some machinery that didn't belong to me, gathered something I didn't understand.\n/Ran far away when high level people started making death threats in chat over the loss, giggled in mischievious glee.\n/Went into dungeon with basic rotted wood armor like a champion.\n/Died horrible death for my hubris.\n/Realized I am back at my first Fire and have no idea where my base is.\n/Gave up on that server, MADE MY OWN!\n/I AM GOD OF THIS LAND\n/INVITED FRIENDS\n/WE ARE GODS\n/contentment\n\n10/10 Would be god again\n\nOk for the real review:\nlike myself, you are reading these reviews for the simple fact that, yes, Early Access has burned you hard, probably 2-3 times and you're torn inside thinking "why do I do this to myself, here I am, looking at ANOTHER E.A."\nThis review is for THAT gamer.\n\nFirst off I've bought my fair share of crap, I don't learn. But this is my first review on an Early Access game for a reason.\nThe game's not finished but that doesn't mean its not working! The game has DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of hours of content. Like a sandbox, you make your own game out of it. Are you going to follow the mold and be a settler? An explorer? A raider? A completionist? GRAV has something for everyone.\n\nThe negatives:\n>Its Early Access: Its not Optimized, Its not Finished, ITS NOT A FULL GAME. please understand this.\n>The UI is slowly being put together, which means its kinda crap, but at least In 2 days I've seen some improvements.\n>Running your own server is an exercise in basic Batch File building. Admining your server is an exercise in commands\n\nThe Positives:\n>Its Early Access: It's being ACTIVELY supported, every indication, like how i've downloaded 3 fixes in 2 days, says so.\n>It's Early Access: If you love the game now, every addition is FREE DLC. If you followed Minecraft for years, you know what to expect.\n>There's tons to do. and the leveling and gear system is well-built. It rides the line between 'quick and easy' (and boring and bored of this game) to 'long and arduous' (and boring and bored of this game) You'll feel like you have a goal that's just around the corner for many hours, which let's be honest is damn near impossible to find in games these days.\n>If you take the time to learn the commands, there's a ton of control you can influence on your gameplay. (check built in Wiki link in-game)\n>You heal by dancing around a fire. that fire makes music when you do. the music gets better the more people dance. THE MUSIC IS DUBSTEP.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10 It's amazing and I'll be back to flip that review to a 10/10 if they continue development and finish the game.","January 14, 2015","true","21.9"," 115 of 126 people (91%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","91","115","126","72","3"

Imagine Rust and Planet Explorers had a baby and named it GRAV.\n\nI have played 5 hours straight, was killed in PvP once, owned by flying bugs, made friends, built a base with them, explored caves. The game has tons of potential, but requires your patience, I believe as more players join, more servers will come up, creating another succesful survival game, but this time with a different feel to it!\n\nTotally recommend the game for those who understand what Early Access Games with tons of potential require.\n\nEdit 1: after playing even more, I've noticed some bugs but they never ruined the fun! the only issue is the lag at times, but the devs are working on it!\n\nEdit2: crowded servers tend to lag a bit more than servers with 8-16 people on is what I noticed from trying out different servers. The game is enjoyable in less crowded servers at current state.\n\nEdit3: as of Patch 4, the lag has been reduced and server performance really improved. Looking forward to future updates.\n\nEdit4: as of the 18th of January, Patch 7 is released, more improvements (CPU/GPU-wise) in bay as well as further graphical enhancements. see the announcments for further info.\n\nI don't know anymore.

Like PlanetSide 2,some places can make quite a scenery and I love it ! Just remember to turn Post Processing ON.\n+ Cool vehicles designs with a wide range of variety,from wingsuits to fighter jets,each with its upgraded version that consume less fuel and have more speed.\n+ Humor element included.Dancing Gangnam Style beside a campfire with a dubstep music will replenish your health and stamina.You can also poop anywhere you want.\n+ Fun building.Bases are some kind of your personal trophy,and designing it is a lot of fun,especially preparing your base to punish griefers.\n+ Your character can do a lot of emotions,it decreases the crude feeling of the game.For example,you can wave,you can clap,you can vomit,you can say hi,you can salute,etc.\n+ Very friendly and supportive community.They will help you level up,they will help you farm,they will give you high level weapons and multitools,they will guide you,and some of them will give you a ride to certain places if you don't have a vehicle yet.(Asia 01 server)\n+ Very active and communicative devs that will help you with any kind of in-game issue\n+ New players won't suffer from high level players,since there's some kind of protection policy on Asia 01 server.High level players who kill new players will get punished by the level 300 guy.Big shoutout to Klipwc for the great guide and his support for new players.\n\nCons :\n- Game performance is dreadful.You will experience crashes mid-game,connection interruptions (ur character blinks around the map),fps spikes,ping spikes,endless loading screen,game suddenly not responding after loading,and sometimes,you will have to wait around 25 minutes after loading for the map around you to load.During this wait time,the map around you will refresh constantly and you will get 5 to 20 seconds freeze each time you try to move.The problem is from the game itself.High end gaming PCs won't fix this.\n- Spotlights will drop your fps to 5-10 if you fly near them,despite your strong PC spec\n- Very few players(2-10 players each server).This is due to the high system requirements and the current state of the game.\n- Needs a lot of time to farm.The resources you get from the sources are so low that it makes the majority of time you will spend in the game is for farming.\n- Monster spawning system still require a lot of work.Monsters still spawn behind you,on top of you,or sometimes doesn't spawn at all even if I already waited for 15 minutes.Imagine high level bosses spawn on top of your head.\n- If a lot of people play this game,this game will not be ready for 32 players on each server.I'm sure it will increase the loading time,and your bases will get destroyed everyday.People will attack each other for the resources,since it will take a long time to farm,and they will also try to get the 100 kill hat trophy.\n- You will lose 90% of your resource when you die (50% if you maxed your Astronaut skill).As I said before,this game is not ready for 32 players.Imagine 32 hostile players attack each other for resources and no high level player protect the new players.It will be a total chaos.Bases will be destroyed easily by the players that already has rocket launchers or tanks.Losing 90% of resource is a pretty ridiculous system and it's one of the biggest factor that make this game isn't ready for 32 players.\n- Classic RPG mentality problem.Some high level players are very proud of their bases,vehicles,weapons,etc.They show off their things everyday to the new players and tell them to do stupid things for their amusement.\n-Griefers alert.Griefers are extremely annoying in this game and one of them are very active going around the servers to troll.They will destroy your bases,change your signs,steal your resources,etc.All experienced players are currently hunting griefers even though it's very hard to find and punish them,since they always move from server to server.Beware for M.F Thatherson.He is the infamous griefer that goes around the servers.\n- New player spawn point system is ridiculous.There is a chance for you to spawn inside hostile base even though it's your first time playing.Auto turrets will shred new players that're the victim of this spawning system.I was forced to leave my old base because I accidentaly built it on the noob spawn point.\n- You need 16 gigs of RAM if you want to run your own server,and at least 8 gigs of RAM to play with maximum settings.This requirement really shows that this game isn't optimized well and perform horribly.Note that not all country has cheap access to computer thingies.\n- New guns only means new colors.No new designs from each guns.There's only 1 design for pistol,1 design for shotgun,1 design for SMG,and 1 design for Assault Rifle.The melee already has a lot of designs though.\n- No headshot hitbox,makes combat system very boring and requires a long time.Imagine holding LMB/clicking LMB multiple times for hours on each cave with no variation at all.\n- No new weapon sounds.All weapons have the same sound,except SMG and shotgun.\n- Boring and dreadful soundtrack,except the campfire dubstep music.\n- Building bases maybe fun but the building system is still not perfect.It's pretty complicated and made a lot of my friends frustrated.\n- Bases lack of decorations.They should add chairs,tables,or any other decorations that has actual effect on the game.For example,a daily EXP/resource buff if we use certain furnitures.Today,all bases are only filled with crafting stations,composter,stargates,and their defense systems,which make the bases look horribly empty.\n\nSuggestions\n1.Fix the performance of the game ASAP.The game's performance today is extremely horrible.It's worse than horrible.There's no word to describe it.It's just a total mess.Imagine losing 90% of your resources only because you disconnected by the game's ping spikes and the game killed you with "CDT_ForcedSuicide"\n2.Increase the farming speed.Harvest pets should give twice resources and each resource points should have more resources available.Farming 20 woods from each tree while you need thousands to build a base and craft things is ridiculous.\n3.Ban griefers.I know it's PvP and griefing is technically not an illegal thing.But remember that it hurts the player base because common sane people hate and avoid games with griefers.Griefers are trollers.They are people who have questionable sanity and mentality,that entertain themselves by making other people angry through internet because they feel invincible since people can't do anything to them.\n4.Find permanent teammates.With today's rate of farming,you need at least 1 permanent teammate.The more the merrier.Teammates will decrease the time needed to build a base and craft things,because you can easily trade resources through public/FoF only storage bin.\n5.Play at the most crowded server in your region.More high level guys means more support for new players.Just be patient when they're showing off,and refuse when they told you to do stupid things for their amusement.\n6.Read Klipwc's guide on how to make grief-proof base.There is a way to completely prevent griefers from destroying your base\n\nOverall,this game has a great potential.But it still needs a lot of work (Remember,it's still on early access).I know that today only a few people play this game,but opening the server for 32 players with this current state of the game is ridiculous.If they want to open it for 32 players,they have to be ready for it.Note that I am not stating that there are literally 32 players inside the game today.Even with this current state,I still have a lot of fun playing it with my friends,as long as I ignore the irritating people.","July 25, 2015","true","89.9"," 121 of 137 people

Does not match advertisement or expectations. Several environments in preview videos do not exist. Previews suggest gameplay that is not present in current stage of development. Gameplay is exceedingly simplistic grinding for numbers. Game is in alpha stages with resource, stability, and memory leak issues. Potential exists, but no amount of quantity makes up for the lack of quality.\n\nWhat follows is a section by section commentary on the "about this game" bullet points.\n\nEndless Worlds - Planets are not procedurally generated, counter to advertisement. All planets have a static map. Exoplanets rotate every 3 hours, making some game objects virtually useless. Exoplanets are often either small enough or with rough terrain to render land vehicles near useless. Flying vehicles feature six axis movement but no horizon or flight hud and no tuneable flight controls: expect to roll and tumble wildly for your first dozen flights. Glide suit and jetpack do not work together, you must alternate using one and the other to remain in the air.\n\nGorgeous Visuals - While GRAV can be rather pretty, the visuals are unoptimised. The game itself consumes an inordinate amount of system RAM (4gb+) and leaks memory (consumed 7gb system ram after a few hours). Reducing texture LOD reduces visual quality far faster than system load. I frequently experienced terrible artifacting near the beach area, with each patch to the game slightly altering the location and severity of the artifacting.\n\nFrenzied Combat - Circle strafe while tapping backwards and holding the fire button for up to a minute per enemy. Twelve different palatte swapping enemies advance with the same mindless behavior and ignore collision with most player placed objects, but halt and become confused when the player jumps onto slightly elevated or out of the way platforms. Enemy melee attacks damage the player for ~50% of health in early game and nearly nothing late game. Rare enemies use mild but irritating camera shake inducing ranged attacks alternating with AoE ground pounds and regular melee. One mob has a pushback that deals significant damage if you are pushed into a wall. "Boss" type enemies are ~3x the size with ~4x the health and ~2x the XP. Using on-tier equipment against equal-level mobs, players damage enemies for ~1% of health using automatic weapons: expect to carry 10,000 rounds of ammunition and use 75-150 rounds per mob. Grind away for hours as XP gain sharply falls toward 10 when fighting mobs below your level and damage sharply falls toward 1 when fighting mobs above your level. Enjoy becoming stuck on random terrain or ambushed by sudden respawns from behind and dropping 50-90% of your loot.\n\nPlayer vs Player - No easily managed friends list: become friends with people by giving them the numeric passcode to your team's private chat and granting them entry to all your buildings and belongings. No method to determine who is currently using that passcode. Changing your individual passcode does not automatically update your buildings or chests. No such thing as a list of foes for tracking your enemies. No such thing as a neutral list, anyone who isn't your friend is your enemy. Impossible to raid other players bases unless they contain one of two different placeable objects.\n\nPlay With Friends - Most of my friends were bored within 10 hours. Many quit after 60. Due to the nature of the friend passcode, it is very difficult to make friends for fear of major theft. System resource requirement is prohibitive to running a Solo or local server.\n\nPowerful Base Construction - Build cube shaped rooms to make cube shaped bases. No method to control which walls are removed or preserved when building an adjoining room. No method to add walls back to a room after walls have been removed. Destroy the entire room and try again. Sometimes this requires you to destroy an entire quarter of a base and try again. Don't bother trying to build balconies around your base. Turret damage is overpowered at low levels and near worthless at upper levels.\n\nExtensive Crafting - There are ~123 different crafting materials, but the bulk of work is done by 10. The rest are one-off items for specific recipes you may use only once or never at all. You will craft an AR and an SMG because the AR has the best DPS without rapid clicking and the SMG ammo drops are plentiful enough to make it a viable secondary. All other ammunition is a waste of inventory space. By the time you have an automatic weapon, melee is a waste of time and effort. Equipment progresses linearly while costs increase somewhat exponentially. Defensive equipment is the primary progression, but variation is lacking. At least one set of equipment is a palette swap. Defending against an environmental hazard often means using equipment well below the area's difficulty. There is no method to sort, filter, or easily manage your inventory or your storage bins.\n\nDynamic Environmental Events - Enemies spawn more frequently at night. Night is very dark and flashlights are craftable temporary accessories. Large numbers of a single enemy type will spawn occasionally as an "event". I have never seen flowers bloom as part of the day/night cycle as advertised. I have never seen meteors fall across the terrain as advertised, let alone regular rain. Sometimes there is fog, and that's about it.\n\nProcedurally Generated Dungeons - Dungeons are procedurally generated from about sixteen different component rooms, but component rooms are static, uninteresting tunnels, often accompanied by invisible clip walls and enemy pathing issues. The same four direct harvestable resources are available on all planets. Three resources require a placeable object to create/harvest. Four resources are exoplanet specific, making them slightly harder to get. Each "level" of exoplanet has an "uncommon" variation of each of these resources, but you'll soon find yourself throwing out stacks and stacks of the uncommons once you've used them for their one purpose. Sometimes there is a pit in the caves or the procedural generation makes a gap to empty space; I guess those are the advertised environmental obstacles.\n\nHostile Environments - Warping to a planet with a hostile environment without the appropriate equipment begins a countdown. When the countdown is over, you lose 5% of your max health every "tick". All water off the home planet is damaging. That's about it.\n\nRoadmap - Several of these features are already or partially implemented. This is not a good track of coming features or completed features.","January 3","false","257.0"," 171 of 210 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","171","210","11","25"

From the few videos you see you really want to get it, at least that happened to me. Is it fun? Yeah, but it won't last long.\nI felt attracted to the game mainly because of the looks of it and the fact that it was a survival/crafting game.\n\n:: SURVIVAL ::\n-The only survival aspect if you play singleplayer (hosting your own server to play alone in it) is the fact that you have that hunger bar, that, if you just farm for blueprints, exp, and materials from mobs you'll get plenty. Nothing more, you won't even see it, like, NEVER, going down to half.\n-In multiplayer the survival aspect comes from trying to survive from other players, if you are on a pvp server ofc.\n\n:: ENEMIES ::\nLittle variety. You have slimes, something that resembles a really fat bee, a tick/louse thing that barks, a blue humanoid alien that you really don't want near you and another mob that's called Day killer and Night killer (depends on the time of the day) that runs fast and wants to kill you. The only thing that change with this mobs is that they are elemental based (Icy slime or blaze slime f.e.). Can't remember if you have more enemies.\n\n:: CRAFTING ::\nDon't, just DON'T buy this if you assume the crafting system will be like Minecraft or Don't Starve. You can craft very few things at the beginning, and if you want more, you need to kill everything on sight hoping to get a blueprint. This is easier if the mob or boss you are killing has a few levels more than you (1 or 2). The red crates that drop stuff just gives you materials, not blueprints. A thing devs might add to the crates, at least basic bp's.\n\n:: WEAPONS ::\nYou have the basic item, and the same with an elemental damage type to craft (fire, ice, poison, electric, and maybe one more). U start with a hunting knife, then you might get a club, a wooden sword, pistols, rifles, and even a shotgun.\nFiring weapons sux, really low dmg even with the Pet that buff that. I used a wooden sword, and a wooden sword with fire damage until lvl 14. Remember, if you don't get a blueprint from monster drops, you are gonna have a bad time...\n\nThe "mining tool" that you use to get ores, wood, crystals and stuff has like 10 or more upgraded versions to craft (Mark I, Mark II, Mark III, etc.). I crafted the Mark VIII and didn't even noticed a change. Maybe it mined a bit faster, but the same numbers of mats where being mined (1).\n\n:: The World ::\nSmall if you ask me. Even more small if u join a server with lots of ppl. It has a central island, and 1 or 2 more of high lvl mobs and dungeons (from 14 to 29 from what i saw).\nCan't remember if the stuff i read before buying the game said anything about being able to explore other worlds but you can't here, not now at least. Remember it's an EA.\n\n:: FINAL NOTES ::\nIf you like the general idea of the game (watch gameplays) and want to buy it now before it's fully finished (and more expensive maybe), buy it.\nIf not, don't do it. I bought it in 11/01/2015 and today (14/01/2015) am ready to say that maybe when finished, it will be a fun game to play. Not now, but maybe someday.\n\nI really don't know what more to say. I liked the game the time i played it. I still like it, and i think this has much more to offer.\nRight now devs are trying to reduce the lag on their servers, but between yesterday and today i had to download 2 patches, wich is a good thing.","January 13, 2015","true","15.7"," 105 of 121 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","105","121","4","0"

The game was extremely buggy, laggy, bad performance and there was no single player ( multiplayer server you could play alone but it required a lot of resources ).\n\nBear in mind that we can only make first impressions / review of the game based on what is "released" or presented to us. Game was in terrible state but it was a rough diamond. That being said, I couldn't just blindly recommend buying this game because of moral issues. There were more stable ALPHA's out there that you could actually play and enjoy the little content they had.\nAdd to that the fact that "we" as gamers can't trust the "promises" of the developers. How many times we have been robbed silly by blindly believing "this game has a potential" ? I can name a few games : Starforge and Legend Of Aethereus. Promises weren't delivered, production stopped and money was never seen again. Hence I can't justify the reviews that are protecting the game rather than consumer. If you like your ♥♥♥ handed over to you then so be it. Just don't involve other people money.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nReview\n\nAfter couple of months of patching and rapid development ( seems like the Dev's are working hard, gotta give them credit for that ) the game is finally playable for me. It runs around 50 FPS in 1080p, there are slow downs here and there but nothing really major.\nIt seems like they have improved performance and eliminated some of the bugs / lag issues I was having.\n\nThe biggest change for me was the addition of the Single Player ( I don't have to do port forwarding now or do anything in that matter, just one click of a button and a long loading screen ).\n\nIt seems like they have added a lot of new content and balanced the game as well. That being the case, monster spawns are bad and can get you killed if you are not on your toes. Guns feel underpowered and there is this Level system for everything which to me is a bit stupid. It reminds me of Borderlands ( higher level mobs are almost impossible to kill when low level and gear ). I was never a fan of such concept but it's playable regardless whether I like it or not. Player has to adapt accordingly.\nTo the game defense I can add that while enemy A.I can be dumb, game is action based and requires manual aiming, dodging and melee combos. Which feels and sounds great! I hope the will refine what they have here.\n\nAs for the crafting and harvesting, I had no issues there as it gets progressively easier. If you are upgrading your tools that is. Once you get through initial grind ( in the beginning ) then player can focus on combat and exploration.\n\nThere are randomly generated dungeons which offer little rewards ( blueprints, resources etc. ) but are worth exploring regardless.\n\nSadly there is no terra forming so all of the resources are on the surface and as far as I know I can't blow trees/ground up. I can live with that tho...\n\nOverall it is a game that I have high hopes for and I can safely say that finally it's worth current price ( 14.99 ).\nOne thing HAS to be said. As they upload new patches they tend to wipe the servers. Which results in loss of saves/worlds. I wish they can overcome that in the future so character data at least stays unchanged.\n\nIf you like sandbox experiences with really fun combat and exploration then this game might be for you. If you have friends then it's even better.\n\nPeace.","April 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","88","97","0","29"

I'm sure ALOT is going to be added in the future.\nThese buildings can all be protected from outsiders or be set to public if you wish to share with others\n\nThe game is heavily material grind and PvE based wich in my opinion is great cause you feel that you have progression but ofcourse that differs for others.\nThat said PvP is also a big part of this game. At the moment when you kill other players you can loot all their resources if they aren't able to pick it up within 15 minutes. The gear will stay after the resources are picked up so you won't be completely useless after you've been killed.\n\nCombat takes abit getting used to i'm hoping to see future improvements since the animation when swinging your melee just swings your arm rather then seeing your body put weight into the swing.\nWould also love to see more diversity in melee weapons as the begin we're able to make a 'club' while the rest of the melee weapons are all knifes ( wich look pretty badass )\n\nFor guns there is a good diversity from what i've seen. Assault rifles, pistols and shotguns at the moment.\nCombat with those also needs improvement since now whenever you shoot you always have to be zoomed in wich is quite annoying since you cant really see what's going on around you and walk into mobs or against walls wich gets me killed most of the time.\n\nAs for teams we're able to set a 'FoF' up at the moment that way you can share structures, portals and other stuff with your buddies.\n\nI've had tons of fun so far and will continue playing this. Already been in a conflict with other players where i got ganked on the moon and retaliated by seeking sweet revenge upon their base !\n\nBring it on players !\n\nOh and if you don't like PvP you can always choose a PvE server :)\n\nI hope this review gave you enough information, if you have any questions feel free to ask.\nI always keep steam broadcasting on for everyone so if u want to see gameplay footage you can always check it out too !\n\n\n","March 11, 2015","true","164.3"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","74","78","8","0"

The devs pushed out the Reborn Update, which got lots of people into the game, but neglected to fix a number of annoying Quality of Life bugs for weeks on end.  (One of which could have been fixed by a // or /*)  Players hemmoraged as soon as they added "overflow servers" to handle the free period players that swarmed in.  Older players left during this period and didn't bother to return.  These overflow servers, or at least the architecture behind them still exist to this day, splitting players up and making it impossible to play with one's friends from the get-go. (Extra step(s) added beyond building a flare launcher: Acquire blueprint for Home Gate, Build Home Gate.)  Two serious mismanagements nearly wiped their active player table to pre-Reborn Update levels.\n\nGRAV's premise is amazing and I watched it for over a year and a half, and have played it extensively, but I took a break (around that free weekend with the annoying sprint bug at its heels), poked back at it and I don't see myself wanting to play this again, since I can't start playing with my friends.  They get thrown onto a different sub-server which is, all-in-all, poorly noted to the player.\n\nThey appear to have gotten lazy, dev updates are nearly nonexistent on Steam.  This game is on life support for the time being.  (Really, what have they been working on for the last six months and why are they so reluctant to tell us about it?)\n\nI'll be checking back periodically, but I have much lower hopes for the future after this debaucle.

add as it progresses\n(EDIT: I should perhaps specify that I purchased the game while it was on sale during it's being launched on Steam, the standard price of the game is of course more)\n\nGRAV is a crafting/resource/survival game...one of many that have sprung up from the success of Minecraft and DayZ\nWhat I find attractive about GRAV is the Sci-fi setting, I'm not really into the swords and zombies direction most survival games take (just a personal preference)\n\nThe game is currently in Alpha and at this stage is more a proof of concept, while future features and functionality will most likely be patched in as the game goes through it's journey from Alpha to Beta and finally to RELEASE, this is what we can expect from the core experience\n\nAs of now I had no trouble running the game, nor any trouble finding a server\nWhile at the time of this writing there is not yet a singleplayer/offline mode, this I expect will be added in the future\nFor now it was best for me to play on a public server, especially since there is really not much to this game except the bare bones functions and interacting with other players and what they had built gave me a jump start on the begining of the game and gave me something else to do beside the few functions available at this time\nThere are most certainly bugs and glitches and wonky controls, but since this is an Alpha I'm willing to set aside these flaws with the assumption that most if not all will be addressed at a later date\nWhat I'll be focusing on is what the core elements of the game are like as of now\n\n-IMPRESSIONS-\nYou spawn in the wilderness, most likely near other players which makes resource gathering a bit of a hike...since you'll have to travel to find the resource nodes you'll need to craft your items\nYou have only a knife and a Multitool at start, and you can make your way just fine with those alone, though stronger enemies and dungeons might require stocking up on better gear\nYou'll fight weird aliens and gather resources to build a home base or try your luck in one of the leveled dungeon instances that spawn throughout the world\nYou'll explore weird alien landscapes where the laws of physics seem to bend if not break, with rocky deserts and lush yellow forests, from floating rocks to poison seas, from abandoned structures to crashed spacecraft\nAll randomly generated so each trip over the mountain offers a chance at something new\n\n-CRAFTING-\nWhile I played I found only 5 nodes to gather resources\nTrees = Wood\nPiles of Bone = Fossils\nShiny Rocks = Ore\nSmoking Crater = Element X\nEach node has a chance to drop a more refined or rare resource, but overall these are all you can expect to find as far as gathering/farming is concerned\nYou use these resources to craft buildings and crafting stations\nAs of now there is no way to un-build what you've built, but I'd expect this to change in the future\nCrafting Stations are where you'll build your equipment and refine your resources, Upgrading your stations allows for access to more items\nEnemies are currently the only way to gather new recipes and blueprints\n\n-COMBAT-\nCombat is real time and skill based, you'll have to time your swings and stay outside of the enemies range of attack\nYou'll gain levels from killing enemies and each enemy has it's own level, so don't be surprised to see yourself die at the hands of a higher level enemy\nDeath is not perminent, in fact you don't even lose all your items, only a portion of your items are left at your corpse (and that portion can be reduced by spending skill points in the appropriate skill)\nYour lost items will remain where you died and will be "Loot Locked" for a period of time, no one will be able to loot your corpse until the timer has expired\n\n-SURVIVAL-\nAs of now you need only fear starvation, you'll start with a portion of food and if you craft a farm you can restock your food for your journey\nNight time is not the time for huddleing in some crude structure while waves of baddies swarm around you, the only thing to fear in the night is the lower visibility\nThe game does have night time monster swarms that spawn higher level monsters, but they are random and come every couple days or so, they are posted on your HUD telling you what the spawn is and when it will arrive\n\n-VISUALS-\nI think the game is beautiful, I'm a huge fan of bright colorful environments and stylized characters and monsters\nI enjoy the design direction the game has taken, with a slightly Retro/Pulp sense for shapes and patterns...like stepping into a modern interpretation of the Weird Science comics I love\n\n-AUDIO-\nThis is probably my least enjoyed portion of my experience, while I did enjoy the music a lot of the sound effects seemed "canned"...as if they were just there to fill a function temporarily, which since this is an Alpha just may be the case\n\nSo overall the game has only a little to offer at this stage in it's development, but I'm hopeful more will be added as things are polished and programed\nSo if you're into games like Planet Explorers or Starbound and you want to support an independent developer while they try to make this game all it can be, then you could do a lot worse with your money than buying this game\n\nHope to have been of help\nTallow","January 8,

As I spawned into the game having no idea what I was doing or where I was I was stunned by the almost dream like graphics. As night comes by I build a campfire and around 3-4 other level 0 noobies like myself gathered around and chatted. After one of us found the x button (the dance key) we all went ham. The stunning realization that this dope ♥♥♥ music was implemnted as the main way of healing in the game just adds to my respect of the creators. The amount of hype for 5 level 0 noobies was something I have never experienced before, we exchanged stories and went our seperate ways. As morning one of my fire buddies and I began to finish the objectives until around level 5 where it really started to get interesting. We started to get blueprints for vehicles, assault rifles, wing suits, and frog feet (<-- actually quite helpful). Campfire buddy and I have mics so we can enjoy our adventure togethor as we conquer dungeons, wreck n00bs, and pillage from the rich. I soon invited a friend to play with us, so campfire guy and I tp'ed to his world and proceed to waste all of our wood and fossils searching for this scruberino by shooting flares every 5 seconds, but eventually we found him and pillaged togethor once again. As you can see after only my first day of playing this game I have already logged 5 hours into this game.\n\nSide Note: I was originally only going to play about an hour of this game and go back and play fallout 4 but this game just grabed my attention.","November 13, 2015","true","8.2"," 100 of 123 people (81%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","81","100","123","28","2"

The issue(s) that plague the game at the moment is lag, lots and lots of lag, to the point where it's unplayable to check out the other parts of the game to decide on its quality and whether it's good or bad, but from the parts I've played and managed to look into it is as follows..\n\nThe graphics are decent, with the art style being really colorful and good looking, same goes for the level design of the game with how nice the landscape looks, kind of reminds of No Man's Sky, but it definitely has its own unique fun look.\n\nThe controls are nice and responsive but a bit floaty/boaty, and the UI/Interface of the game are really basic, you can see that it's sort of a place holder. Crafting and building structures and objects/items are easy, but not that convenient/enjoyable with how basic the UI is at the moment. Also, there isn't much to do at the moment aside from crafting, building structures and items, exploring and killing monsters, there may be a lot more stuff to do but it's hard to tell right now, since there is no offline mode too (at the moment, not sure if it will come later on)\n\nSo yea, that's what I got from playing the game at the moment, with how massive the lag is right now. The game has great potential to be a lot of fun, looking at the videos, and getting a quick play session of it now. I don't recomemend it right now, but will definitely check the game constantly to check if it's an ok purchase or not, because I do have really high hopes for this one.","January 8, 2015","true","18.3"," 98 of 121 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","98","121","2","22"

I find myself to be easily distracted due to the urge to explore and find new blueprints. Whether you're playing on your own, with friends, or with strangers, it's always a lot of fun. There's PVE and PVP servers to suit the experience you're wanting from the game as well as Official and Unoffical servers. Like I said, it's incredibly easy to become distracted in GRAV. I often find myself gathering resources, then spotting a dungeon and being drawn to the idea of killing mobs and finding them precious blueprints. GRAV  can  be a very unforgiving world, you'll have to watch your back whilst gathering, ensure there's enough wood in your generator to power your base and be very cautious on new planets you travel to. All in all, it's a fantastic game, despite some optimisation issues and bugs (remember people, this  is  an Early Access game run by an Indie Dev). With a recent major update and an enthusiastic and active dev team, this is a game that is sure to have a great future ahead of itself.","November 1, 2015","true","50.2"," 113 of 145 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","113","145","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klip/recommended/332500/","klip","Klipwc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klip/","581 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWith over a 160 hours on Grav as of the time this review was written. I did like to believe I can at least write a decent one.\nI now clock over 400 hours as of build 20.\n\nI have also written a guide for this game. Reading it will help you address the common annoyances people have with the game and also further influence your decision to get it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470854662\nThe review has had stuff added due to patch 19. Nothing was removed though.\nThis review has been re-written for build 20 due to the large amount of stuff and improvments added to the game. New players have a much easier time starting the game now due to the new damage curve, area level re-rolls and tutorial objectives.\n\nFirstly, Grav is a sandbox open world, much like the other sandboxes on the market, you farm for resources, craft stuff, build bases and consume stuff to survive. It also belongs in the Sci-fi theme. The game does start out alittle boring, but once you get to around level 13 and make your first trip to the moon, the game becomes infinitely more fun then. I would suggest trying the game till this point before asking for a refund.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from the others? Honestly I cant give a definite answer to this yet, and I am not gonna mention dancing. The game is still in development and community suggestions on stuff to be added to the game are conflicting. [ e.g building decay ] But still I am recommending it  based on several factors.\n\nPros:\nLarge maps\nGame is gorgeous\nThey got the basics right\nAll basic resources are always useful\nGreat developers\nEarly access, updates come hard and fast, a new build every 2 weeks\nVehicles, jetpacks, wingsuits\nProblems are solved fast\nBuilding stuff is great if you are innovative\n\nCons:\n8GB RAM requirement\nRepetitive combat [or rather, non existent combat changes across levels]\nRepetitive dungeons [see a few and you see it all]\nNo end game content [yet]\nInsufficient playerbase\nResource farming requires some knowledge of where to get the fastest amount\nSome lag is present\nGriefers. Like almost every sandbox game? Griefers is a problem.\nBuilding stuff is horrible if you dont excatly excell at doing stuff like that\nEarly access\n\nSo allow me to elaborate on the pros.\nThe maps are pretty large maps. The starter world for example is consisted of 2 - 3 Islands and each Island is serval kilometers wide. By basics I mean, combat, movement, UI and stuff are all decently done, there are some problems and room for improvements but updates are comming in fast for them.\n\nThe game is gorgeous? A picture says a thousand words.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482330205\n\nComments saying the game did not ship with graphics shown in the store screenshots? Rubbish... They didnt turn on post proccessing, obviously it wont look the same.\n\nAll resources have a use for them, you wont, lets say... have no need for wood when you reach max level. Far from it, wood becomes more important than ever. This applies to every single resource. Something which you thought useless at the start, for example, I thought plasma was useless after I got off the moon, little did I know my vehicles and drill platfolm required plasma to run... until I got them that is.\n\nThe developers are great, they are actively talking with the community, suggestions made by the community have even been added into the experimental build within hours.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/332500/discussions/3/530645446313592491/\n\nProof that I aint just pulling your leg.\nThere is a normal build, and an experimental one. Roughly every two weeks, all the patches added to experimental is released to the normal build and the build number goes up by one. Currently waiting on build 21.\n\nWhat I mean by building stuff is great if you are innovative? Well...\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470288120\n\nA building project I did alone dubbed Project Racer. This was completed in less than 4 days inclusive of resource gathering.\nThe full thing can be viewed here\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/332500/discussions/0/530645446305634897/\n\nAlso my base\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487241226\n\nYou may check my guide under section 7. for building projects I have completed and am in the midst of making. Hopefully they might give you some ideas if you do intend to buy GRAV\n\n\nNow for the cons.\n\nThe ultimate killer for this game IMO, the game requires at least 8GB RAM to play properly at the moment. You can disable all the graphic options to enable GRAV to run at 4GB but thats the very bottomline it can go for now. This basically means unless you are using a custom laptop / high end one. You will not be able to play GRAV on a laptop.\n\nLike a few other reviews have mentioned. There isnt much variety, Once you see a level 1 slime, you have seen the attack patterns for a level 60 slime as well. There are also NO headshot hitboxes in the game YET. I have personally confirmed with the developers they are adding this in, but no ETA on it yet. So what does all these mean? Basically PvE combat in this game boils down to kiting over and over again. But considering its early access and they are planning to release more content for combat its excusable... at least for me.\n\nCurrently the game has basically non-existent replayable end game content. But as you can probably see, the devs are starting to prepare and release stuff for that. Vehicles for upcomming warzones like the build 20 released hammerhead [ VTOL Jet ]. New monsters, stuff like that.\n\nInsufficient playerbase is related to its somewhat bad start and also the lack of end game content. When more content is released, I do believe the playerbase will increase substainally. This game has alot of potiential and the devs are living up to it.\n\nResource farming on the other hand isnt as bad as some people made it sound. As with a majority of the cons, I have covered ways to make your life easier in the guide above.\n\n\nThe game is horribly optimised for large scale building projects atm. Patch 19 is supposed to fix quite alot of it but we will see.\nEDIT\nAs of patch 19, Building large scale projects no longer lags the game to kingdom come. I now run at a pretty smooth 20 fps around my base. Previous was 9 - 15 FPS along with severe lag spikes. Do note that my base is HUGE and filled with dymanic base items like laser fences. I play with 30 - 60 FPS on other planets. This is with a custom laptop.\nAnother EDIT\nPatch 20 further improves on building with serval optimizations and also introduces building decay into the game.\n\nAnd.... griefers. This one is a major blow to the game. I will be upfront and say this. The PvE servers are even worse for griefing than the PvP ones. This is because a griefer can shoot your buildings and you cant even damage them while they are doing so on the PvE ones. They are planning fixes for this but I did not ask for an ETA for this [because there are ways to grief proof your buildings]. Also there are alot of stupid things that are done [e.g new player killing] by a small minority of jerk players... well you get my point. If you do intend to get this game I recommend you head to the offical server in your region with 01 in their name. For example, I am based in ASIA PvP 01. These servers normally have an active community that will help and look out for each other to keep the griefers away.\n\nBuilding stuff, this one took me hours to learn. Once you learn how to utilise the system its easy, but before that its a pain in the *ahem* to do so. Just building a simple house with a single door to a balcony can drive you nuts when you are first starting to build stuff. I have covered how to use the system in the guide.\n\nAnd so yeah, do I recommend this game?\nIf its on sales? Of course\nAt full price? Sure, I gotten more than my money back already.","June 27, 2015","true","675.0"," 107 of 136 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","107","136","11","4"

Sure I read what it was about and everything but, since its early access i didnt think it had much to offer. Damn I was wrong!\n\nJust bought today and put in a good four hours so read this review with some caution. I'm not fully capeable of giving a in-depth review.\n\nI started out by playing with two of my buddies. Making a server wasn't that hard it's almost like making a vannila Minecraft server. (Need help go to wiki) Then loaded into the world. The first 20 secconds will be a bit laggy because, everything rendering in. We got a house going and started cave hunting. The enemies scale nicely and theres not much of a learning curve. I would also like to add that I absolutly love how the developers of this game update it almost daily! Thats somthing i love to see. It shows they care about their consumers and game! Keep up the good work!\n\nPros~\n-Small learning curve\n-Looks Beautiful (For alpha)\n-Lots of content (Was very surprised)\n-Updates almost everyday!!!\n-Noticed little to none bugs\n-Enemy Scaling system\n-LOTS OF ITEMS! :D\n-Price\n-Much much more\n\n\nCons~\n-I run a r9 290x OC and a i5 2500k and its choppy (56 to 32 FPS) at some points which is disapointing so i find it hard to belive that lower end PC's can run this game well.\n-Better looting system with friends (No loot hog)\n-Same enemies\n-Graphics options!!! <---- That's what really got me\n\nTips~\n-New enemies\n-Extra Vehicles (Gyrocopter?)\n-Optimise\n-Mod support (later on)\n-Space travel instead of portals?

I definitly recommend this game because; The developers update often which you dont see a lot! Lots of content! Low price for a game you can play for hours.

Though after a while it gets quite boring as everything just looks the same.\nThere is no manipulation of the surroundings, no landscaping. All you can do is build certain devices and pre-factured containers. Wooden containers, stone containers, glass and metal (which you can't build unless you level a certain profession up, which takes forever...). No free building as you would be used to from other survival/mincraft genre-like games.\nAnd these pre-factured blocks are the main problem. All items have a certain amount of degrading time (unfortunately usually quite short, something like 2 days). If you don't login over the weekend, you'll suddenly stand there without your house. The only way to keep them from degrading is to build a certain type of shield. This shield needs a generator. This generator needs wood. So what you basically do is logging in every day, grind wood to keep the generator and your shield going to keep the house from degrading. And this is literally your own purpose in this game.\nApparently there are more features, like claiming land which then makes you be able to claim tax from other players. But unfortunately, as blueprints need to drop from bosses, after 2 weeks of playing this game and basically mainly logging in, gathering wood for the generator and killing endless mobs outside and inside of caverns I didn't get anywhere.\n\nAs it is bad enough already, I played this game with my brother, so technically there was twice the manpower, twice the chance of dropping blueprints and you would suggest twice the fun. But it wasn't. We just both got annoyed really quick and as you might be able to see in my playing time in other games, I am usually not giving up that easily.\n\nNo quests, same monsters over and over again, random NPCs called "Wei Wei the Wanderer" appearing wandering about and being killed by the monsters. Same with Vending Machine robots.\n\nUnless you're an old-fashioned WoW grinding lover... you should avoid this game.","December 2, 2015","false","26.9"," 110 of 147 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","110","147","4","0"

You might want to play it with someone though as it could get a little boring by yourself, though it takes a while for that to happen. The graphics are really vibrant and juicy in this game, youll have to turn on post-processing though to really get these colors, but if you dont like post-processing effects, the colors will be a little washed out without it on. The only thing i dont like about this game is takes a while to get resources, or at least enough to build something good. Another thing about this game is that playing on high population servers might be a little annoying when youre trying to build a base and the crafting stations and such gets destroyed a lot when your offline, and building a turret to defend that stuff while your offline requiers a LOT of wood, which will take a while to get. One last thing i have to say about this game is that the landscares are gorgeous and have a true alien planet feel, which is different from most space type games out now.\n\nActual Review Score 8.5/10 - Its a VERY addicting game, even better with friends, though the grind may turn people away,and building a worthwhile base may be somewhat annoying with lots of other people around,although im sure the developers will improve on this sometime in the near future. For an early access game, this is one of the best, most content rich ones ive ever played.","January 11, 2015","true","75.4"," 629 of 965 people (65%) found this review helpful 124 people found this review funny","65","629","965","124","28"

As much a grinding game as any of these types, but it fails in being attractive. It get repetitive easily, the amount of content is disappointing, the state of the UI, the absence of a dev / progress tree, etc.\nAnd then there is soo little support from the devs. ARK has updates daily and they almost alway offers something for everyone, with at least one content update per week.

But...\n\nforums:\n\nWithin two weeks so many things have happened in this game, The PVE East server US IOTA starting world was completely destroyed after the new 9.2 patch! Nothing at all was responded by the devs even after multiple bumps in the thread keeping it utop the forums for over a week nor the other posts by other members had any responses. People quit becuase of this. On Desolate moon I made a Drill high up utop one of the rocks and it does not work at all, it just stays blue and takes plasma decreasing it over time but always says 2+ hours, once again, wrote on forums - no response from the devs. Recently after upgrading myself to having 4 drills on one planet I tried that and after over half a week of me collecting over 100s of thousands of materials to upgrade these drills THREE of the four of them this morning are completely GONE! This also happened to a friend of mine on the same server earlier this week. One drill said INF time on it the other three said 12+ days till decay well they decayed within a few hours and I lost a weeks worth of mats. I went to a PVP server and the exploits are ridiculous, everytime we make a home it gets destroyed (shields are up and everything, we know how to fortify). The composters do not work properly and take 50 of your wood before you can even start putting wood in them cheaing you out of your gathered resources. The list goes on.\n\nYou couldn't even fix something as easy as the Chinese New year hat, that was bugged nobody got it, if thats the extent of this game I can tell the future of this product is very bleak.\n\n-- I actually did get a response back from the Bitmonster devs, saying they do care and to contact bitmonster support through an email in which myself and and some other friends did to urgently let them know the issues with the game.  Over a week later we recieved emails from the Bitmonster email with an automated message (no fooling) and it said to register with another site and send an email through that way...... .are you kidding me....\n\nI find it funny the moderator said they do care, but then deleted the post.

However on release it ran terrible for nearly everybody apart from those with super computers, since then I have a very powerful PC and I can run it great, however since the beginning and now they have radically reduced graphics, fine, this makes certain the game runs all on PCs right? Well one thing, where is the graphic settings so I can turn them back to original as I want the game looking like it is advertised... yep that's correct STILL!!! No settings.\n\nSo what do we have now, a game that looks worse than when it was first released.\n\nOkay so graphics aren't everything, they did promise quests, lots of things to do, highly populated servers and base building. Well!! 1 out of 3 isn't bad, they got base building which is a bit square to say the least, every base almost looking identical to the next with very few exceptions.\n\nThey have included wood rooms, stone rooms, glass rooms, metal rooms(think they was there day one) a few bubble like shields they keep reinventing, these are mostly done by a 3d artist, so during this time has the programmer fixed the network code? Nope, look at server populations, if you don't own this game well right now the offical servers have no more than 6 people MAX, and maybe 4-6 servers may have 1-2 people and the rest are empty, this game is DEAD, and maybe not for the reasons I thought (lack of content) but purely you play the game and first your like "wow it's so pretty" followed by, right what now? Well you grind grind grind, level up to beat better bosses to get better tools to grind grind grind, and you think "well how is this different from any other MMO" well other mmo have better, EVERYTHING!!! Seriously this game is broken beyond belief, try chatting in the game? It's impossible not to lose your temper as the chat constantly closes down when you press grammar keys such as '... so write a long sentence only to release it's no longer there.\n\nI wanted this game to do well, I really thought it could be something great, I've even set up my own server so me and my best friend can play it, we tried recently and it was just so boring void of content that I honestly don't see this improving, and what is so funny is that it's being updated very frequently by huge sounding updates, but when you play it, you release how small they are.\n\nThe devs have included countless dances (whats the point when no one is in their servers?) they have included lots of colours of the same monsters lol, they have added a few more 3d models of buildings you can slot together in a linear fashion... but you know what they haven't done? They've not fixed their dreadful laggy network code, it's the worst I've seen, they've not added quests even though we have "quest givers" to make it look like we have content when we don't.\n\n\nBefore you cry "EARLY ACCESS EARLY ACCESS" I can tell you right now from the time they released the game to now, I expected.. wait a normal person who has no bias would expect much more playable content, something to do differently from when the game first came out, it's the same game with a few 3d models added. It's disgraceful and not worth the money.\n\nThe longer they go without fixing their network code the more impossible it will become when they finally get round to it (if they indeed ever do)\n\nPlease if you haven't bought this game, just avoid unless you don't mind playing by yourself in an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me with next to nothing to do other than grind grind grind.","June 2, 2015","false","24.5"," 179 of 268 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","179","268","17","7"

Compared to many EA games this game has a lot of content and variety and the frame rate is smooth even on my mid tier rig.   The landscapes are gorgeous and the art style works with the music to produce some real immersion.\n\nI enjoy PvP and so far I like what I see.  Gear and level is important but so are tactics and aim.  At level 4 I was able to scare off a level 19 just using the starter pistol when he had an assault rifle.    I was also attacked by a level 9 when I was level 7 and was able to down him mostly because I had better gear (had the better pistol at that point) so it's a good mix of skill and gear based victories.\n\nThe gunplay feels  a lot like Halo to me and I mean that in a good way.  It's arcadey but still feels like skill matters and accuracy while shooting on the run is critical and can be practiced.\n\nThe end game seems completely different then the beginning so I will update my review when I get to that but so far so good with Grav.  More people should be playing this game IMO it's highly polished and fun for an EA game.","November 11, 2015","true","57.1"," 81 of 111 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","81","111","6","2"

However, in its current state, it is limited and buggy - as to be expected for early access.\n\nThe good:\nGraphics\nCombat\nExploration\nSimplified resource gathering\nVehicles\nGuns\nPets\nWide variety of items to craft\nClasses with bonuses\n\nThe bad:\nNo real level progression*\nCollision detection\nRarity of certain common resources*\nLack of base defense options\nLack of harvestable resource types\nLack of monster models\nVery resource intensive\nSmall groups are ineffective*\n\nThe bad will probably be resolved, but a few really stick out.\n*No real level progression: Sure your classes can level up and you can create new weapons and armor.  However, it doesn't matter.  All weapons are level based damage.  This means if you give a level 1 character the max level weaponry, they will still hit mobs that are only one level above them for minimal damage.  This is not apparent at lower levels, but after one reaches level 20 or so, it is an obvious pattern.  Bosses that used to be challenging turn into a huge time and ammo sink instead of being fun.\n\n*Rarity of certain common resources: There are a ton of resources in this game.  However, you will run into a brick wall for one or two of them that are extremely rare - even though they are marked as common.  These resources will be staples to your progression and will basically stop it until you run around gather the 1 or two around the entire planet for a few hours.  But even then - when you do build that upgraded equipment, it won't have a noticeable change on combat.\n\n*Small groups are ineffective: If you want to play this with 1 or two of your friends, it will be fun for the first few hours.  However, after level 20 or so, the "no real level progression" portion kicks in.  If you find a loot chest or an artifact, you're either going to waste all of your ore on ammo or fail to get the artifact.\n\nAll in all, it is worth a try.  I liked the game for a while.  However, the bad points really ruined it.

DayZ, Rust and Nether have been the dominant 3 for me. So far (I know it is early) Grav has all 3 beat. It seems like the dev(s) haved played all of these games as well and has corrected mistakes that the others have made. Here are a few benefits of choosing Grav over the rest.\n\n- Penalty for dying isn't ridiculously brutal. Sure you go back to level 0 and lose some of your stuff but you keep the important stuff and get a shot at retrieving your lost goods from the spot where you kicked the bucket.\n\n- Playing with friends. Rust and DayZ had me spending the entire time searching for my buddy so we could go.. survive. Grav has you build a Locator which gives you your lat/long. After building the Locator you never lose it. That's great.\n\n- Food bar. No mare having to go somewhere and do the pointless activity of sitting and eating. You must collect food but eating is a passive feature.\n\n- Traversing. Your dude moves swiftly and jumps and dances like no aliens are watching.\n\n- Low-level areas are not overly punishing and aliens drop health. Tired of grinding in these survival games for an hour or so to start only to die and have to start over with this cycle repeating itself? Grav allows you to get going and keep going and progressing relatively easily unless you are KOS by another player which brings me to...\n\n- The community is not full of KOS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. At least not from my experience.\n\nAnother thing I dig about Grav is while playing it, I feel like I'm in a really cool 80's space-flick. Not sure if the devs meant this but I definitely get this vibe. The music and dancing is great as well. This game is basically the MMO survival version of Planet Explorers with Unreal Engine 4 behind it.\n\nMy beef at this point is only with the lag. Lag at this point makes the game unplayable at times. It's very early access so I'll give them a break for now but that needs to be priority 1. The UI is god awful as well but you can tell it is just placeholder stuff that will soon change so no biggie.\n\nOther than that I hope they fix the lag and focus on keeping the hackers at bay and we will have ourselves a winner.\n\n**update 3/5** Game is currently dead. Maybe due to stability issues or lack of end game, people are likely waiting for bigger updates to hit the game before logging back in. Keep this in mind if you plan on purchasing at this time**\n\n**Update 4/7** The devs have released some big updates and the game is coming along wonderfully. People are beginning to trickle back in. No reason at this point to not have confidense in the team behind this game.","January 19, 2015","true","9.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","38","44","4","0"

If not keep on reading.\nLag issues:\n-Lag is still an issue right as of now but the dev is working on it and commited to fixing it right now. A special test server is up and a patch has already helped part of the issue but there is still a way to go.\n\nSomewhat barebones:\n-You can't take down the stuff you build at the moment (well in PVE, I havn't played on a PVP server so I can't tell if it's PVE related only).\n-No clear friendslist you have to make parties with custom codes and key commands.\n-Inventory system is minimal and missing features like displaying the look/picture of an item when selected.\n\nThe Positives!\nAlright still here? Good because what is there is really enjoyable. Did you see all the stuff in the trailer? You can do all of it (well ok 90%) at this very moment! (unlike StarForge *angryface*) You can level up to max level (30) and gear up accordingly. You can play co-op with friends and run dungeons and fight bosses together (or alone you Einzelganger you). You can build really neat bases, craft armor, weapons and yes working vehicles and jetpacks. The graphics are bright and the colorscheme is nice. The aesthetic has it's very unique, silly and somewhat cutesy personality.\n\nAll in all it's impressive how complete the game already feels for a 6 month old project and there is a lot of fun to be had already. If the developers keep this up this will be a fantastic game. But you do have to realise there is still work to be done. You must understand this is still an Early Access game (in alpha). So things will break, bugs will annoy you (and I'm not only talking about the enemies)  and stuff will be missing.\n\nGive the trailer another go! Does it look apealing? Yes?

The crafting system is fairly robust.\n3. Good music and sounds when they aren't bugged.\n4. The IDEA behind the game is sound, if realized I may recommend this game.\n\nBad\n1.  This has improved slightly, but this is still the most poorly optimized game I've ever seen.\n2.  The sound is bugged badly since release, hasn't improved at all.  Random sounds and music at random times.\n3.  This is FALSELY advertised as both Single-Player AND Survival.  It is neither of those.\n4.  A better name for the game could be Grindy McGrinderson lands on the planet Grind and builds Grindytown.\n5.  It literally seems to get worse with each patch.  Sounds have gotten worse, the events are no more than large groups of random mobs (unless you get slimes, then you might see some bosses), the resource placement is appallingly bad right now, and the instances are scarce and nearly useless.\n6.  To call combat rudimentary would be generous. Imagine Minecraft combat, only not as intricate.\n\nThe game IS an EA title as some will surely point out.  This MAY all get ironed out by release, but I don't recommend games on what they might be.  At this state is not really worth $10, much less $20.

So, unless your machine meets min reqs (have at least 8GB of RAM, this game loves it), you probably shouldn't get it.\n- Net code seems to be unoptimized at all - having any latency and lags to local server is a bit strange (although that might be related to fact that server as well eats tons of RAM and 8GB is just not enough for running both - server and client)\n- Current (v7) progression is limited to getting all blueprints from monster and leveling your character does not do much.\n\nOh, and it's definitely more fun to play with you friends.\nIf that sounds like your thing - you'll probably enjoy playing GRAV!\n\nWatch overview of the currently available things in the video below:\nhttp://youtu.be/YYvj-3RsJpU","January 18, 2015","true","3.4"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","34","41","6","0"

The game is mostly online only, I imagine there is probably a way to play by yourself, but that wouldn't make for a very entertaining experience. There aren't a lot of enemies right now, I have been told that this is due to a bug. So far I haven't experienced much PKing (Player Killing), though I have seen it happening according to the chat. The game has a nice friendly/unfriendly system, which makes playing with friends a lot easier. The caves/dungeons can be really hard to find, and leveling up can be very difficult as well, but this game is still extremely pretty and I hope to see this game get even better over the next several updates.\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing this game, I would highly recommend it, there are a lot of friendly players and the game is very well made.","January 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","2"

This is impressive stuff and is a great addition to the unreal engine library of games.\n\nCombat is frantic, frenzied and furious fun as you move in and out and left click your attacks trying to best time them against the mob or enemy players own attacks.  Quite simply, the combat is very fun and a nice way to keep you invovled as you fight for your life!  While there isn't any kinda of special attacks or rolls to dodge and that kind of stuff at this early point, it is still very fluid, responsive, and engaging!\n\nExploring the different biomes of this gigantic world full of vibrant colors is perfectly speckled with just enough dungeons and caverns to adventure into.  Inside these tunnels, sounds echo through the natural looking rooms of rock and water drips from the top.  Some great rewards are found inside as well as a much greater risk in the form of more dangerous monsters.  Ore, gems, better loot, and the valuable element X resource are some of the rewards found within these glowing entrances.\n\nThis is a very friendly development team who are showing more then a healthy determination to make this the best and most fun game they can, and they prove it with a patch to fix numerous bugs in less then 24 hours after its initial early access launch!  That is very impressive to see!  Add in fun, well thought out game design and you can see these guys care about what they give us!  Just an example of great and fun game mechanics is their idea to have you dance at a campfire to gain health and the team work bonus of mutual faster heals by adding more fellow players dancing at any camp fire.  This idea works brilliantly and makes the game with online strangers much more cohesive fun then other survival games out there.\n\nCrafting requires exploration and killing the bad guys that roam the dark places and nights of it's virtual sandbox.. if you want to craft more then just the bare basic stuff that is.  Resource gathering seems less boring and less grindy because of the dangers present all around you.  Monsters fight each other in unpredictable fashion and will even attack npcs walking through the world!  It's never going to the same experience twice when you log into GRAV and I look forward to seeing where this game goes.  The sky is the limit for this amazing and brilliantly assembled online survival game.  It's very different then anything out there now, while offering enough familiar game mechanics to keep us feeling comfortable with the game controls.\n\nAll in all, this new online world cries to us to explore it, to live in it, and to take in its spendor and beauty.  It's bugs and lag is there but minor and a small dent in an otherwise beautiful new online realm.\n\nUntil I get more game time, I WANT to play more, so I'm giving it a definite thumbs up at this point.  Please ignore all the negative reviews complaining about this 'early access' game not being complete or having bugs.  That's to be expected in 'early access' period.","January 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 56 of 79 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","56","79","0","9"

Much less than ARK though.\n- Expierence available only for killing mobs (as far as I know), not for role related stuff like building structures or piloting vehicles\n- Mobs design is questionable, looks like random models bought on market and hardly related to anything in the world aroud them\n-  Early access caused lack of optimisation. Even available through interface settings for graphics are mostly useless - you have to edit config files to disable flares etc -  still with light effect on fps you'll get on low-end PCs\n\nOverall: I like it more than ARK, it has variety and it isn't that hardcore to stop you from discovering world(s) around you or force you to grind all day long.\nGame won't scare you most likely, as ARK would. It more would inspire you to explore and learn.\n\nAnd it has nice music. And you can dance to that music, ingame.","November 15, 2015","true","54.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","28","33","3","2"

Since there is a leveling system in the game, it gives to think that there will be a lot more to do than just surviving against other players and the wilderness. Although at this early in the game, the leveling system could be a slight problem as there is a level 1 starting zone and PvP is usually turned on.\n\nDungeons and Quests seem to be the main thing that will keep a lot of players busy, as well as building your base or house, especially those running around in groups. Hopefully item drops and loot spawns will be evenly distributed but we will see.\n\nThere is currently no Singleplayer at this moment in time, only a Multiplayer. And with it, are a lot of lag issues.\n\nThe game as a whole at this moment in time should only really be given a shot by those who want to go out and scout for bugs and breaks in the game.

Goto the Summary\n\nSurvival. Sandbox. Procedural.\nSure, its a common trend these days with so many similar titles coming out on a weekly basis. You get resources, you build stuff, you craft stuff, you kill stuff. Repeat.\n\nTo me progression in these games is the hardest thing to nail. "To what end!?" I always find myself yelling... that is, not so much this time.\n\nLets start with the basics  - this is an early access game. This means that at times it simply may not work because as developers patch it, it can break. It is the nature of these beasts, so please do not spam forums because you are too stupid to identify that prior to buying the game. Additionally, use the forums to search for information, instead of reposting the same questions.\n\nGraphics 3.5/5\nIn line with other titles, this game has a slightly cartoonish feel, based (i think) on the Unreal engine, it has some pretty good features. Currently though customisation of the options is minimal.\n\nInterface 2.5/5\nThe main menu is minimal however the ingame HUD works fairly well. An upside is the inclusion of item descriptions in the HUD, making learning the game a bit easier.\n\nGameplay 4/5\nGameplay is comprised of multiple components:\nThe Gather\nThe Grind\nThe Build\nThe Reward\nThe Gather\nResource gathering is primarily done through the use of a 'multitool'. This device allows you to effectively deconstruct resources into nuggets. Currently the primary resouces are: Ore, Wood, Fossil, Food, Element-X.\nThe first 3 spawn in random locations on the map, dependant on the biome. Food is available via a 'Farm' which requires wood for 'fuel'. Element-X however is a little trickier, it requires a harvester to be built and placed on to a deposit. This must then be checked and emptied. All resources are available as drops from mobs/lootboxes, aswell as materials.\n\nThe Grind\nLove it or hate it, the Grind is a key component of any levelling game. Thats right, GRAV has levels. Firstly, lets look at the way the world is layed out. There are multiple 'biomes' which are all assigned with a 'state' and a mob level. For example, you may start in a lush forest, where the 'state' is freezing and the level is 1-2. This means that there is tonnes of wood at your disposal, the mobs do freezing damage and are of course level 1-2.\nAs per any levelling scheme, low level creatures only give good experience until you equal their level, then you are best to chase bigger prey.\nWhat I like about the levelling system in GRAV is that the mobs are genuinely brutal. At level 6, if you try and take on a medium bugdog of level 8 - its practically a deathwish. Unless you have decent gear and lots of health packs.\nLootwise, grinding is the only way you will get blueprints - required to further your knowledge, build more stuff and win at life.\nsidenote- I forgot to mention the excellently done combat system. Although simple, for an Alpha game, it is smooth and well polished whilst maintaining fast paced combat.\n\nThe Build\nBy grinding and gathering, you are able to get materials and resources. As you would expect from any sandbox game, these are used to build/craft things.\nBuilding is simple, there are a number of predetermined layouts, which allow you to build in a modular fashion. The interface is decent and the skill required is minimal. In terms of craft items and machines, there is a natural progression here which allows you to build bigger and better things. However, the most vital component is blueprints, which once aquired allow you to build items such as Generators and Automated Turrets.\n\nThe Reward\nThis is where it all ties together and SOMEHOW GRAV has kept a very balanced gameplay. In order to build decent items, you need decent mats which can only be found on decent foes. And thus the circle is born. Although not disimilar to the multitudes of sandbox games available, GRAV just seems right. There is just enough annoying resource gathering wihtout it becoming a bore.\n\n\nSummary 10/15\nAt the end of the day, its an Alpha. There are issues, bugs and bugdogs. There is no single player, besides running your own lonely server. The netcode is laggy and and the system requirements are pretty brutal.\n\nHowever,\nIts fun, exciting, progressive, rich and adventurous. The combat is great, grinding is fun and with a blueprint system, you need to keep searching for your next leap of knowledge.\n\nMy tips to starting with GRAV :\nCheck your system specs before purchase.\nEnsure you have friends to play with, or at least plan on playing with other people.\nIf the game bunks out when you run it for the first time - dont panic. goto the discussion boards and search.\n\nHope you enjoy GRAV!","January 12, 2015","true","9.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

Half the customizable controls are litterally dance moves.\n\nThat aside This game has a quite a few drawbacks that need to be addressed. First of all: This game has severe motion blurring, when you move/look around it's like you're drunk and cannot see where you're going. Second: The option menu is minimastic, like an Aeria game there are barely any options. No sliders for detail, no sliders for brightness, nothing. Third: placement controls are awkward compared to other survival type games and needs to be refined. Fourth: as opposed to most other survival type games there is no first person mode. Infact the camera distance is permantly set and cannot be changed which can cause problems such as when trying to look out windows. Fifth: The interact and punch button being the same key is a bad idea. New players would get used to the button being the interact key, try using it against something that seems like it should be interactable but isn't, then end up punching/stabbing a traveler in the face.\n\nHopefully those will be adressed as the games development continues.\n\nSomething else that needs to be mentioned is the game's building system is a cookie cutter build of preset rooms. Some may like this design but for me I prefer building the home piece by piece roof, walls, and all.","March 10","false","5.0"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","39","54","0","0"

Plus they really want community ideas. Plus this game has an amazing concept. Okay! I'll buy it!" I was not let down. Game was pretty bad in the beginning due to lag and other issues. In about a week they released 3 patches fixing pretty much all the lag issues.

Players can either cooperate or compete with others over various resources to help them survive the harsh environments found on the planet(s). There are several different elements/materials with which to craft things, and many are very easy to obtain and build. Most things require a blueprint to craft, and blueprints are dropped randomly by enemies. In this way the game encourages exploration and combat to further the experience by offering you a variety of new things to craft and build.\n\nTHE GOOD\n-----------------\n*Extensive crafting options\n*Fast-paced combat\n*Dungeons to loot and explore\n*MMO-like gameplay and mechanics\n*Smooth combat\n*Responsive, simple controls\n*Funny Gameplay / Dancing Character ^.^\n\nTHE BAD\n----------------\n*Laggy online servers\n*Confusing user interface\n\nFor an Early Access title, GRAV shows you how Early Access should be done.

I went into this game started playing and thought this so much less grindy than the reviews said. As i kept on playing the game there are no hazards besides creatures unless you count oxygen as one there is not really a chalenging aspect to the game all you do is grind to level up. It seemed very promising when i made a gate to go to a small planet as i exsplored this new terain i saw the same types of creatures repeating there are no new creatures whatsoever. This game has great promise i know how survival games have constant resource collection. This is constant monster hitting for xp or crushed star dust to make a gate or level up any new planet except the moon is the same thing. I would say I had a fun time but it just got way too grindy personally I would buy it and let it sit in my library and develop but in its current state I would buy it only to support the developers.","July 1, 2015","false","14.9"," 56 of 87 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","56","87","5","4"

Check the forums about it before you buy if thats all you want it for.\n\nThat's probably the number 1 complaint I see everyone saying how there's no true singleplayer so hopefully this will help dissuade you from making another post in the future about how there's no singleplayer.\n\nWith that said this game is a great multiplayer game with a bright future. Since patch 10 I would say you could get a solid 80-100 hours out of this game. However that also presents it's own problem where a lot of people will find it very "grindy", leveling itself I found to not that bad but if you want to make new weaponry you have to take a solid amount of time to build one gun as you get higher in levels (Building armor isn't that bad). Personally I find that to be a positive but that's my preference so keep that in mind.\n\nThe gameplay is great and has come a long way from it's launch where it was almost unplayable due to lag you now almost never even see a hint of it. The community is very friendly and I would definitely reccomend bringing or making friends while playing this, dance battles and base building and the competition is a big part of this game for me. Plenty of new content has been released and it's constant which is comforting in an early access game if it keeps it up I'll be playing this game for hopefully hundreds of more hours.\n\nNever been so dedicated to watching and waiting for new releases 10/10.

Features are subject to change upon full release.\nGRAV is something that I was hooked to instantly. I'm not sure if its the beautiful alien landscapes or the dungeon raiding you can choose to do by yourself or with friends, but I really enjoy it. The Early Access so far gives you 2 fairly decent sized Islands to build on, scavenge, explore and dungeon raid. I'm not sure I would call this a survival game though. Although you do have a food meter and you can build a farm, It is very easy to collect food dropped by enemies. In all the time I've spent in the game, I've only ever needed a farm once, and it was because I crafted several Health stims from the food I had. Upon killing enemies they can drop numerous items, but the one item you get a lot of, is food. So I would hardly call this a survival game unless they are talking about the fact that you can die from enemies and other players. It just doesn't have the survival feel. It is a great game though. Aside from the dungeon exploring and vast landscapes you can also craft numerous weapons, armor, and comsumables, as well as build a base with defenses from enemies like turrets, laser fields, and shield nodes(which create a dome around your base not allowing anything in).  There is a leveling system and in order to take on high level enemies you will have to start at the bottom killing low level enemies first and using low level weapons. I found fighting anymore than 2 levels higher than your players level usually turns up bad unless you're attacking a BugDog or a Slime, those things are usually easy to defeat but can take lots of hits and be tedious to kill. Another great feature that seems to grab a lot of people is the ability to dance. Now dancing doesn't just look funny and awesome but it is also a means of healing yourself and others. If you crowd around a campfire and dance, you will instantly start recovering lost health and if you dance with friends you will gain it even faster. There is also some very awesome music to go along with it.\nThe crafting aspect of the game is pretty vast. There are numerous materials to be collected and some will only be dropped in certain level areas. Craftable items include Buidlings, Weapons, Vehicles, Armor, Stims, Defenses, and work stations. Among the many things available for you to craft in the game you can get a Jetpack eventually which will allow you to visit the other Island that you can see in the distance from a certain side of the island you start on. Everything on the second Island is meant for levels 14+ I believe, although there isn't many low level dungeons or areas to fight in on that second island, it makes you really have to be careful what and what not to aggitate. It kinda makes you feel stuck doing the same thing for a while between just a couple dungeons but once you hit level 20, your horizon starts to broaden and you can visit a lot more of the many dungeons available. That is pretty much it for exploration at the moment but it still offers a lot. I would say each island is about the size of one of the bigger battlefield maps. In future updates there will be something they are calling stargates that will allow the player to visit other planets, galaxies, and hopefully have new enemies to fight. Now I personally haven't played much PvP considering the servers and the game desync and lag are still being worked on. There are rubber banding issues just like there was in DayZ Standalone when it launched, but those issues are being worked on and a lot of progress on those issues have already been made in the short time I've been playing. So playing against other players isn't really fun at the moment cause you never know if that person your fighting is actually where you see them on your screen, but it should be a fun game mode once the lag is sorted out. The developers are very active in the forums as well and seem to want to make sure everyone has a good experience, they even consider ideas that others have posted for the games future.  I'm very interested to see where this game will wind up. I have very high hopes for it and will continue playing it I'm sure, for a while. I highly recommend it if you're into exploration, dungeons, bosses, leveling up and crafting.","January 22, 2015","true","50.7"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","25","33","2","2"

I've been playing GRAV for about a week now and I really enjoy playing it. GRAV is a smooth blend of RPG and survival with decent combat, beautiful graphics and an extensive, interesting environment. My only issue up until about 5 minutes ago was the grind to gather resources which in actual fact is a lot less tedious than other similar games. I've spent hours farming the same resource to make only one piece of equipment as the higher level equipment requires A LOT of resources. So I've just come back to a large base I've found to make myself an assault rifle which I have been farming ore for for a very very long time. I've also got about 6000 gems to make some gem armor! Lovely.\n\nBam.\n\nGanked from behind by a PKer 8 or 9 levels higher than me. He continued to kill me until he gave up but not before taking off with all of my resources, basically making me start the game from scratch all over again. Until this game has some sort of PK control, I don't particularaly feel like playing. Either that or make it easier to get resources.\n\nTL;DR: Grind is kinda fun and not too tedious until you get PKed and lose everything\n\nEdit 09/04/15: Just to clarify, it isn't the PvP thats a problem (I actually prefer survival games that have PvP), it's the fact that a level 100 player can (and probably will) kill you despite you being 10, 20, 50 levels lower; and there is nothing you can do about it apart from watch helplessly as you lose everything you've grinded for. This is a good game but having to start from scratch again is not something I have the time for.","March 24, 2015","false","29.5"," 178 of 305 people (58%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","58","178","305","30","23"

And I do. However, I have come to the realization that there needs to be more to the game. There is no goal, no ultimate mission, no quests, no purpose other than grinding to get resources to get better armor and weapons. Again remember that I do enjoy it. But I truly wish there was an ultimate goal in mind, a true purpose to advance, a reason to achieve the higher levels other than to be able to defeat the bigger mobs. So I plead to the devs to give us a reason to play other than the grind for resources to get better equipment.  And I do recommend this game. In spite of what I just said there is a lot of enjoyment at stake for those who are considering this game. I have seen some complain about the lag, etc. A good way to lessen the lag is to play solo. And believe you me that makes for a greater challenge, but the lag is almost non existent. Here are a couple tips for you if you are going solo. Endeavor to get the automatic rifle. Once you do you will be able to stand back and fight the big guys. They will give you the blueprints you need. Once you get the jetpack blueprint, you will no longer need to make a fortress at ground level. Each planet has some high altitude rocks that you can fly up to with the jetpack and make your fortress there. You will not have to worry about defenses from that elevation. Again I do truly recommend this game and hope others will also tell the devs to give us a goal.

Right now, far too many issues which make the game more of a chore to play than a fun survival game.   Dungeons have monsters that spawn way too fast, sometimes as you kill one enemy another respawns in its place - and sometimes you die because of monsters respawned on top of your character locking you in place because of clipping issues,  graphics wise it varies from area to area, it can look stunning in forests or on moons, to looking kinder low res and somewhat ugly in dungeons.\n\nAnother issue distinct lack of the varity of enemies, just 4 or 5 monsters in the game it seems.  So it can get boring fairly fast, especially once you start the grinding.   Base building is also a chore since you have very limited options all across the board, becomes very difficult to build a cool looking base - another issue with bases is that enemies seem to have no problems walking through walls or spawning inside your base either, also what happened to base lights? Or better options at night since its exceptionally dark, pet lights don't really cut it so again, basically Grav needs more of everything.\n\nI think if the developers can really build on this game, improve base building - add a lot more monsters.  Fix spawn rates and generally add more content then Grav could be a serious contender against ARK.\n\nPros\n\nMultiple Planets/Moons\nMany Dungeons to explore\n\nCons\n\nLack of options across the board\nToo few enemies types\nMelee combat is useless\nGrindy\nToo dark at night, with limited options for lighting\nBase building isn't intuitive\n\nI hope the developers keep working hard at making Grav the game it deserves and aspires to be, I think everyone interested should keep an eye on the development, it shows promise once they can get fix the game up.","April 6","false","7.5"," 39 of 59 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","39","59","0","0"

Not something I am particularly happy with, when at home on (ain't so) Great British, break neck, net speeds of 500,000 bps (<-you like that?). Yesterdays patch caused lag on all servers so I guess today's update addresses that.\nNow I know some of you ♥♥♥♥y mofo's (ye' you know who you are) are going to blame our cr4ppy net for lag issues... although this may be true in many circumstances, the lag issue above were prevalent with friends, multiple configs and on many servers.\n\nBase-Building = Check. You place pre-built rooms, stairs, fences etc (lets call them modules) which come together in varying ways depending on the type. It feels like its kind of a mix between sandbox and tower defense. The modules are not cheap and without defense are soon destroyed. I wouldn't really call this sandbox atm. Open world for sure but there are no tools for modifying the world, merely adding.\nSurvival = Yep. You have to eat. Scary things can come out at night depending on where you are but ftm that's about it.\nAdventure = Explore I suppose. Procedurally generated and I'm sure I read infinite, I find that hard to believe as we reached an endless ocean after a 30min run from server spawn (although I suppose that is infinite ;p) No NPC's missions, story-line or any other distractions.\nAction = Kill various stuff. Mainly played PVE but we did jump into a PVP when testing lag issues. No deaths but no kills, despite trying (lag was just too bad).\n\nLikes: Pretty yet doesnt feel too taxing on rig, easy learning curve (at least atm). Nice community (so far). Plenty of potential.\n\nElse: Gathering sound, come on, you can do better than that! No building amendment (that could be a biggy). Even with it's potential for growth, it could fall prey to its limited foundation.\n\nI've seen alot of reference to the dreaded "grind", to those people I say "perhaps you ain't a gamer"? ;] Anyone else who isn't currently enjoying any other MMO sandbox, what are you waiting for?

I really did. For the first hour or two in the game, it felt like it was going to be fun. Until you reach the two hour mark and I realised, that's it. Not a whole lot to do.\nThe game could argue its a sandbox game, but no sandbox is fun unless theres things to do.\n\nYou can wonder around looking at the pretty sights and fight some monsters but thats about it. The loot system doesn't really give the player any sense of acomplishment, they're meaningless. Crafting things and building structures is so awkward and hard that by the time you have farmed a few hours for resources you either die or build 2 or 3 walls before having to go out and farm for another few hours. Its just not fun.\n\nIf the game wants to suceed, they really need to give it a sense of direction. At the moment, any generic zombie shooter is funner than this game. The game looks pretty and sadly thats not enough for me to recommend this to other people.\n\nThe game is indeed in early access, and I wish BitMonster the very best in bringing out the best the game has to offer. I only hope they will take on the community feedback and enhance their game. At the moment the game has a strong foundation, it just needs content. But for what it is at the moment, I'm going to have to recommend people keep their money in their wallets for now.\n\n","January 29","false","8.9"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","38","59","4","0"

One thing I dislike about games like this is that they don't really bring anything new to the table. The whole concept to these games is basically as follows\n\nSpawn\nLevel up\nFarm resources\nBuild a base\nMake a clan\nBuild up your base and clan\nFarm more resources\ncreate OP items so you can PvP other players and basically rule the game.\n\nWhat this game DOES do differently, however, is the very unique vehicles and different DUNGEONS you can raid either solo or with others. Base building currently is actually really extensive, so if that is your thing, I'm sure you will enjoy this one\n\nA few things to note, however, this game doesn't really have very many graphical tweak options (At least I couldn't find them anywhere) so you're pretty much not able to lower the quality by a lot, if you have a lower quality PC.\n\nAlso, when you look at this game graphically, and the behaviour of different characters/NPC's and sound effects, you kind of get a "Silly" vibe from it. As a whole. Me myself, I'm not too drawn to "Silly" style games. Games like villagers and heroes, or aura kingdom and stuff like that, they're a little too PG 12 for me, but hey, that's just my opinion.\n\nAll in all, though I am not recommending this game purely because it isn't MY type of game, I am not purely saying that it's bad. It is very unique, and you should definitely give it a shot if you're into this type of category.\n\n","August 24, 2015","false","3.6"," 54 of 88 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","54","88","3","0"

Ask in chat for leveling tips and farming tips or even better gear to be crafted for you. There are easy ways do level and to farm if you know how and players like me and many many others will help you out when you ask for it as long as its not stupid requests like and end game equip when your level 10 lol\n\n4) Despite what some players say the game is been worked on by the devs who unlike other dev teams are fixing bugs before rushing new content that adds new bugs to the game there is bug fix updates monthly.\n\nTL:DR\nIn short if your looking for polished AAA game thats almost ready for full release and will take you by the hand and spoon feed you like other openworld base building-survival type games do then this is not the game for you yet, keep checking back on it as for now its 65% complete IMHO\n\nBUT... if your looking for a game that you have to put some time and patience into and like to figure some stuff out on your own, then this is a game you will love.\n\nIn closing I enjoy Grav as much now as when i started playing it 2 months ago, First I was on the EU PVP server and got to rank 278 (420 is max) but due to a friend from the USA who had crap net and could not play on the EU server I rerolled on the USwest PVE now after 3 weeks I am 294.\n****TOP TIP**** If like me you want to move server instead of rerolling like I did there is as I only recently found out a character transfer service provided by the devs follow the link for more info http://steamcommunity.com/app/332500/discussions/8/","May 5","true","525.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","0"

I know we live in a era, were early access is a often approached thing here on steam, and many of these games are not worth it while some are. I can truly say i didnt know much about this game when i bought it.. but DAMN! This game feels like an adventure!:\n\nExploring new places, building bases and try to become stronger. Slay beasts and gather blueprints n' resources so you can gear up! Find friends and people you can work together with.. or attack other players (wouldnt advice that since you can get a pretty tight defense system up and running..).\n\nBut ofc. this game IS early access, so there are minor bugs and lags. Also the 'ljoin server' loading screen is really long, and takes about 5 min to finish (by my experience), and the game can be very laggy at start. But after a couple of minuttes the game is pretty fluent. The dev's are really hardworking, though!

It has a bit of grind, but it rewards you, and finding new blueprints and crafting new items, armor, weapons, etc. is really fun!  Once you learn the basics of survival and find a wing suit, jetpack, and monocycle, it's really a blast.  Then there are the gates which you can build that take you to entirely new levels, and the global world events, which yield a lot of loot.  There's already a lot here - the developers have proven they're invested, and are constantly adding more content.  It reminds me of a prettier Anarchy Online, aesthetically.  And because of the leveled NPC's and dungeons, there's variety to what you're doing.   And it has basebuilding and PVP servers, but PVE is really where this shines.  It's an mmo, with crafting.  Play it with friends.  You'll see a lot of houses around and evidence of human life, but the players are spread out.

I have only played the single player because these types of games its either that or co-op with friends only and the co-op isnt done yet.\n\nAfter 20hrs i find my self very hooked in to this game. Its very easy to learn. The crafting is deep and yet does not feel all that complicated and was pretty easy to learn how to put it all together. There are a good amount of enemies and differnt planets to explore. Lots of cool stuff like building a base, Jet Packs, Vehicles and tons of other neat things to slap together.The only thing this game really needs to be a complete game is Quests, Boss Fights, Raids, Online privite Co-op, and I'd also like to see more wepon types like explosive wepons, sniper rifles , ect.  Also a ability to upgrade your ammo amount on your charicter.\n\nOtherwise this is the best EA game i have played .

It would be great to see more region-specific mobs, such as the Yetis, which are only found on cold planets.\n-You cant go in the water, if you go to deep you will start taking damage, when I say deep I mean a few blocks from the coast.\n\n\nOverall the game is worth checking out, if you have any questions feel free to msg me on steam.","August 2, 2015","true","64.4"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/332500/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGrav is a crafting survival sandbox with some action elements. You begin your adventure on a planet inhabited mostly by bugs and slimes. After slaughtering some of the local wildlife and extorting the ecosystem for resources, your inventory will begin to fill with the three main components used for crafting; wood, fossils, and ore. There are also gems, but these are used far less in recipes. Once you’ve crafted some armor and some weapons, the next step is to set up a base. It might start as a tiny hovel, but once the sandbox experience takes hold, you’ll find yourself scouring the planet for more components to complete your fortress. Once you’ve got your castle together, what could possibly be left? Another planet of course. There are many alien worlds to be conquered, as long as you’ve killed enough monsters to find a blueprint for a spaceship. Once you find the blueprint you will find yourself grinding for the raw materials. There are tons of crafting blueprints from landmines to automated turrets. Grav has so much potential, but there are some key elements that will require an overhaul before a full release. What are they? Let’s find out, as we take a deeper look at Grav.\n\nThe first thing you will likely notice are the striking graphics. Everything in the world is wonderfully rendered and sticks to a pretty cool looking neo-sci-fi aesthetic. This is completed by a soundtrack that displays some fine synthesizer usage, as one would expect to hear anywhere in space. Though, on occasion the sound will drop out completely leaving you listening to plants rustling as you walk. I think having a soundtrack is fine, so is not having one. But a clear-cut choice should be made. If this is only because it’s Early Access, then please disregard. The dancing/waving/pointing in the game is quite silly, and adds to the laid-back nature of the game. Players seem more focused on base building and resource gathering than on murdering each other, which is a nice change of pace for these types of games. The reason for this might be that the world consensus to being nice to strangers on the internet has completely changed, but the more likely reason is that combat in Grav is currently pretty unsatisfying. PVP matches take upwards of 10 minutes, with both players doing nothing but left-clicking. Monsters have a slightly more varied attack pattern, but still telegraph their two or three moves pretty early. You will be killing a lot of monsters to level up. The grind is felt pretty hard due to the linear nature of combat. Hopefully with the full release combat will be improved, and quests/objectives added since they will be essential components in breaking up the grind.\n\nGrouping and descending into a dungeon is also a decent option for breaking up the monotony, though grouping is most often used for chatting and sharing buildings. The grouping system is not fully implemented, and a member can currently only be invited via the console. Luckily, dungeons don’t require a group. If you’ve got the chops, you can brave the dungeon alone and reap the sweet rewards. Boss creatures aren’t just found in dungeons either. They have tons of health, but their attack pattern doesn’t differ from smaller versions of their species. There are a variety of boosts you can craft; health stimpaks, invisibility stimpaks, and even a stimpak to increase your speed. You will use them often as you traverse the landscape, and eventually space in search of resources. There is a nice day/night cycle, to keep you on your toes and let you know when you should head back to base. Night is a very dangerous time, but you can buy droids to assist you. Some provide light, others will provide attack or defense bonuses. They are all bought with a secondary currency called Element X, which can be mined from glowing spots on the ground by building a Harvester. Currently the game is based on Element X. Build a giant base near some extraction points, build some Harvesters and lock them down. Then about 30 or 40 hours later, when your base is massive and your level is maxed… You can head out and destroy the tech-palace of some other maxed level players. That’s the MMO formula and while building a giant castle is enticing enough, I do have a couple bones to pick.\n\nBefore I unleash criticism, I’d like to say that once Grav fully develops I believe it will be something amazing to play. Currently, it has some serious flaws that need to be addressed before I’d put 30 hours into a game in order to reap the full reward. Combat simply doesn’t feel that fun or dynamic and needs a ton of work. Weapons don’t really seem to scale as much as levels, while incoming damage certainly does. One would think an assault rifle would be a decent remedy, but ranged damage is pitiful. On top of the low damage, they actually use ammo. Building my first pistol was a major letdown. The Generator runs on Wood, and eats quite a lot… About 2000/day, so if you get a base worth defending most of your social life will consist of cutting trees with a laser. World events are a great idea but poorly implemented. Monsters spawn 2 levels above the highest player in a zone, so a level 30 can hang out in a low-level zone and really cause some havoc. Base building is the only real incentive I’ve found at the moment. Even during the build, you will need to head out for resources which can be hard to find.  While you’re out and about you’ll inevitably find some combat. Enemy AI needs a lot of help. I can’t count the mobs that simply stood there and took their beating. It’s either that or they walk through a tree for a cheap-shot. Overall, I think Grav has all the makings of something great, but we’ll probably need to wait for a few more updates to truly find out.\n\nSummary: Futuristic multi-world sandbox, set around base-building and domination of the landscape.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10 for aesthetic, community, and blueprint variety.\n\nFull text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-grav-early-access/\n\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfYsJ4ArPj0","January 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/332500/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI was extremely excited to start playing this game. Space, exploration, technology, different terrains and random enemy events all garnered my attention it's way. Upon playing it further I wasn't all that impressed. Controls felt stiff, animations were decently good, gathering resources became annoying (as it was a grind every time) and the gameplay simply remained alright. I realize that this game is early access but there are some issues to be address.\n\nGRAV is a sandbox game by it's premise in which players are required to acquire resources to build and improve their technology or build up their base on a world that is segmented with different environments. Controls are basic at the moment and movement is a bit limited (in regards to jump/dodge/rolls). Obviously, the player can move about using WASD and increase their speed with shift (if they have a stim available). Space will make the character jump quite a distance in the air (air-time cannot be adjusted) while "G" will initiate a greeting and put the character into an animation (as well as "X" and "Z"). On top of this, players are able to fire out a flare using "F" and are able to keep pets (which can be managed by pressing "K"). Additionally, skill points can be managed by pressing "K" as well. "B" handles the build menu and will most likely be one of the most important buttons you press. There are devices in-game such as the flaregun that help players locate one another. If players are looking for something more in-depth, a locator can be built in which coordinates will be displayed on the screen showing locations, last death points and current locations.\n\nThe player will start out with a club and a multi-tool. Basic objectives will be displayed/given for the player to complete first. Some of these objectives include forging weapons, crafting new tools or building certain stations. The harvesting tool allows the player to harvest wood, fossils, gems, ore, plasma and sunstone. Special resources include food (when the player gets hungry), Element-X (used to craft higher level items but needs it's own designated harvester to collect) and a loot crate. Loot crates require the player to be certain levels before opening them. They got pretty creative with some the vehicles they created and decided to make it real by using fuel. One of the first modes of transportation is the wing suit. Altitude can't really be gained but holding space will let the character glide (and doesn't require fuel). The monocycle looks like something out of South Park. It's this giant wheel the player can craft that sort of looks like a motorcycle that does require fuel. The jetpack is another mode of transportation that is quite self-explanatory and uses fuel as well. A doom buggy can be created as well as an aerial vehicle known as the hammerhead (which is extremely expensive).  Lastly, the centurion basically looks and acts like a tank. Some will require a blueprint to build. Blueprints can be found throughout the maps or dropped by bosses (upon their death) in order to unlock or expand possible crafting concepts. Blueprints are not lost when you die!!!\n\nCrafting stations is what makes this all happen. Crafting stations include : armory, factory, kitchenette, matter condenser, science station and vehicle bay (for large vehicles). Armory crafts ammo, armor, weapons, devices and multitools. The factory will produce materials, traps and smaller vehicles. Kitchenette is obviously for food while matter condenser if for producing materials. The science station will craft stims and devices. Room configuration is basic at the moment but some neat combinations can be put together in order to make it all look appealing. Obviously, different material can be used (such as glass, wood or metal) but basic designs involve a basic room with a door, a balcony, supports, stairs, roof, room with windows, enclosed room, and a bridge. Additional smaller structures can be added such as ladders, ramps, bins, camp fire and flags. Lastly, power structures are available to build. These include forcefields, stargates, automated turrets, alarms, beacons, jump pads, generator, data recorder and (not limited to) shield generators.\n\nSimilar to Terraria in it's customization, players can craft armor out of the resources they collect (so wood, fossils, plasma etc...). To compliment a good defense, players can craft better weapons in melee or ranged situations. Some melee weapons include swords, knifes, blades and cleavers. (Some) ranged weapons that can be crafted are pistols, rifles, SMG's, shotgun's, rocket launchers and superior weapons that have a pretty intense impact. Stim's can be crafted as well to give a player boosts (such as damage or invisibility) or health. Traps can also be used such as landmines but I haven't experimented much with these weapons. It's sort of tedious trying to get an enemy to run over your trap but it does provide a better defense for the base.\n\nThere are occasional attacks that can occur as well. This sort of took me by surprise as I had no idea what to expect. I got a message stating that there would be a raptor attack soon and had a lot of bird looking things come out of nowhere and swarm around me. The variation in enemies is minimal at this point but some cool concepts have been introduced. There are specialty enemies that will sometimes be rare in color or in size. Jumping from planet to planet or moon to moon wasn't as exciting as I thought. In the game Rodina (early access currently), the player may physically land on the planet and get out from their ship or may take part in interstellar travel. It's not quite possible in GRAV. Moons need to be accessed VIA stargate. I'm not sure exactly sure how planet to planet travel happens either than stargate but I highly doubt the player is able to interstellar travel by space-ship.\n\nVisuals are pretty neat at times while sometimes it seems as though they are buffering. I have a pretty powerful computer so this shouldn't be an issue. The designs are actually quite interesting and seem unique to the game. Sounds are pretty basic and can become annoying as you grind to collect materials and resources. The enemies have varying voices but when they get hit, every clip that is played is about the same. Although gameplay should be the primary focus of this game, wouldn't hurt to tune all this up to.\n\nIt's quite difficult to get going in single player as gathering resources can be extremely difficult (while trying to stay alive and dodge enemies). I would recommend playing with a group of friends to advance quicker in the game as advancing yourself is extremely difficult. Overall, it is not a bad game but it just doesn't feel put together properly at the moment. There is way too much of a grind and not much of a reward I find. The available options seem cool but almost seem unattainable at times. With No Man's Sky coming out soon as well as Rodina, it would be tough to recommend this over the two. If it appeals to you, I would suggest buying it at a cheap sale price.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.6/10","May 10","false","3.4"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"

GRAV isn't that hardcore. In fact it's what you might call "Casual", in that nasal, derisive term you might reserve for other games where you aren't required to micromanage every last thing in your stats and inventory just to get past the first area.\n\nNo, GRAV is a 'survival' game only in that you might have to deal with low oxygen levels on certain exoplanets that you can warp to later, and that you have to gather materials to craft armour and weapons and bases and defences to survive dungeons and encounters in the world so you can get better mats and blueprints and armour and weapons and so on and so forth.\n\nIts art style is kind of silly and toonish, its clearly got a silly sense of humour, it really doesn't take itself at all seriously and that makes it absolutely great fun with other players. Seriously if you aren't playing this multiplayer there's something wrong with you. Setting up a server is really quite easy actually, and playing with your friends doubly so. It looks great, it plays great, and even at this level of early access there's still loads to do and loads to find and there's so much charm in just exploring around and finding cool new stuff to build.\n\nYes it's casual, and yes it's patently ridiculous. I mean you can gangnam style dance around a campfire to recover health and stamina. And it plays silly music too.\n\nBut yes it is ABSOLUTELY loads of fun and PERFECT for those of us with a busy lifestyle who can't dedicate days of work to making sure you don't get raided in the middle of the night whilst you sleep in real life by a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ who think its hilarious to wreck everything you own for no other reason than the fact that they can just because they're bigger than you.\n\nGRAV is a lot of fun and doesn't require you to make the game a second job in your life.

What kind? Pride. When you complete something in this game the effort makes it more like "I did that." rather tha "That was easy" it's not easy regardless of what others say, this game takes a lot of time and patience to play through. I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone who loves sandbox games its not like a future minecraft. it's more of a alternate universe Minecraft. This game makes you go out and search for what you need to build in different ways, you don't always find the materials you need in the same areas or by digging into the ground. it's like each important thing takes a mini quest to get. it's worth the effort in the end. the only annoyance. is sometimes the things you need are on creatures you cant defeat. that's where the grind to get stronger comes in.

If you enjoy space exploration, building bases, exploring dungeons, and gun combat, this is a must have for you. I plan to keep playing for a long time to come, and hope that the devs keep up the great work!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReview:This weekend was a free trial of GRAV.\nI didn't expect much with the recent status of sandbox survival games, but I decided to give it a download.\n\nWhen I started, I went into the single player version of the game, and was placed into a beautiful environment with a couple weapons and some resources. Combat is extremely smooth, building is user-friendly and easy to do, and gathering resources is done with a multi-tool, which is a superb feature (no more axes, shovels, etc.).\n\nAfter a couple hours in the single player, I decided to check the multiplayer scene. I was surprised when I saw that BitMonster hosts plenty "official" servers (PvE and PvP) which make the game have a sense of community. I quickly hopped on a PvE server and started harvesting resources, gaining levels, and having a blast. I had a buddy of mine join me, and with a friend, since it's a sandbox survival, the game gets x10 better. After playing about 8 hours or so on the PvE server, we noticed griefing is an issue (without shield generators running), and there was no way of removing these players even if they were right in front of you. So we decided to start over on the PvP server, and our game experience has improved since then.\n\nI'll start off by saying the game seems like it was meant to be played in PvP, and they've done it in a way where dying isn't necessarily the end of the world.\n\nReasons death isn't terrible:\nYou don't lose your gear upon death. This means you keep your armor, your weapons, locator, flare gun, etc. .\nYou don't lose ALL of your materials, just most of them. I'm not sure the percentage on the materials you lose, but it's a big amount.\nYou keep your ammunition! This allows you to respawn and keep guns a blazin'.\nYou can set your own respawn locations easily. As long as you do this frequently, you won't have issues getting back to where you were.\nTo prevent death you can store your things in a chest. I would recommend you build a small base and with a shield generator (this is an early blueprint that makes it so your base is immune to damage so long as it is powered with a generator, thus keeping your stuff protected), and then place your chest in that base.\nOne of the coolest aspects of the game is that fact that there are multiple planets, that you build stargates to get to. This allows for level progression and an awesome sense of exploration that I haven't experienced in a while. As of this review, I will be heading to the mid-level planets which is right before the last tier of planets available. Each planet offers new blueprints (which are required to make gear, structures, and many other things) giving you the tools to keep motivated and playing. On these planets you can also place land claims with towers which allows you to own land, and tax resources from players who harvest on your land. When you hit level 60 in the Astronaut job (one of the seven jobs available each offering different perks), you can place more of these towers.\n\nAll in all, my experience on GRAV has been an amazing one. Since I have invested so much enjoyed time into GRAV, I ended up purchasing the game. I plan to keep playing for a long time to come, and hope that the devs keep up the great work!","November 15, 2015","true","59.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I couldn't hear my party members talking whenever there was combat going on, due to the battle sounds drowning the voices, and there was no way to change this.\n\nThe graphics controls are also very limited; it doesn't even have V-sync. Some in-game actions are missing from the hotkeys menu, so you can't assign them.\n\nCombat is at the moment quite boring and unbalanced. Even if you're the same level as creatures and you're wearing the best armor you can, most creatures take 50-75% of your health with one hit, making meleeing them an inviable option. So I had to resort to shooting them with my pistol, but since they don't take notice of you if you're shooting them from so much as 30 ft / 10 m away, it's very boring. They just take all the bullets and die without realizing anything.\n\nThat being said, I did manage to have reasonable fun during the Free Weekend, and again I think it has good potential. I intend to check out this game in a year or so to see if it has left early access and the bugs and balancing issues have been sorted out. I might very well buy it then, if I'm not too busy with No Man's Sky.","November 15, 2015","false","9.3"," 94 of 170 people (55%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","55","94","170","22","14"

I bought it on sale (3 copies) and it has been worth it. The devs are patching every couple of days and slowly creating more robust world.\n\nI would recommended for those that like Phantasy Star Online ish type games (it has a slight touch of it <- maybe it is the graphics) and survival games.  If the combat is somewhat streamlined and varied (multiple types of attacks with the same weapon) and as the content and biomes are increased this game will be very successful.\n\nThis has been one of the more dev active projects that I have dealt with on early access, the devs are being very responsive. I commend them on this and hope they can keep up the good work.\n\nYou can host your own server in this game (single player is accomplished this way) though it is not  straight forward, yet (I am assuming this will get better).\n\nThe graphics are good, again I go back to a open world PSO vibe crossed with the color palette of No Man's Sky. The skies are busy, night day transitions good and the few biomes available are pretty. Enemies are repetitious (again this is early early access - and understandable) and predictable.  The weapons are varied but simple.\n\nI guess the best thing I can say is I got my money worth out of this game already and it looks like it will only get better.\n","January 22, 2015","true","18.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The combat is what's expected of a TPS, the crafting is relatively easy and intuitive, though it could use some streamlining.  A better tutorial would be fantastic, my first hour of the game was spent figuring out what the hell to do and what could/couldn't kill me.\n\nOne thing I like a lot is the leveling system, and zones to fit level brackets.

I love playing it and I find that the more you play this game, this more enjoyable the experience gets! As much as I can say without spoiling your experience, this game has crafting, planet exploration, moon exploration, various classes of monsters each with a specific level and special drops (if you manage to kill it.)\n\nThe aim of the game is collect blueprints. Blueprints for weapons - melee and ranged. Blueprints for structures, blueprints for food and resources, blueprints for vehicles and blueprints for armor, ammo and awesomeness (maybe not for awesomeness!)\n\nYou can get these blueprints by killing creatures with a slightly higher level than yours. And you may even find them in LootCrates that spawn in random locations of the world, or are more commonly found in dungeons; but beware, these are filled with creatures way beyond your level (so high risk, yields high rewards)\n\nOh! And just when you think that a rotted wooden club is enough to destroy the universe, think again!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy playing this game, and I recommend it.\n\nMy rating: 8.5/10. This is because, the loading time is slightly too much (took my 13 minutes to load a LOW PLANET.)\n\nHopefully, they improve the load times, and FPS drops for the game!

I picked it up shortly after the EA launch and, despite the fact that it was somewhat laggy and buggy, the beautiful aesthetics and the thrill of finding new stuff to craft kept me going. The devs' devotion to the game is obvious; patches were rolling out regularly and the changes week to week were obvious. I took a break after one of the patches caused some rough times, but, coming back, it's obvious they've been working just as hard. There were major substantive changes to combat, harvesting, crafting, exploring, and basically every other system in the couple of months I was away and I am loving it.

I've put well over 80 hours into it, and definitely got my money's worth. The gathering isn't horribly grindy, and the survival is fun, but still needs improvement. I'm happy that in the short time I've played, there have been several large updates and overhauls to the game's mechanics. Even if the game were to become abandonware (which it doesn't look like it will, at least anytime soon) I will have enjoyed the time and money I've spent on this game much more compared to various AAA games.\n\nThe game is not perfect and has it fair share of issues, so let me share them with you. First, The performance is quite awful. I can barely manage 1080p60 on a Intel Core i5 4570 and GTX 780, and the frames will often drop below 30fps. Luckily, they have been doing optimzations every patch, but I haven't noticed anything major yet. Second, Collision with most of the terrain is completely wrong. Some rocks, spires and other terrain objects you can walk right through to a certain degree, as well as some hitboxes for objects are far away from the object itself ( think invisible walls). It really breaks the immersion of an otherwise beautiful game.","June 16, 2015","true","91.5"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","27","46","0","0"

There's so much to learn during the levelling process of your character that the game will never become boring, because you need to gather a lot and kill lots of mobs, in different places, to get blueprints, but you are rewarded with new recepies and new strategies to add to your gameplay. You start practically unequipped as a LVL 0 and in a few months if you are skilled you might reach LVL 100 with so much equipment and so many resources to loose yourself into developing strategies, this game is so pleasant in colours and graphics either, and it is fun to kill mobs and players around that goes straight to my personal favourites, GOTY!","April 5, 2015","true","68.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I’m not sure if there’s any sound cues that is convenient to have, like a monster rampaging towards you. But missions and such are displayed in text.\n\nI have NOT tried multiplayer.This is a SINGLE PLAYER experience.\nCons: Not a real survival game. Minecraft is more a survival game than this one is.\nMob respawn rate is pretty damn high. You can’t really ‘clear’ an area or cave, they’ll respawn somewhere close by via some magical means.\nBuilding is with modular prefab structures. And the machinery you build might not even fit in those. You also got to find blueprints first before you can start building more interesting components.\nHarvesting is very basic. Just trees, ore nodes, and some other sort of nodes, that you can harvest from. The landscape is pretty much untouchable otherwise. Harvesting doesn’t yield terribly much materials either.\nThere’s no storyline. If there was, I totally missed it. The devs probably missed it too.\nNon-interactive buildings in the landscape. There are some interesting looking buildings in the area that you can’t do anything with. Clearly they’re inhabited, since the lights are on brightly at night. How rude.\nIt’s all about grinding. You’ll need to kill for leveling up, it’s pretty grindtastic. I haven’t even bothered to go to level 10 so I could go to the moon. Game’s not interesting enough for bothering.\nYou run underwater. Swimming doesn’t seem to be implemented yet. You can even make a campfire underwater and dance!\nWeiWei the Weary Wanderer is EVERYWHERE! The humanoid NPCs in the game are all WeiWei, and you can’t do anything with them.\nThe game doesn’t take itself seriously. Your first crafted set of armour will likely be a wooden one, and it’ll look ridiculous. Dancing in front of a campfire heals you. Might be a pro for some, though.\nPros: Graphically very stunning. Landscapes are gorgeous. My GTX 970 could handle it with ease. It felt smooth.\nConclusion:While the store page plays hints at this being a survival game, it feels more like an action RPG of sorts. You harvest, you can build prefab stuff, you have to kill for loots and XP. Everything’s too underdeveloped to even speak of a true survival. Overall it feels pretty pointless, doubly so because of the lack of real quests and interaction.\n\nIf GRAV would develop to be more about survival and building, less about lame fighting and leveling, and more about interesting ways of harvesting and crafting, then it might become interesting. As it is now, I’m not really interested in this. At a higher level there might be more stuff, but it’s simply not interesting enough for me to continue/grind towards that stage.\n\nI find Planet Explorers more engaging than GRAV, offering a bit more, like a storyline, interactable NPCs, and reasons to go explore.","November 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 196 of 368 people (53%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","53","196","368","25","21"

We both start grinding. "Veterans" start insulting the newbies via chat in the free weekend event after someone asked something about one type of resource. A lot of low level dudes like us start destroying and looting the base. We somehow manage to defend it. Not really fun since the game doesn't allow a confortable control for movement and combat (yet, in early access). We keep killing thing and grathering resources, making a nice base with houses and all. And for that moment, the "veterans" are playing "Hunting season: noobs". We managed to kill some of them after dying, but a guy with an automatic rifle spent 5 minutes running after us and killing at seven times the distance we can even shoot.\n\nI know there are pve servers but this game doesn't look enough good for that, not enough rich on variety (the world is inmense but you can walk, grab resources and kill things, no more, so, it feels a bit the same after a while) and the community seems annoying. Not sure if is for the free weekend but, even I really appreciate the possibility to test the game before purchasing it, I can't see the charm in it.\n\nJust to make it clear, I died three times, and killed 17 players, all of them in self-defense, and I didn't enjoy doing it because the controls and because having a huge variety of worlds to explore with people to interact, the mayority only want to play COD. And Pve kinda will ruin the experience.\n\nThe game doesn't run like a charm but, for being in early access I would say it does well.\n\nI want the possibility of dying, of betrayal, of being tricked by an evil banker, of ambushes, of lies, of wars, outlaws all of them! But the possibility is not the same as the unstoppable shoot and loot by any means, in that case there isn't risk in trusting a new friend, just grind to survive and reflexes. That possibilities would make the world much interesing but, if 9/10 players just shoot everyone they see, then this is a third person shooter with bad controls. This also makes me wonder if devs will include a large variety of possibilities or this will be a generic "shoot them first just in case survival" game.\n\nThis is not a bad game, but the huge universe could be a box with some trees to cover yourself and the taste you will have would be pretty much the same.\n\nEdit: I logged again to give the game another chance, trying to see it like a survival game with other elements. People pass time insulting in chat and killing each others, ganking and killing low levels. Survival? Well, I was attacked by a guy, and managed to shoot him with my pistol for 23 hits before he hit me for the second time with his automatic rifle. I said, "Well, thanks Axxazor" and his response was this: "Serry, but Im mad cos I went one our farming and some dude killed me, qq".\n\nSo, no survival, only grinding. Not even worth trying to get a free key in game. I expected a more complex and different ways of interaction in this vast, beautiful world, but for the experiences I mentioned, the game is just one big survival box. Are the developers responsible for this? Well, not exactly, but they can fix it adding a better way to interact with others, giving huge rewards if you cooperate, putting some kind of interestelar police, etc. Even if I want to be an outlaw killing noobs, I want to be a renegade, I would want to have things HARD because I would be a public enemy. ¿Vending machines? Not for the outlaw, no if you don't steal another identity, or whatever.\n\nThis game could have a lot of potential, and indeed it has it but I don't see the ambitious things I would like to see in Devs' agenda. I won't edit this more since I don't own the game, have in mind this is a review of the Grav: Reborn Update 1, so, this review has a limited useful time.","November 14, 2015","false","4.2"," 78 of 144 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","78","144","6","3"

Yes the game is really really AWESOME and the survival elements are awesome and  not so hard to master :) you have PVP and PVE servers.

You get the basic survival stuff : Crafting, Basic combat and what not,\n\nWhat I didn't expect going into this game was the vast amount of pregenerated dungeons you might\nfind while strolling the mountain side, gathering resources for your base. Or how about the randomized locations of the hundreds of random bosses that spawn in to kill you? How 'bout the dynamic day/night cycle that'll keep you on your toes? (Day mobs and Night mobs are different so if you need something from a day mob, you'll have to survive the night and vice-versa.)\n\nThe.Dungeons.Meng.\n\nThe dungeons are pretty random and exciting at the same time. If you play with friends, you can go exploring with them, fighting huge-♥♥♥ bosses and what not to get them crazy loots at the end! You can also get some mad resources if you bump into them inside. Share the resources with your friends, and craft even better gears!\n\nFor me, this game provided more of an mmo experience than a survival sandbox. Oh, that's a good thing. So If you're looking for a great game under  $10, this might be a great pick up. Depending on the server you choose, you get to meet great allies, annoying rivals and face great obstacles to survive your way to the Stargate! (A future update that will let you and your squad travel to the moons!)\n\nWell like any game, this game still has it's flaws. It's young, it'll definitely mature over time. As of Update 8, they've made changes to the server/engine to make the game less laggy -- Which is a pain, if anyone has played this game prior to U8. Some kinks and whatnot still need to be addressed but from the looks of it, this game is travelling a path that promises gamers a great adventure. For an early access game, i'd give it a 8/10. None of this 10/10 b*llcrap (It's defnitely not perfect yet.)\n\nSo if you're hesitant on picking this game up on EA, i'd suggest you come back at a later date or on official release for a more fleshed out vesion. But as of now, my friends and fellow servermates are having a blast trying to survive Grav's wonderful atmospheric world waiting for future updates and enjoying how the game is evolving throught the Dev's love.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you want a fun adventure with a community that helps each other out a lot!

I thought that I subscribed for ARK that month, but Grav caught my attention and held it. I played it for 7 hours in one sitting and enjoyed it a great deal. It was a touch glitchy, but it was pretty, easy to get into, and got the adrenaline pumping more than once. Why is this a down vote? The server that I played on went off line on Saturday. It is now Wednesday and still the server with 7 hours of character progression is not listed. The forums have revealed many with the same problem, but no solution. I'm sure the devs have a lot on their plate, but to have mutliple servers down and, from the point of view of the players, ignore the fact is not something that I can forgive.

Has HUGE potential and is very fun. Would recommend. 8.5/10\nUpdate:\nHaven't played since I bought it, got really boring, updates coming out every 1 month or so? Devs be like "Puttin in dem rockets for 4th of july update". And boom, 1 update done.\n__________________________________________________________________\n9th november:\nReborn GRAV is much better, actually going forward this time, the new monsters are much more interesting.\nTHE BIGGEST THING, that bothered me so much, is the UI. The new item icons look AMAZING, it's a lot prettier and is also A LOT easier to use.\nThe starting planet also looks a lot more interesting. It's not just the same ♥♥♥♥ repeated like last time, it has a very fun atmposhpere, and is very fun to explore.\n__________________________________________________________________\nNow my personal opinion on this: [DEVELOPERS PLEASE READ]\nThe things that should change ASAP are the COMBAT SYSTEM and the BUILDING SYSTEM !!!!\nI think those should be a priority. The game seems dull when you can kill monsters from far away with a pistol, because they don't move and have those repetitive animations.\nThe animations from monsters should have a lot more diversities.\nThe building system doesn't seem fun. Imo it should look up to RUSTs building system, which I'm a huge fan of (the building system).\nThat would be the main stuff, without which the game looks too basic.\nUpdates should come out more often, like at least twice a month, and those updates should contain new stuff and improvments. Don't be like before, 3 updates per year, and 2 of those are like, added fireworks and improved fps by 5..\nLater on, after COMBAT AND BUILDING SYSTEM is imroved, movement system should be tweaked, it seems so wierd when you just glide on the ground 50% of the time, for an example when you spin in place.\nALSO, the armory, sience station and other blue big thingies should be remodeled. Looks so small, but yet takes a lot of space, makes building very boring. 1 or 2 of those per room is not fun while building, and also doesn't suit the game style imo.\nI'm a big fan of the music while dancing at the campfire and stuff.. Would be interesting to see that kind of music somehow implemented, for an example, when in a dungeon, you could have that kind of music.","June 23, 2015","true","26.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It has its flaws.\nIt's buggy.\nIt's really ♥♥♥♥ing buggy.\nSome enemies feel incomplete - sometimes projectiles fired just seem copy pasted from another.\nBefore Reborn, this was barely even worth your time because there was so little content aside from PVP.\nThere are permastucks around mountains,\nwater areas need serious work with collision boxes,\nand the arctic planets are so unpolished they feel like a joke.\n\n\nBut it's addictive. I love every possible imaginable thing there is to love about this game, and there is A LOT to love. I started playing this as something to tide me over while I wait for no man's sky... but at this point? I think I'll just keep playing this and watch it grow into a better game every day.\n\nI love the devs of this game. Any other active online MMO dev team could take a page from the way they handle their feedback. I've seen developer leads come straight into the game and investigate bugs, playtesters will talk directly to the community, and they take all requests super seriously. They are the nicest dev team I've ever seen. Period.\n\nAnd the community, despite some weabos who get off on fooling newbies into giving their FOF codes, is really good. I've met more friends on steam here than I have on any other game, ever. This game is incredible and is a steal for the price.\n\nI;ve put in over a hundred hours (and I work full time), and I plan on putting in many more. I even bought 5 copies just because I wanted to.

Considering the fact they worked "only" 5 months on this title - if that's true - before getting it on Steam, the game has - except for performance/lag issues - a pretty good core game in place. It's stable and the graphics really look like "from another world" or something, i own Planet Explorers too and if the game is close to any other title from the look'n'feel perspective then it's probably PE.\n\nA Summary:\n\nPositive\n- You can dance\n- Stable game and connection\n- Nice graphics, colors and art-style similar to Planet Explorers but more vibrant\n- Big procedurally generated world where you have freedom to explore, kill, gather/collect/loot, build...\n- You can dance\n- Dungeons\n- Decent amount of buildable objects, weapons ..\n- Experience system, abilities, levelling for the alter ego\n- You can dance\n\nNegative\n- Not much graphics options yet\n- Performance and Lag issues\n- Inventory management and storage can get tedious as of now\n\nAnyway, i can see a lot of potential for this game as far as i played, i can understand why it has been Greenlit (in less than 48 hours!), even though, i will spend more time in the game and can't wait to see more stuff being added, things fixed as the game evolves, if you like being able to choose from PvE and PvP and play together with friends or buddies or against others i can recommend it, otherwise wait a bit more for optimization, more content and more dance moves.\n","January 23, 2015","true","29.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has the makings of a great game, but some of the mechanics need to be polished. As I was explaining it to a friend of mine, it's like a mix between Minecraft/Terraria and Borderlands, with a number of those elements ripped out.\n\nNow, wait one second before you skip over this because of the reference to two other amazing games, allow me to explain.\n\n> This game pulls from Minecraft due to its heavy use of resources to make your character stronger, build new items/buildings/machines/rides/ect. However, what it takes out from the Minecraft formula is the open-ended sandbox elements that Minecraft is known for. Unlike in Minecraft, you can't dig down into the planet to build yourself a base. And, on the topic of bases, they themselves are very limited compared to its blocky counterpart. Though, as seen in the base competion, there is still room for creativity... once you figure out how to do so.\n\n> Now, in reference to Borderlands, I'd like to talk about the weapon system in these two games. In GRAV, you can craft a number of various weapons, from Pistols, SMGs, Assaults and more; and, in similar fashion to Borderlands, it's shoot to win against most of the enemies you'll face within the caves. The controls for shooting, aiming, and the like are a little tricky to get at first, but with all things, practice will make perfect. But, to the element that Borderlands has over GRAV, is simply the vast enemy types. You're going to shoot a LOT of turtles, starting out. And, that, in itself, can be a turn off for a lot of gamers. Myself included. But, it's something that, like all survival games, is something to be overlooked if the enemies are well-designed and function well...\n\nWhich leads me to the negative aspects that I've noticed in playing. First and foremost, while you are able to recover lost items upon death, a number of the few deaths I've had could've been prevented if the enemies acted as they should. That meaning, a lot of the time, I would be clearing enemies out, only to have them immediately respawn not long after I passed by their corpes, which left me sandwiched. And once you're stuck, good luck getting out of the mess.\n\nAlso, while the game has individual leveling systems for different classes, swapping classes quite litterally means you'll be level 1 in a level 12 area if you're not smart about where you're swapping. Now, while I don't mind grinding, it made me feel like I had to go back to those older areas to build my character up before continuing onward. Now, this in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if the enemies didn't chunk your life so much. Level 1 against a level 5 toad, and I'm out in two good hits. This is with the second class armor, by the way. That, and the hitboxes for the attacks are kind of hit-or-miss with some of the enemies. I would be clear out of the way, and a frog's tongue could still damage me despite missing me by 45 degrees.\n\nEverything considered, the game still has a fair amount of work that needs to be done. But, is it a game that I would pass by? Well, if you've read this all down to here, then honestly, I think you could handle the game. It's still fun, for what it's worth. Especially if you get a few buddies, that's when these games would shine. I mean, I got this game with the Humble Bundle, and I don't regret it. So, if you have some patience, and you're willing to take a few cheap deaths, then I think you'll enjoy what this game has going for it.\n\n","May 20","true","5.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blank137/recommended/332500/","Blank137","Blank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blank137/","124 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPut simply, this game is amazing. It's an early access gem that no-one seems to have noticed yet, which is a huge shame. The game already has a lot to it, it feels like an RPG/Survival/MMO mix, and has just the right amount of each genre in it. There are tons of things to do and the base building is really great, with a nice snap build system you can build pretty much anything you've ever dreamed of. The graphics are fantastic and really do a good job of creating an amazing atmosphere. There's tons of loot for you to go and find, and the whole system behind finding blueprints is very fun and makes finding blueprints not feel like a boring grind, you get excited when you find something real good. I enjoy the crafting system a ton, and personally my favourite part of the base is doing cave runs and then stashing the loot in my base. Killing bosses is also a great time. You can eventually unlock other planets which you basically 'warp' to, so there's a neverending stream of new environments and biomes to go through. Dancing is a fun little activity with many animations, and my favourite part of this game is honestly the amount of updates the devs push through. We get about 2 a month with huge amounts of content!\n\nI really don't have much to say on the minus side for this game. It can feel a little repetitive after a while, the game really just consists of farming materials, building a base, doing cave runs and.. that's kind of it, really. The game could benefit from a food and water survival system to keep you on edge more and give you more work to do. We also need more world events such as alien hordes which come for your base every x_amount of days. I love the animations of the game although jumping animations need a serious rework, your character looks like a wannabe superhero. Loving the jogging/sprinting animations though. The game could also benefit from a camera system where instead of it being stuck to your back, the character turns and can run toward the character (like GTA/Warframe etc.) The combat system also doesn't feel too great. You right click to enter combat mode, and you're stuck there until you click again. What would work really well is having to hold right click to aim, and left click could keep the camera zoomed out and have you blindfire with no crosshair. Speaking of crosshairs.. the current one doesn't feel fantastic. A dot, or a circle with a dot in it would work much better, in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, that was my personal feedback and suggestions to the devs, but if you're looking for an actual recommendation there here it is: This game is fantastic, the fun almost never ends, and there's reason to keep you playing for hours. There's tons to do and co-op makes it even more fun. It's definitely worth a purchase.","August 5, 2015","true","26.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

This alpha is special because of the sheer number of systems that DO work, and are seriously fun.\n\nSimilar to other survival games, you spawn in the world with basic tools and no idea what to do other than "get resources."  Press B and build basic crafting stations when you find a nice spot, and things will start to make more sense from there.\n\nIt reminds me of the innocence of kids playing Minecraft.  People were locating each other via chat, remarking about what they found, and sharing intel on how to do things.  This game has a kind of Rust feel in that you can murder anybody, but I didn't experience any murders.  Instead, people have built crafting stations and uplinks, and set them to public.  I found a nice cave on top of a mountain and set up a few key stations around it.  When I logged on later, some dudes were using them.  Instead of jumping up and murdering me (or vice versa), they said hi and I said hi and now we're Steam friends and building an awesome base together.\n\nSpeaking of base building, holy crap is it done well.  If you have the materials, you can press B and plop down a room.  While you're placing it, you see a ghost of it that you can rotate.  Doorways will form between rooms, and rooms fit with the environment.  If you build a room on a hill, it will have a little support structure under it and a ladder so it looks pretty natural.  I'm happy with it.\n\nCombat is already pretty good.  It's responsive and effective.  Did a few boss fights with my new Steam friends and it was very fun.  We had a few pistols and a few melee weapons, and my low level buddy used his multitool to stun the target.\n\nA lot of cool stuff isn't here yet, and some stuff doesn't work.  I'm not oging to go into specifics here because they're getting fixed pretty quickly.  There will be more, and then they will be fixed.  These are alpha things, and it seems like Bitmonster is a good team.  My review focused on  the things the game currently does well, because it's actually quite fun right now.  It's definitely more than a tech demo.","January 9, 2015","true","18.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

However this shouldn't impact your view at all on this game, as the content provided with it is HUGE (and in such a small download).\nYou will spend the majority of time in your first hours running around and exclaiming things such as "oooo" and "aaahhh" and very occasionally you may approach someones base and say "what does this button do?".....

Since i purchased this, earlier this week there have been a grand total of 6 patches. All of them a rapid response to bugs which came about from the prior patch. The devotion and communication these developers have with the playerbase is tremendous and should be taken very seriously when purchasing this game, as you will expect a lot of patches and (maybe?) content coming up.

Not a recommend, nor a not-recommend.\n\nFirst of all, this game is structured to be a RPG-slash-crafting game, where you cap off at Job Level 60, and there are seven jobs in total, for a combined Rank of 420. Each job has their own perks and intended uses, so the goal is to max out each rank in any particular order you desire.\n\nThe game gets you hooked by being built as an RPG. About 99% of the time you're not crafting; you're focusing on leveling up, finding "blueprints," and making better equipment.... to farm more.\n\nOnce you reach past Job Level 50, you start to realize  there's nothing else to do besides build. You hit a mental wall, realizing that after you've put in dozens of hours in the game, you're struggling to find a reason to keep playing.\n\nDon't let the trailers and screenshots fool you. The "world exploration" aspect of the game wears out very quickly. Not only that, but there are only a handful of worlds available for you to explore, due to the restrictive nature of how the devs designed the game.\n\nSimply put, the worlds are grouped into four different tiers, and they rotate every three hours in real-time. This means that there is a theoretical max for the number of worlds you could explore, since 24 hours would mean there's a maximum of eight worlds per tier.\n\nOf course, the devs could add more tiers and/or more content, but with the characters capped at Job Level 60 and all equipment more-or-less already hard-coded, I highly doubt that will happen.\n\nIn regards to the crafting, you can build bases, but with the limited customization options (this isn't Minecraft or some other major crafting game), you start to feel like the game is lacking on that front.\n\nAnyway, you'll likely clock 50+ hours simply farming until you reach Job Level 60. You'll have significantly more fun if you're playing with some buddies, even if you meet them in-game. But once you max out, you'll lose the will to keep playing, and will feel inclined to quit.","November 15, 2015","true","77.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Still I like the shortened RPG aspects of the game, they aren't too much nor too few, just exactly as I would wish a system to be in a game like this.\n\nThe look is unique, unlike games like DayZ, Rust and so on which basically play in the similar genre, Grav doesn't get that stressfull, it's so enjoyable, so blithe, especially with friends. Simply running around and watching the world was fun.\nI love the base building, though some things are difficult to remove at the moment when you begin to play. ( it's possible later on when you have the right weapons to destroy it again )\n\nThe dungeons are good so far, I really like them, they offer a nice different experience in combination with pvp gameplay.\n\nThe farming goes smooth along the rest of the gameplay.\nI like the dynamics, mobs attack each other, they change at night, become more aggressive, the newly added events are quite nice, they add pretty well up to the rest and all in all the game has many layers on which you can spent time, none of them is bad so far. Me and my brother we actually didn't know what to do at first, visit another dungeon? farm for our turrets to protect our base? or build a jet pack and check out some of the other places in the world? hunt specific mobs for special drops to craft some cool new weapons ?\n\nAll in all it's a great game already now, like I said, I haven't that much fun quite a while!\nAnd that means something as I'm a passionate gamer which is not very confident with the situation of gaming in the moment, thanks for this one BitMonster!\n\nReview should just offer you a little insight, but I play every kind of game ( as long as they offer something I think spending my time on is worth it ) so my judgement on this game isn't influenced by anything.\nAlso it might change and things add up while Grav develops.\n\nIf you think about getting this because you "actually like it" but can't decide because you're suspicious due to all the early accesses that disappointed you, do it. It is worth it. If you know you're not into these kind of games and aren't open for something new/different ( the look ) you'd better not do it. If you want to get fed and follow a red line this isn't something for you neither.\n\n\nTo be noted: At the moment I'm on pretty weak hardware, so I have to play in 1280x920 and pretty much everything where is it possible is turned off/down when it comes to graphic. Still I ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy this game. :-)","January 28, 2015","true","124.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Most games are a bit stressful, so it is nice to to play something that is interesting, fun, and laid back. There are 2 ways to get over your head, it is because you ignored what level area you had entered which are clearly marked, or there was a moster raid and you were caught near it. Do you want to fight and build alone, you can. What to join your friends for a while, again, that is your choice. You are given several characters and if you want all the abilities, you must upgrade them, so if a new friend arrives, change to your lower level characters and go to a lower level area, or stay at a higher level and escort them through higher level area, so they can level up faster. Once they shoot a monster even once, they will share in the experience after said monster is dead.\n\nIT IS FAMILY FRIENDLY.\nFor those parents out there that love to games but run into objectionable materiel in so many fun games, you should consider GRAV. The only thing one might find offensive, is the ability to leave a dropping on the ground which others can step on. If you create a private server, with a password, then you control who plays. My son and I have enjoyed playing together.\n\nSetting up the server  is supper easy  once you use the correct port . Most tutorials tell you to use the wrong port. The correct port for your server is 7777. Look at the bat file they give you, and you will see.\n\nThis game is not finished  and I have found only a few bugs. I would like to see more polish to the game, more monsters, some direction on where to find all the blueprints and some tutorials to help new player.\n\nAt the time of my writing, I have played 67 hour and I look forward to many more.

In its current state don't even try to get into it as it's so imbalanced and lacks basic features and common functions that even solo developers get right and in game long before these guys are even considering that it might be a good idea.  It's got plenty of potential but unless the devs pull their heads out their asses it's going nowhere.\n\nSome of the plaguing issues with this game include:\n-Extreme level based PVP imbalances. (Passive upgrades & gear.)\n-Extreme lack of viable base defense options.\n-Easymode 10 minute wipe the base EMP bomb that takes 15 minutes tops to farm materials for if you have the levels.  Of course you spent way longer actually building that base but it's gone now isn't it.\n-Game logs you out and back in to transfer the player from planet to planet, you actually see the main menu here.\n-Poor UI functionality such as ability to quick move items into player inventory but not out of and a number of bugs.\n-No sound adjustment settings at all and the guns are so loud you will never hear anything else if you wear headphones/set.\n-Monsters will spawn inside of your base, yep inside your base.. if not that they actually walk right through the walls often enough.\n-Very little monster variety.\n-If you're looking to explore and see different biomes don't expect much more than different lighting or color fills on the objects in most cases.\n","December 13, 2015","false","86.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

While on some levels it is indeed a sandbox survival game, it has much more in common with a MMO, especially in terms of the grind. Gathering resources and levelling up is a very slow process, and to make things worse, the only way to progress in the game and unlock things is to get random, rare blueprint drops.\n\nOverall, the current state of the game is grindy and tedious, which is a shame since it looks like there's a lot of places I would like to explore but lack the time and interest to grind through the game to get there. Hopefully the devs will streamline the progression soon, but for the time being I can't recommend this game unless you're fond of the terrible MMO time sink of random rare drops for critical items.","April 7","false","2.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

Grav is in Early Access Alpha. The biggest issue I see now is some sporadic server lag spikes which the Devs have acknowledged and are working for a fix. With that being the biggest issue, Grav is the game I have been looking for. In it's current state it offers fun RPG/survival elements in a harsh NPC world. The map has zones which lets you know what level the creatures are. Being one of the biggest Rust fans I think I have found something to keep me satisfied until that game is finished. This game offers more playability than Rust did in the legacy mode. It's fun sci-fi techno feel really got me hooked and I can't wait to see how the game evolves.\n\nIf you don't mind random lag for the time being and your system can handle it then I encourage you to pick this one up!","January 12, 2015","true","19.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The World is so amazing, you dont want to come back to your own real life. Just kidding.\nThe movement and the combat system in this game is really cool, but I think, the developers really should make some tweaks in some points there. I would say, it´s kinda hard to fight with the character in this game. Cant explain it so much.\nOh and this game isnt beginner-friendly. The first 15 min I had to inform me in diffrent videos how this crafting system works.\nAnd what i wanted to mention too, is the perfomance of this game!\nIts kinda terrible :P\nI got a pretty good gaming system, and i cant even hit the 60 FPS. Hitting the 30 Fps is a struggle, so i would really recommend, that the developers should work on this issue too.\nIn short:\nShould you buy this game?\nI would say, "no"\nWhy?\nBecause this game is in a (i would like to say) heavy construction phase.\nIt needs more fixes, it´s pretty hard from the beginning, the building system isnt that revolutionary.\nBut i give this game, a positive rating, because i think the devs are knowing, what they have to do and i know this game has a great potencial!\nYOU SHOULD ONLY BUY THIS GAME, IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVS IN MAKING THIS GAME AS GREAT AS POSSIBLE!\nSo thats everything, from my side.

That being said it is not perfect, some cons include:\n\nThe mob spawn rate is rediculously high-you will clear a zone of mobs in a cave, and they will be back within seconds sometimes\n\nThe game can be very resource intensive, especially in the ram. There were times where the game itself would use over 8 GB. Some people say they get low fps, but I have a 970m so I couldnt tell you.\n\nThe community, at least during the f2p weekend, was a bit mixed. There are some major d**** in this game. They will get a small group of three or so who are several levels higher than you, and take everything you have or have built. That being said, there are some really nice people who are helpful and dont kill the newbies.\n\nSomeone else has said that the combat is a bit weird, and that is rather true. Melee is basically unusable except maybe in some pvp cases. The mobs that have to be higher level than you to get the blueprints will two or three shot you. The same mobs will take a couple clips to kill, and if you are far enough away they wont even come at you. (This is kind of a good thing though, considering they will kill you really fast and it takes several bullets to kill) You will need around 1000 bullets for an average cave to be fully safe.\n\nAll of that aside the game has some really cool things, and is absolutely gorgeous. I think they will eventually take care of the issues, and the built in VOIP is actually pretty cool. It works based on distance to who is talking, so it's almost similar to talking in real life. someone a couple feet from you will hear you. I would definitly put this on your watchlist, if it goes on sale 10/10 buy it. If not still a solid 7 right now, but there is a lot of potential.\n\n(edit: formatting)","November 16, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I zap trees untill I realize these aren't trees but some other kind of weird alien small... tree.  Oh well.  I find and start to get used to seeing the fossils and gems and ore scattered around, but alas no trees.  Plenty of vendors saying hello though no players in sight.\n\nEventually I find some trees, relived to finally see their true form, and harvest what little was there.  As time progressed other bits grew back and I was able to build a base after running back and forth to grab what meager supplies were around.  Quite proud of myself, and expending myself for the evening, I slept and came back to GRAV the next day.\n\nThis day.  Boy.  The forests were plenty.  I was able to gather and build and affter doing what I wanted to and realizing how much I was really wasting, starting to kill and level, and realizing this is how to "gain knowledge" and craft new things.  I would trade off, farming monsters, farming materials, building, rinse repeat.  Never once did I get dull, and always find myself eating rushed and delayed meals.\n\nI learned the lands.  Saw glimpses of players who merely just waved and went about their business.  I was always cautious but after time I grew to just say Hi and move along as well.  Exploring at first was frightening.  The though of losing my small base and time I spent building it worried me, but after a while I grew to know the landmarks which was comforting.  It felt homey.  Then sounds of a second island made their way through the forest.\n\nI had been feeling like a pimp with my bigwheel and finishing up my armor when the jetpack dropped, and started building that instead.  Didn't take long and I was zipping around.  Didn't mind grinding trees for fuel because it made it easier to gather specific types - it was GREAT... but I could always see that island.\n\nEventually I earned the nerve to go over, and got stacks of wood.  STACKS.  I didn't want to die in the ocean by miscalcualting.  I took plenty, but it was still crazy, and took awhile of straight flight to get over to it.  This new ilsand was all completely different and brought back all the fears from the first island, being weak and unprepared, new dangers and wonders.\n\nI set up shop on the coast, close to zipping back to the first isle if needed but found this to be a poor choice as all the monsters were quite stronger, so I just abanonded the small two room base and moved inland and found a nice lake to settle by, building a new home for myself always to remember my humble beginnings.\n\nThis new island was intense.  Lots of big bases with complicated layouts and players going about their ways, often coming by to zap you to mess with you or even tag you with a pistol and fly off merrily, always in good fun.  New armors and weapons to craft on the second island allowed for plenty more grinding and sight seeing which is excellent, which I am still doing, only to pause to write this review and go to bed for work.  Shame I can't play this there as well.\n\n10/10 would keep playing\n\nPro's\n- Great Abience\n- Interesting Weaponry/Gear\n- JETPACKS\n- Friendly Community\n- GRINDING!!! <3\n- Cool dances\n- Wood = Fuel (non of this gas shiz)\n\nCon's\n-\n\nHonestly, the only Con's I could about say aren't really cons because the game isn't finished so stating it's missing content isn't a downfall of the game, it's the current state of development.  Help fund and shape the game, or wait till others do and deceide if you like it then.","February 5, 2015","true","187.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Tons  of fun to group up with friends or play solo and gather, craft, upgrade and pillage. Even PvE has a PvP aspect in that you can destroy people's structures for resources or looting purposes but base defense is quite easy, save for gathering wood enough to keep your defenses online overnight in realtime.

It seems who you summon is based on some parameters not made available easily to the player, so our course of action was to upgrade until we could summon everyone in the group at once, which became annoying with the decline glitch.\n\nAll in all, very entertaining and easy to sink some time into. If I had a dedicated group of players and no other games that delivered what I was looking for in this genre, I'd purchase it.

If you want a review on individual aspects of the game, please consult another review\nAs of this review, I have played the game well over 30 hours, including over 25 on a US East PvP server, and to be honest, I can't get enough.  The game itself, for an alpha, is very playable, but does not shove everything immediately at you; you earn your way through the game.  Going into new, unexplored territory of unknown dangers and the risk of coming into contact with an extreme PvP player, this is all aspects of the game that give me a feeling of excitement.  The game itself is good, but it’s the interactions with other players and friends that make this game absolutely worth it.\n\nIn terms of community, I’ll fall upon an official PvP server.  Unofficial, PvE, and generally other servers may differ from this experience.  For a long time after playing PvP survivals like DayZ, Rust, etc., I have always looked on server choice by risk, having enough players to be a part of the game, but not too much to have a huge threat.  This all changed when I joined this average of 8-12 up to 40 as of this review.  I was genuinely surprised when most people on the server were actually quite relaxed and helpful.  This lead for my clan and I to make a name for ourselves on the server, even if not a prominent as the veterans of the game.  I love new players and rarely anyone PvPs with the friendly community, especially after the seniors demonstrated their caring and generosity.  I have high hopes for my community and its expansion into even more relationships and wonderful memories.\n\nSUMMARY\nGrav is a very playable alpha that is especially fun with friends.  The game in itself can feel grindy, especially at early ranks.  However, if you can form or find a good community in the server, make a name for yourselves and start your reform; this will lead to a happy server and the game earning the rightful spot in your memory bank that it deserves.  It runs well if you meet minimum requirements and has fun and unique items and features (notably the dancing; look it up if you have never seen it).  The game is one of chance, you may or may not find a server of generally good and happy players, but the shear feeling of helping someone and being part of something gives you purpose and can lead to great relationships.  This game is very greatly worth your time and money.\n","November 25, 2015","true","52.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The amazing, serene music put me in an instant state of tranquility while I walked around the beautiful landscape.\n(unfortunately the water is nothing more than a material/texture with post processing color tint under it)\n\nI kept this up for a while. I walked around for nearly 4 hours, simply exploring the landscape.\n\nThen I got some friends in on it, and the real fun began. We built bases, jumped into stargates and traveled to the moon and other interesting and still beautiful planets. We explored GIANT breathtaking caves full of weird and dangerous aliens, (and slaughtered them) and conquered intimidating boss-like foes we at first were sure were going to slaughter us.\n\nI notice a lot of negative reviews with this game cover the PvP. But I really don't think that's the way this game is meant to be played. It certainly doesn't feel like it, and I know I wouldn't enjoy it. In fact, I'll probably never play on a PvP server. This is best as a PvE game in my mind, really. Let these planets steal you for a minute. Take you and your buddies on an scenic adventure. All while conquering your objectives, if you please.\n\nThe whole "building"and "crafting" system isn't too complicated, no, but it leaves room for challenge and things to be sought after. It does its job and it does it pretty well. This IS NOT minecraft. Nor do I want it to be.\n\nThere's a few things in the game that give a vibe that the game doesn't take itself very seriously and it's obvious. Such as, dancing at a campfire to regain health and stamina instead of just sitting and resting. Or, the ability to poop wherever you please. over, and over, and over, and over again. The former I can get over, I hardly need to use the campfires anyway. But the latter, REALLY can ruin the experience for me real quick. Luckily this can usually be avoided if you're playing with a mature group.. hopefully.\n\nPlay this game. Don't judge it as a survival game along all the others. This is its own piece of art.\nI'm only 17 hours in right now as I've only been playing for two days. but this time will skyrocket.

Multiple different biomes (each with their own potential hazards, atmosphere caused or the wildlife within), stargate travel to other worlds, the moon, and massive expanses of land to tame, or claim.\n\nEven in Early Access, this is feeling like a full fledged game!

If you want a review on individual aspects of the game, please consult another review\nAs of this review, I have played the game well over 30 hours, including over 25 on a US East PvP server, and to be honest, I can't get enough.  The game itself, for an alpha, is very playable, but does not shove everything immediately at you; you earn your way through the game.  Going into new, unexplored territory of unknown dangers and the risk of coming into contact with an extreme PvP player, this is all aspects of the game that give me a feeling of excitement.  The game itself is good, but it’s the interactions with other players and friends that make this game absolutely worth it.\n\nIn terms of community, I’ll fall upon an official PvP server.  Unofficial, PvE, and generally other servers may differ from this experience.  For a long time after playing PvP survivals like DayZ, Rust, etc., I have always looked on server choice by risk, having enough players to be a part of the game, but not too much to have a huge threat.  This all changed when I joined this average of 8-12 up to 40 as of this review.  I was genuinely surprised when most people on the server were actually quite relaxed and helpful.  This lead for my clan and I to make a name for ourselves on the server, even if not a prominent as the veterans of the game.  I love new players and rarely anyone PvPs with the friendly community, especially after the seniors demonstrated their caring and generosity.  I have high hopes for my community and its expansion into even more relationships and wonderful memories.\n\nSUMMARY\nGrav is a very playable alpha that is especially fun with friends.  The game in itself can feel grindy, especially at early ranks.  However, if you can form or find a good community in the server, make a name for yourselves and start your reform; this will lead to a happy server and the game earning the rightful spot in your memory bank that it deserves.  It runs well if you meet minimum requirements and has fun and unique items and features (notably the dancing; look it up if you have never seen it).  The game is one of chance, you may or may not find a server of generally good and happy players, but the shear feeling of helping someone and being part of something gives you purpose and can lead to great relationships.  This game is very greatly worth your time and money.\n","November 25, 2015","true","52.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The amazing, serene music put me in an instant state of tranquility while I walked around the beautiful landscape.\n(unfortunately the water is nothing more than a material/texture with post processing color tint under it)\n\nI kept this up for a while. I walked around for nearly 4 hours, simply exploring the landscape.\n\nThen I got some friends in on it, and the real fun began. We built bases, jumped into stargates and traveled to the moon and other interesting and still beautiful planets. We explored GIANT breathtaking caves full of weird and dangerous aliens, (and slaughtered them) and conquered intimidating boss-like foes we at first were sure were going to slaughter us.\n\nI notice a lot of negative reviews with this game cover the PvP. But I really don't think that's the way this game is meant to be played. It certainly doesn't feel like it, and I know I wouldn't enjoy it. In fact, I'll probably never play on a PvP server. This is best as a PvE game in my mind, really. Let these planets steal you for a minute. Take you and your buddies on an scenic adventure. All while conquering your objectives, if you please.\n\nThe whole "building"and "crafting" system isn't too complicated, no, but it leaves room for challenge and things to be sought after. It does its job and it does it pretty well. This IS NOT minecraft. Nor do I want it to be.\n\nThere's a few things in the game that give a vibe that the game doesn't take itself very seriously and it's obvious. Such as, dancing at a campfire to regain health and stamina instead of just sitting and resting. Or, the ability to poop wherever you please. over, and over, and over, and over again. The former I can get over, I hardly need to use the campfires anyway. But the latter, REALLY can ruin the experience for me real quick. Luckily this can usually be avoided if you're playing with a mature group.. hopefully.\n\nPlay this game. Don't judge it as a survival game along all the others. This is its own piece of art.\nI'm only 17 hours in right now as I've only been playing for two days. but this time will skyrocket.

This game is top notch banter with your m9s, that meaning that its a great online experiance. MURDERING other players in grav is exciting especially with the simple but enjoyable combat experiance. Dying in grav is not as bad as other survival games, as GRAV has an enhanced system in which you loose only 50% of your loot every time you die. Dying does not even matter when you have a base with an uplink because you can just store most of your stuff in a chest and then peace the ♥♥♥♥ out, and if you die you will keep solo items and the rest will be in your chest and then you can just click respawn at uplink...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratsplat/recommended/332500/","Ratsplat","Ratsplat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratsplat/","310 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvival games are one of the biggest genres in modern gaming, especially when it comes to early access games. I’ve played my fair share of them, and I can easily say that GRAV is better than most of them out there. However, even though GRAV is touted as a survival game and everything, it is actually more of an RPG with slight survival mechanics, even feeling like an MMO of sorts when played on multiplayer servers. This is because there is almost no threat from survival mechanics, you spend most of your time killing enemies for experience and loot, and the grindy job system lets multiple players to work together.\n\nI spent about 17 hours on the game, which let me see pretty much everything the game had to offer, except for getting to see all the available blueprints. The whole time was spent on solo mode instead of playing online with players, which allowed me to focus more and I even learned something important about the game. One of the last things that happened to me while playing was that an object spawned in the middle of my base, which caused enemies to appear around it and since I was the only one there and defensive turrets weren’t working for some reason, I lost all resources that I spent 15 hours gathering. Luckily, you never lose equipment or blueprints you have obtained even if you die so I still had those. Since solo and multiplayer is exactly the same game wise, you are severely handicapped when playing alone. The biggest thing is that instead of multiple people training different jobs, you must train every job in order to do stuff yourself. This is especially bad when you must spend a long time killing enemies just to use advanced vehicles as a pilot. Want to then efficiently build a base? Spend another 20 hours killing enemies for experience so you can learn passive talents. If you’re looking for a fun game to create large bases and have with with all the cool things you can create by yourself, you might as well go somewhere else unless you want to spend 100 hours unlocking everything.\n\nOther than solo mode being handicapped, which was discussed previously, there are a few other things that are severely detrimental to GRAV. While it is good and bad that each job must be trained separately, the fact that you only get experience and blueprints from combat makes no sense. The hunter job, which is focused on killing enemies, makes sense to train it with combat, but why would someone with the jobs to make building bases and gathering resources more efficiently want to spend hours killing enemies, instead of actually doing their jobs. Instead, most of everything in the game should grant experience and blueprints, with bonus experience rewarded if it is part of the job you’ve selected. Combat is also very plain and boring, as it just involves you running backwards while you shoots tons of ammo at enemies. The only time that you die in combat is if you’re in a cave or other dungeon area, where enemies will pretty much just spawn on top of you and your character gets stuck.\n\nRead my full review at http://www.ratsplat.com/grav-early-access-preview/\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","March 27","true","17.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

You can do it in solo play or multiplayer. But remember, there's always danger around you,  so beware of it, try to fight it before you drop dead. Wether it is a player or creature, a gun or melee, turret or not, it can always defeat you. You must become dominant, build your base and upgrade upon it. Creat new armour sets and give them enchants, such as 'Fire' or 'Ice'. Explore new places that are unlike any other game you have or haven't played or even seen before. GRAV is a game which needs you to have power, enough to stay alive. Will you fall to a Yeti? Will you die to a shotgun shot? It's up to you, what will your choice be, adventuerer?\n\nOverview\nGRAV is a sanbox where you can explore, build, craft, hunt, attack with your tribe, and hopefully survive. It needs true focus on a populated server, however GRAV has servers that aren't that popular, maybe because of the price tag, or just because people always say "don't trust Early Access" or something along the lines of that, but GRAV along with some other games change that completely. The base building is absolutely insane! You can build a whole castle  which would take a while to make, but would be awesome. It reminds me of Rust in this mechanic, in-depth, complicated in some parts, innovative and also fun. Sometimes things that are fun just don't makes sense how they can eb fun, famring ages to make a virtual thing, then realizing you didn't make a bubble shield, so all of you work is depleted. The next day you do the same, but you can't ind a Bubble Shield in the building selection. You realize you need the bluperint for it  in order to create it. Day after that you have the blueprint, place it down, but then you need a Generator which needs a Generator blueprint. Frustrating but well worth your time.\n\nGraphics\nI talk about Graphics in all/most of my reviews for a very good reason, to bring some light to the artpiece. This game definitely deserves the spotlight. GRAV was made in a very good game engine, using talented people. Who said all games have to be all dark and miserable? Well GRAV changed that by proving how an exotic atmosphere looks and feels better than a realistic one. If you want realism, go to a game simulator, if you want a more fantasy approach, GRAV is your friend. There's bright colours everywhere, even some weapons are brightly coloured. The characters are bright, the voice acting is higher pitcher to make it sound a bit more friendly. It is a HD game from what I could see, the light shafts look beautiful as well. It's almost perfected. Not such good graphics that my computer will die in a few minutes, but also not too shabby that I don't know what anything is meant to be. Although the graphics do make me lag a little bit (around 45-50 fps on average), but these are some next-gen graphics right here. So it's expected.\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nVery impressive work within a small team\nAwesome graphics\nSo much to do\nEpic base builing\nCheats (if you like them)\nVery good game engine\n\nCons:\nCheats (if you don't like them)\nBugs, although there's few of them\n\nFinal Rating\n9/10 - Graphics, gameplay, multiplayer, singleplayer, cheats, a ton to do, base building, and even more being added!\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

It kept me hooked for 259 hours. Even Fallout 4 didn't manage to do that (90 hours played and never touched it again).

But oh boy what fun I had on the way reaching it :) The game community is awesome and I made new friends and I built some stuff and I was astonished by new breed of survival action game. Naturally there are some bugs but luckily I didn't experience major issues.\n\nThe reason I'm having a pause from the game is definitely not the community and guys in-game but the game itself. And the reason is simple: When you start a game you need to have goals. When you achieve the goals and there is nothing to do the game kinda dries out. And this happened after reaching the end-game. Meanwhile doing so I have reported some bugs and I hope I have done my part with all the feedback I've given to make this game even more awesome.\n\nBut at this point of the development we have to remember that Grav is a living breathing and evolving game.

Cool graphics.\n2. Music is good.\n3. Lots of potential.\n4. Game menu is easy to navigate.\n5. Mobs drop items like Borderlands, which is cool as funk.\n6. Solo/Multi/Coop.\n7. Runs smooth.\n\nCons:\n1. Game craft progression is way to easy.  (I had a pistol in the first 5 mins)\n2. Items drop in a way that is hard to mentally keep track of.\n3. Inventory is not very immersive and makes me want to exit the game when I see it.\n4. Mouse sensitivity is super sensitive and requires file editing to fix.\n5. Blur is default and also requires file editing to turn off.\n6. Collecting resources is not at all immersive. (Not a good deal for a game that requires gathering for progression)\n7. Auto loot. (See #2)\n\nFinal Thought:\nI support the concept of GRAV but not at the price of $20. I believe GRAV will be a top notch game but I think their devs need to rethink the price in respect to the paying customer. Terraria is a hit game yet still only charges $10 for a copy.

I played 3 hours of it to get to level 10. I must say it is a great game to play but it's missing a couple of elements to it. Where are the spaceships? My understanding of going through the construction phase of what you can build is you can build machines, planes, cars, tanks, whatnot. But you jump through portals to get to other planets. Wormholes I understand but portals? The portals lead to other dimensions, of course.\n\nThen when I pushed the button to travel in the portal to the moon. The game got really buggy and crashed on me. :( I'm not too happy about that. So I reloaded the game again and got back in it and it seems like it took forever to load for me to travel to the moon, the second time around.\n\nWhen I got to the moon, I found out at the loading screen there is 'TIPS' you can read about the game. One of them was you have to build a special oxygen tank or special suit to travel to other worlds. Then when I was on the moon, I only had maybe a minute of air to walk around. Which this building the suit ties into getting 'Element X' and you have to build a machine to mine it. I would be just happy with a pick axe. :) Or the mining gun on my arm to mine it. :) But you have to have all the right material for the machine to build it and mine for you. The mining takes up real world time too. I'm not a fan of real world time.\n\nYou have to wait until you are at certain higher levels to build stuff or build buildings. & then you have to research the job that you are wanting to build those buildings for. You can interchange between different professions. :)\n\nThe other thing I looked at was the feed for all the bugs that were fixed. :/ Granted this is a beta game right now. But I guess I was hoping for a lot more from the game. My expectations were set high. So from 1 to 10 I give this a 6 rating.\n\nPros:\n\nWhen I got into the game the visuals and floral and skys, clouds, sun are beautiful. I'm a total fan of that. Breathtaking in fact.\n\nThe concept of the monsters are gorgeous and otherworldly. I kept dying at level 1, while the monsters were level 6. Because that's where I kept spawning was around those monsters. It definitely feels like I want to play more of the game when the bugs are fixed and there is no freezing up or crashes. :/ The concept of the game is to build and loot from the world on different planets and in space on the moons. I love that idea!! :)\n\nThe idea to travel to other worlds and visit dungeons but in this case its caves on the planets and see what all is there. Mine with the building machine, if you have all the right components. You can get a mount but in this game it's a circular cycle machine. I forget what they called it in the game. But you have to have wood to keep feeding it and lots of it too. :/\n\nThe cycle machine does get me around a lot faster but needs to be improved upon with turning, while you press the A and D keys.\n\nBuilding your own home is pretty cool as well. As long as  you have the right materials. :)\n\nI would recommend this game to players just starting out with space survival games. It seems like it is perfect for beginners who want to get into the upcoming genre of these games. :) I just wish they would have spaceships to fly to other planets or the moons and then if you run out of air, go back to your spaceship. :) Every game deserves a chance to be played and who knows my opinion would difffer to someone else who enjoys the beta game. :)","November 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game world is jolly attractive, I like the in game music and the mechanics are solid. It feels like a 3D Darkout (minus digging) for me with a greater focus on dungeons, finding loot boxes and hunting blueprints.\n\nAh, blueprints, something that I could see being a bone of contention amongst many players - to craft an item, you have to have its blueprint. Blueprints drop from enemies, but reasonably reliably drop from boss/named monsters which can be found on the surface, but are better hunted underground. I could see this system feeling a little "grindy" to people - blueprints are on a % chance to drop and although some things can be unlocked through research I am unsure if all can be researched.\n\nCaves dot the landscape and the in game compass points you towards them, and dungeonrunning for the loot crate + named bosses at the end of each cave is essential, rewarding and maybe a little frustrating as enemies respawn a little randomly. In addition, resource nodes dot the cave that can have extractors built on and defended while they gather the resource for research.\n\nThe game seems to encourage (at least in the beginning) wide range exploration - respawn terminals are cheap, as are crafting stations, so creating little outposts as you explore rather than setting up a primary base is totally viable.\n\nThe "survival" aspect of the game appears to only be a stamina/hunger system alongside "hazardous" environments in some biomes, and not dying against swarms of enemies. This may or may not be your sort of thing, personally I enjoy the "survival-lite" feel.\n\nMy current objectives are to build a wingsuit and find a way to get to the moon. I'm yet to even encounter artifacts or elemental weapons, or unlock the extra "jobs" you can level up for permanent skills and active abilities, or blueprints for vehicles, or actually start using the base building tools (which other players have made some impressive things with)...\n\nIf you tried the free weekend but raged at griefing, I heartily recommend playing it singleplayer instead. There's plenty of content to get your teeth into and I'll be interested to see where the game heads from here.","November 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Probably from MMO/RPG qidthdrawl, but aside from farming the planets are well designed, and even the moon feels like (but the lungs and ocean (wtf)) the moon.

I played 3 hours of it to get to level 10. I must say it is a great game to play but it's missing a couple of elements to it. Where are the spaceships? My understanding of going through the construction phase of what you can build is you can build machines, planes, cars, tanks, whatnot. But you jump through portals to get to other planets. Wormholes I understand but portals? The portals lead to other dimensions, of course.\n\nThen when I pushed the button to travel in the portal to the moon. The game got really buggy and crashed on me. :( I'm not too happy about that. So I reloaded the game again and got back in it and it seems like it took forever to load for me to travel to the moon, the second time around.\n\nWhen I got to the moon, I found out at the loading screen there is 'TIPS' you can read about the game. One of them was you have to build a special oxygen tank or special suit to travel to other worlds. Then when I was on the moon, I only had maybe a minute of air to walk around. Which this building the suit ties into getting 'Element X' and you have to build a machine to mine it. I would be just happy with a pick axe. :) Or the mining gun on my arm to mine it. :) But you have to have all the right material for the machine to build it and mine for you. The mining takes up real world time too. I'm not a fan of real world time.\n\nYou have to wait until you are at certain higher levels to build stuff or build buildings. & then you have to research the job that you are wanting to build those buildings for. You can interchange between different professions. :)\n\nThe other thing I looked at was the feed for all the bugs that were fixed. :/ Granted this is a beta game right now. But I guess I was hoping for a lot more from the game. My expectations were set high. So from 1 to 10 I give this a 6 rating.\n\nPros:\n\nWhen I got into the game the visuals and floral and skys, clouds, sun are beautiful. I'm a total fan of that. Breathtaking in fact.\n\nThe concept of the monsters are gorgeous and otherworldly. I kept dying at level 1, while the monsters were level 6. Because that's where I kept spawning was around those monsters. It definitely feels like I want to play more of the game when the bugs are fixed and there is no freezing up or crashes. :/ The concept of the game is to build and loot from the world on different planets and in space on the moons. I love that idea!! :)\n\nThe idea to travel to other worlds and visit dungeons but in this case its caves on the planets and see what all is there. Mine with the building machine, if you have all the right components. You can get a mount but in this game it's a circular cycle machine. I forget what they called it in the game. But you have to have wood to keep feeding it and lots of it too. :/\n\nThe cycle machine does get me around a lot faster but needs to be improved upon with turning, while you press the A and D keys.\n\nBuilding your own home is pretty cool as well. As long as  you have the right materials. :)\n\nI would recommend this game to players just starting out with space survival games. It seems like it is perfect for beginners who want to get into the upcoming genre of these games. :) I just wish they would have spaceships to fly to other planets or the moons and then if you run out of air, go back to your spaceship. :) Every game deserves a chance to be played and who knows my opinion would difffer to someone else who enjoys the beta game. :)","November 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Considering it's in alpha there will probably be lots of detail added... at least i hope so (little butterflys here and there! xD).\nThe soundtracks are great! Very pleasant and smooth!\nThe whole idea of exploration on mutiple planets, flying with jetpacks and crossing desets with doom buggys is very appealing.\nComabt also shows lots of promise but definitely need lots of improvement and variety added.\nThe job system gives a nice replay value to the game as if you are leveling a new character except it's the same one. I like that.\n\nNow as I said before. Combat needs lots of improvement. The AI is not very respondent. Sometimes it feels like the mobs don't care if i'm attacking them. Makes it very easy to kill them overall. As I see it the only danger is the high respawn rate. Especially in caves. Never know when something spawns right behind you. In my opinion mobs should react more aggresivly, dodge attacks and have all kinds of tricks up their sleeve while in the same time spawn rates should be decreased giving us players the time to deal with an encounter.\nNow about the weapons. I love shooting things! But once i went from Combat Pistol to The Remodeler i never went back. I just hated to have to click so many times to shoot. I felt like i was back in 90's wishing i had a turbo controller! :D\nAlso a shield would be dope so i could block shooting attacks in tight cave tunnels.\nSomething that annoyed me a little was that driving a monocycle there was no used for the A and D buttons. It seemed like they should let me look left and right while driving straight looking for thouse precious big red loot boxes i mean like cmon i opened like 10 and no free key? WTF? <_<\n\nP.S. Almost forgot to mention that there needs to be some sort of way to sell off unneeded items not just storing them or dropping them. What if i want to quit for a month and cant be active at keepeing my house and storage safe. An option to trade items for resorces would come in handy so i could just keep everything in my inventory and log out with no worry on mind. :)\n\nBest of luck to the devs!

The game world is jolly attractive, I like the in game music and the mechanics are solid. It feels like a 3D Darkout (minus digging) for me with a greater focus on dungeons, finding loot boxes and hunting blueprints.\n\nAh, blueprints, something that I could see being a bone of contention amongst many players - to craft an item, you have to have its blueprint. Blueprints drop from enemies, but reasonably reliably drop from boss/named monsters which can be found on the surface, but are better hunted underground. I could see this system feeling a little "grindy" to people - blueprints are on a % chance to drop and although some things can be unlocked through research I am unsure if all can be researched.\n\nCaves dot the landscape and the in game compass points you towards them, and dungeonrunning for the loot crate + named bosses at the end of each cave is essential, rewarding and maybe a little frustrating as enemies respawn a little randomly. In addition, resource nodes dot the cave that can have extractors built on and defended while they gather the resource for research.\n\nThe game seems to encourage (at least in the beginning) wide range exploration - respawn terminals are cheap, as are crafting stations, so creating little outposts as you explore rather than setting up a primary base is totally viable.\n\nThe "survival" aspect of the game appears to only be a stamina/hunger system alongside "hazardous" environments in some biomes, and not dying against swarms of enemies. This may or may not be your sort of thing, personally I enjoy the "survival-lite" feel.\n\nMy current objectives are to build a wingsuit and find a way to get to the moon. I'm yet to even encounter artifacts or elemental weapons, or unlock the extra "jobs" you can level up for permanent skills and active abilities, or blueprints for vehicles, or actually start using the base building tools (which other players have made some impressive things with)...\n\nIf you tried the free weekend but raged at griefing, I heartily recommend playing it singleplayer instead. There's plenty of content to get your teeth into and I'll be interested to see where the game heads from here.","November 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

That time has come! I bought this game ages ago but as it's pretty grind heavy I haven't had the time I  wanted to spend on it. I really like the aspects of sandbox/survival/mmorpg with plenty of loot, blueprints, gear, and dungeons. Oh, and when you get bored of one planet... just teleport to a new one or jet pack over to a new island! I definitely suggest spending a little time to get to know the game but I would not say it has a steep learning curve. Anyways... cheers!

Game mechanics are the basics, gather resources, find blueprints to build stuff, ultimately build stuff, get better, go on.\n\nInitial tutorial covers the most basic bases, while unfortunately leaves some pretty crucial things, like the fact that every building you build decays over 1 day real time initially, so if you log out after building a nice looking house or a big coumpound you returt 2 days later to find... Nothing, and is something I find extremely annoying, it may be the norm in this kind of MMOs, but as I said above, I don't know. You can ultimately prevent this process by finding a blueprint that allows you to build a shield, but let's talk about blueprints now.\n\nBlueprints are the basics to get better and aquire new building and equipment, but to obtain'em you have to grind mob, which can be a frustrating stuff, since normal mob have an extremely low chances to drop a blueprints while bosses have around 80% chance to drop, but once you start collecting blueprints, if a boss drops a project you already have you simply gain nothig, making it more luck better than anything else later on.\n\nThat being said, there's much to explore. Worlds are huge and you can traver within and beyond'em, even go on moons, using stellar gates to get to other planets. There are diffrent biomes to explore and many things to see and diffrent resources to gather, the problem is that you have to run for looooong distances, there are however, some vehicles you can buy at verdors for ridicolously high prices or build'em using blueprints... and yes... see above, so you either are lucky to find a vehicle blueprints or nothing.\n\nLast thing is... well, griefers. I know, I know, since is a MMO you must expect to deal with human natural ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry, but even in PvE servers you can very well find people who just destroy your stuff because probably they're having the best time in their life doing so, and you can do nothing because it's a PvE. You can repel it by building certain defensive systems an by being careful where you place stuff, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son...\n\nI really hope this grief problem are just a free weekend thing because honesly, if you spend money to put down people your life must be very miserable.\n\nAnd that's just about Grav for now, worth the current price and acceptable due to the Alpha state","November 14, 2015","true","27.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Obviously I do not have much time into the game but I will post an updated review once I get a good 20+ hours into it... I was really looking forward to that lighting.\n\nThe game itself is very enjoyable so far.. I met a few random people and we made a base together, found another random who then attacked us for no reason (Which was very entertaining) The crafting system is easy to use, once you have the blueprints you need.(which drop from enemies or lootcrates) Leveling up takes some time, but I'm only saying that because I spent more time collecting materials then I did killing enemies. The ability to hop into a world and have nothing but a mining  tool and a knife, being able to meet random players and explore the large environments made this game worth it. Once I joined an empty server I was able to turn on Post Processing without the intense amount of lag and the game looks beautiful.(running in 1080p with all of the lighting/shadows/post proscessing Enabled) I recommend this game and I'll keep updating this review.","January 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Review\n---The Short 10-hrs. Review---\n\nPROS\n\n+ Amazing visuals through use of the Unreal 3 engine\n+ Large, open-world concept with many biomes to explore\n+ Controls are fairly decent for an Early Access game\n+ Crafting system is very thought-out and well-built for an Early Access game\n\nCONS\n\n- GRAV is very laggy even with a good connection and low ping\n- Some environments are 'broken' and players/enemies fall through\n- Mining for resources is very time consuming\n- Player progression is slow\n\nOVERALL\n\n+ Score: 8/10\n\n---The Long 10-hrs. Review---\n\n\nPremise\n\nWhat is GRAV? GRAV is a unique sci-fi Craftbuilder/Survival MMO allowing players to build bases, tools, and vehicles in order to aid them in their exploration and survival of the planet they are residing in. GRAV has no classes, no real currency, and no ranks, making every player equal in their ability to mine for resources and hunt monsters.\n\nVisuals\n\nGRAV is built on the Unreal 3 engine which makes it a perfect candidate for stunning visuals on a large, open-world game such as this one. The planet is large, and contains many different biomes such as a bright blue wooded area with colorful red and green leaves, or a sandy beach with large, rocky mountains. Caves are dark and narrow with many faultlines inside, and the sky is filled with clouds and distant planets staring us down. As the day leaves and nightfall arrives, the terrain becomes hardly visible except for a few monsters that glow in the dark. The Unreal 3 engine really does a fantastic job of portraying a real planet with its night and day sequences and GRAV really shines in this respect.\n\nCrafting\n\nUnfortunately, GRAV struggles a bit with the crafting system. Yes, there are many amazing things a player can craft in this game, however, the resources required to craft anything other than a campfire or Uplink (respawn point) is a bit outrageous and will require several hours of mining in order to acquire a decent amount of resources. In the ten hours of playtime on GRAV, I have spent at least seven of those hours wandering this vast planet exploring caves and mountains in search of enough ore and gem deposit to build a simple 4-bedroom base to call my home on this planet. Once crafted, there is also the risk of a monster or even another player coming up to your newly built home and bashing it into nothing but resources for them to take. So, while the amount of things one can craft is vast, the tedious mining for resources can be a big negative for those not looking to spend ~70% of their playtime roaming the planet in search of gems, ore, and wood.\n\nGameplay\n\nFor an Early Access game, the controls are fairly responsive. When engaged in combat or mining, GRAV features a non-targetting combat system similar to Dragon's Nest or GunZ: The Duel in which the player must click on the object in order to perform the action. This is a very good thing when fighting multiple targets in the open or a cave, as it lets the player run freely around the enemy and attack simultaneously. At times however, the hit detection is off a bit, possibly due to lag issues or when the player or enemy encounters certain environmental obstacles such as a tree or a mountain. In some areas, a player may even fall through the map or get stuck in a continuous jump if they approach a mountain at the wrong angle. Still, for an Early Access game, the controls are solid.\n\nOverall\n\nGRAV is fairly new and is still in its pre-Alpha phase, but it does show true potential to be a contender for a fairly fun game in the coming years. Thanks to the Unreal 3 engine and the artists, the game is visually impressive with a large, open-world planet to explore and beautifully rendered monsters and textures. The controls are fairly responsive and decent enough to not have an awkward hand position while playing, and the non-targetting combat system works very well for this type of game. Unfortunately, GRAV can be quite tedious in the hunt for resources, but it makes up for the hours spent mining by allowing you to create large bases and craft better tools to aid you in further resource mining or combat. The lag issues are becoming less frequent with the new patch, but it's still an issue when playing for more than a few hours as it will often get you killed or simply prevent you from exploring the planet.\n\nWith that said, I would still recommend this game for anyone looking to try out a sci-fi craftbuilding MMO in Early Access. Unlike other games, the development team is actively releasing patches and the community, while small, is very helpful to newbies.","January 26, 2015","true","12.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For one its all about the crafting and collecting resources to build in. I mean its gonna take a while to get things, but that's what makes the game fun.  I have read that the crafting takes forever, I would have to strongly disagree with that. You may not get things instantly in your inventory, but you can farm enough material for a set of gear in 20-30 mins which is very reasonable.\n\nThe Bases are just amazing in this game.  You get to create a defence and your own way of how you want your base, well also you will need blueprints(bps) to even make the items. Speaking of bps, once you start collecting them you can make some really cool gear. When starting out you can create an armory to build your gear. Then there's a factory you can build so you can create your vehicles such as a monocycle which is really fun to ride and even a jetpack.\n\nThen there is PvP, i dont mind it actually because you can kill people to get blueprints which have an essence of PlayerSoul, and that increases weapon dmg and increases armor reduction for pvp. Gear is a vital part for PvP.  But like all other things, it isn't too hard to farm and craft. I craft sets all the time for my brother and friends.\n\nI enjoy PvP, but PvE is great too because you will never have to worry about getting ganked. The only problem about PvE for me is the griefers that destroy your base(s).  Although this can get annoying, it can also bring about a challenge within the PvE environment similar to PvP, base defense!  So rather than combating a person, you could build shield generators that protect your base since you cant kill them. In PvP you can alsso add a strong defensive weapons system to kill enemy griefers!\n\nGrav also has a class like system called job that maxes out at level 60 while your character rank maxes out at 300. The jobs let you kill things your current job lvl or less, but be warned, try to kill higher job lvls and your dmg output is reduced significantly.\n\nSomething new to the game are tanks! They look alien with electricity underneath and anything you hit with it explodes and does a ton of DMG.  They sit two people inside which is nice.\n\nI really recommend this game! It's a great price for a good indie game with so much potential for an alpha.  The developers (DEVS) are doing great to this game so far and you will see them in game often. This is why I enjoy and continue to play this game, I hope you take the time to give it a try!","April 8, 2015","true","226.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It has good music. It has good visuals. You can run your own dedicated server and have a private sandbox. There are some bugs but it is in Early Access.

There are Player vs. Enemy servers where you can't kill other players but they can still destroy your stuff provided you don't have a shield with an active generator. PVP is where it's at for me. If you don't want any of that there is also a solo mode.\n\nYou can easily be lulled into a sense of serenity with the music and peaceful nature of gathering resources and building structures. This makes it all the more interesting when encountering other players because you don't know what will happen. They may be nice and give you tips on building or they might kill you and take all of your gathered resources. It is all up to the individual player. We can be ruthless or we can dance around a fire (which will give you health and stamina). Getting killed sucks (duh) but you are largely on the same playing field with other players (unlike the enemies). They can loot your dropped items but you will always keep your slotted items (including weapons).\n\nI look forward to more GRAV content from Bitmonster.","March 15","true","331.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you need to find another player, the player has to use a flare and you have to go looking for her. I find this great, it adds a weird aspect of realism in the game.\n\nIt has had its ups and downs (server problems etc.) and it can get very heavy if some users have built enormous structures around (which take too much time to load), but I still enjoy the experience. After a while it can get grindy though.\n\nI really want to see what the future holds for this game.

With what I would like to share some of my opinions on the game.\n\nWhen I played like for the first 2 hours of the game I was just killing things, getting killed, and getting resources that i thought I needed. When I got some friends to play with me, it went a little faster, getting a base up (wood) then going to the moon and eventually having cool plasma armor.\nSo far it was fun, had some run ins with the game not wanting to load the map and or damage was not being dealt.\n\nOk so I left the game for a month and came back to one new update ( did not really see a difference) But was playing with even more friend and did more things than just go to the moon a get plasa armor, and as of right now we almost are the highest rank that you can possibly be on the game and have everything that we need for a long time. But that does not take away the fact that we love going into caves and fighting bosses and fighting our way through a dungeon.\n\nI get why it may be boring and i know that it is early access, But that does not take away the true work behind it. there are problems with the game that I hate and really wish was fixed like vehicle go under the ground in some parts of the map or base building items don't really do what you want it to. It is a big grinding game, which is the whole point of it. You don't have to have a story or missions to make a game good or in this case, progressive improvement. I don’t want players to leave the game because of hackers or Bugs or random things that get over dramatized out for. although there could be some big improvements to the game that I would like to see in the next few monthly updates are ( bug fixes,more vehicles,variety of enemies, and base building items) to list a few.\n\nWe all want something from this game and i think that they want to work on it as much as they can but it may take time, and time is what this game has.","February 11","true","71.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It has a great group of creators that are keen to listen to the comments and concerns of those playing and testing it. Very thorough and detailed patch notes are also a personal favorite of mine. The game is ever expanding and every time I log back in after a week break something is new. Not to mention the learning curve is relatively easy compared to most open world builders out there.\n\nHowever I will say it is not ideal if you love base building. The objective seems to kill, collect, build, level up, then move. This makes base building for that perfect stronghold kind of moot. Not to mention if you do not log in every day you are likely to come back with your base just destroyed as if it were never there, either by other players or random AI's.\n\nAll in all, great game, havent regretted the purchase","March 21","true","91.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It gives you the chance to explore all the parts of the worlds that you may have passed before.\n\nYou start on a Home Planet, then travel to a moon at level 10 and proceed going to low, mid and High planets afterwards.\n\nThe planet you travel to is basically conditioned by time. Depending on the hour of the day/night, you'll reach a forest or a desert and you'll also need some protections to sustain the enviromental hazards some of these planets present.\n\nAnother key feature of this game are blueprints. Basically you get them from killing monsters and the higuer the level of the monsters, the better blueprints you get. They serve as a claim to incite you to keep exploring new worlds even though you may very well end up dying.\n\nBut that's pretty much it. Aside from the exploration and blueprint recollection, there's nothing else Grav offers.\n\nLet's not forget that games like these are made by their users and Grav has an extremely thin community you can play with. Now, I was lucky. I found some really nice people that helped me most of the way and showed me how the game worked, they even created a portal system that allowed a faster farming and leveling, but the fact is, it's not enough. I've been playing in the European PVE server and have only found 40 people (at most) connected at the same time. People that would only bother to use the general chat to say "hi" and little else. In terms of population, the European PVP server holds the most people, roughly ten more users than the second server, which is the European PVE one. And all the other servers hold between one and five users.\n\nIn addition, developers have pretty much abandoned Grav. There's no new content being released for the game and updates don't seem to fix anything consecuential.\n\nAbout PVP, truth is I've never tried it, but I'm guessing it's pretty frustrating. It's already hard enough to farm key elements, such as Element X, when pleople isn't constantly trying to kill you in order to rob you of whatver you may have farmed that day. But that's just my opinion.\n\nWhat's not is the state of development of Grav. Simply put: it's not finished. There's so much to do. I was constantly bugged by the fact that you can't see your enemies' health bar, have found way too many bugs to count, estructural flaws, mob behavior, gliding technical difficulties, continious connection interruptions and glitches. So many glitches. One of which cost me my entire character, if you want to know more, please visit this link in which I explain with detail what happened to me in particular:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/332500/discussions/2/364041776194681479/\n\nI have to say that, thankfully, they were able to fix my problem, so there IS some kind of support for this game.\n\nHowever, all in all, I don't recommend playing Grav the way it is right now due to their many glitches. The game's got a lot of potential to be sure and I'd love to play it once it's no longer an early access, but not right now.","May 17","false","48.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

Basically you start out in the middle of no where with nothink but a chocolat kinfe (crappy weapon) and a Mining tool no food You get nothing else. this means you die COOOOOOONSTANTLLY mostly of starvation or over powered monsters. There are barely any areas with monsters of that you are able to fight with out dying, There isn't much variaty in animals exept colour.  You can't host servers you join servers that the game is holding toghether so if you are stuck without wifi for a week sucks to be you and i bet once or twice in the commercial it shows you kicking ♥♥♥ with your friends the thing is it isn't that simple. You have start a group but in order to do that you need to make a code but to do that you have to do other stuff if you don't do that you can't build or share equipment toghether and usually you and your friends spawn in different areas so you have to make a flare gun but that takes for eva to make. And servers with people who aren't your friends are wild jerks who swear alot who won't even hestitate to kill you and take every thing you built, crafted, found with all that blood sweat and rage quiting.

It puts you through a very rudimentary Tutorial on how to build three different Workbenches in order to craft your starting gear(some of this gear is once you make it, it's permanently yours).\n\nAfter the very brief tutorial, the game throws you out into the harsh enviroment of whatever world you're currently stuck in and not only lets go of your hand, but slaps it away as if you're supposed to strike it out on your own.\n\nSo you wander aimlessly around, harvesting stuff from trees and rocks and other various little things as you explore the world. Blueprints to other items can drop from Monsters that wander around aimlessly, but this is slightly rare for it to happen.\n\nThere's also Caves, or Dungeons, that let you raid either with a friend or by yourself if you ever fancy yourself giving it a shot but dont expect rousing boss battles.\n\nYou can also take a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ on the ground. I don't really understand why I need to take a ♥♥♥♥ on the ground, but I guess it's funny?\n\nThere's random NPCs that pop in and out of existence if you're ever in Solo Play that just wave their arms at you and go fade into the rock wall like David Copperfield.\n\nSo what EXACTLY am I supposed to do? Traipse around, collecting resources, beat the everliving ♥♥♥♥ out of Bugdogs for their sweet, succulent Hearts? The game is literally begging you to be EXPLORED and taken by the reins, but it feels so  bland, and so boring, that there's nothing to do except Mine resources.\n\nGRAV is a very sandboxy Action RPG Crafting game, but it's vastness and complete lack of anything WORTHWHILE to do could spell it's doom.\n\nVERDICT:  WAIT","September 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","15","28","3","0"

Ten Outta Ten.\n\nIt is still quite new but offers quite a lot. It is an action survival MMO with resource gathering, monster farming, and player interaction. I feel PVP offers a lot more in this game as it adds a benefit to working with others and a concern when approaching an unfamiliar face. When you die you drop most of your items (can be reduced later) but they are unable to be looted for a whole hour (which can be extended, later) so this means you won't lose all of your work when you die and will have a good chance to regain it. Additionally, the crafting recipes you learn are bound to your character.\n\nAfter 16 hours I have not experienced any game breaking bugs and have suffered only 1 game freeze that decided to eat through 180 assault rifle bullets...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vascoalexander/recommended/332500/","vascoalexander","BIOHAZARD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vascoalexander/","73 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFrom the game description, trailers and other reviews i have expected an intersting Survival / Exploration Game with fast paced Combat and rich atmospheric Graphics. If you expect the same, then this review might be a help for your buying decision.\n\nNote: I have revised this review, after digging deeper into the game and finally it has convinced me to recommend it.\n\nGameworld / Environment\n\nIt's an open-world with no limitations in the player movement other than the boundaries of the map. Flying rocks can be reached with rocketpacks and are fully functional (eg. for base building). The procedurally generated terrain looks nice, but after some time you have seen all variations and it just repeats over and over. There is a day and nightcycle and a rudimentary weathersystem (does not effect the gamemechanics). The dungeons are crappy and monotonous. Soundeffect and music are okey, but could be better. There are only a few different creature models varying only in color and size. Boss- or elite-mobs are just bigger variants of their normal counterparts. The NPC AI is limited to the minimum (hostile, friendly, aggro, non-aggro).\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is best described as third-person shooter, with crafting elements, in an open-world sandbox scenario. Combat is fast and action driven. Atm there are only a few special moves like dodging or an alternative special melee attack. With higher level you can craft rocketpacks, wings and a bike-like monocycle - all with reasonable high movement speed. The vehicles are a big fun factor in the game.\n\nYou have to grind a lot to get resources, but with higher level it gets easier. Leveling your character is kind of the same as in other mmo's. There are level zones and you move on to higher zones with better resources, grind, level up, get better gear and so on... Between that, you can build your base. The cubic base modules do not add much visual variety, but there is a wide spectrum of different base enhencements, that offer interesting functionalities like shields, auto-turrets or jumppads. By building stargates you can explore more planets and moons, adding a nice exploration experience.\n\nThere are world-events every 7-8 days (ingame-time). Actually the only event type happening, are extra mob spawns near your location in your level range.\n\nThere are no mentionable survival mechanics atm and the atmosphere of the game does not fit to the survival genre. To give an example: You have to dance at fire to recover health. When you do that, some kind of techno like music starts to torture you (or me). You have to disable (all) Music to get around this annoying effect.\n\nSingleplayer Mode\n\nSP is actually realized by a "One-Click" Local Server. That means: server and client run on one pc - that needs resources - specifically alot of RAM (take a look at the recommended specs in the description). Also you cannot pause the game, you cannot save / load a game and you cannot have multiple gamesessions at once easily. To start all over you need to delete the server files. This all will get better with ongoing development.\n\nPVP\n\nI haven't tested pvp so far, because it is too time expansive for me. From what i have heard it seems a little bit unbalanced. There is no lvl protection (low vs high level). Games with a high grinding factor to get gear or build things are known to be problematic in pvp. Open pvp servers are most likely not much fun for players, not willing to invest lots of time. But it might be fun to host or join a private server for Teamfights with home-brewed bases.\n\nDevelopment progress\n\nBeside minor issues (unpolished UI, buggy base-building), the game is well developed and fully playable with no game-breaking bugs. There is enough content for a long playtime. Updates are coming in frequently with new content, balancing and bug-fixes.\n\nCheck the Trello board of the game to get an idea of the direction the development takes:\n\nDevelopment Roadmap for GRAV (Trello Board)[trello.com]","April 9, 2015","true","221.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't feel bad spending the money at all. For a 6-month old project it's already pretty solid. The graphics and the atmosphere overall are simply beautiful. New updates including new items like vehicles, armor and weapon sets are pushed every week by the devs. The community is mostly mature. Some sort of grief prevention is already in the game and there are a dozen of new servers coming out every day... It feels like a mix of starbound in 3D and Borderlands. Hell, there are even NPCs that look like Clap Trap!\nGameplay is a bit laggy on a full 32/32 server but tweaks to lag reduction are in every patch and latest patch already removed like 70% of the lag.\nMob movement seems a bit laggy for now but as i said, i play on a full server and that might cause it. Gameplay consists of grinding dungeons for armor, weapons or buildings blueprints, materials and exp. There are world events where u can level your character pretty good. You can build bases, mob traps for item drops and soon you can travel to the planet's moons or even other planets.\n\nYou see, there is alot to discover in the world of GRAV.\nYou wonder if you should give it a try or not? I'd say do it! On the other hand keep in mind it is EARLY ALPHA and things will change. It feels unfinished but maybe in 1-2 months it will be different. Mobs are pretty much the same, there are like 6 mobtypes in about 4x4 elemental types. There will be more soon i guess... PVP is crap, people can log off, there is a 1h cooldown to pick somebodies backpack drop and in that time they can always pick it themselves up so a PVE server would be the best option. Weapons consist of different types of swords, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns (my favourite :D), soon to come rocket launchers, light sabers etc. Go to twitch and search for a stream, watch it and make yourself an opinion on the game before your buy it.","January 23, 2015","true","111.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ten Outta Ten.\n\nIt is still quite new but offers quite a lot. It is an action survival MMO with resource gathering, monster farming, and player interaction. I feel PVP offers a lot more in this game as it adds a benefit to working with others and a concern when approaching an unfamiliar face. When you die you drop most of your items (can be reduced later) but they are unable to be looted for a whole hour (which can be extended, later) so this means you won't lose all of your work when you die and will have a good chance to regain it. Additionally, the crafting recipes you learn are bound to your character.\n\nAfter 16 hours I have not experienced any game breaking bugs and have suffered only 1 game freeze that decided to eat through 180 assault rifle bullets... I'm sure SAO had its bugs early on. :}","January 26, 2015","true","286.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And finally a game with a working server browser.... well. You spawn in a Random generated world? i believe. You start farming down trees,  gems and some kind of stones. Then you start building your first base made out of wood. You place down your factory, armory and tech thingy. Then the fun begins. You start exploring the world. After a while you notice those big Metal round things like Domes. You enter one.. What you see, A lot of enemys. After a while in that building you have slain some enemys and then all of sudden, A giant walks arround the corner, You start running for your life. Then...you die...:D no actually...you jut need the right LVL and the right weapons. This game is my favorite game now 8/10.... "Only 8/10?" yes..only 8/10..because This needs much more weapons and vehicles :D like.. a jet or a helicopter thingy..or hoverbike. Or random events like a horde trying to mow down your house.

This is EARLY early access, but the game has a ton of content already.  It's farming oriented and takes time, but once you learn the mechanics you will really get into it.\n\nPROS\nEasy "party" system\ncrafting is simplified but expansive\nGraphics are great\nActive devs to bring the fixes on\nContent arriving soon!\nCombat system is great (some cons to it)\nNo caveman weiners\nCreate your own server\nJETPACKS\nGreat Coop, PVE, and PVP\nNot everyone is out to kill you.  Compared to other similar games, most won't slaughter a newly spawned person.\n\nCONS\nGrindy, some may not like it\nThe spotty lag.  They are actively addressing the problem, but it still exists.\nCombat mechanics are there, but hit boxes tend to be off at times.  Probably lag related.\nWorld generation.  One server had an awesome second island.  A different had an overly large second island with hardly any ore nodes.  Needs balancing.\n\nCOMMENTS\nBlueprint drops are great and make sense, but could use some balance tweeking.  I was stuck with the rotten wooden club until level 10!  However, ice weapon blueprints from ice mobs, poison from poison, etc.  Spot on.\nFirearms are somewhat terrible right now.  Only ones worth anything are shotguns.  Pistols and ARs could use some boosting to make it worth the resources.\nI will be following this game very closely.

The wiki and forums are a bit lacking in help for topics that aren't spread to basically everyone, so solving issues can take you on quite the journey. Also, I don't think the devs have posted in the forums recently since they announced the big update (as seen on store page), so getting help from them would be unlikely.\n\nI give the game a 8/10.

It is a bit hard to learn. There is not really much usefull explenations on their wiki. Wich is really needed for new players. Though it is easy to learn how the game works. You can jump, run, dance, hit etc. That is the easy part. You gather wood and start to build. It is a really easy process to build the first stuff. You then have a house with a door, some rooms and some windows. What now? Most pepole would not know what to do then. Basicly you kill monsters to get blueprints, (they drop) you find dungeons with a decent level for you. Kill, get loot and blueprints for new stuff.\nThe way you should play the game is that you make a gun and combat knife from the amory. Maybe even some armor if you want to. Then find monsters and kill them. Gather lots of stuff. Even get some of the nice blueprints, like storage box, forcefield door, generator, you would also like to have something so that youre base wont decay.\n\nBasicly there is alot to the game. You learn something new all the time. It's a really big game and there is so much stuff to explore and get.\n\nI def. recommend this game. The game is still in alpha, so keep that in mind!\nThis is a survival ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. But the mmo is actually good, so it does not really get too boring, and does not really take long to level up!\n\nHope someone could use this review!\nPeace!","November 22, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the game I've been waiting for. Sure, it is in early access, but that is not a reason not to support the developers, they are very active and they do provide when demanded to do a hotfix. Trust me , I've tried a great deal of early access games and most of them were ♥♥♥♥, sure some were good , but this one, takes the trophy for the best early access game ever. I've spent hours in the game, having fun, killing monsters, building, exploring. It is indeed a little bit grindy, and TRUST ME when I'm telling you, I absolutely despise grinding, but I actually had fun killing the same things in this game, maybe it is because I finished it for the first time and didn't have any spoilers , but needless to say, I had fun grinding. The building system is pretty shabby now, but they said they are working on it, and they recently uptaded it so it is all good. For Christ's sake guys, the game has a MIB 3 like vehicle, a jetpack, they promised a hover bike/hover board, a plasma shield. Simply amazing. The game is pretty laggy because it is still in early access but I have high hopes for the optimization, it is running on Unreal Engine after all. Buy this game guys, you will sink 20 to 30 hours in it and you will finish it eventually but then you will be so eager for the next BIG UPDATE, or you can just do like me and wait maybe 3-4 months so you can log in and find A LOT of new stuff ingame. Please people, keep this game alive, it deserves a lot more hype than it got so far.","April 30, 2015","true","33.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the came kept showing up in the games you might like section and i somehow really loved the visuals so i bought it.\n\nI have played it for 25 hrs. and it´s been 25 hours of grinding, exploring, building and looting and loving it. Sure there are bugs it´s early access so of course there are bugs, but it´s really playable and really enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics were what first drew me to the game, and they are bright colorfull and the animations for the main character are wonderfull, i cannot help but greeting back every time one of the NPCs greet me or do some dance moves to the backdrop of a rising moon. The wildlife in the game is not that varied, but i´m sure that will change over time, the day/night cycle suits the game, and different creatures come out at night and they are usually tougher and more aggressive. The different planets could look more different though,  for now it seems the only thing different is the colors used and some of the plant life.\n\nThe base building is really easy and really inituative and you can make some empressive looking structures, I hope that there in time wil be more ways to make your building stand out though, but again early access. Crafting is fun, you earn blueprints by killing creatures, and different creatures drop different building materials, these you have to combine with refined forms of wood, fossile, gem or ore. Crafted my first armor of refined wood, the ugliest looking armor i´ve ever seen, the helmet being a hollowed out piece of log, with holes cut out for eyes and mouth there´s even a little branche sticking out, love it, really funny stuff.\n\nThe bad is the way servers work right now, it really is difficult making your own server since you have to mess around with text files and the command interface, you of course can use one of the many servers allready being there, but twice i experienced these servers gotten closed down, and all my progress lost(I really miss my monocycle.. sigh!!) So i promised myself not to play the game until these things get fixed and making your own server gets easier. But if you do not mind that I really give GRAV the thumbs up, and it seems the company behind it works hard to implement new features and best of all, they seem to listen to the ones playing the game.\n\nFor my self i can only say, i´ll be back and if the publishers keeps it up, This really will be a great game.\n","February 17, 2015","true","158.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a bit hard to learn. There is not really much usefull explenations on their wiki. Wich is really needed for new players. Though it is easy to learn how the game works. You can jump, run, dance, hit etc. That is the easy part. You gather wood and start to build. It is a really easy process to build the first stuff. You then have a house with a door, some rooms and some windows. What now? Most pepole would not know what to do then. Basicly you kill monsters to get blueprints, (they drop) you find dungeons with a decent level for you. Kill, get loot and blueprints for new stuff.\nThe way you should play the game is that you make a gun and combat knife from the amory. Maybe even some armor if you want to. Then find monsters and kill them. Gather lots of stuff. Even get some of the nice blueprints, like storage box, forcefield door, generator, you would also like to have something so that youre base wont decay.\n\nBasicly there is alot to the game. You learn something new all the time. It's a really big game and there is so much stuff to explore and get.\n\nI def. recommend this game.

If you like to shoot a lot or if your very good at dodging and like to use sword and just go ham then you'll like this game. When it comes to shooting I think the enemys could possibly have a longer sight when getting shot from a distance, maybe even code it in so that when damaged by you they come at you instead of just standing there till you get close enough but I guess that is combated with no xp if you to far away.\n\nStill I've been having lots of fun with game so much so that I created my own public unoffical PvE server. (Might change to PvP in future but currently just want my server as a noob friendly get used to the game type of thing)\nLast little thing I'm going to say about action is that everything you kill has a chance to drop blueprints which as you guessed is used to do all the crafting. Not going to be going into great detail about it since I want to to figure most out yourself.\n\nCrafting: I like it, go around the world collecting resources and use them to craft most if not everything in the game if you've of course have found the blueprint for it.\n\nBuilding: kinda reminds me of old rust but with its own twist. Kinda have to play around with the rooms and figure out how to build your floor plan. If you don't know what your doing could get complicated if you are trying to build something big with lots of halls and seperate rooms (I could just be a noob though :D )\n\nCons: So far have run into bugs bugs bugs but this is Early Access so what ya expect? :P\n\nNot going to spoil anything else, just buy the game already and join my server! <3\n\nSteamServerList: grav.gamingpastmidnight.com:27059      (Will be changing in the future)\n\nGame Press Tab: open grav.gamingpastmidnight.com:7825\n\nIf you can't connect to server please contact: http://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnightDusk/\nSo he can get it in working order again!\nOne of the current Grav server bugs is causing it to crash. This will be fixed in the future(I hope)\n\nServer is currently only a 20 Slot and PvE with Vanilla settings.\nNoob friendly will answer any questions if online and around.","December 3, 2015","true","170.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks great, is pretty easy to get into, will take a long time to max out and doesn't require zombies to keep you challenged and entertained.  You can play on your own world, or do multiplayer with either PVE (Player Vs Environment) where you can't kill other players (but you can steal some of their stuff), or PVP (Player vs Player) where you have to build up defenses to stay alive.\n\nIt's Early Release, so needs some polishing (yet does not have a Beta feel to it). The developers do regular updates (sometimes even a bit too often for my taste) and listen to requests from the player community.\n\nAll in all well worth the cost (even if I hadn't gotten it while on sale) :)","November 25, 2015","true","629.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the came kept showing up in the games you might like section and i somehow really loved the visuals so i bought it.\n\nI have played it for 25 hrs. and it´s been 25 hours of grinding, exploring, building and looting and loving it. Sure there are bugs it´s early access so of course there are bugs, but it´s really playable and really enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics were what first drew me to the game, and they are bright colorfull and the animations for the main character are wonderfull, i cannot help but greeting back every time one of the NPCs greet me or do some dance moves to the backdrop of a rising moon. The wildlife in the game is not that varied, but i´m sure that will change over time, the day/night cycle suits the game, and different creatures come out at night and they are usually tougher and more aggressive. The different planets could look more different though,  for now it seems the only thing different is the colors used and some of the plant life.\n\nThe base building is really easy and really inituative and you can make some empressive looking structures, I hope that there in time wil be more ways to make your building stand out though, but again early access. Crafting is fun, you earn blueprints by killing creatures, and different creatures drop different building materials, these you have to combine with refined forms of wood, fossile, gem or ore. Crafted my first armor of refined wood, the ugliest looking armor i´ve ever seen, the helmet being a hollowed out piece of log, with holes cut out for eyes and mouth there´s even a little branche sticking out, love it, really funny stuff.\n\nThe bad is the way servers work right now, it really is difficult making your own server since you have to mess around with text files and the command interface, you of course can use one of the many servers allready being there, but twice i experienced these servers gotten closed down, and all my progress lost(I really miss my monocycle.. sigh!!) So i promised myself not to play the game until these things get fixed and making your own server gets easier. But if you do not mind that I really give GRAV the thumbs up, and it seems the company behind it works hard to implement new features and best of all, they seem to listen to the ones playing the game.\n\nFor my self i can only say, i´ll be back and if the publishers keeps it up, This really will be a great game.\n","February 17, 2015","true","158.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have purchased many, many early access games and have always hoped that the game would get better.\n\nCurrently, there is a ton of content and things to do.   The game has been out for 6 days now, and it has had  patches, so the developers are working very diligently to fix some of the things that are causing grief (mostly lag and performance related).\n\nWe play on a teamspeak and have other people on our server as well.   There is a component that you can play solo, or with other players.   The dynamic landscape is amazing and great to go adventuring.\n\nWe have had multiple conversations about this game, and all of us agree that it feels like the developers are actually gamers too.\n\nI am always hesitant to get ea games, but I am more than happy that I bought this game.

They pull you in with promises and silly gimmicks, and rarely deliver, or do it quite badly. I think my playtime will tell you that GRAV did not disappoint me.\n\nGrav impressed me from the very beginning. I picked this game up on sale for $14, thinking it'd be a decent time. After playing for about an hour on solo play, I realized that I was having a great time! The PvE combat is intuitive, the crafting system (while slightly unbalanced at high-level - those damn artifacts will be the end of me) is very versatile, and getting resources is actually kind of fun! You can run about the overworld trying to find what you want, or you can go into Caves, which is the best way to both gain resources and level up.\n\nThe game itself is gorgeous. The sky turns a brilliant yellow/orange as the sun rises, it has countless, beautiful stars in it at night. While slightly buggy because of the REBORN update, the gentle slopes and steep cliffs combined with pseudorandom placement of trees and such is reminiscent of a real place, and you get sucked in. Waterfalls, rivers and grand vistas from mountains capture your eyes and give them a true feast when playing. This is not to even mention how uncannily well they did when you go to a moon or another planet - each is beautiful in its own right.\n\nFollowing the REBORN update, there was a server wipe. Even though everyone had lost their progress, it was okay. Bitmonster has done everything they can to prevent this, and only did it this time because REBORN feels like/is an entirely new game, even better than before.\n\nWhat makes it different from other survival games?\n\nTanks, different planets, specialized classes that can upgrade certain aspects of your character, jets, actually claiming territories, and the game is an absolute blast when playing with your friends.\n\nAs a note here, I just wanted to also say how EASY it is to set up your own personal server for your friends. You just make an .exe, make sure you have a password, port forward the game and voila; you have a universe for just those that you want.\n\nOn top of this, Bitmonster has an excellent staff. I commented on the forums here on steam with a problem with creating a server, and within just a couple of hours one of the staff had responded with a fix to my problem! Their service, on top of production, is something rarely seen nowadays. These guys really care about making a damn good game.\n\nGet GRAV.","November 15, 2015","true","50.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Definitely worth $20, but it's stupid to not pick it up for anything less than that.

They pull you in with promises and silly gimmicks, and rarely deliver, or do it quite badly. I think my playtime will tell you that GRAV did not disappoint me.\n\nGrav impressed me from the very beginning. I picked this game up on sale for $14, thinking it'd be a decent time. After playing for about an hour on solo play, I realized that I was having a great time! The PvE combat is intuitive, the crafting system (while slightly unbalanced at high-level - those damn artifacts will be the end of me) is very versatile, and getting resources is actually kind of fun! You can run about the overworld trying to find what you want, or you can go into Caves, which is the best way to both gain resources and level up.\n\nThe game itself is gorgeous. The sky turns a brilliant yellow/orange as the sun rises, it has countless, beautiful stars in it at night. While slightly buggy because of the REBORN update, the gentle slopes and steep cliffs combined with pseudorandom placement of trees and such is reminiscent of a real place, and you get sucked in. Waterfalls, rivers and grand vistas from mountains capture your eyes and give them a true feast when playing. This is not to even mention how uncannily well they did when you go to a moon or another planet - each is beautiful in its own right.\n\nFollowing the REBORN update, there was a server wipe. Even though everyone had lost their progress, it was okay. Bitmonster has done everything they can to prevent this, and only did it this time because REBORN feels like/is an entirely new game, even better than before.\n\nWhat makes it different from other survival games?\n\nTanks, different planets, specialized classes that can upgrade certain aspects of your character, jets, actually claiming territories, and the game is an absolute blast when playing with your friends.\n\nAs a note here, I just wanted to also say how EASY it is to set up your own personal server for your friends. You just make an .exe, make sure you have a password, port forward the game and voila; you have a universe for just those that you want.\n\nOn top of this, Bitmonster has an excellent staff. I commented on the forums here on steam with a problem with creating a server, and within just a couple of hours one of the staff had responded with a fix to my problem! Their service, on top of production, is something rarely seen nowadays. These guys really care about making a damn good game.\n\nGet GRAV.","November 15, 2015","true","50.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gameplay is heavily focused on gathering resources, which gets tedious after a few hours. It is little bit mixed with MMORPG like dungeons filled with rich crafting materials and with minibosses. The crafting system is not half bad as well, I was just missing something that would make me wanna play more to reach new dungeons, crafting items or anything, but that might be just my problem. It lacks something unique. This is more neutral than any other recommendation.","May 5","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not saying it's the perfect game, but if you like:\n\n- Space / Alien based games\n- Open world exploration\n- Crafting your own Items / Gear\n- Fighting Giant Alien Monster to get resources\n\nthen this may just be the game for you. Think of Grav as a mix between Minecraft and Halo. The gamepley itself is crafting tools and weapons in a world where countless monsters want to beat the crap out of you. The game specs are like Halo - Furturistic, Aliens, Guns, Spaceships, etc. The actual grapics also look like thery were inspired by the Halo franchise.\n\nCON: This is early access, and I don't have the best proccesor in the world, but the actual gameplay was incredibly laggy. I had trouble launching it half the time. When I tried opening a Solo World, the program became unresponsive and I had to open Task Manager to end it. Multiplayer was out of the question. I was kindly provided a heads up that connecting to a multiplayer server would take a "few" minutes. But as with the singleplayer sworld, the program became unresponsive, and I had to shutdown my PC. If you're curious as to what specs you will need to smoothly run the game, I would reccomend anything better than what I have- At least 8 GB of Ram and 3 ghz.","November 15, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Doesn't hog memory or cpu (4gb of ram pre-memory leak patch and 20% cpu day one)\n\nPros:\n-Cheap\n-Many features.\n-Stable.\n-BLOOMY graphics.\n-Good sound engineering.\n-Death penalty is perfect, you lose a percentage of items, which you can pick back up, way better than other games.\n-Most people are friendly, the 'hello' and 'high five' feature get spammed a lot with shockingly low pvp, and many people working together, not sure why, it might be that there isn't full loot drop pvp.\n\nCons:\n-Player structures are too fragile, one person can take out an entire player base in minutes with the starter knife.\n-Server list type game.. For me I rather mmos with huge playerbases, the player cap per server seems to be 64, and for me that is a thousand times too low, this game has the potential for all the worlds to be connected with the Stargate network, so why break it up so much? Very dissapointed when I discovered that.\n\nConclusion, awesome game, some people have trouble getting the game to work right, which is a shame, but its early days, and I pour one out for them, but have seen zero sign of those problems.\nI'm sure some people will even find my "cons" to be "pros", each to their own..

The main time I have seen it is posting too many powered lights around our base.\n\n-Lush worlds, and constantly changing cycle of moons and varyng categories of planets to travel to via Stargates.\n\n-Good variety of class types with different skill sets, making the unlock of new skills and blueprints an interesting progression\n\n-Character and monster designs and  animations are good, and dancing is always a blast.\n\n-Fun mellow soundtrack, and though more tracks are always welcome, the current set of songs is easily loopable for hours.\n\nMixed\n------------\n-Variety of monsters is sparse currently, likely you'll have seen one variation of each by level 10.. There is varying classes and sizes of monsters, all with different abilities and traits though which is good. Hoping we see more types later on.\n\n-Water areas are currently pointless, and lack a change of gravity, monsters, just any purpose. Still better than prior instant death that can still be found in oceans on moons.\n\nNegatives\n------------\n-Wood resources are worst grind after establishing a base. Maybe lowering requirements on generators or having trees produce more wood.\n\n-Female models are still not in the game. Play with wife, and models were shown and said to be coming with last server wipe.\n\n-As far as I understand all game operations are optimized, so there's almost no options for fine tuning the video or audio experiences.\n\nEnding thoughts\n-----------------\nI jumped into Grav with no guidance and the game told me all I needed to know along the way, and I felt like I was still being surprised by new things 30 hours in.\n\nA good majority of retail games dole out a 6 hour experience at a full $60. Grav has also been on multiple gaming sites sale rosters, and I actually got mine on a sale on Humble Bundle dirt cheap, and I often tell friends it's the most game for my money I've ever got. I got my wife a copy as well, and I know she agrees.\n\nThe game is somehow heartwarming, and soothing to play. I've gotten lost in it for hours at a time, and it's a great multiplayer experience especially if you bring friends to the party. Obviously it has some kinks to get out, and could use a smidge more content to be excelsior. But hey, you can drop logs for people to walk through, and dance as stupid as possible with friends by a nice camp fire.","February 24","true","98.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Discovering the new creatures and blueprints was so fun I got lost in this world...For the first 10 hours. During those 10 hours I had much fun discovering new things and setting goals for myself. The classes were an effort to extend the life of this game. Now, I haven't tried the multiplayer first because of the many reviews about the hackers and second because I have no friends who play this game. This is a singleplayer review.  One of the goals I set for myself was to go to the moon. I spent time getting the resources for the portal (and I was a little disappointed it was a portal and not a ship, but it'll do) I made it there and I was sad to discover it was severely underwhelming. There were a couple of new creatures, but it was tedious getting oxygen and it was outright boring for me. Overall, this game was about a 7/10 for me. The pros and cons are below.\n\nPros\n\n-Beautiful graphics\n\n-Good tutorial\n\n-Flying is fun\n\n-Great exploration\n\nCons\n\n-Gets VERY grindy\n\n-Combat was sometimes tedious and annoying (finding glitch tactics to kill some creatures which were very overpowered)\n\n-Not much to do after you built a base and went to the other planets, many can lose interest fast\n\n-Blueprints can be a nightmare to get because of the randomness","May 11","true","15.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Impossible not to reccomend at that price despite some issues below:\n\nPros:\n- Big worlds to explore\n- Solid and pretty graphics - performs well.\n- many hours of gameplay.\n- Great fun with friends. (You will need them, because even on PVE servers people are just horrible).\n\nCons:\n- Grindy. You spend a lot (I mean A LOT) of time mining wood, ore and gems. Too much in fact, prob 70% of time is spent mining.\n\n- No story arc. Would be nice. You sometimes wonder why you are here.\n\n- No LAN coop/ multi. Sometimes you don't want to play with strangers.\n\n-  Looting, death and protecting your hard work. This is the biggest issue in the game for me. Let me explain: When you die away from your uplink/save point, roughly 80% (estimating that number) of everything in your inventory stays where you die in an orb which can be looted by anyone. So 9 times out of 10 on a multi server you will lose all your hard work over and over. That's on a PVE (peaceful server)!! It's infuriating. It turns out that people on the public servers are greedy pigs who will take your stuff without question. IMHO The game should allow you 10 mins to get back to your stuff at least. Next, protecting your hard work. Build a base (which requires hours and hours of mining), come back later from a mission and half of it will be missing and your chests (where you put stuff to to stop death looters) will have been destroyed. Yes, locking a chest does not mean it can't be blown up. The same goes for harvesters (which you cannot protect at all) Why do people do this? It gives them ore,gems, wood etc. The balance between how hard it is to build stuff and how easy it is for other people to wreck it is completely off. It's not all bad, because you can eventually put shields around your base which stop others stealing, BUT shields also need generators which need fuel which can run out.\n\nLong story short, if you dont want people knicking your stuff, you will need to mine and play for about 10 hours just to be in a position to lock a chest from looters. Oh and don't die doing it or you will lose all the stuff you need to lock your chest..\n(FIXED on update 19/11/15. Game much better now.)\n\nMinor quibbles: Caves are all flat (you don't ever go down!) and fairly repetitive.\n\nExploration: Sadly the most fun thing to do is quite hard. Would be much better if you could jump to multiple uplinks (save points) earlier in the game. You can only have one active at present and will need to spend 20+ hours to get the teleportation room.\n\nSummary: Good fun overall. Lots of potential. Community are all horrible thieves with no respect. 7/10","November 14, 2015","true","83.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While it looks decent, and has acceptable combat mechanics the poor performance and the glitchy gameplay makes it barely playable. Progression is lackluster, there are classes, but they do not give enough variation. Blueprints can be found by defeating mobs, but just like leveling it is too slow and gets grindy right from the beginning. I died on moon with around 2000 of many of the resources and I got only 200 back when I got revived. I could not even find my backpack, neither the backpack summon stim worked. Hours worth of grind wasted mostly because of bugs and performance problems. As the game got bundled recently and updates are pretty much died out for a few months now, it seems like GRAV is going to be another failed early access title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/portalshifter/recommended/332500/","portalshifter","PortalShifter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/portalshifter/","524 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGameplay: 9\nGraphics: 9\nSound: 8\nTOTAL SCORE: 8.6\nHOURS PLAYED: 150\n\nGAMEPLAY - GRAV is an open world survival crafting Action-RPG game that feels like an MMO, but plays more like 3d Diablo with guns. The world is an open map with underground dungeons. The whole map is accessible to anyone on the server: no areas are "instanced" as you would find in traditional MMO. You start on a homeworld, then you can craft stargates for space travel to moons or higher level planets.\n\nThere are RPG style classes called "Jobs" that you level up and then unlock abilities. Each job has different abilities, but the class progression isn't totally central to progress, your crafting is more important. Crafting is fun and requires building different supply stations that you use to manipulate the raw materials you find dropping from enemies or loot crates. Base building is well developed and currently you can build a few dozens options for room types and powered items such as gun turrets, forcefields, stargates and teleporter pads.\n\nCombat is enjoyable but does get repetitive, much like any ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. However, the freedom of movement you have is superior to most MMOs, with equipment to double jump, glide from any height with wingsuit, or jetpack up to the sky. Melee weapon swords and ranged guns like assault rifle, pistol, shotgun are all options. There is an elemental system similar to what you've seen for damage types in other games. Personally I find PVE more enjoyable than PVP in this game, but you have option for both.\n\nGRAPHICS - GRAV is a beautiful game to look at! Amazing skyboxes, you feel like you're walking around in one of those cool 80's airbrushed sci-fi paintings. Each planet is very different visually. You'll see everything from purple grass and yellow trees, to blue grass and red trees, to huge rock formations floating in midair, and bizarre desert landscapes covered in spiraling tendrils. Probably the best alien landscapes of any game I've played. All armor sets display visually on your character as well as the elemental weapon types, so there's plenty of visual customization.\n\nSOUND - GRAV loses a point for weak sound effects. The gun shooting sounds are solid, but the enemy alien sounds could be a lot better, as well as the volume balancing between sound effects and the music. However, while the sound effects are generally weak, the game soundtrack is absolutely fantastic! This is one of my favorite video game soundtracks, kinda futuristic downtempo, great for space exploration.\n\nOVERALL - GRAV is one of the most solid Early Access titles out there right now, and I highly recommend if you enjoy MMORPGs or action-rpgs or sci-fi themed games.","June 12, 2015","true","185.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This game has such a potential.\nHowever if your one of those that buy a game and just ignore the lable "early access", kinda like a person that ignore tha manual of how to install a fridge and then complain it broke after a week.

Ofcourse i encounter bugs here and there thats rather annyoing but i wasent expecting a finished game, since it is not a finished game.\nIve got some ideas for the devs, but i havent got around to share my thoughts yet.\nBut for example i would suggest that instead of forcing you off a planet when it´s rotating out of orbit you have to choose, to stay there and be stuck there for 6 hours or return back to homeplanet and go to an other planet thats entering the orbit instead.\nA more sane mob spawning system inside dungeons, it´s annyoing to have mobs spawn right behind you after you have cleared that area... but sure, this makes the dungons alot harder.\n\nAnyway, it´s an awsome game and i cant wait to see more!","March 28","true","386.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Which is fine for singleplayer, could use a solid story, some worldbuilding and some lore. Filled my cup of tea anyway.\n\nHowever, go to multiplayer and it's a different picture, with pros and cons. It's still fun, still great, now with neighbors to get along and trade with. In PvE, your bases are generally safe. In PvP, not really. Back on PvE though, you'll still hit that end game. Once you do, you might quit. My bases have multiplayer-deteriorated by now, so I have even less interest in coming back.\n\nGameplay aside, there were still technical issues as of late 2015. It was poorly optimized for a game made with the Unreal Engine. The UI has room for improvement, but it's not utterly atrocious either.\n\nAll in all, I'm voting "Maybe" on this one.

Unique, but weird.  You can dance around a fire to regain stamina.  Or you can eat food.  That is the extent of the "survival" elements in this game.  You won't freeze to death.  You won't die of thirst.  You don't get exhaustion and need to sleep.  I'm not even sure if you can actually starve...you just lose your stamina and then cannot perform actions.\n\nYou can build a base, but it is extremely limited in what you can do.  But there are lots of resources you can collect to build with.\n\nOh...I meant grind for, not collect.  This game is much more MMO than Survival, except it is barely multiplayer as the servers are mostly empty.  You will your time grinding mobs for loot and going through dungeons for materials to craft your tier 1 gear so you can get more materials and loot to craft the tier 2 gear so you can go get the tier 3 gear you get where I am going with this hopefully.\n\nSadly, that is also the only place this game is fun.  After a couple hours it is strangely satisfying smashing the exact same model of turtles, frogs, and birds over and over again.  And that is what has to appeal to you, because otherwise there isn't really a game here.\n\nYou have multiple jobs and also an overall rank, which is a sum of all your job levels.  But your damage scales directly with the active job you have at the time.  Which seems terrible, because unless you are really off the ball, a higher level will always kill a low level in that case.","November 16, 2015","false","22.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It only piqued my interest, because it was compared to No Man's Sky. Since NMS is not out yet, I can't really comment on that, but what I'm looking for in those types of games is a sense of wonder & discovery, freedom of exploration and a really good illusion of a living, breathing world. GRAV exhibits none of those things. You're basically greeted with limitations and what awaits you is a long and painfully exhausting grind just to make the experience bearable.\n\nGRAV features slow movement, fast rate of fatigue/hunger, ultra fast day/night cycle (and the night is annoyingly & overly dark, thus barely playable), awful uncustomizable avatar, animations with too few frames, which makes every action & combat look twitchy/jerky. The virtual world is flat & boring, also feels gamey - sprinkled with repeated objects & mobs of even lower variety dropped randomly here and there, moving awkwardly in small radius. It lacks a lot of basic game & UI functions. It's littered with tiny issues, that may feel insignificant and be easily dismissed each on they own, but combined together they just overwhelmed me and successfully killed any sense of wonder and the will to proceed.","November 15, 2015","false","0.9"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","27","53","0","0"

The Dev team is highly active and updates roll out constantly.\nThe community is alive and it is just down right fun.\n\nPros:\n1. One of the best soundtracks I have heard ...and I work in the game industry.\n2. AMAZING graphics..it is just downright pretty!\n3. Procedurally generated, random worlds - yes, world**s**, each server is different.\n4. Fun, easy to get into but hard to master.\n5. Awesome crafting system.\n\nCons:\n1. It isn't done yet...damnit.\n2. Can get a little bit grindy.\n3. Glitches and bugs..it IS AN ALPHA.\n\nAs long as you're not expecting a perfectly polished, AAA game = this is about as good as an early ALPHA Indie game gets, and the Dev team is only like, 6 guys?

Some features are not yet in the game.\n\nThis game even though in very early access is a thrill to play. The open world procedural generation means that you can go out for as long as you like and explore. The graphics are beautiful, if cpu and ram intensive. I however only have 6 GB of RAM and I am able to run the game through some tweaking of the config files. This then allowed me to play the game. The loading screens take a long time to complete and sometimes may cause the computer to freeze up for a few minutes. However if you let it load and don't try doing anything then it will soon allow you to join the game. Overall the gameplay so far is unique and interesting, the game takes aspects from multiple different games including minecraft, space engineers and multiple other well known games. As more features are added in the future i'm sure we will see the game grow nad evolve.\n\nEach day a new patch is released for the game meaning new features are added and the game is upgraded. The team work around the clock to make the game the best it can be for the communtiy. This is also the reason they state that they have released the game as early access after only 5 months in development so as you can imagine there are multiple bugs and high levels of lag along with a unusual GUI and menu system that takes a little getting used to. Overall the enemies progress in strenght as you explore and the use of caves and dungeons means there is always somewhere to explore. The PVP adds in an extra amount of danger to the world you spawn in and allows you to form friendships and enemies. The advancment of technology and research in the game is interesting and flowing. Blueprints can be collected from enemies to help you build more complex machines and become more powerfull. The addition of sci-fi technology such as shields and automated farms means you feel like a futuristic planet explorer.\n\nA few negatives of the game in it's current state are as I have previously mentioned the lag and amount of CPU/Ram usage. It does require a beefy computer to play at this current point, however fiddeling with the configs does allow you to unlock a massive amount of fps for the game. A second negative is the single player set up as to do this you need to create a dedicated server which takes up even more RAM. Unlike minecraft there isnt a single button you press to get it working, however there is a guide on their wiki on setting up a server. Apart from these few problesm and glitches such as going through rocks, everyhting else is tip top and the creators are very caring of the community.\n\nOverall review scores:\n\nGraphics\n\n+ beautiful design\n+ vibrant colours\n+ awe inspiring sights\n- very cpu and ram intensive\n\n9/10\n\ngameplay\n\n+ intriguing system of technology\n+ increasing level of enemies\n+ proceduraly generated enviroments\n- fallign through rocks and glitches\n- not much variety of things to do (will most likely change in the near future)\n\n8/10\n\nmultiplayer\n\n+ good use of PVE and PVP\n+ co-op gameplay\n+ DANCING TO REGAIN HEALTH\n- difficult to play single player so multiplayer is the only real way\n\n9/10\n\noverall total\n\nA brilliant game with much promise for the future.\n\n92/100","January 15, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whether you want to bust a move or settle down next to a rock that looks like an ♥♥♥ you can do it all! Servers tend to lag a little bit too much and not being able to save your character kind of sucks as well, you'd have to put in a couple of hours to get anywhere in the game and then you lose it all when you leave. I'm sure they're going to fix that, it's only early access anyway! The trailer sold it for me where you can work with your friends and fight off the creatures and other players.

The Scifi setting is refreshing  and so are the gadgets you can build - wing suit, jetpack, doom buggy. It's highly satisfying gliding around the map quickly with the wingsuit.\n\nGRAV Reborn runs a lot better than a lot of the early access titles out there and the visuals are great especially the lighting, which can likely be attributed to the unreal engine.\n\nThe game is lacking any kind of real threat, the mobs are quite simple and feel a bit like stock assets. Purely as PVE it might get boring quickly unless you are a big fan of base building, which I did enjoy more in GRAV than in other titles.\n\nThe PVP is fun, full loot, large variety of weapons and breaking into bases that haven't been properly secured, or have had their generators run out of fuel, means you can rob them blind.\n\nDid I mention you can hit P to take a dump?

The game play is what I would consider to be a masterpiece in the making.  So why is it a game like this, even on a free weekend, cannot manage to get even a third of their main servers full, of which there are few?  Simple, implementation.\n\nThis game is mind-blowingly behind in terms of basic functionality. ANY game I can think of at least has the following:\n1) Graphics settings beyond toggle on/offs.\n2) Sensitivity options as part of the GUI.  That's right, you need a console command to change your mouse sensitivity, sound levels, etc.\n3) Local/LAN/small group play.  You can play solo, but the content differs to an extent.  For the most part you get the same stuff, but the 'backbone' of the game Element X is 10 (hurrr) times (hurrr) worse than on a multiplayer server.  So this might as well not exist beyond the first couple days. Which is why the rest of the points are so damn important.\n4) Server Hosting.  While this game has it, it is absolutely horrible.  Most hosting companies won't even touch this game.  They operate each planet on a separate server.  So if you want to host a server, you might end up eating 10GB+ and having seven different commands prompts.  As mentioned, even if you manage to get that far, which my doctorate and 15 years hosting experience barely accomplished, you will spend days figuring out how to tweak the server to your liking.\n5) GUI support for passwords.  Yes, if your server is password protected, people cannot click it and type in the password.  They have to go into console and type in a syntaxed command.  Most players won't ever figure this out or bother unless someone copypasta's it for them.\n6) This list could go on, but the point is... playing with friends, playing how you want, altering graphics and basic configuration options are such a pain that it makes this a research simulator.  Which would be viable, if everyone hadn't given up trying to figure it out already and all the research is from January.  As mentioned below, Reborn is out so all that is irrelevant now.\n\nThis free weekend was probably Grav's last real chance.  It just ruined its reputation.  When you can't give a game away, which is of such outstanding quality (really it is, the game play is FANTASTIC), you've really screwed up.\n\nTL;DR: Grav is spectacular, but all that potential is being wasted because the developers have failed to implement even the most basic ease-of-use functionality into the GUI and into the game.","November 15, 2015","false","95.4"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","8"

I must say that Grav became much better after reborn patch, so i hope the devs will keep working on it and we'll see much more improvements in the future.\nAnyway, for an Early Acess project, game is really playable and very addictive. You just have to know that there are no NPC quests, no story line etc, it's more like sandbox experience. So if you are looking for the game where you can save the world by killing rats and collecting their tails, Grav is not the right one :)\n\nYou can play Grav offline in single mod, or online on one of many servers. At this moment, it's really hard for new players to start on PvP server (every server is kinda PvP except the ones labeled as PvE), because of high population and actual ruleset which is kinda newbie-unfriendly. If you just want to relax after hard day at work, and you want to explore planets, kill creatures and build your base, i'd really suggest to join one of PvE servers, which are much more friendly to new players.\n\nI really like Grav skill system where you can level up every single job (atm 7 jobs, 60 levels each) you wish and upgraded passive skills remains active, you can even use active "uber skills" you have learned from other jobs. You can only craft some items with particular job / level, so there is always some kind of motivation to level up another job. Of course, there is a lot of grind, we all would like to see more different types of creatures, i'd like to see some events in the future (even something like "Chosen attack" in Firefall would bring more life to servers imo), but overall i really enjoyed every single minute i spent in Grav, so i have to recommend it and i hope it will be only better :)","December 1, 2015","true","189.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've read the reviews, and that was certainly the reason why i didn't buy the game. The recent "Grav: Reborn" update was a major improvement to the game and people reacted very positive, and i started considering the game again. This free weekend was perfect for letting my try the game.\n\nI downloaded, and started playing. The game is beautiful, noting about that. Then its just about crafting a base, exploring the huge planet, and then exploring the moon, or any of the oner 7(i think) homeplanets. There is really alot to do, and GRAV doesn't feel grindy at all. Building a decent base only takes 15 minutes or so.\n\nI LOVE the game so far, the only issues I've had is with the RAM running out (i have 8gb, should be doing fine), but it's a EA game, right? :)","November 15, 2015","true","26.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great gameplay, great potential.\n\nA lot of reviews after the free weekend are negative, understandably as the servers weren't totally prepared for such a large influx of players - and some lag issues were present.\n\nPeople have been complaining about lack of basic features (i.e. brightness, some video options, sensitivity options) etc. That's fine, but please bear in mind this game is in ALPHA right now. Not even beta.\n\nHomeworld is small? Is it really a planet? It's not huge, sure, however it's far bigger than you think because new players physically can't explore all of it without dying. The low-level and above exo-planets however are extremely vast and expansive, and pretty much require a vehicle of some kind to explore the entire thing.\n\nI really highly recommend this game, it's a unique take on the survival genre and while yes you're gonna be gathering a lot - there are a LOT of ways to speed this up once you pass about level...10 or 15, so pretty early on in. They're also extremely cheap ways, and pay for themselves very quickly.\n\nAll of the bad reviews of this game that have come out in the past two or so days will be incredibly helpful for the devs, who released a MAJOR update to this game less than three weeks ago. I look forward to experiencing the next few months.\n\nCreativity: 10/10\nImplementation for this stage of an alpha: 10/10\nAddiction level: 11/10\nSkills at showing off a game for a free weekend: 5/10\n\nTL;DR: Great game, free weekend didn't show all of its nuances and longevity.","November 15, 2015","true","89.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Already in the early access it offers a lot of content and is fun both in pvp and pve. The game runs flawless on my computer with 60fps+ in most locations. Exploring different planets and dungeons are pretty fun and you get alot of loot as you kill mobs which makes you want to grind more and more to find new recpies and to level up. The games also uses a class system that lets you choose what you want to level as.  For example I am a "pilot" which gives me special traits just for my class which is pretty cool. There are pretty many classes to choose from but also there is a crafting system that lets you build bases,cars ,armor ,weapons and more!You will need to craft different type of gear depending on where you are going to travel because some zones and planets can be very hostile towards you if you dont got the correct gear for the place. For example if you want to travel to the moon you will need to craft a set that lets you breath on the moon or you can craft and consumable item which lets you breath on the moon for around 5min.\n\nI do however recommend you to play this with someone as the world can be harsh if you choose to play on pvp server.\n\nOverall the game is fun and you should try it on free weekend which the game is running on atm and then buy it if you like it which i did!","November 14, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've read the reviews, and that was certainly the reason why i didn't buy the game. The recent "Grav: Reborn" update was a major improvement to the game and people reacted very positive, and i started considering the game again. This free weekend was perfect for letting my try the game.\n\nI downloaded, and started playing. The game is beautiful, noting about that. Then its just about crafting a base, exploring the huge planet, and then exploring the moon, or any of the oner 7(i think) homeplanets. There is really alot to do, and GRAV doesn't feel grindy at all. Building a decent base only takes 15 minutes or so.\n\nI LOVE the game so far, the only issues I've had is with the RAM running out (i have 8gb, should be doing fine), but it's a EA game, right? :)","November 15, 2015","true","26.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great gameplay, great potential.\n\nA lot of reviews after the free weekend are negative, understandably as the servers weren't totally prepared for such a large influx of players - and some lag issues were present.\n\nPeople have been complaining about lack of basic features (i.e. brightness, some video options, sensitivity options) etc. That's fine, but please bear in mind this game is in ALPHA right now. Not even beta.\n\nHomeworld is small? Is it really a planet? It's not huge, sure, however it's far bigger than you think because new players physically can't explore all of it without dying. The low-level and above exo-planets however are extremely vast and expansive, and pretty much require a vehicle of some kind to explore the entire thing.\n\nI really highly recommend this game, it's a unique take on the survival genre and while yes you're gonna be gathering a lot - there are a LOT of ways to speed this up once you pass about level...10 or 15, so pretty early on in. They're also extremely cheap ways, and pay for themselves very quickly.\n\nAll of the bad reviews of this game that have come out in the past two or so days will be incredibly helpful for the devs, who released a MAJOR update to this game less than three weeks ago.

Learn something about the process and be patient. I personally have been playing nothing but EA games because they offer something different than what a AAA can. Indy devs who have passion. Some have passion that burn out quickly but I have been lucky to find games that have motivated people at the helm.\n\nThe game is a blast but if you join a non-PVE server expect to die and die often in the noob zone. While losing pixels doesn't bother me, bullies do. I have been calling them out every time and it seems the majority of the server are not griefers. I even had someone take me off the street and hook me up.\n\nI bought the game after getting my moneys worth during my first free session of 4ish hours. I can see logging a lot of hours into the game because there is so much to do. The rpg feel with survival sprinkled in is awesome.\n\nThe biggest con for me is trying to link up with a friend from work and starting on different planets.

I'm better at criticizing for what's wrong, than talking about what's right. Just not my thing.\nIt's a great game, and has some pretty good goals, and ones that are reachable.\nAs it is, the core gameplay is there, and everything is neat. It all works, even if it's a bit rough, or even just placeholder.\n\nMy only complaints are the combat and the lack of a survival aspect, and no real exploring yet. The combat is incredibly simple for an MMO, having absolutely no input aside from hold left click. Hoping that changes though.\n\nThe game has no survival whatsoever, which is dissapointing. Hope that gets added.\n\nThe planets have some variety right now, but there's quite a lot of re-used models over all the planets, which I assume are placeholder. There's not really much to find or explore, the planets are very simple. I'd like to see more detail and 'alien' features. Things that make planets worth exploring.\n\nI think the game is worth it, although I can see why you might not want to buy it yet at $20.\n\nWish I could afford it, being Australian, currency conversion is terrible, so the game is expensive :(, plus i'm broke.

I've only played the game on the free weeked, so I'm a new player coming in, not a veteran.\n\nTHIS REVIEW IS BASED OFF A PVP SERVER EXPERIENCE.\n\n- There's lots of things to do in the game. It's just a shame that this is not immediately obvious to everyone coming in. Blueprints drop from monsters, and new players start off with a few crafting recipes. Unfortunately you may not realise this and conclude that the game is very shallow and doesn't have depth. Some players are judging the Early Access game just by playing on the starter planet, and I think they should give it another chance, because I think there's still a lot to this game than the starter planet.\n\n- Graphically awesome, though being an EA game it's still got some issues to kink out (some weird lights at night, graphical artifacts near dawn, etc.)\n\n- I was lucky because when I first joined there were also a lot of people asking questions, so I wasn't as lost as some other people. I know a lot of people were confused about the game's direction ("What do I do?")\n\n- There should really be a tutorial as well as some newbie protection zone. I heard some people giving bad reviews because a couple of people were running around the spawn point and killing level 1s.\n\n- Yes, grinding is boring, but most people who complained probably didn't get past MultiTool Mark 1.\n\n- Don't die.\n\nOverall, I actually liked the game for what it is and have high hopes for the future of this game. I hope it will be one of the more successful sandbox games out there.\n\nEXPLANATIONS AND COMMENTS ON THE GAME'S BAD REVIEWS:\n(Note that this game had mostly positive review BEFORE the free weekend)\n\n- New players coming in got immediately killed by some higher levels.\nSolution #1: RUN.\nSolution #2: Join a PVE server instead if you don't even like the idea of getting killed?\n\n- New players don't like the grinding in the game.\nThey get faster as you upgrade, and as you kill higher level mobs the better loot they'll give you (plus seeing blueprints drop is satisfying)\n\nEDIT: So look what I found on the latest changelog - "The game will now take action against non-newbie players killing newbies. "\nThey've been listening!\n\nTL;DR - It's a beautiful and graphically stunning game. It's got way more polished content than any Early Access game out there! Give it a try and you'll find a friendly community willing to make you a better player.","November 15, 2015","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The new Reborn update has completely changed the game and so I wouldn't bother taking those into consideration.The game is in early access still, but that being said, it has immense depth and work put into it. The new update has pretty much completely reworked the game for the better, adding hours of content.The game is similar to your average open-world survival game, so if you liked ARK, Rust, DayZ, or even Arma, I'd suggest checking into it.\n\nYou begin your journey by being placed into a region, filled with all kinds of life: creatures, trees, water, travelers, and even mobile vending machines. You'll begin to build your first structures for survival, machines to assist you in crafting, level up, and create new weapons. Night time will hit, you'll see the monsters roam about, and explore the next day. While exploring you found a cave and another player's base, guarded with a forcefield. You can either take the route and try to raid the base for more loot, or venture down into the cave and fight dangerous boss and collect ores!\n\n\nPros:\n-Easy to run (atleast for me).\n-Self-explanatory crafting system.\n-There's always something to do.\n-Updated frequently.\n-Fun with friends.\n-Decent combat system.\n-Servers are easy to create.\n-Tips to keep you from not knowing what to do.\n-Multiple planets to keep you entertained.\n-Active and helpful developers.\n-Easy base-building + difficult raiding.\n-Vehicles provide hilarious times with friends and aid the struggle of traveling large terrains!\n-'Official Wiki' is a tab in the Menu.\n-You can dance, literally.\n-Music is enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n-Grinding is tedious, but isn't as much as ARK.\n-Bugs occur occasionally, but they're generally fixed soon after discovered.\n-More fun with friends than alone.\n-People can randomly join servers that are PvE and destroy territory/bases without restriction. (No anti-grief system).\n-Spawns of servers are sometimes camped unfortunately.\n-You'll be forced to play in 3rd person (some could care less).\n-Lack of graphic customization in-game. You may have to configure files to disable some graphics.\n\nScore: 8.5/10\nAll in all, I really enjoy playing GRAV. Playing with friends is primarily what keeps me having a lot of fun. The scenery is almost dream-like. Plains don't look boring and grassy - there's huge mountains, and those mountains have caves, and behind those have massive trees, which are surrounded by lakes. There's endless things to explore, and instead of focusing on PvP, you can have just as much or even more fun adventuring out into a giant steel tower, a cave, or even a biodome. If you'd like to watch a vending machine get mauled by 8 dinosaurs, and then watch an entire fleet of combustible turtles swarm your house, then you should probably buy it.","November 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's always some cool new biome or alien structure over the next hill that will stab at your curiosity and cause you to stray from your objectives.\n\nThe artistic direction is incredibly surreal and creative, reminding me heavily of the sort of zany world design in titles like Spyro the Dragon. The monsters and everything come into all different forms and names, some silly, some epic, but all of them charming.\n\nCombat is a left-click grind, but I quite like it. Then again, I'm very much a fan of games that implement similar combat/leveling systems.\n\nAt its core though, GRAV is a game that demands patience. It is designed for the grinder and the explorer. If you're not particularly a fan of slow character progression, then this game probably isn't for you. But if you're the sort of player that enjoys roaming freely, killing time, GRAV does the job well.","November 16, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Learn something about the process and be patient. I personally have been playing nothing but EA games because they offer something different than what a AAA can. Indy devs who have passion. Some have passion that burn out quickly but I have been lucky to find games that have motivated people at the helm.\n\nThe game is a blast but if you join a non-PVE server expect to die and die often in the noob zone. While losing pixels doesn't bother me, bullies do. I have been calling them out every time and it seems the majority of the server are not griefers. I even had someone take me off the street and hook me up.\n\nI bought the game after getting my moneys worth during my first free session of 4ish hours. I can see logging a lot of hours into the game because there is so much to do. The rpg feel with survival sprinkled in is awesome.\n\nThe biggest con for me is trying to link up with a friend from work and starting on different planets. Having a join friend through Steam (that actually works) would be great.\n\n","November 14, 2015","true","47.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ok first off, many people who have just purchased this game are complaining about stability or lag, this is due to the most recent update to the game. Whenever the devs release an update, there will be lag until they release a hotfix which comes out a couple of hours after the initial update. The hotfix has since been released for the servers which will hopefully have cut down on the lag.\n\nnow onto the game.\nThis game is a cozy little open world game that you can play by yourself or with your friends. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and so are the graphics. The world is pretty huge and you'll need more than just the average adventuring skills to know where everything is because you aren't gonna get a map! There are tons of other planets to go to and even a second island that you have to jetpack to from the main planet so you're not gonna run out of adventuring any time soon. The Monocycles go pretty fast once you upgrade them to Monocycle+ and none of the vehicles take too much fuel to run. As long as you have about a thousand of every main resource, you should be fine. As long as you're not too unintelligent, you shouldn't need too much of a tutorial and anything that you really need to know about the game can be found in some really helpful community guides, so go look at those.\n\nThe game is very stable(I mean people with laptops run this thing)\nThe replayablitity never ends with all the different classes that you can unlock\nthe adventuring never ends as long as you don't stop adventuring\nsuper nice community\ndedicated Devs\ncrafting is pretty fun\ngraphics are stunning(I mean christ, the main planet looks like freaking Pandora from Avatar)\nSoundtrack is comfy and amazing\nthe entire game is comfy and amazing\n\nAnybody would be dumb to not purchase this now because this game is about to get GUUD\ncompletely worth the original price.","June 17, 2015","true","35.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game play is what I would consider to be a masterpiece in the making.  So why is it a game like this, even on a free weekend, cannot manage to get even a third of their main servers full, of which there are few?  Simple, implementation.\n\nThis game is mind-blowingly behind in terms of basic functionality. ANY game I can think of at least has the following:\n1) Graphics settings beyond toggle on/offs.\n2) Sensitivity options as part of the GUI.  That's right, you need a console command to change your mouse sensitivity, sound levels, etc.\n3) Local/LAN/small group play.  You can play solo, but the content differs to an extent.  For the most part you get the same stuff, but the 'backbone' of the game Element X is 10 (hurrr) times (hurrr) worse than on a multiplayer server.  So this might as well not exist beyond the first couple days. Which is why the rest of the points are so damn important.\n4) Server Hosting.  While this game has it, it is absolutely horrible.  Most hosting companies won't even touch this game.  They operate each planet on a separate server.  So if you want to host a server, you might end up eating 10GB+ and having seven different commands prompts.  As mentioned, even if you manage to get that far, which my doctorate and 15 years hosting experience barely accomplished, you will spend days figuring out how to tweak the server to your liking.\n5) GUI support for passwords.  Yes, if your server is password protected, people cannot click it and type in the password.  They have to go into console and type in a syntaxed command.  Most players won't ever figure this out or bother unless someone copypasta's it for them.\n6) This list could go on, but the point is... playing with friends, playing how you want, altering graphics and basic configuration options are such a pain that it makes this a research simulator.  Which would be viable, if everyone hadn't given up trying to figure it out already and all the research is from January.  As mentioned below, Reborn is out so all that is irrelevant now.\n\nThis free weekend was probably Grav's last real chance.  It just ruined its reputation.  When you can't give a game away, which is of such outstanding quality (really it is, the game play is FANTASTIC), you've really screwed up.\n\nTL;DR: Grav is spectacular, but all that potential is being wasted because the developers have failed to implement even the most basic ease-of-use functionality into the GUI and into the game.","November 15, 2015","false","95.4"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","8"

I spawned in the game and looked around to see an immersive world. I immediately went looking for crafting options, as I started playing with my friend. Upon the first 35 minutes of trying to find out how to get to a different instance of the home planet (there's a lot of them) to play with my friend I died approx. 2 times a minute.\nDid this stop me? NO I was on a PVP server and I loved what I saw already. naked noobs spawning in having intense club duels at the spawn field. I loved it, every high player was known by name on my server and that was also cool. It was like you got to choose your minature community, think that because there are lots of planets you'll never see anyone? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! If anything I see more people when I least expect than anything. The game will center goals to make players eventually conflict over things. The moon is the best place to get materials by 3x but you best believe there are going to be a clan of 6+ people watching that portal for you to attempt to smuggle the goods back home.\n\nI bought this game 4 days ago, I have 40 hours.

I anticipated a survival/crafting game but what I got was a hack and slash action RPG.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I'm not usually a fan of the hack and slash genre, but I took to this game and can easily recommend it to others.  Here's a run down of the pros and cons:\n\nPROS\n\n1) GRAPHICS - Quite frankly, they're amazing, rivaling that of any AAA game out there.  Everything is rendered beautifully.\n\n2) MODELS AND ANIMATION - The models are as detailed as they are various.  There's a huge variety of enemies and each one is unique in appearance.  The way each enemy moves and the way your character is animated are quite impressive, too.  Your character can even perform complicated dance maneuvers, like twitching or gangnam style, something I found silly but clearly demonstrated the amazing skills of the development team's motion animators.\n\n3) CONTENT, CONTENT, CONTENT! - This game has so much content.  There are tons of items, gadgets, vehicles, weapons, and armor.  It will be a very long time before you run out of stuff to make and use.\n\n4) CHARACTER PROGRESSION - This game excels at its sense of progression, allowing you to develop your character through many, many hours of gameplay.\n\n5) EXPLORATION - The world is huge and varies in biomes.  Additionally, there are other planets and moons with diverse landscapes (and hazards) to check out.  It was all very satisfying.\n\n6) VARIETY OF ENEMIES - The sheer number of different types of enemies was jaw dropping.  These developers put a huge amount of effort into modeling and animating tons of different enemies.\n\n7) VEHICLE TYPES - Wingsuit, jet pack, doombuggy, tank, and many more I haven't even unlocked yet (I think there's a plane or two).  Lots of fun!\n\n\nCONS\n\n1) LACK OF CAVE DIVERSITY - You will spend a lot of time exploring caves, so it's unfortunate that every cave pretty much looks the same.\n\n2) REPETITIVE COMBAT - The combat in this game is pretty much just kiting and mashing the mouse button, regardless of weapon or enemy, thus the hack and slash designation I mentioned earlier.  The combat lacks any nuance that might make it a more enjoyable aspect of the game.\n\n3) LOOT OVERLOAD - There are so many different kinds of crafting materials and loot in this game that your inventory and chests will be overflowing with stacks of stuff you have no idea what to do with.  I quickly got to the point where I didn't even look to see what I was getting from enemies; and not long after that I didn't even bother looting the enemies at all.  That's not a win in my book.\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nA fun hack and slash RPG with tons of content for many hours of gameplay, but it suffers from repetitive combat and poor cave design.","February 1","true","70.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I watched some gameplay on YouTube about this game and I found it very interesting! I bought it and I already have 5.4 hours on it! At first the game doesn't seem like much but then as you progress in cave exploring and taking down monsters you get these blueprints that lead you to greater things and keep the game interesting. They give you this task list that you would want to complete, there's many things to craft and creat! I just keep finding stuff and it only increases how much I like this game already! It was well over the $6 I paid for this game, I actually wish that I had paid more for this game. This game goes beyond any game I've played before. If you like Space Engineers you'll love this game!

I can see a lot of potential.\nRight now its a little Grindy (heck, what isnt these days?)\nTheres no story line but what ever you make up for yourself.\nThe environments are as Varied a the video suggests, and require specific equipment to survive in them (beware of low grav environments).\nEnough weapons to keep you busy.\nI have no tried PvP so I cant comment on that.\nThe progression is well thought out, in that you dont immediatly have access to all recources, but you have to level up in order to get to the environments the recources are found in.\nUpdates are slow-ish.

The first few minutes of my first game went something like this:-\n\nSpawned  on a lush, vibrant  planet. Took a few moments to soak in the ambience; unseen animals called to each other in the foliage, the wind sighed through the trees. Tall grasses whispered about my legs and in then distance I could see some strange life forms gambolling about in a meadow.\n\nWow, I though to myself,this looks amazing. Filled with the excitement of adventures to come, of vistas to explore and  hardships to overcome, I took my first step in a new world. And a long neck reached in from behind me and a huge bird thing killed me in two bites.\n\nI respawned in a grassy plain, I could see hills behind me and a forest ahead.  Jumping around madly, and crying with apparent glee, a large turtle type creature flounced through the grass around me. Initially nervous of its intentions, upon realising that it meant me no harm, I relaxed and took a look at what items I was carrying. Noting that I carried a stout club, I took it out and gave it a few practice sweeps around me. At which point I hit the turtle thing that, being level 7, promptly stomped me into the soft, verdant soil.\n\nAt this point I had to stop playing as my young son had fallen asleep on my lap and was  exuding an impressive amount of drool onto my knee. I therefore plan to return to this review in the future once I have spent more time with this great looking game.\n\n10/10 would die twice before I literally had taken 3 steps, again.","January 26","true","18.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firebertninja/recommended/332500/","firebertninja","FireBert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firebertninja/","185 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly Access games are hard to review in general. There is normally a lot of content missing, and a player never knows when additional patches will either render a game unplayable for a time or vastly improved afterwards. GRAV seems to be one of those games that tends to firm up after additional patches, and I am all the more happy about it.\n\nI find that the gameplay is simplistic and authentic. Gather resources, combat the environment and other players, survive raids, discover new blueprints, and dance around a fire to catch your breath. I am sure that these features, plus the allure of building an infinite amount of structures on the surface of every planet, have kept me in rapture for some time now. The graphics are much better than I had initially anticipated. Even thought the details are simple and repeatative, the overall scenery makes me want to take screenshots whenever I can. !@#$ you F12, your easy access will fill my harddrive space with plenty of screenshots and no remorse!\n\nI have not reached the end game content yet, nor do I know if any exists yet, but the thrill of inching closer to the goal of Rank [420] is every bit as exciting as I imagined. I would hope that more people would discover the game to build a more full and vibrant community, but int he meantime it is noce being one of the few on the server that have become a mainstay for some time.\n\nThe only downside I see so far is the lack of real content to make the mystery of why the player characters are stranded on the planetary system. I am sure that BitMonster is busy working on fleshing out the lore of the game, but in the meantime we are left to wonder *why*  the character is left on such an inhospitable planet and *where* they may have come from. As far as gameplay show-stoppers are concerned, the devs still need to do a lot of polishing on many of the collision issues such as invisible walls and excessive clipping, creatures disapearing into walls and rocks, physics that glitch out and destroy vehicles and PC's, and tweak the day/night cycle a bit to allow for more planning.\n\nOverall I give GRAV a huge thumbs up. Head on over to Humble Bundle to pick your copy while it remains on sale. Look up the FireBert on the US EAST Universe and join me for a dance by the fire :)","April 25","true","209.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It drives me crazy that people can sink hundreds of hours into an Early Access game and still call it a rip off.  It is definitely "grindy", but I don't mind that as I am not an endgame player.  I just want to casually mine and enjoy the (great) scenery while checking over my shoulder every now and then to make sure some bloodthirsty player doesn't mess me up.\n\nAs of now I find the game to be balanced in a decidedly old school way: the beginning is SUPER hard, but if you persevere you will master thye planet.\n\nWhat I like most of all is that once you get the opening grind out of the way, its pretty easy to recover even if you lose everything - you retain character levels and research.  The levels and research are not too overpowered, either so even new players aren't just prey for higher level folks on multiplayer servers.\n\nCommunity has been decent so far, not anything particularly bad or good.","April 13","true","164.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

I was hopeful that the whole open-world exploration and crafting on many different planets would expand on the survival genre, but the devs failed pretty miserably. There are like 6 enemy models, with the bosses just being scaled up versions of the normal monsters. There's not much to do besides run around gathering resources or exploring caves. The caves all look the same though, so after 1 or 2 spelunking expeditions you'll be thoroughly bored. The crafting system is nothing special, just upgraded armor and weapons with tiny damage increases. You can make some base items too, but there's not all that many base elements, so your base will look terribly bland. There's no objectives (or point) to this game, and content updates are virtually nonexistent. Instead of trying to make a good game, the devs seem more focused on being the "next big thing" in the already crowded multiplayer survival field. Needless to say they won't achieve this. There are many more deserving games out there, don't pay for this crap.","March 26","false","42.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Now when I first saw this one, I was rather skeptical. I looked into some tutorials and let's plays of it and thought it would be choppy and really bad. I was proven very wrong by the game itself. As weird as it may seem on the surface Grav really isn't at all. Firstly, the combat system, THANK U JESUS ITS AMAZING. They literally ripped the combat system out of an MMORPG and put it into a building game YAAAASS thank u devs. The system itself is very much like TERA's combat system (if any of you play that game). After that, any structures require a TON of harvesting which makes the CO-OP feature of the game crucial to having the most fun out of the experience because they have the reasource requirements set at the perfect limit to where 2 people can get a structure built 3 times as fast as 1 person could. Grav is honestly the first game I've seen to fully say,"Sandbox game, Adventure and RPG first, then sandbox element." And it pulls that off masterfully. Also, it runs super smoothly on my computer and I only have a measly GTX 750 from like 2 years ago.

I'm more against the genre than this game so hopefully the developers don't take it too personally.\n\nI don't get why anyone would want to play this, what's the point in surviving when you just respawn and carry on... that should be a T-shirt. There's just no reason to play it. Yes I only played this for an hour (nearly two) so disregard it if you want but let me boil down that hour or so of gameplay: I spent an hour as an astronaut wearing wood for armour, lasering down trees and dinosaur bones while battering big frogs to death with a club and trying to build a house with the most awkward camera controls ever. I was also later infromed that you can dance around fires to heal... because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why. All of that for an hour with no explanation as to why, how or what my end goal was because like in every other survival game there is no reason for anything. You just do because they told you you can.\n\nI don't understand these kinds of games. They're as frustrating and boring as real life but with no real reward except maybe some pretty pixels. I would much rather just rearrange my living room, cook a meal, look at some fancy pictures (I don't mean porn) and then play any other game in the world. I would get the same experience as playing another plotless survival game.\n\nLet me tell you about the game I dream about; I recently played the Tomb Raider reboot for the first time and when I first sat down at a campsite after having hunted a Deer I thought that it was gonna be one the best games I'd ever played (incidentally it was brilliant, just not what I expected). I thought it was gonna be a survival game with an interesting plot, a relatable character that I actually want to help survive and some kind of goal. An endgame. Until there is a survival game that fits that description ♥♥♥♥ 'em all. This would probably make a better Free-To-Play but I still wouldn't play it myself.\n\nIf you like those pointless survival games I see no reason you won't enjoy this one.\n\nI don't but maybe I'm just a dreamer.","November 15, 2015","false","1.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","11"

I played Starwars The old republic too and loved it. Grav is for me kinda boring after short while, although I love to play with my friends. The reason is that you got to go a lot for collecting to build anything and that I really don't have enough stuff I'd like to build because I am kinda focused on the basebuilding and the items for this are very limited and building doesn't work well, after 2 weeks I was completely done with it and I am not a fan of leveling all professions by killing stuff all the time. Killing is just not interesting enough in this game, there are just any tasks missing, no quests at all. It is just going to the next higher planet and killing next higher monsters, collecting next higher stuff all the time. That's pretty much all that game is about. Even the armor you get build for doing this is not amazing enough to motivate me and the most terrible is that you can do it all all over again if you want to level up the next profession to be able to use its abilities, and there are lots of professions that you would need to level up. So I need to end up to give Grav no positiv review, although the graphics are kinda nice. I know it is still Alpha but this review is about should you get it as Alpha already or not and I guess you shouldn't. Sorry for the developers, but it is just how I personally feel about it.

An afternoon with it helped me realize that I will never pay money for this.\n\nAfter freezing my computer for SEVERAL MINUTES upon startup (and this was before the "populating world" thing; I couldn't even close the program with alt+f4 or access the task manager), it crashed my computer when someone near me tried to use voice chat.

It's fun, but there's a bit of an imbalance in both PvP and PvE. Although the game says it's impossible to build adjacent to enemy structures, it is DEFINITELY POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. This leads to a lot of griefing. A rank 75 came up to my house, put down some turrets and a shield, and kept me locked in my house until he decided to take them down. It's even worse in PvE because if this happens, you literally can do nothing because you can't kill other players. Spawn killing is also pretty bad, as in any survival PvP game- high levels just hunt noobs for no reason. There needs to be a starter planet or a peace period for new players so they can get properly geared and defend themselves.\n\nIt's fun, but these issues are gamebreaking.

Exploration gets blocked upon start-up by grinding mechanics. You can't leave areas without totaly grinding the crap out of this game. This game can't decide if it wants to be an exploration game or a survival game, but fails at both. This game will literally EAT your precious time through grinding. GRAV has way less to offer than other survival games: some ore nodes to mine, chopp down trees. No variety in wood types or something like that. All the same. The wood cutting animations doesn't play synchronized with the corresponding sounds and feels awkward: It's kinda inspired by Starbound, but in 3D. The laser doesn't create any serious wound decals on the trees while cutting them.\n\nMultiplayerStutter animations, de-synced sounds and lags.

The game is a grinder and not rely playable in it´s present state. Before you read the good and bad listing, you will understand that changes will hopefully be made to better balance the game play and graphics later on! Hopefully!\n\n\nThe good bits first:\n\n1/ Rely great music that sets a calm mood (the best part of the game).\n2/ Nice style or design on the area, although minimalistic detail or textures.\n3/ Good lighting effects (sun rise that is).\n4/ and a fun dance (the first 4 times).\nYet that is all the game has to offer at the moment.\n\n\nThe bad bits:\n\n1/ There is no survival; ( you get food constantly when killing or even when harvesting a tree). So no real need even for the  farm unit (that looks like a table top).\n2/ There are no caves; you find a light or structure in the area and press "E" to spawn in what looks like a hallway with neatly lined straight paths in a crossroad layout (I was very boring and badly designed without atmosphere).\n3/ The creatures basically ignore you, so the idea of a base is lost.\n4/ The world is very repetitive (same shape rock used 100 times, same grass colour) needs more plants and normal life.\n5/ You need fostle to build just about anything, yet this is hard to find. If you do find some it can be for another level/grade.\n6/ The modular system you build with is extremely modular, one click and your done, so a bit too basic.\n7/ AI awareness is too low.\n\nAlthough I have many early access games waiting for updates, I do not see them re-doing the cave system completely as it would have to be re-done from scratch. The world is not interesting enough and needs a TON of added content. The cave areas was the biggest let down with an extreme modular cave system that repeats way too often, offering you only straight walk ways and bright lighting every were. Even the world area (island) is split up in a modular leveled way, after walking 50 meters I found the trees are marked with a grade level of 7 or 6 and right next to my spawn area? A tree is a tree in my book and should be seen as just a resource for the taking;)\n\nI was pulled in to buying the game, by the color visuals of the trailer and the general atmosphere and thought they had at least got that right, yet the caves need to be totally re done in my opinion and the whole balance needs a look over.\n\nSo my advice is to wait and see if changes are made or if you do not mind the grinding and are happy with the music buy it. Yet it´s not a game I can recommend, as it has too much thats just wrong.\nLuckily there is still one brilliant game out there that I can recommend instead "Planet Explorers".","February 22, 2015","false","5.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I would maybe recommend it in the future but it needs work. Raiding in this game currently is impossible unless the person hasn't played in a while. Generators make your walls immune to all damage. So it really doesn't matter if you make a 1x1 wood base it's just as good as a 100x100 metal base. The pve is decent, does get a bit boring since the AI in this game is super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you even get hit by a monster you must not have been paying attention. The pvp is pretty fun (not the raiding aspect but actually killing other players.) The only issue is that a rank 420 can sit in the lowbie section all day and just kill new people. Then they just ragequit with no chance of even playing. Fun game but needs some work.","November 15, 2015","false","96.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","3"

Almost 2 hours to get the resources to make the first teir gun and armor "rotten wood armor YAY" clear ONE level 3 dungeon just to find a blueprint to get yet ANOTHER resource so you can get upgrades.... At that point I decided this game has way to much grind, even modern MMORPG's dont have as much grind as this does and I'm even refering to the solo pve non-raid grind of yester-years rpgs... The other thing is construction, the handful of blocks /structures you can create are all the exact same, so every base looks the same.... One might be elevated on pillars, the other sitting on the ground with stairs, but the over-all design of bases are way to ....similar..... Think RUST houses with no option of corner pieces just the square foundations and thats it....\n\nWith that little bit out of the way lets get the pros and cons out of the picture and move this review along.\n\nPros-\nNIce Graphics and Ambience\nGreat Score\nLots of growth potential / content\n\nCons-\nDead Multiplay "And what few that are on are either solo-mmo or just out right rude -even on a pve world"\nSome Framerate issues "typical of open-world sandbox games"\nTo much "garbage" left by other players when they move on in the world i.e. clutter.\nGetting stuck in your workbenches\nGrind.....Grind....and more GRIND...... More crafty less grindy please!\n\n\nOverall - 6/10\n\nIf the community was a bit more lively and the "cough" certain member base could quit playing with thier e-peen, the game might be a bit more interesting even with the few bugs I had noticed and frame issues from time to time.\n\nAnd before People say "community isn't the devs problem", you're right, it isn't. But with there being not much to do in the game and the whole selling point "even in the trailer for the game is co-op / pvp " the community is the biggest factor playing against thier hand at the table. And about the clutter I mention, is half built structures left to decay, armory benches and factorys just sitting in the woods and in the fields EVERYWHERE.  Why build a base to store your excess gear and to restock ammo and items when you can just walk over to your nearest\nhobo-vendomatic at a rock near you.  "Granted these structures don't cost much to build but, as time goes on, and more...more....more of these keep appearing it is bound to cause a lot of performance issues for new players on average and below systems." So there should be a wipe of these objects after so long.\n\nBought the EA to take a peek, good idea but not quite there. Hold on to your wallet is my advice.\n\n"Also for those who say no Single player, I gather what they mean is you CAN play the game solo or with friends etc, unlike say modern mmo class games where to do certain things / raid certain dungeons, you MUST have a team/party to complete."\n\nI want to like this game but I cant at present...... I will change my rating if/when this game matures a bit more "hopefully sooner rather than later"\n\n--Will comeback to this game later and take another look--","February 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Maybe you don't know this, but disagreeing with a review isn't actually a legitimate reason to downvote.\n\nThis is not one of those reviews where the writer doesn't understand Early Access, and then slams the game because they have no concept of the process. This is a review where I take aim at the underlying principles of the game - things that are extraordinarily unlikely to change in development, a conclusion I attempt to justify with what I feel are compelling reasons.\n\nIn good faith and fairness, behold the "Pro" list:\n\nPROS	Graphics. This game is much prettier than most of its kind, and likely to improve as the game develops.\nSound. I like the music. It's not typical, and it suits the game's aesthetics.\nAdversarial. I love sandbox games where the environment is dangerous and comes after your base, giving you reasons to defend it.\nNEUTRAL	Crafting. Crafting and building are OK, but unpolished. Doesn't weigh against an early access game, though.\nLack of UI features. Where the hell am I? No maps. Again, a feature that could be added, so it doesn't count as a "con".\nPoor Co-op. You can't yet build a proper base together as a group; everything belongs to exactly one person.\nCONSHere it gets complicated. A list won't do, because for an Early Access game, I must justify anything I think will never change.\n\nExremely grindy. If you have MMO experience, this will mean more to you. The resource gathering in this game is incredibly grindy. Think of WoW or FF14, but with far more travel time. The jobs, consumables, gathering equipment, and fatigue mechanics are all designed around creating incentives to marginally reduce the grinding. The game is poised to deliver hundreds if not thousands of hours of playtime, most of it grinding. No game should last that long.\n\nThere's no room here for me to make a full argument for why this can't change. If objections arise, I will take them on individually. In summary, though, the grind is the entire principle underlying the design of the game. If the game were less grindy, all of it would have to be redesigned from the ground up. One of many examples: Resource nodes are spread out over great distances. Stamina limits your running - only an interesting feature in a game where you may have to run and run and run. Expensive consumables allow you to run more. Crafting allows you to increase the rate at which you can create these consumables, slightly reducing travel time, but not enough to change the nature of gameplay. There's no reason for these mechanics unless the game is designed to be a grind.\n\nThe thing that makes it all inexcusable is that this isn't a subscription game! There is NO reason for the game to be design to string you along and draw itself out indefinitely, yet it is clearly designed from first principles to do exactly that.\n\nI am told that some people enjoy this grind. There are entire games devoted to it that people pay monthly to play. I think it's absurd. Not just absurd, it's not even a game. It's a job.","November 21, 2015","false","8.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","5"

For an alpha game, it tries to do too many things at once without doing anything well enough to impress. The gameplay is mediocre; standard third-person shooting action without oomph. As a player, I lack a direction. There are some introductory quests that might count as a bare-bones tutorial, but a couple of hours into the game I'm already just grinding the same boring mobs to get more levels in hopes of unlocking better stuff via leveling. I don't know if that's going to happen, the game doesn't really tell me. Materials are collected simply by beaming nodes with an all-purpose tool. The environment is indestructible, which means no mining. The "dungeons" I encountered were simple tunnels that had some non-aggressive mobs, and mineral nodes that weren't available in the overworld. The colony pods in the screenshots are purely decorative, as they\n\nThe game isn't ugly, per se (though the art direction seems questionable), but it also doesn't look as good as it does in the screenshots and the options menu offers nothing to fix that.

This game runs amazing and i have no lag on unoffical servers. ( i have not tried offical) I do have a better then average computer made for games and I have not had performance issues. I had scared where switching from planet to planet would turn white screen or take really long but it always came through. there are terrain and bumping into character bugs but having a jetpack or just restarting the game fixes that. (restarting also takes like 20 secs so i dont see it as a bother when a bug is involved) If you have slow internet connecting you may fall through the would that has happened to many players i have meet that have lag issues. The game has a lot more content then it lets on. Many dungeons small and large planets and moons to travel too. There are not many different creatures but there are bundles of different types of the same creature so it keeps you on your toes when fighting.

I believe there are some game balance issue as well as some weird game considerations.\n\nCons:Base-BuildingNo point building bases as they are destroyed relatively easy, to secure your resource do not put in stash put in your inventory and log off. Turrets can be easily avoided. In PVP server i played, there isn't any proper building intact.\nMaps are littered with lots of unused base\nBuilding are in form of rooms and they all look the same, no customization\nGame DesignWhen you die, you basically drop almost everything and waste whatever effort to accumulate them. There is not cooldown time, so whoever killed you, immediately runs off with your resources.\nMonster spawn in caves have no time gap until you cleared the whole waves, so you have to keep spamming your gun\nMining resources take too long even with upgraded tool, you need wood for most of the crafting and it takes a long time to mine them.\nLevel of your char doesnt mean ♥♥♥♥, you can be killed by a low level who doesnt want to mine and have everything looted. With everyone spaming their guns, whoever has the majority wins.\nGrindfest, i need to up my level to 40 just to get a skill that increase damage by 10% and after 10+ hours i barely reach 20\nNo way to breakdown materials you crafted(guns, bullets and clothes), so you can only discard them.\nItem drop sucks, i played for 15 hours and only have the basic assault gun recipe which i used for more than 10 hours of my playtime\nCaves are not integrated with the main map, its more of a small area outside of the map.\nMonsters glow too brightly in multiple colors which kind of spoil the scenery\nI have not found a way to pass the night, like sleeping\nNot much attack skills to speak off, the skills are all stat based (No fanciful killer moves). Most of the time i just spam my gun holding thousands of bullets. Close range attack is just normal or hard attack.\nThere is no map, once your murderer destroys your resurrection station, you will be randomly placed on the area and you will have to try to find your way back through coordinates.\nTip: you can look at logs(lower right) to see on which coordinates you died.\nLack of contentThe monsters i seen only have 2 attack patterns (regardless of home or moon planet), one close one long attack\nLack of explanation for a lot of ingame mechanics\nMaps are kinda of plain, monsters have no habitat nor behavior and just roaming around. Lots of open area with nothing on it.\nLighting(UV map) is not implemented, nightime is total darkess and you will need to craft a bot to hover for light and you have no torchlight\nThe gun firing sound will drive you nuts, combat animation can be improved.\nOnly 2 NPC types but multiple clones of them in caves and everywhere, you cant interact much with them except to buy bots. Their sole purpose is to be slaughtered or to block your path especially in cave.\nThere are different home planets like alpha, beta etc but they all look the same, i believe there are some different planets for mid levels but for low levels it doesnt matter which planet you are on.\nLow replayability as the maps are not procedural generated.\nOthersCrash often\nController is not implemented properly\nPros:Seems to have potential for something interesting\nLots of different types of resource\nDifferent type of Vehicles  like monocycle? jetpack (Need wood to move though)\nYou will feel like exploring the map to see what is around\nA bit of survival feel (you will feel hungry but not sleepy), monsters hold food packs for you not meat\nGraphics is kind of nice\nyou can eat processed poop\nYou can find crates akin to treasure chest in caves and makes it rewarding to fight your way in.","November 15, 2015","false","55.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

High levels can kill lower levels but are punished with a beam above them and killed if repeated. I wouldn't recommend this game alone unless playing a PVE server. From my experience so far, higher levelled players are more inclined to offer you things rather than kill you.\n\nI'm giving it a 8/10 for the ~30hrs of gameplay so far.\n\n\nPROs\nBlueprints come often enough to keep you striving for the next level\nTravelling by Air, Land or Portal is always fun with a wingsuit/jetpack!\nHEAD OVERIDES! These are such an awesome idea, from wearing a santa hat to a horse head.\nCaves/Dungeons these are super fun with friends! Killing minibosses and special monsters that spew blueprints is always exciting\nPETS! You can get pets that buff you! DMG/DEF/SPD/XP and one that shines light on those REALLY dark nights.\nOnce you play a class, the passives and active abilities carry over when you switch to another class and are interchangeable.\nYou can poop....EVERYWHERE.\n\nCONs\nThe monster level to damage is a bit rough, I'm level 29 killing a level 30-31 and doing low damage.\nThere's no mouse sense slider, you can fix that by using console commands though\nThere's no graphical tweaking options at all, can't change audio levels either, you can turn music off atleast\nLack of different mobs is kind of a drag reskinned and recoloured models, but expect more to be added\nIf you land ontop of someone or enter a instance ontop of another you get stuck and need to relog\nProbably the biggest thing of all, due to the lack of playerbase is there's not much to find in wiki pages about where to find certain resources or monster drops what.\n\n\nProtip! I found starting your first class as a prospector to level 10 to gain the "Strip Mine" ability for gathering those clustered resources really quick is super handy and not to be underestimated.\n\n\n","January 1","true","35.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

If you do initiate Solo, don't do ANYTHING otherwise it will take longer to create the world for just lil ol' you and the game could crash/freeze if you click anywhere while its loading.\n\nYou're better off starting in Multiplayer on the Official Servers cause the maps are already made & you're here to find out if you like it or not (not spending most of the 2 hrs just creating a map for yourself). Play the Official Servers, you'll be able to figure out much quicker if the game is for you or not.\nFor the short time I've played this game, I'm giving it a 7/10 . And don't think I'm being nice with my rating, I'm generally very harsh when giving my ratings, and 7/10 is pretty good for just 3 hours of gameplay.\n\nSide Note: (posted this on 4/28/2016 just in case) Humble Bundle has GRAV 75% off (4.99 from 19.99).

However this update was forced on ANY server, including private, which equated in me and my friends on our own server, losing several weeks of effort, with no warning. Uncaring devs, VERY infrequent updates, most of which fix a very small amount of minor bugs, and lack of any form of communication with the players makes me feel like this title will die long before release.

There is a PvE server if you don't want to be killed and for the farming and grinding that is to be expected in a Survival Sandbox MMORPG. Now on with the review....\n\nThe game is amazing there are loads of potential:\n\nThe game looks amazing, it takes a lot of ram though so make sure you're at minimum with the 8gb of ram. I play with 5.42gb (not recommended) and  can get a little laggy sometimes with freezes here and there because of my ram not reaching the min requirements, but I am sure as the game proceeds the ram will most likely come down just like Rust. Now for the combat, it's a little meh, it can get pretty repetitive when fighting monsters and boring with the monsters attacks being repetitive aswell but I'm sure they'll add more to combat as the game goes on. As for the PvP it can get INTENSE and is pretty fun until you die, I recommend that you play with a group on PvP or else you'll get killed very easily by big groups. :( For the crafting there are loads of stuff you can create vechiles, armor, weapons. For the building this is probably the most frustrating part for me and the game is very limited on building, such as when I was trying to build a lip on my base it was hard do, the building is not like where you make floors, walls, and foundations seperate and put them together which they should do.\n\nAs of now I would recommend this game with a verict of 7.5/10.","February 1, 2015","true","212.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/malafool/recommended/332500/","malafool","Grisis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/malafool/","172 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWith a computer that runs this game with the reccommended requirements, this game is a treat with a lot to offer at this point in the development phase. People rating it bad with .7 hours of play time played the free weekend recently and couldnt run it. Even if they could, they probably didn't like this genre in the first place.\n\nThe first thing you should do if you buy this game is choose a pvp server and go from there. The pvp is fantastic. The guys who are making this game all worked on the Unreal Tournament games. So the shooting feels punchy, the action is fast, and if you're skilled enough you will be able to defend yourself from any griefing. If you don't like pvp then this game probably isn't for you. However, at the time of this review the population on a server at any given time is low. So griefing isn't a major issue in the first place. When I first started playing there was a problem with higher level guys killing new players, but if you enjoy a challenge and can brush off your shoulders you'll have a good time. Another thing to consider is that you only drop a portion of your crafting materials and ammo, never gear you spent time to make.\n\nThere is a grind, but it's the same type of grind you would get in other buildy games. The incentive to kill the monsters in the game is to get blueprints so you can build better tiers of armor, weapons, vehicles, and structures. At first the prices are daunting because you are supposed to develop your character and get skills that reduce the cost of things. Once you figure this part out materials are plentiful and are easy to get. You'll probably lose a base or two on the road to the high planets which isn't too bad because once you know how some of the building mechanics work a base can be indestructable to other players as long as there is enough wood in the generator. The only way to break a base currently is if you place certain items inside of one that cause other players to want to destroy it.\n\nThis game says it's a space game but there isn't any space travel. You use teleports that take you to another island that has a different environmental survival condition. So if you don't have a prope suit you can't stay for very long before taking damage and eventually dying. Aquiring the blueprints to the differnet suits requires you to kill monsters around your level range so by the time you have a full suit you'll be the level of the area.\n\nI think the job system is unique in that all of the skills gained from any of the seven jobs apply to your character. So instead of having a bunch of different characters you only have one. The max rank in the game is 420, but that is seven level 60 jobs. It seems ridiculous to have a 420 character at first, but in reality once you hit 60 in any one job you can build and fight just about anything.\n\nIt's like Unreal Tournament and a MMO had a weird baby that doesn't quite know what it is yet, but is well on the way to being a better game. Make friends, learn from your failures, don't sweat the small stuff, and you'll have a good time.","January 23","true","507.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chakkahn/recommended/332500/","chakkahn","Chakka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chakkahn/","245 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShort review: an interesting dose of leveling progression mixed with building bases and improving weapons/armor. I'd highly recommend it while it's on sale. Still partly recommended while full price if you like building style games with a bit of leveling progression tacked on. Imperfect, but enjoyable for what it's worth. Play with friends, if at all possible. The solo experience is sorely lacking.\n\nLong review: This game has given me good moments, great moments, terrible moments, and horrendously boring moments. While I can think of more cons than pros, I still believe that the overall experience of the game, played with other players or friends, makes up for them. I may not play forever, but I enjoyed the time spent, and so I give this a positive review.\n\nPros:\n-Initial progression is fun, as you get new weapons, armor, skills, and building "blueprints" from exploring places and killing creatures\n-Building bases is fairly intuitive once you get the hang of it, and you can construct whatever you wish, assuming the area is clear and you have the materials. Most areas are easy to build on.\n-Once you figure out the way to build bases, you can construct practical bases, strange mazes, or anything you want so long as you protect it with shield generators and plan properly.\n-Playing with friends is fun, and pvp/pve is fairly straightforward when working in groups\n-Loot is easy to find and abundant to acquire, and ammo is never hard to come by.\n-Devs are responsive, and many errors/bugs are fixed fairly quickly.\n\nCons\n-Past the initial fun of discovering new blueprints and going to new planets, the progession becomes a grind. Either a grind to level up to get one particular kind of blueprint, skill, or passive effect, or a grind to 5/8 max rank so that you can get the "best" items. The tedium of leveling each and every class is draining, and I have yet to complete the process despite my playtime.\n-Those same high level items are mostly timesinks, as they require absurdly large amounts of resources to acquire or need a max level class to make/use.\n-Beyond what's necessary to build blueprints and acquire passive skills, the classes you can level are non-unique and essentially the same. Once you have a class at level 60, you are "max" level. Level all 7 classes to 60 and you are "max" rank. No further progression is possible or even useful.\n-Building some structures/items requires leveling particular classes or acquiring rare blueprints, which can be boring solo and at best tedious with a group.\n-PVE is a joke. More of a time sink than a real threat. Except for turtles. Those things will murder you unceasingly.\n-PVP is both interesting and unfair. While any level person can kill a higher level player, the difference in armor and weapons is often the decidng factor. Added to this is odd visual and connection lag that can make PVP a nightmare. You need groups/friends to stand a chance, and the most powerful elemental blueprints are from PVP.\n-Only way to reliably protect your base is with a shield generator and power generator. While these can be filled with enough wood to last 12 days, they are limited in range, and any large construction project requires extensive planning to survive the first person to walk by with a desire for destruction.\n-Glitching is still a reality, and people regularly try to exploit spawn and permission errors to destroy bases. The Devs do work on fixing these, but not every problem can be solved.\n-Tutorial is basic, and decidedly unhelpful for the main aspects of the game. You are essentially requried to figure out what to do next, including how to protect your base from raiders, get new items, level/use skills, etc.\n-No solo experience. While playing solo is possible, without friends to help or others to explain and teach you, the game will likely be frustrating and boring until you figure out what you want to do with it.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the time I spend planning and building bases, with the everpresent threat of pvp to keep me sharp. Though I enjoyed the initial discovery of items, planets, and resources, it eventually became a mere grind to get the levels or stores of resources I needed for the end-game items and I ended up focusing more on construction than "progression".\n\nA decent game. Imperfect, but fun if played with friends (or with people you meet in the game). A unique concept where leveling is included, but that novelty soon wears thin and all that's left is constructing bases or killing other players for no real gain.\n","December 22, 2015","true","378.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If in the futurue, this game becomes something more than what it is now 5/12/2016, and if I enjoy it in the future then I will switch my "No" to a "Yes". I would like this game to move away from survival by only slightly improving the survival system here and there. I think this game has an agreeable foundation on which to build an RPG on. While this is no easy task, what I would like to see includes the following (and more):\n\n-Villages/cities/holdouts with interesting NPCs, maybe a notice board, a few shops in each hold, NPCs that give out BOUNTY quests, etc...\n-A wider variety of weapons and gear, many should be customizable to an extent.\n-Unique skills\n-Unique attributes\n-Unique movesets\n-More monsters\nWhat this game has right now in my opinion is a foundation for a great RPG/ARPG game. Thus, I cannot give this game a thumbs up, just based off its current state.","May 12","false","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is quite a grind, now this isn't always bad I like some, but in this case it is.  While there are multiple planets to explore and farm, the enemies and npc's are mostly the same on every planet.  While leveling, mob's only take 1-3 hits to kill you even with appropriate gear.  You may very well wear your left click out on your mouse playing this game.  Farming wood/ore/etc. is slow, there are so many items that will only be used once to craft a gun or gear you'll constantly be leaving trash items.  Which comes to the next negative, loot used to float to you and auto pick up after a kill.  Now little boxes are left from each mob for you to look through to try to get only what you want.  During an event this isn't going to happen, you'll die trying to sort loot.\n\nThe game does do some things uniquely, but overall the gameplay tends to get old pretty quick.  Building is limited to premade structures to place near/on each other.  Surviving is just keeping a bubble shield up on dangerous planets, if you are low on stamina/health you can dance at a campfire instead of eating to refill.  Crafting you'll have to farm mob's over and over for blueprints, but you'll be doing that to level all the jobs anyway.  You'll make ammo, it drops off mobs, but not as fast as you'll click.\n\nGraphics options are pretty limited, but you can edit your files if you feel comfortable doing that, I had to in order to get better FPS.  This game does not seem to play well with AMD GPU's, many reports of graphics glitches on good cards, I've had quite a few using an AMD A10.  Minor ones such as white outline/shadows and more major where 2/3rd's of the screen is blocked.  This game will eat RAM and CPU like nothing, over 8 gigs of ram in single player.\n\nAs for replayability, my hours were put into both the original and "Reborn" as well as editing some of the files to play more the way I liked.  Still this was a game I rarely found myself playing, most hours played at first purchase and maybe 20-30 after Reborn.  If you like PvP or have a group of people to play with you may like it, PvE just feels lacking in this game even tweaking the guns/tools/etc. still left something to be desired.","November 26, 2015","false","109.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Really fun, and I continue to play it. But I have to downvote it.\n\nWhy? Because the question is "Do you recommend this game?" And with such a toxic community that exists on official servers I honestly cannot.\n\nNew players are griefed, players destroy bases without provocation and for no reason whatsoever. The moon is a no go zone under pain of death for any low rank player (despite the fact you need to go here to progress).\n\nAll that happens is you hit a player generated wall of difficulty that should not exist. But is created by the usual survival game=mugging simulator mentality. The sort of mentality that exists to overcome probably real life issues that these players no doubt have. Or simply to enlarge their Twitch eDing-a-ling. Players then will most likely quit through boredom of not being able to progress. And before early access is over I am sure the playerbase will eventually kill itself off.\n\nHowever even if you do progress (and this is an Alpha comment so I do not say this as a main problem) There is not much more to see enemies are merely recolorations or each other. And all that is new is perhaps a different resource to grind at (while other players constantly mug you for it.) And maybe you are doing this in an environment that is as toxic as the players.\n\nIn my opinion the method to fix this game is a dualing system rather than a mugging system and/or any player under general rank 20 should be unable to harm other players or be harmed by them. That way newbies can at least have a brief starter respite from getting shot realising the toxicity and refunding their game. The rest is Alpha is Alpha issues which I am sure content will be improved upon over time. But in my opinion wait this one out until Beta or maybe even Full Release.","November 29, 2015","false","58.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They game just started, give it some time. If you want to play a polished product, wait a year until the game gets released, i can't stand people who complain about such stuff when they're playing an Early Access game.\nThe game is polished for what it is right now.\n\nIn order to pass some areas, you will first need to find a blueprint for special equipment, needed to stay on specific areas for prolonged times, such as desert, because you get too hot and start to take damage.\n\nWhat is great, is because the game is somewhat Sci-Fi, it has features such as lasers to protect your surroundings, and you can always find your base, wherever you go! Because it tells you coordinates of your Uplink (Respawn point) and other coordinates such as the last cave you visited, and so on. If you're in big trouble and really need to get out of the place, you can use a teleporter, but that costs resources to make, but no worries, after being just in one cave, you'd have enough to stack for your whole lifetime.\n\nSo to explore, it takes some time, you can't just pass through freezing, or hot areas, or fly to the moon and expect your lungs to endure for some magical reason! You need right equipment for your traveling.\n\nThe Good:\n\nMusic\nArt\nAbility to craft\nJobs\nMultiple Worlds\nPets\nAbilities\n\nThe bad:\n\nBugs, glitches (Duh)\nAnything that is related to the Early Access\n\nThe meh:\n\nWhen you and your friend decide to play the game, your first hour of the game will not be playing together, because you will be in different worlds. Way to overcome that is to collect resources, create stargate to home worlds, and power it up via generator, you'll need bluerints for those, but after an hour or two of hunting you'll be ready to create one. If you happen to be on the same world, but not close, make a flare gun and shoot it, using F, and your friend should see a lighting beam with your name on it.\n\nBut i can understand why it is done, it is to balance the population between the worlds, hopefully, the amount of worlds on single server will be decreased, because game sometimes feels lonely! Having ~60 people split across multiple home worlds makes it feel like im playing alone 70% of the time.\n\n\nOverall i enjoy the game, and i recommend it to you too. Get it, while on sale, play for under 2 hours, if you really dislike it, refund it!\nBut honestly i recommend this game even at full price.\n\nIt may take time to experience everything, but it's totally worth it.\nNow the community is good, I answer any questions newcomes may ask, only after having a few hours into the game i have learned quiet a bit, and i am happy to help, always looking at the chat for questions, as i understand how frustrating it may be, i try to support the community as much as possible.\n\nI hope the game for prolonged success, it really has potential, but there are always people who really ignore the fact that this is an Early Access game, and just plain stupid.\nAnd also people with different taste, that i respect, but if people have different taste, why download the game type you do not like, then leave a negative review just because YOU don't like it on your personal preferences rather than objectivity..?\n\nEither way, have fun.\nEnjoy.\n\n","November 13, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the notion of having to go out and gather blueprints to craft new items (though this gets a little tiresome at times when waiting for certain blueprints to drop). There are a few things I would like to see improved, such as cave spawns (it takes forever to even get through the lower-level dungeons due to the rate of monster respawns, especially in small enclosed spaces with little mauverablility), and more efficient armour (the armour items available early on the game barely feel like they help reduce any amount of damage). I'd also like to see the implementation of craftable waypoints, to be able to mark the coordinates of wherever they're dropped (this may or may not be something that's craftable, but I haven't found anything fitting this yet).\n\nOverall though I feel that the game has lots of opportunity to add and expand as it continues along in its development, and I look forward to its future improvements. For the price being asked for the game (especially as it's on sale at the moment), I feel it's worth the purchase.","November 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But after only 9 hours of gameplay I already feel like I got my Moneys worth. If you are hesitating about buying this game. Dont.

Very Polished for an early access game.\nStunning graphics.\nNice crafting system.\nNice tutorials.\neverything is easy to understand (I didnt have to spend hours reading up on how to play the game).\nMassive planets to explore which enclude caverns and moons.\nGuns, Land Vehicles, Spaceships.\nWorld Bosses.\nNice loot system.\nbase building is a dream. (again nothing too complicated).\nDungeons.\n\nCons:\nA little bit grindy. Takes a while to get the blueprints you need.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rarnd/recommended/332500/","Rarnd","Maw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rarnd/","264 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA good survival game with good RPG elements. Very polished animations, very pretty. Also, unlike Rust/ARK, if you're killed, you do not lose everything! You only lose large amounts of your resources/gear/etc. if you have already been killing players. This means if you're a passive player on a PvP server, you will lose minimal amount of resources upon death - that's it. If you go around killing people, you will get skulls following you, letting other players know that you have been killing people and are basically a walking loot crate. I enjoy this concept.\n\nThis is a good EA game but it remains to be an EA game that I hope will come to fruition and do well in the future.\n\nOn the subject of the game currently being a "Mixed" review - this is due to the free weekend and people moaning about grinding.\n\nLet me tell you about "Grinding"\n\nYes, you need to kill things to get blueprints, EXP, and some resources.\n\nYes, you need to gather items by farming Trees, Fossils, Ores, and other resources.\n\nYes, if you're on your own, this can become very tedious.\n\nIf you do not like gathering or killing creatures to level up and gain new equipment, this game is not for you. This game is meant to be played with friends, not on your own.\n\nThe free weekend may have damaged this games review rating but always take Steam reviews with a handful of salt - this game takes time to invest and you will not experience all it has to offer in a single free weekend.\n\nIf you like Rust, ARK, Minecraft, 7 Days To Die, etc. then certainly give this game a shot - it's pretty, it works well, it's pretty relaxing, it's a good game.\n\n","November 15, 2015","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The same monsters are everywhere (with recolors) and it totally kills the feeling of "I'm in a different place than before". Dungeons need unique bosses. Planets need unique monsters and unique dungeons.\n- No endgame.\n- * Graphic settings are incomplete.

I am of mixed emotions over this game.\nThe Idea of the game on the outside is great. Finally an MMO based game that gives you the single player choice and let not go on how big it is because I'm yet to even set foot off the 1st planet. That being said the reason why is because even after they said they fixed the fps rate for single player. I am spawned into a slow, scattered paced world which is very annoying with the glitching soundtrack in the background like someone turning the volum on and off every second and lets not get started with going online and playing because thats just a slaughter house of bad bandwith and overloading. The only good fun times I have in the game so far are in the desert and inside some dungeons ( maybe because it doesn't have so much ♥♥♥♥ going on in the background that you can't adjust in the options like other normal games eg: Load distance ).\nConstructing is fun and a great idea too (If you like building something then blowing it up and then building the same thing on top just so you can get the walls right).\nAlso lets not get started on how damaging it is on my computers RAM even 10 minutes after shutting the game down.\n\nAll n all It's a good game for VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS.\nBut needs to start focusing on fixing the problems instead of saying that they did.","November 2, 2015","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you want to play a polished product, wait a year until the game gets released, i can't stand people who complain about such stuff when they're playing an Early Access game.\nThe game is polished for what it is right now.\n\nIn order to pass some areas, you will first need to find a blueprint for special equipment, needed to stay on specific areas for prolonged times, such as desert, because you get too hot and start to take damage.\n\nWhat is great, is because the game is somewhat Sci-Fi, it has features such as lasers to protect your surroundings, and you can always find your base, wherever you go! Because it tells you coordinates of your Uplink (Respawn point) and other coordinates such as the last cave you visited, and so on. If you're in big trouble and really need to get out of the place, you can use a teleporter, but that costs resources to make, but no worries, after being just in one cave, you'd have enough to stack for your whole lifetime.\n\nSo to explore, it takes some time, you can't just pass through freezing, or hot areas, or fly to the moon and expect your lungs to endure for some magical reason! You need right equipment for your traveling.\n\nThe Good:\n\nMusic\nArt\nAbility to craft\nJobs\nMultiple Worlds\nPets\nAbilities\n\nThe bad:\n\nBugs, glitches (Duh)\nAnything that is related to the Early Access\n\nThe meh:\n\nWhen you and your friend decide to play the game, your first hour of the game will not be playing together, because you will be in different worlds. Way to overcome that is to collect resources, create stargate to home worlds, and power it up via generator, you'll need bluerints for those, but after an hour or two of hunting you'll be ready to create one. If you happen to be on the same world, but not close, make a flare gun and shoot it, using F, and your friend should see a lighting beam with your name on it.\n\nBut i can understand why it is done, it is to balance the population between the worlds, hopefully, the amount of worlds on single server will be decreased, because game sometimes feels lonely! Having ~60 people split across multiple home worlds makes it feel like im playing alone 70% of the time.\n\n\nOverall i enjoy the game, and i recommend it to you too. Get it, while on sale, play for under 2 hours, if you really dislike it, refund it!\nBut honestly i recommend this game even at full price.\n\nIt may take time to experience everything, but it's totally worth it.\nNow the community is good, I answer any questions newcomes may ask, only after having a few hours into the game i have learned quiet a bit, and i am happy to help, always looking at the chat for questions, as i understand how frustrating it may be, i try to support the community as much as possible.\n\nI hope the game for prolonged success, it really has potential, but there are always people who really ignore the fact that this is an Early Access game, and just plain stupid.\nAnd also people with different taste, that i respect, but if people have different taste, why download the game type you do not like, then leave a negative review just because YOU don't like it on your personal preferences rather than objectivity..?\n\nEither way, have fun.\nEnjoy.\n\n","November 13, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the notion of having to go out and gather blueprints to craft new items (though this gets a little tiresome at times when waiting for certain blueprints to drop). There are a few things I would like to see improved, such as cave spawns (it takes forever to even get through the lower-level dungeons due to the rate of monster respawns, especially in small enclosed spaces with little mauverablility), and more efficient armour (the armour items available early on the game barely feel like they help reduce any amount of damage). I'd also like to see the implementation of craftable waypoints, to be able to mark the coordinates of wherever they're dropped (this may or may not be something that's craftable, but I haven't found anything fitting this yet).\n\nOverall though I feel that the game has lots of opportunity to add and expand as it continues along in its development, and I look forward to its future improvements. For the price being asked for the game (especially as it's on sale at the moment), I feel it's worth the purchase.","November 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But after only 9 hours of gameplay I already feel like I got my Moneys worth. If you are hesitating about buying this game. Dont. This might be early access but I must say it is the most polished and well presented one to date.\n\nPros:\nPrice\nNo Major Bugs. Very Polished for an early access game.\nStunning graphics.\nNice crafting system.\nNice tutorials.\neverything is easy to understand (I didnt have to spend hours reading up on how to play the game).\nMassive planets to explore which enclude caverns and moons.\nGuns, Land Vehicles, Spaceships.\nWorld Bosses.\nNice loot system.\nbase building is a dream. (again nothing too complicated).\nDungeons.\n\nCons:\nA little bit grindy. Takes a while to get the blueprints you need. But this is a survival game and to be honest with you it wouldnt be as fun if you didnt have to work a little for your gear/upgrades.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone waiting for no mans sky.","November 13, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rarnd/recommended/332500/","Rarnd","Maw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rarnd/","264 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA good survival game with good RPG elements. Very polished animations, very pretty. Also, unlike Rust/ARK, if you're killed, you do not lose everything! You only lose large amounts of your resources/gear/etc. if you have already been killing players. This means if you're a passive player on a PvP server, you will lose minimal amount of resources upon death - that's it. If you go around killing people, you will get skulls following you, letting other players know that you have been killing people and are basically a walking loot crate. I enjoy this concept.\n\nThis is a good EA game but it remains to be an EA game that I hope will come to fruition and do well in the future.\n\nOn the subject of the game currently being a "Mixed" review - this is due to the free weekend and people moaning about grinding.\n\nLet me tell you about "Grinding"\n\nYes, you need to kill things to get blueprints, EXP, and some resources.\n\nYes, you need to gather items by farming Trees, Fossils, Ores, and other resources.\n\nYes, if you're on your own, this can become very tedious.\n\nIf you do not like gathering or killing creatures to level up and gain new equipment, this game is not for you. This game is meant to be played with friends, not on your own.\n\nThe free weekend may have damaged this games review rating but always take Steam reviews with a handful of salt - this game takes time to invest and you will not experience all it has to offer in a single free weekend.\n\nIf you like Rust, ARK, Minecraft, 7 Days To Die, etc. then certainly give this game a shot - it's pretty, it works well, it's pretty relaxing, it's a good game.\n\n","November 15, 2015","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
