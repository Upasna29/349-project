I paid for the game, a whole game, not a beta test or a DLC, the whole game.\n\nHad I bought a beta then I wouldn't be writing this, heck, I'd be praising it. But I didn't, so I can't.\n\nThere's been an absolute shedload of patches and updates since the game came out little over a month ago, so I'm kinda glad I didn't buy it at release as I would have been majorly angry / disappointed. I'm also quite surprised that some pretty major issues haven't been addressed at this time.\n\nLike I say, I'll get around to addressing my woes to the devs at some point, but as I'm a little busy with work and suchlike at the moment I don't see why I'll effectively be doing a job that should have been done properly and by someone else in the first place.\n\nI play games for enjoyment and to de-stress and unwind, not get angry and be turned into a unpaid beta-tester.\n\nThis will probably be a great game at some point and when that happens I'll change my review accordingly, but for now I'd recommend waiting until a few more patches have come out.\n\nAnd by a few I mean a lot.","May 22, 2015","false","139.8"," 409 of 460 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","409","460","18","18"

I read the reviews, and saw that the developer was busy fixing the many bugs, and decided to take the chance that the game would still be buggy.  A little background first:\n\nI love space games like Master of Orion 2.  I bought this game when it was 66% off, and right after patch 1.2 went live.  With that said, here are my thoughts:\n\nPros:\n-This game is basically Master of Orion 2.1.  To say that this game is inspired by MoO2 would be the understatement of the century.  The gameplay is copied, the tech tree is copied, and even the race customization options are copied directly from MoO2.  This is not a bad thing, but it was surprising.  I really love MoO2, but this game is only slightly different and expanded compared to MoO2.\n-The art is pretty good.  Better than MoO2.\n\nCons:\n-Buggy as hell.  And not in the weird technical-glitch kind of way.  Simple stuff that should have been caught by the bug-checkers.  Your planets will be invaded, but you won't have any troops, so there is no way to start the battle.  You must exit and load an auto-save.  Enemy ships fly off the edge of the screen in space combat mode.  You must retreat (lose) the battle.  You conquer an enemy civilization but somehow the planet doesn't get captured.  It just sits there, uncolonizable and unconquerable.\n-Interface is really finicky.  When zoomed way out, there's like a 2x2 pixel range on which you have to click to select a planet.  Lots of other little stuff like that that makes the experience less than seamless.\n\nConclusions:\nDO NOT BUY.  Wait for the bugs to be fixed.  This game is at Alpha level at best.  The good news is that the developer is actively fixing bugs.  The bad news is that they are also working on an expansion.  This is going to seriously detract from the bug-fixing, and will probably introduce a bunch of new bugs too.  Not a great sign.\n","November 22, 2015","false","105.7"," 414 of 469 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","414","469","8","9"

WOHAAAA! Great! it's like MOO2, but with everything better: Cooler ship design, better tech thingies, more exploration, tactical combat, flavorful events. Terriffic!\n\nThe downside, and for me the number one reason to never play again (Please, make a patch, expansion, DLC, ANYTHING): there is only one way to win: total conquest. So after hours of playing I have to destroy my friends. No economic, diplomatic, cultural, 'who has the most bunnies' or anoher origional victory at all.\n\nSo I own 60% of the planets, the biggest fleet and most technical advancements (Ok, I was playing 'normal', sue me) and have to spend hours conquering planets. No fun at all.\n\nOne small thing when you're make a patch: Please give an end-of-turn warning when a planet is doing nothing or convert the excess labor in coins or anything. It's frustrating to discover after 5-6 turns you forgot to give one planet new construction orders.\n\nWhen the victory thingie is solved, it will be a A+ recommendation from me!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSebastiaan.\n","May 26, 2015","false","31.8"," 214 of 262 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","214","262","13","12"

This means that you will meet other races pretty quickly and all of a sudden are rushing production as the AI appears to be able to pull fleets out of it's hat at will.  This turns what should be a strategic game into a "I can field more ships than you" slugfest.  The various ( we want to eat your granny ) type races ensure that diplomacy is no more than an afterthought and certainly not a means to an end as they will attack you anyway.\n\nI decided not to recommend this game as there are better 4x titles out there.  For those that want strategic depth without worrying too much about graphics there is distant worlds.  For those that want the 3D combat coupled with decent strategy there is Sots or Sots 2.  For those that want an RTS feel there is Sins of a Solar Empire or Star ruler 2 and for those that want a more traditional 4x then Galciv 3 is just around the corner.  SD2 tries hard but it doesn't excell at anything and in what is becoming an ever more packed marketplace it is doomed to fall by the wayside.  That is not to say that it can never rise to the top.  With more development, larger maps, much better diplomatic systems and better strategy overall it could be a winner.  At the moment though, close but no cigar.\n\nWith Sector Zero DLC:\nI didn't think it possible that this game could be any less desirable than it is already but I was wrong.  Sector Zero takes what was already there ( and flawed ) and adds a liberal dose of absolute boredom while not repairing or addressing any of the previous ♥♥♥♥ed up systems.  Diplomacy is still ♥♥♥♥, The Ai can still create fleets out of nothing etc. etc.  To the developer I can simply say:\n\nYou obviously have talent.  You obviously have some good ideas and a fertile imagination but ffs bring a few more people in so that you can bounce some of those ideas off them and gain different perspectives.  Maybe then you will end up with a product worth playing instead of this pile od detritus.","April 9, 2015","false","9.3"," 772 of 1,042 people (74%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","74","772","1","42","50"

Then I turned the space wolves core systems into a zombie infested plague quarantine zone and retook Earth with space eel-cannon-armed-battleships produced by my new robot servants. After that the samurai space bears started a border war with me and things got interesting.\n\n10/10 would terrorize the galaxy again with zombie plague fleet mounting space-eel-cannons.\n\n\nSeriously though, this is a good game. Great? No. Good? Yes. Bugs? Yes, but they are consistently being stomped and progress is happening quickly.\nA little bit about me, I have played probably every major space 4X game made. MoO1-3, Space Empires 2-5, Galactic Civilizations 1-2, Sword of the Stars 1-2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Imperium Galactica 2, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, and many many more. I also was a Beta Tester for a couple of the Distant Worlds expansions and you can see my name in the credits. So you could say that I have been around the space 4X block, and I really enjoy this game, warts and all. Let me break it down a little. Keep in mind the next few things throughout my review:\n\nA - this game is made by one developer (goes by the handle "Zero"), and he contracts out art, music, and other assets. So very indie.\nB - this game is only $20+ at time of review, and as an owner of StarDrive1 I got a discount (so no ♥♥♥♥♥ing about having to pay for a new game if you bought SD1, and yes this game is a huge leap forward and worth the price). What's my point? This game is arguably as interesting as Civ Beyond Earth, and a fraction of the price, so lots of value for the money.\nC - I am comparing this game to other space 4X games in each category, not other genres.\nD - I have read some reviews where players claim that the AI is cheating, I think they just didn't RTFM and don't realize that there are mechanics like TAXATION that can net players and AI lots of cash to supports massive fleets and cash negative planets with.\n\n\nGraphics 9/10 - This isn't Halo4, but man this game LOOKS GOOD for a space 4X! Great colors and effects, and the ships and artwork are clean and stylish. Explosions and weapon effects are slick. IMHO best looking space 4X in a while. The only weak point is the ground combat doesn't look very good. Would have preferred the ground combat from MoO2, even now the most epic looking space 4X ground combat.\n\nSound 8/10 - This game has an epic sound track that I didn't tire of easily. Weapon effects like different thuds as mass drivers hit armor or shields brings the combat to life. Quite adequate.\n\nDiplomatic AI 7/10 - This game has a great feature where there is a threshold on how many deals you can make with another faction that keeps you from spamming tech trades or going from being complete strangers in to becoming instant besties like in the Master of Orion series and most 4X games. The main drawback here is that the other empires just don't feel as alive as they could, but to be honest this is a huge problem with most 4X games. The main one that does it better is GalCiv2, man that AI was dastardly! I will note that as of yesterday (4/24/15) Zero released a patch that works on my of the Diplo AI's issues so this is definitely something that will get better with time.\n\nStrategic Fleet AI 8/10 - Your opponents don't quite feel as alive as they could, but man are they AGGRESSIVE, and I am not just talking about declaring war. This is the first space 4X in a long time where the AI contantly pounces on my undefended systems (and INVADES the planets successfully) and aggressively engages my fleets. Enemy fleets could coordinate a little better, and upgrade their ships more often, but overall the Strategic Fleet AI is solid.\n\nShip Customization 9/10 - Dude this game is seriously cool, like Gratuitous Space Battles mixed with Master of Orion. Love the ship customization, the only drawback here is that SOMETIMES the AI doesnt pick great ships to build. The other minor gripe is that not every race's ships are created equally, some races have more spaces on their ships for components, etc.\n\nMap 9/10 - Two of the four "X"s are Explore and Exploit, well this game has fun mechanics that really support this. Meaningful wormholes with interesting placement, space monsters, pirates (human themed space monsters), Orion... I mean Master raiders are there and there are rewards to be gained once they are defeated. Also, planets can have specials like having deep caves, dangerous fauna, strategic resources that give your empire a boost, etc. In addition there are minor races that you can trade with, hire mercs from, or attack and subjugate.\n\nGround Combat 6/10 - This feature just isn't there yet. It has the potential to be very advance wars or XCOM, but instead it is just kinda underdeveloped and a bit of a slog. I would suggest Auto-Battling until this is fixed in a patch or in a Mod, which is sure to happen and would be pretty easy to flesh out.\n\nTech Tree 9/10 - This is very closely based on the Master of Orion model, including the core concept that you can only research one of three techs at each level of research and can only trade or steal for the ones that you didn't research. This is assuming that someone researched a tech, and often one tech isn't researched and so you can have a game where some techs aren't available. There are a few nice features that earn this high score. One, you can often unlock secret research projects by doing things like killing a space monster and dragging it's corpse in for research. Two, each race has hidden techs specific to it.  Three, at the end of each tech tree are a choice of two advances that you can take over and over again that give you meaningful benefits like increased ship speed, weapon damage, diplomacy boosts, shield strength, etc. There are also references to one of my favorite scifi book series "Old Man's War", so kudos to the dev.\n\nEnd Game 8/10 - Currently there is no allied victory condition, but Zero posted as of the latest patch that he will be adding that in. No victory animation or movie (like the slick one in Master of Orion 2), or Civ style map replay (which would be really cool to relive the adventure), nor a power graph screen, but it does rank you versus fictional SciFi chracters (I was ranked Picard); funny I dont recall seeing Kirk or Blackjack Geary listed, what a shame.\n\nModding Support 8/10 - As of right now the game has Steam Workshop but it isn't listed like normal, you have to navigate to the Workshop tab and search plug-ins to see them. Alternatively you can head over to the game's forums on the dev's website. StarDrive1 benefitted heavily from player made content and I suspect that this game will too. Unfortunately at time of review there is no integrated mod loading menu like in SD1, not sure of dev plans but I hope this is added sooner than later and that the Steam Workshop works correctly soon.\n\nStability and Bugs 8/10 - Small bugs, but no crashes, and not too surprising considering that the game is so indie but looks and feels so high budget. Some people report framerate issues, but I have experienced none. I have an i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM, Nvidia card. Make sure to keep your drivers up to date!\n\nThere is more here than I have listed, like a really in-depth medal and experience system where your ships can level up and earn medals through various combat exploits, which give them relevant bonuses (ie: Purple Heart, if your ship survives after being reduced to 35% health, whenever that happens in the future it takes 10% less damage). There are fun missions, and funny alien empire dialogues, overall this game is really great for around $20 at time of release.","April 25, 2015","true","58.3"," 208 of 275 people (76%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","76","208","275","63","15"

Improves on it, then changes the game into more of  a traditional 4X experience, with turn based game play.\n\nThe Good:\nShip design - This is very deep with a level of subtlety and customization which no other game seems to have, at least in terms of whats on your ships and how they behave in combat.\n\nPersonallity - The races all have distinct ship models and very distinct personallities. There is a bit of cheesy humour in the game and allot of pop culture referencing which is worth a laugh. *spoiler* I got to weld guns to a t-rex's head and then use it to eat people!!!*\n\nAI - After about 8 hours I have come to appreciate the difficulty of the AI, they wait till your fleets are out of position and attack core worlds, will try and undermine you diplomatically and have varied personallities ranging from homicidal to just the nicest little plant people ever. They also seem to adapt to your ship building strategies and it seems very difficult to cheese the AI in this game.\n\nEmpire Management - This is HARD and requires allot of thought. Managing some worlds to be food producing worlds and others to be ship producers or science worlds is an interesting balance and sometimes having more population on your homeworld is not the best choice. This means that a variety of adaptive stratagies are required, absed on your surroundings. This adds allot of replayabillity as games can vary wildly.\n\nFleet Combat - very pretty, plenty of strategy and a bit of point and click. Not one of those games where i want to autoresolve every battle.\n\nThe Bad\n\nGround combat - Can still be fun but is not quite up to the standard or polish that the rest of the game seems to have. There is however a suprising degree of strategy in what looks at first to be a very simple minigame. Especially when you take the variability of some of the races into account. I freaked out when i realized the squid men could squirt ink into peoples eyes......\n\nSome balance on certain weapons - Overall ship modules are well balanced with few weapons ever truly becoming obsolete which is AWESOME. However there are some modules (Im looking at you plasma cannons) which could really use a buff.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nHaters - There are ALLOT of haters after some of the issues with SD1. Personally I can see where they are coming from but i easily got my 30 bucks worth outa the game. BUT i swear i am sick to death of the illiterate streams of untruthfull vitriol that get posted about this series. This is the onlly reason i wrote this review. I am a busy person, but i got so sick of all the polarized BS i felt i had to write something.\n\nTo Sum-up: Stardrive 2 is a difficult game with a steep learining curve that has deep and rewarding systems. Its not for the feebleminded. Some of the production values in certain areas of the game are a little low but otherwise it feels like a AAA game. I would heartily reccomend this game to any lover of 4x or grand strategy games and to anyone as obsessive as i am about building the deadliest ship ever.","April 10, 2015","true","121.8"," 258 of 350 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","258","350","8","5"

Not.  Nope.\n4) Ugly and moderately difficult ground battle in an ultra-simplified Xcom style\n5) Most of all though falling for this twice.  Twice.  It's one thing to make a bad choice.

Moreover it is so blatant about it that it feels like it is flirting with the breaking the fourth wall not something I am a huge fan of.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential in the ship design and strategic aspect of space and ground combat and the level of depth that it allows you to manipulate your empire.\n\nI will say that it was better than MOO III in general fun and striking a balance between allowing depth and getting carried away with it.\n\nMy big gripes about the game are as follows.\n\nTechnological advance doesn't yield significant upgrades until you get very very far along in the trees.  I almost always had better luck researching a few basic (tier one or two technologies), the pumping everything into producion ships and troops and conquering the galaxy without ever doing more than cursory reasearch.\n\nThe AI literally cheats on basic settings, I have tested rich homeworlds on small maps with optimized industrial output and the AI will invariably massively outcolonize me and outproduce me (in terms of fleet and fleet size) very quickly in the early game.  You can still win by being clever or cheesy in your builds, but the fact that it literally plays by a different set of rules on default settings really really bothers me.\n\nThe technologies are poorly balanced to create a stable empire.  The game forces you specialize each of your planets because of prohibitive maintanence costs (making one planet that has all upgrades and buildings your empire is capable of will put a big dent in your wallet).  Basically I find myself skipping almost all of my unlocked buildings on most colonies just because of what it costs to maintain them.  The way various technolgies interact and overlap with each other just makes a lot of them feel useless or redundant or only of use on a very small proportion of your colonies.\n\nI do think the game has a whole lot of potential and with some patches or balance changes could be more fun.  Essentially my complaint it that it forces you to play in one of a few very specific ways if you want to avoid getting wiping out quickly on default difficulty.  It felt more like how well can I implement this strategy which I know will be the only viable one for this map/race selection rather than what type of empire would I like to build this time. It feels like the game has mechanics for amazing strategies and fun but makes it impossible for you to implement them before you have already taken control of the map.\n\nBottom Line I just didn't have fun playing it.","April 13, 2015","false","9.3"," 156 of 215 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","156","215","5","4"

However, if you want to play a more peaceful or diplomatic game then I would not recommend it as it’s really not possible to play that way at the moment.\n\nThe Good\nThere are various early game opponents and some events with nods to sci-fi fans.\n\nThe AI is strong early game and I had to reload during my first game a few times to improve my strategy before winning on Normal difficulty.\n\nThe technology tree really does feel like Master of Orion 2 and I enjoyed mulling over the options.\n\nThe Battle Arena has been good fun to test designs and weapons and the combat is generally a highlight.\n\nI've encountered no major bugs and while there were some minor bugs, there was nothing gamebreaking.\n\nIn some ways it is an improved game over Stardrive 1 but there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nThe Bad\nThe technologies and weapons need to be better balanced.  Once you've tested them in the Battle Arena it becomes apparent some are worthless.\n\nThe late game is really tedious.  Colony governors are needed particularly for the mid to late game as it becomes micro intensive.  There are no defaults for troop loadouts so you have to do every one manually.  Late game AI ship designs are very weak so the battles become trivial and nowhere near as much fun as the early game.\n\nThe ground combat is weak.  Automatic resolution comes at a high price as it leads to excessive losses compared to manual combat even when you have a massive advantage, so it essentially forces the lame ground combat or bombardment to avoid it.\n\nThe AI’s are far too aggressive in responding to expansion.  The AI's are very similar and it's difficult to avoid anything other than Total War.  The tolerance mechanic used in diplomacy is good but needs to be increased as currently diplomacy is a bit of a side show.\n\nBrutal difficulty is not hard enough once you get familiar.  In fact once you learn the mechanics this is the easiest 4X game I can remember.\n\nThe Lowdown\nI had a lot of fun with the early game and Battle Arena.  As a result of the time I've played the game, I'll stick with a recommend, but without more serious improvements I don't see myself wanting to load the game up again (and I tend to play genuinely good 4X games much longer than this).","April 12, 2015","true","406.2"," 125 of 169 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","125","169","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TonkRogerio/recommended/252450/","TonkRogerio","TonkRogerio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TonkRogerio/","769 products in account","One of the best 4x games to come out in a long time. SD2 has phenomenal game design philosophy...in Most parts.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nShip design:- This is by far the best ship building feature off of any 4x game excluding the original which manages to outdo this one just ever so slightly. You manage everything within your ship in a FUN way. This is the problem with a lot of other 4x games with ship building, they add a ton of things you can do, but it doesn't feel fun. You're just moving numbers about. In SD", you get to see exactly where your components go, why they go there is completely up to your combat logic. You want to create massive artillery ships with weak armour and then create some up close and personal heavy shielded and armoured heavy hitters to protect the artillery? Easy. Then when you've built your ship with a specific class in mind, you get to see how it plays out in battle.\n\nCombat:- Superb combat. The action takes place as an RTS. You get to build your fleet in factories after you're done designing it, then put them together in a fleet. When that fleet meets an enemy fleet, you enter into an RTS strategy map where you can plan out your manoeuvres in real time or with a pause function. There is some UI issues which I'll go over in "THE BAD" section. My only other complaint besides the UI is that there really isn't anything to interact with in these battles. An asteroid battle or having to battle over your home planet, trying to make choices of attacking the ships that can kill your ships, or attacking the bombers that can kill your population would make an excellent addition to the ship combat. As it stands it's awesome, but with a few wasted oportunities.\n\nEvents:- Another thing that SD2 outclasses everything else on. Events make you feel like you're really managing your empire. In most 4x games you see something on the map, get the reward and off you go to the next one. In SD2, you can find things that intertwine within other concepts of the game. For example, you can find a world where dinosaurs live in. So you now get a new research project to mount guns on the dinosaurs... There are quests you can find, the usual $50 from every other 4x game, and events that  happen because of your own doing. Create too much pollution on a farm world and your crops are dust for a few turns. Build a ship production line on a lava planet and you might just find a new way to make hulls more durable using that planet's natural resources. Events make the universe come alive and it follows choices and consequences in a logical and believable way for the player.\n\nTech:- At first I was disappointed with the tech tree. I've been let down so many times in 4x games before, that when I saw videos of it pre-release, I just thought there wasn't enough there. Well I was wrong. The choices you make in tech are really meaningful. You have to pick one tech out of a couple of choices and you never get to pick the other tech again. You can trade for it with other empires, or steal it from them using spies, or taking over their planets with a specific trait or tech. This makes trading for tech pretty important. But even though you never research all the techs, there are so many that you will be researching for days. You also get new techs that come up due to events in the game. Found a strange asteroid? Tow it back to earth for a new research project. Colonized a planet with a specific negative attribute? New tech (My only complaint is that these don't exist for every planet with negative attributes). Found a wormhole next to a research planet? New tech. You get the point. I really hope that this feature gets expanded on in a future update though.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nUI:- There needs to be a more user friendly interface. It does a lot of stuff right, like showing information most of the time for example, but in combat, it fails miserably. Why can't you highlight all of your ships and have their powers show up at the bottom so you can click on all of them instead of each one individually? Same with troops. Why do I have to waste time loading combat with my scout, just to wait for him to retreat? Why can't you drag all of your ships and place them in a different location before the battle starts (or even save a formation for your fleet?!?!??) Why can't you click on an enemy troop with your troop selected for an automatic attack with your main weapon? Why can't your melee troops auto run and then attack when you click on an enemy soldier with your troop selected? Things like this are just not acceptable in this age of gaming. An almost catastrophic oversight in SD2.\n\nGround Combat:- This is not fun. It's OK, but it's not fun. Most of the problems come from the UI. So once that's fixed, we can begin to enjoy the simplistic nature of this minigame. Maybe an expansion should really concentrate on adding more to this mechanic.\n\nAI:- the AI cheats. We all know this. The problem is that they don't play by your rules. I hate this sort of mechanic in games. I like the AI to play by my rules, not for them to get bonuses while we get gameplay mechanics. It's much harder to balance a game this way and I feel like this was a bad but maybe forced decision by the developer.\n\nGeneration Options:- There just isn't enough options for generating your galaxy right now. No slowing down tech or production options, only 100 planets, not being able to add custom races to go over the 8 AI limit. A missed opportunity here.\n\nPERSONAL STATEMENT ON DIFFICULTY\n\nI don't really feel like the game is too hard right now. I play it on hard as the humans and I'm doing pretty well. I feel like deployable shields are OP in ground combat. It's got to a point that I just don't lose soldiers anymore. My under tech'd ships are doing their job just fine because they have shields and a good formation with strong artillery, and the enemy doesn't do that. They get some missile throwers but it's just not enough when I have big massive cannons that start attacking them before they're even in range. I really don't see why everyone is making a big deal about the difficulty. Start off with building as many small ships as your empire can handle for free, then defend with them (for medals) until you get shields. Build 2 artillery ships with little armour, and 3 frontline armoured ships. All 5 ships with shields. That's enough to defend against any attack through most of the early game (safe till at least 2 fifths of the way through). I know the humans get some pretty powerful ship traits, maybe this is why I'm not finding it difficult.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nThis game is awesome. I've not been able to put it down since it came out. I know it was made mostly by just one man, but I'm not paying to appreciate the awesome talents of one man creating an awesome game, I'm paying to play an awesome game. And I can't say I'm displeased with that. I got a nice discount for owning the first game, but I would still recommend it even if it is full price. Just know that there are parts of the game that will feel unfinished. Specially the UI. As it stands, it never really prevents the fun parts from being fun. It's still a masterpiece, a slightly flawed one though. 8.5/10\n\nMESSAGE TO ZERO (Maker of SD1+2)\n\nMake DLC for this game. I waited a long time for SD1 DLC. Don't disapoint us, we all want to throw our money at you for DLC.","April 12, 2015","true","70.8"," 104 of 139 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","104","139","4","4"

Has a rather rushed feeling after a while\n\nMy main complains are:\n- The tech-progression is too fast or the tech-tree to short. It's too easy to reach "future-tech" without ever deploying researchers.\n- Ground combat is meh.\n- The AI (premade) ships are boring and the AI just spams. Most ships are low-tech only. There is only 1 pre-made Titan (high-end ship) for the Vulfar I could see. It's full of spinal lasers (low-end weapon).\n- The ship spamming of the AI leads to slideshows in combat, when fighting against "bigger" fleets full of rockets.\n- The ship-limit is really weird. The 2 smallest classes don't cost command until a certain margin. Which the AI uses to spam. Most of those ships are not worth the building affort, but again kill the framerate.\n- The AI sends more spies to you, then you could ever remove. Even with the Anti-Spy Leader. I got 2 messages for removes spies for every turn. Never got less.\n- The ship-design info about how long your energy weapons will last straight down lies.\n- There are not enough different special-encounters.

Having played through and done some reading I will point out some glaring flaws.\n\nAI is hyper-aggressive stupid expansionist. It will gobble up as much as it can as fast as it can and use that to produce as many junk ships as it can to throw at you the instant it detects weakness. That's ALL it will do - the ships it uses are pre-designed and total junk. It makes no attempt at clever diplomacy or alliances. It doesn't use starbases. No hiding in the trees to do a devastating flank attack here - no sir it will conga line straight into your wall-o-doom in the puddle size combat arenas.\n\nConstant escalating attacks by 'NPC factions' - remnants and pirates and space crystals that don't attack the AI, so you have to dedicate a fleet to defending against them while the AI out-expands you then sends a fleet of doom at you.\n\nDiplomacy is a joke. Half the races Want To Eat Your Granny and will declare war right away if they have more ships. Every other species is going to demand/threaten right off the bat, sometimes your homeworld, and if you don't give it to them they'll declare war if they have more ships. If you do they'll declare war anyway a few turns later if they have more ships. More ships >>> diplomacy.\n\nBalance is...nonexistant. Tech 0 lasers and tech 2 mass drivers are all you ever need, maybe gauss later. They aren't the best weapons in the game because you can use them to flank or do ninja flips and death from above the command center, they are the best weapons in the game because their stats are better than anything else you can research. Some traits are grossly overpowered - subterranean + more money per pop. The optiris have ships that are TWICE as large for the same CP cost as the vulfar.\n\nGround invasions are 3rd wheel. What is a stripped down Xcom doing in my 4x? Ugly, simple, beyond mindless, pointless, click-fests that can be avoided at no cost by having one ship filled with nukes. Seriously, you'll need a ship with nukes and one trooper per fleet and that third of the game can be safely ignored.\n\nThe bugs! Oh God the bugs! And I don't mean the hivers. Ranging from game-breaking (autoresolve with many losses) to devastating (can not scroll systems in leader-assign screen) to merely annoying (deployment area does not auto-size for fleet).\n\nDo Not Buy. Will update in 6 months if they fix stuff, it's gonna need at least that long.

I loved SD1 and so was convinced I would love SD2 as well, but I can honestly say, I'm disappointed. The game looks pretty, I can have an open mind when changing to a turn based campaign, but found that SD2 was lacking in alot of details ,and had something of an identity crisis.\n\nThe UI is clunky, apparently something as simple as pointing and clicking is to damn easy, hope you learned all your hotkeys. The camera is stuck, you cant rotate or see any planets and even zooming is quite limited in choices; far away or in your face, cant have anything in between. Diplomacy is sadly 1 dimensional and boring, lots of options, but few applications.\nThe AI is a mess. I tried about 10 attempts now as humans and got completely steamrolled by massive fleets or rampant monsters in more than 6 of those attempts, in under 100 turns. This is on easy..You wont have a nice relaxing "get to know you" experience here, prepare to get slammed shortly after contact. That wont take long, the galaxy is a sardine can. Despite being open minded to its transition from real time to turn based, I didnt adapt to the transission well, and I dont feel this game did either. SD1 just felt much more alive and fluid, the sense of the distance between stars was apparent when you watch your little colony ship slowly zip through the void to a distant beacon of light. You wont feel that here, the galaxy is a flat, small, tiny world full of crappy planets.\nSadly, i didnt get a feel for being in space at all. The galaxy is emensely small (100 stars max), and so crammed for space, that you'll be pilling on top of your allies and enemies alike. Not that your likely to have many allies though, even they will turn on you in a hurry if you happen to occupy the only terran planet in whole tiny galaxy.\nThere was no sense of space, its expanse, or progression of my species at all. In SD2, you should feel rushed right from turn #1, and dont you dare make a single mistake or you'll get slammed by indestructable fleet of monsters on turn 45.\nI didnt feel like I was leading or playing a star civilization at all.

Numerous bugs, bad UI, rare crashes, half baked ground combat.  This game is unfit to be called a finished product.  A good beta maybe.  Needs polish, lots of polish.\n\nYou can tell that love went into this but it did not come with an equal measure of design skill.  Fleets will frequently overshoot their targets without engaging/parking.  Ground battles will sometime bug out, switching control of you and the AI's forces.  Real time space battles are unforgivably disorganized and nearly impossible to command in any meaningful way without 10+ minutes of pre battle formation micro management that you have to do every-single-battle.  Save your formation?  Nope, F U.  Simply clicking on a ship and telling it to "fly here" is absurdly difficult when large fleets are present.  Planetary production Governors?  Nope.  All micro.  Insta scroll game text with a click?  Nope.  Get used to watching the letters crawl across the screen like a legless orphan eating crayons.  Enemy transports will bug out in/near wormholes, becoming permanent, untargetable fixtures until their race is annihilated.  The music is awful and may as well not exist.\n\nIn it's defense, smaller space battles are fun and pleasing to the eye.  The random events/missions scattered about the galaxy are fun and interesting.  Ship designing is lots of fun but probably poorly balanced.  A colorful cast of aliens, even the 1 world minor races, Art and writing fluff did their jobs at least.\n\nReally, if everything worked properly and had a decent UI, I'd say StarDrive2 is slightly above average.

Sadly, the game had been abandoned, but with the help of some very awesome people who made some very awesome mods, I was able to enjoy the game to whole new level than before.\nI was extremely excited when I opened up the store one day and found out that it was the launch day for StarDrive 2. I'll admit I wasn't following it much, so I was surprised. There came the first problem though. After StarDrive one had been abandoned, many of us who had bought the game expecting big things were not only disappointed, but also felt a little betrayed. With StarDrive 2 out, I thought we would get a pretty sizable discount on it... we did, but only a third of the price. For how much we had paid for the original, not only was this disappointing, but perhaps in the back of my mind I knew this was one of the many problems to come.\nRead some other reviews and you will quickly realize how many things are wrong with this game. From performance issues, to really lame options regarding diplomacy. Balancing issues regarding hull sizes from faction to faction is the thing I hate the most. Even customization has taking a turn for the worse compared to the original. In fact, the original I would say is far superior to this one.\nI'm not a person that holds a grudge, or even forms one often, but I cannot even start to tell you how bad of a job the developer (Zero) is doing. All I read from him is how "terrible the community is." He fixes issues that the minority only cares about, and never listens to real problems. He denies that he "abandoned" the original game, even though the main problems are easily fixed by a few mods.\nI gave him a second chance after abandoning StarDrive 1, but I was disappointed by the second game. By far the worst though, is the announcement of a "DLC" for StarDrive 2. Hell, this frustrates me more than everything else combined. Fix your broken game before you start charging even MORE money for something that isn't worth $15.\n\nDon't waste your money here. There are many better games that not only cost less, but actually has a Dev who cares.\n","October 26, 2015","false","39.2"," 70 of 96 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","70","96","5","2"

Lack of balance, basic UI bugs, crazy strong AI that loves to kill you a little too much and seems like it's cheating.  At the very least, I'd wait a month or two for some patches.\n\nBeyond the lack of polish, I feel, lies a game that is just inferior to the first.  The turn-based systems lack the amount of control that the real-time systems did.  For example, you can't reinforce your ships during combat, or position your forces around an enemy before attacking, or make any kind of hit and run moves.  Just seems like it loses a lot and gains little, which I think sums everything up perfectly.

If you're new to the series you can safely skip this text. A 'Tl;DR' summary can be found at the end of the review.\n\nI almost feel bad about giving this game a thumbs down. But since there is no "it's just average" option and I certainly can't go with a thumbs up, it'll have to do.\n\nStarDrive 1 with its free-flowing combat, RTS feeling and huge fleets was a nice change of pace. StarDrive 2 being turn-based came as a bit of a shock to me and took me out of the game almost instantly. On the other hand, if you're into more traditional 4X games you're probably fine with this change.\n\nAlso gone are the huge fleets you could build in StarDrive 1. The number of ships is now (soft)capped by command points, which results in much smaller battles. But since even small and medium scale battles can have quite a severe impact on frame rate, this might not be a bad thing, at least not from a performance point of view. (I'm running an OC'ed i7 with two OC'ed GTX780s, not exactly a "slow" setup, but during battles the frame rate can drop to almost 0).\n\nSpeaking of ships, there is now less variety - the smaller classes are mostly gone. So most races are down to four different classes, and again the Titans have no preset layout, so unless you don't supply the AI with your own layouts they won't build Titans (which further reduces the hull variety to three).\n\nMeanwhile, the ship editor has been reworked and streamlined: Similar weapons and components are now grouped together and you get nice diagrams showing you the range and damage output of each weapon. You can also set a default behaviour for each ship layout. Unfortunately you can no longer manually edit the firing arc of your turrets. Granted this was very fiddly in StarDrive 1 and I like the fact that the turrets default to either a bow or port/starboard firing arc. On the other hand, it would be nice to have the option to overwrite these default firing arcs. But all in all I think the ship editor has seen the most improvements compared to StarDrive 1, although you have less hulls (per race) to play with and all the remaining hulls (except for the two new races) are more or less directly copied from StarDrive 1.\n\nSpeaking of "copied from StarDrive 1". A *lot* of stuff has been either directly copied from its predecessor or only slightly modified. Now I won't go on about this for too much, since as far as I'm aware these game were pretty much a one or two man operation... but I was still surprised by the amount of images, ships and weapons that were reused. I guess if you're new to StarDrive 2 then it doesn't really matter, but if you've played the original then there really isn't that much new content. (if we discount the fact that StarDrive 2 is turn-based it could almost be an addon for StarDrive 1 instead of a new game)\n\nAlthough, to be fair, there is now turn based ground combat (think of XCOM) which is kinda neat. But it doesn't feel fleshed out. Personally I would have kept ground combat the way it was in StarDrive 1 and focused development on other areas of the game. If I wanted in-depth turn-based squad combat I would play, well, XCOM. Luckily there is an auto-resolve option that lets you skip this part of the game.\n\nTalking about combat: space combat is of course still a big part of StarDrive 2, but you have to micromanage a lot more than in StarDrive 1 since there does not seem to any sort of "attack-move". Without input your ships will just sit at their spawn location. You have to manually assign targets because your ships won't automatically pick their own target (you can defince a "typical behaviour" in the ship editor but that only seems to affect the way the enemy AI is utilizing the ships).\n\n\nTL;DR:\nStarDrive 2 goes from RTS to turn-based. Fleet sizes seem to be severly limited due to a command point limit. Space combat is still in real time but you have to micromanage and babysit your ships a lot (which some people probably find appealing). A lot of the ingame art, ships and weapons have been lifted from StarDrive 1, and while the introduction of turn-based, XCOM-esque ground combat might set the game apart from other 4X games, I found it very tedious.\n\nOn the plus side, the ship editor has been improved greatly and the game seems to be more stable (at least for me) than StarDrive 1.\n\nAgain, I would give the game an average score if I could (but for now Steam is lacking this option). Overall I was hoping for a continuation of StarDrive 1 (think different hulls & weapons, new tech tree), but what I got was basically "StarDrive 1 - the turn based edition".","April 22, 2015","false","6.4"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","55","74","2","0"

While the game is fun in it's current semingly incomplete state, it requires a beefy computer to even finish a campaign due to the massive fleet size. The game's AI is overly warlike and game itself is entirely riddled with bugs. All of this aside, what really pushes this review into the negative is the utter dissapointment I have for the developer after so many people gave them a second chance with Stardrive 2 after the failure and abandonment of Stardrive. Stardrive 2 is in a buggy and what feels like downright incomplete state. Instead of fixing the problems in the games, or adding better and more exciting content the developer has chosen to lock away these things behind a DLC paywall for the game, forcing any loyal fans to purchase the game a second time, or even third time if you wish to count the original Stardrive, to even continue receiving updates to it.

Although a few hours in it's very obvious that it's not a finished game. I had oversight with that because of two facts, the game is simply great from a 4x point of view (though somewhat lacking in the diplomacy departmeant), and it was developed by one guy. Stardrive 1 captured my interest with a non-turn based system, it's wonderful shipdesigner where you can put modules pretty much anywhere in your ships making them, essentially, your design. The tech tree was wonderful and the empire managemeant was comprehensive.\n\nStardrive 2 threw out the ship designer, the non-turn based system, the meat and potatoes of the game in my opinion. In place they put in a turn based system and a dumbed down version of the ship designer. The diplomacy has been improved but at a fatal cost, at least to me. The ground combat is somehow worse than the first game and the battles now take place in a seperate scenario where when you encounter enemy fleets load into a combat screen where you duke things out in real time. This eliminates the dynamic open world combat with on the spot micro, retreating somewhat easily, reinforcing with ships on the way or being built mid fight. It results in a game which boils down to biggest highest tech fleet wins the game. I bought StarDrive 2 hoping it would beat the odds again only to be met with a turnbased, dumbed down StarDrive 1.\n\nNow when I want to play a 4x space empire game, I play StarDrive 1, because to me, it's simply better.","September 12, 2015","false","23.7"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","34","43","2","0"

After 40 hours or so of playing that is my conclusion. Now let me explain some of the reasons why I honestly cannot recommend StarDrive 2 at this moment (version 1.1).\n\nWhen building something with the construction ships (Listening posts, subspace projectors or fueling stations) they CANNOT be destroyed. I mean not even by you.\nYou will notice how irritating this is when you accidentally click the construct icon when the ship is on top of your planet. If you try building "space highways" with the projectors you can goof it up so bad that your ships can get stuck in an eternal loop when it's trying to reach it's destination. Basically what happens the projector accelerates your fleet to high speed, it shoots past it's target (for example a planet), turns around and repeats. Yes I have had this happen, more than once. Also path finding IGNORES subspace projectors completely so basically they're completely useless and a broken concept.\nShip modules and their descriptions (What they actually do and what other modules they affect) are vague to the point that I had to dig through the game files to find out what weapons were point defense weapons (prioritize incoming ordnance over enemy ships).\nNo auto build option for colonies (After you reach a certain point of colonies this becomes TEDIOUS).\nUnique leaders where some can engage in space and/or ground combat. Sadly for space combat their ships become outdated really quick and no way to update/upgrade them. Not even the modules in them like armor.\nGround combat is a joke. It's a huge chess board with absolutely NO tactics involved. There are some weapons, some protective items and some utility items. You can select 3 of them for your ground unit. Guess can you create a "default" item set for new ground troops? Nope. The whole ground combat part seems more like an afterthought to try and get more sales.\nAI is, in pretty much every aspect, an idiot. Yeah it keeps spamming my 12 battleship blockade fleet with around 15-25 ships consisting of corvettes, frigates and cruisers.\nRace customization options aren't really that diverse (Pales in comparison to Master of Orion 2).\nAI ships designs are a joke. My latest discovery was a design where the ships had 3 ECM jammers, heavy armor at the front but no weapons. What does the AI do with that ship. It retreats right after the start of a space battle. And when there can be over 10 of those ships in the enemy fleet... well just picture a facepalm and you I'm sure you get my meaning. This is yet another glaring show how little the developer actually puts effort in the game.\nSpace battles eventually turn into lagfests. Picture the enemy might have 30-50 corvettes or frigates. Each of those ships can have several rockets/missile launchers firing a rocket/missile every few seconds. Now please answer the question below.\nDoes the above mentioned rocket/missile spam lag the *BEEP* out of the battle no matter what hardware you're running?\n[ ] YES\n[ ] NO\n\nGood you answered correctly.\nIt does not matter what your computer specs are. In the end battles will become slideshows and turns start to take more and more time. If you think Civilization V end game turns took long, compare them to this and re-evaluate. That is if you want to waste your money on this game.\n\nWhat I mentioned are just some of the things that came into my mind while writing this review. It's not a complete list and hardly even a partial list of what's wrong with StarDrive 2. I have played StarDrive 1 and I liked it. I really wanted to like StarDrive 2 but the more I play it the more annoyed I get with the multitude of irritating things in the game.\n\nThere are a lot of problems in the game currently and I do not believe that the developer can, has enough time or interest to sort things out. In reality the only hope for this game is proper modding support. The community might be able to salvage what's salvageable in the game if the modding support is extensive enough to be able to change and tweak all aspects of the game. Currently it is a very limited amount of things that can be modded.\n\nIf you can get this game for a real good price (5 euros or under) then grab it. For 5 euros or so it's enough entertainment. I really cannot recommend paying full asking price for this game in this state.","May 20, 2015","false","40.6"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","52","76","0","0"

That potential, at least without the expansion (which I haven't purchased) is not realized. If you are a fan of Master's of Orion 2 you'll feel right at home. The graphics are obviously better and the combat has been reworked, but otherwise the races have been borrowed from heavily and the technology tree is nearly copied in its entirety. All of this wouldn't be an issue were it not for the staggering amount of bugs that are still present in the game. I've not managed to get even a single play through to last more than an hour or two without running into a bug that causes the game to lock up. These are issues that are being caused by normal game play and I, like other reviewers, am amazed that they never game up in beta testing. In fact, they make the whole game feel like it is an early release as opposed to a fully completed product. Hopefully they will continue to work on fixing the bugs, but until then I wouldn't pick the game up unless it's massively on sale.","March 11","false","40.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Its a welcome addition but it will need a LOT of work if it is ever going to make it. The problems with ground battles start from randomising the troops instead of allowing for 1 standartised troop type you want to take into battle wiht you; ♥♥♥♥ing up your carefull planning of team at some point * i honestly dont know  when * by randomising what they carry in battle despite meticulous repicking of what they have. But that doesnt matter, the enemy AI is ♥♥♥♥ poor. All you have to do is sit at starting point and accumulate points, then ai rushes in with nothing and you get what is 2 turns of firepower unleashed on them before they have a chance to respond,... then just mop it up.\n\nIve seen a lot of people complain about how the game is hard and ai might even be cheating. Truth is AI is horrible in macro map aswell and it does indeed cheat at least somewhat. For this was made an experiment ( you can confirm this yourself btw ) -> create TINY map with extremely limited resoures and max ai. Reload till you have good starting place, since rest of galaxy sucks ♥♥♥ AI will be attracted to what your system has to offer and might 'scout' it with colony ship. Thats right! Its 'very lucky' with guessing where good planets might be. Incredible feat. Same goes for assuming firepower. AI knows what you have at all stages without scouting anything. If it saw you on map and met you you ♥♥♥♥ing bet it knows what you have.\n\nDoes it matter that it knows? No it does not. AI has no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what is going on macro wise and all it cares about is Command points and total ship count. Suppose you have 4 stationed tier 5 ships outfitted to the maximum of capability, just imagine 2500-3k worth of manufacturing. Thats about 8 CP if you play your cards right. And just 4 ships. In AI"s mind you have NOTHING AT ALL. ITS A FREE WIN TOWN BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOO! TIME TO PILLAGE. And then they get destroyed. It wont stop them. No sir! They will keep spamming the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little ships untill their last planet dies. It refuses to adapt it refuses to utilise the technology they have. Hell i GAVE them tech for tier 4 and 5, gave them schematics for weapons and armor for free to what my diplomacy allowed. Gave them 100 turns and went to war with them. 200 turns later they still dont have anything bigger then tier3 ships with swarmers. Ai ♥♥♥♥ing loves swarming.\n\nAnd its  the ultimate cancer, you see in late game you will be facing say 200 CP (command point) fleet. Are you excited for some epic showdown of 2 mighty fleets? You better not be because you will be autoresolving the battle. If not prepare for 1 fps for next 15 minutes because ai will be carrying as many corvettes it can, and the t3 ships will be filled up with viper fighters spamming up everything. Do you have NASA supercomputer? Well too bad for you the game doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ you will still be lagging.\n\nAI never changes tactics in any form or shape. Ive also never seen pirates spawn and attack AI how it does happen against player. then again maybe my scouts and listening posts are not all seeing so i might have missed it.\n\nLets focus on the positive -> the diplomacy window for reactions is great! Its charismatic, filled with love, changes accoarding to what is going on, its hilarious and enjoyable. You know whats not enjoyable? The limiting system. I want to sell 21k woth system to someone too bad best fdeal i can get is 9k for it as a single tech from my semi ally thanks to all the limitations.\n\nAi having different traits at start is great and makes the game extra fun, but as a general rule of thumb i found that the only 2 races one can trust are Dreylocks and Bears. Everyone else will be all too happy to backstab you despite all agreements and previus actios.\n\nThe Values of things need to be adjusted aswell. Once again  - i have  the power to destory/slaver everyone then sacrifice whomever i dont like, entire galaxy teaming up cant stop it *mostly because they refuse to build good ships no matter what*.\n\nShip symmetry/design is ♥♥♥♥ed big time for ships tier 5 as of right now. Its not a design choice, its a design ♥♥♥♥ up, - there are tiles missing, extra tiles making no sense, entire rows missing even though the face of the vessels are symmetric. Upon pointing that out, our valiant developer replied "I have a feeling that you may have an obsessive co'. Charming.  No word on fixing either. I mean i can guess that there was just not much time to probably test t5 ships  and few problems were missed  but...really? How hard is it to measure. Sloppy, lazy, insulting.\n\nMight i remind you that original StarDrive was pretty much abandoned in favor of pursuing more cash from creating 2d one? No multiplayer yet. It would have been possibly the redeeming part of the game, but its unfortunately not here. At least as of right now.\n\nWhat else was great: the charming world, elephant wizards, great Ghost Pirate Tigre, Zapp Brannigan etc, fun dragons, - those are all welcome additions, but what the game is really good is - these tiny details, like good diplomacy gimmicks, charming lore, those kind of things. What is game bad at? Everything else. Mostly AI. Its been a while since ive seen one so bad. Watching t5 beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of everythign enemy has to offer is like watching a professional boxer beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of a handicapped old man. Its disgusting and not fun.  Its bad strategically and tactically, all it does is spamms small ships even if its doing nothing for it. Thats the AI's plan to win. Enemy can destroy everything you have and not bat an eye? Wont agree to peace and give 2 technologies instead of 1.\n\nOverall its a fun game. Its NOT GOOD. Not yet at least. A LOT of things need to be rebalanced and tweaked and fixed before this game is good. If developer doesnt start fixing this and instead moves on to moving StarDrive 3 i humbly ask you to not support him. If, however the developer starts getting work dont, then by all means buy the game and enjoy it.\n\nAs it is right now i give it 5/10. No multiplayer and about one of the worst AI's ive seen as of late. In 2010 maybe that ♥♥♥♥ would have slided, not today. Has potential to be 7/10, not more. Do i recomend this game? Barely.\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","50.2"," 63 of 98 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","63","98","7","3"

I'm really just a 4x gaming fan at heart who was lucky enough to be given access to Stardrive 2 during its development :)\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a galactic empire building game featuring that "just one more turn" itch that some of the great 4x games of the past have offered. This is definitely a game that can keep you up late at night, constantly clicking end turn just to see what lies ahead in the development and struggles of the star nation you've spent hours carefully building.\n\nRight from the start, you'll be faced with interesting events, encounters, and anomalies that will drive you to spread your chosen species farther out amongst the stars. You'll research interesting technologies, some of them unique to your species and others totally random in nature. You'll find valuable resources to claim through colonization and exploration. You'll design and build your own starships to conquer your enemies and protect all you've gained. You'll engage in diplomacy and espionage with/against a variety of interesting and unique alien species all with their own agendas. You'll meet minor species to either befriend, enslave, or exterminate.\n\nThe combination of turn-based empire management with real-time space combat helps to break up the pace of the game into enjoyable yet distinct pieces. Being able to see a newly researched weapon help your ships blaze a path of destruction across an enemy fleet in real-time combat helps to tie the entire game together and makes it feel like every decision you've made matters. The ship designing and customization are definitely high points of Stardrive 2. The space combat is visually impressive and always fun to play. The ground combat is turn-based, with an X-Com Enemy Unknown feel to it, which I've come to really enjoy as an entirely separate mini-game within Stardrive 2.\n\nIn short, if you're looking to escape from reality for hours at a time by putting on the hat of a space emperor and building your very own interstellar civilization this is the game for you!","April 9, 2015","true","79.3"," 168 of 282 people (60%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","60","168","282","13","9"

As soon as you encounter any other force, they instantly bleed you for income and technology.

A vulfar fleet of 6 ships gets easily outgunned by two pollop cruisers. Even two vulfar battlecruisers will lose to two pollop cruisers. You can imagine that when the NPCs are these races, the vulfar will ALWAYS LOSE. ALWAYS. The Ralyeh Titan ship is smaller and less utilizable than their battlecruiser. What. The Kulrathi are actually decently balanced, HUGE but not usable for proper artillery guns and they're slow, so if you can pick them off before they reach you that's a great strategy. Bring flak against their fighter spam, I like how that race plays out. The Humans have small ships, and early on do not have the money to keep them. Not really a ship issue, but they've got issues with them and are easily halted to a stop early on. The Draylok are another all-right race, their ships are decently sized beyond their frigates. The Codrazine dew the shortest straws together with the vulfar, their slots are insanely hard to utilize and their titan is tiny. The Chukk are basically a better vulfar. They scale decently in the game and their titan is quite big (even though it's not exactly very usable) and their early frigates in a player's hands can hold off early fleets. As an NPC however, they are incredibly aggressive with ♥♥♥♥ ships so they're usually a joke. The Opteris are also really insane. Everything is very square so lots of usable space, their frigates can fit like six large cannons or five fighter bays iirc, have tons of port side capability for close combat and are quite fast, same goes for all of their ships really.\n\nSo basically, the Opteris and Pollop are insane, the Kulrathi are close, and the rest are always doing incredibly bad and in a player's hand (Besides the draylok, they're usable if you abuse mechanics) give you a really big disadvantage.\nUntill this is addressed, I will not recommend it to ANYONE. You'll love the game initially, until you realise that only three races are playable without severe disadvantage on any real difficulty without abusing mechanics.. Purely from a combat perspective. This makes every game you play exactly the same with three races doing alright, one being a diplomatic switzerland sitting quietly in their part of the universe and a few pirate races that are the laughing stock of the universe. Randomizing anything including traits only ♥♥♥♥s up the balance even more and regardless of what you do, a mid game pollop fleet will win any battle with a much larger vulfar fleet without any casualties.\n\nEDIT: the new DLC doesn't change anything to address this.","March 30","false","172.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","1"

So far I've played a number of games over 11 hours (normal) and have lost every single one. You know what though? I get a little bit better every time, and I know I'm getting close to winning. The first time I conquer the galaxy I will feel like I earned it. The AI doesn't cheat, it's not entirely ruthless towards you as long as you dont take the repulsive trait because you want the easy 4 points.\n\nPeople get upset because they lose. The fun is in the challenge of rising to the top. I think it's quite fitting that the first few times you try to conquer the galaxy you get slapped around.\n\nIt's a game that takes practice, turn it on to easy if you are struggling and make sure you understand the mechanics of the game.  There is a tutorial which lots of people ignore and several help sections in the game. Some mechanics are a little obscure, for example how your empire generates galactic credits beyond population is not explained very well.  However, there is an insane amount of tooltips explaining anything you mouse over which makes it really easy to find information.\n\nCombat is really fun, though the fact that the default ships are designed incredibly efficiently probably contributes to the difficulty new players are having.  However you can easily see the default layouts (which again are quite good) and can work on designing your ship from there. There are a few performance issues with large scale battles, but I hope to see them ironed out in the future. There are a large variety of weapons and options for those weapons, as well as support systems so you can design ships any way you like them. It also looks pretty damn good too. I hope to see more activatable abilities in the future, but right now space combat is a solid tactical experience.\n\nThe economy is good. It's really irritating that people are complaining about the map size, because I can't imagine playing on something like a 150 system map. There would be too much to do. I think a few people loaded the game and said "what, 70 stars default?" without understanding the depth of the economy. You'll be really busy managing your empire with even a few systems. You can specialize your planets and they also develop over time, gaining unique traits depending on what you do with them. High research planets attract universities, big farming planets will eventually attract a farmers market, etc.\n\nThere is more I could go on about but overall I'm happy with my purchase. I'm excited to see a few balance passes over the next few weaks, but other then that it is already a solid experience.\n\n","April 11, 2015","true","38.7"," 75 of 121 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","75","121","4","0"

Where it falls apart is in its AI, it knows where everything is, and doesn't even try to hide it.  That one planet at the back of your nation that has never been scouted, the one without a star base, yup every enemy you have will attack it again and again and again.

A story of conquest, Pollop treachary, and human insubordination\n\nThe United Federation of Planets, my fledling creation, had reached it's third star system of colonization. We made first contact with the Draylock council. War soon broke out but was ended with the successful defense of Earth. They were forced into peace and eventually became lucrative trading partners. Galactic tensions were high between the many newly discovered aggressive empires, such as the Chukk and Rayleh. I soon discovered a small spacefaring civilisation of the Pollop race. They were peaceful and docile so I let my guard down on them.... a huge mistake.\nThey sent a colony ship to my homeworld system and claimed a colony on a small world with the "beautiful" trait, which I had overlooked due to it's ironic toxic nature. Enraged they had the audacity to pull such a move, I sent a task force to bombard the planet out of existence... My second mistake. Thinking I was safe I continued to focus on the other larger, aggressive empire.\nSuddenly alerts begin blaring as an enormous Polop fleet enters my outer space and begins making a beeline straight for Earth. I rallied the fleets but only about 2/3 of my forces made it to the homeworld in time. They has at least 8 cruisers with an absolute swarm of fighters. They tore through the orbital defences in a matter of minutes and outnumbered our ground forces 2:1. Earth was lost. And soon the Federation was left with but one colony.\nOur last colony of Epsilon was kicked into overdrive mode and started pumping out a fleet, with a new flak cruiser to combat the plant swarm. The Pollop invasion fleet finally made to to Epsilon, as the fate of the Federation and Humanity as a whole rested on this battle. After a long and drawn out battle the human fleet remains victorious, and prepares immedately to reclaim the homeworld.\nThe fleet jumps out of warp and engages the Pollop fleet. Lasers and missiles are flying all over, Pollop swarms and human fighters battle it out zipping around the cruiser slug fest, with flak rounds detonation all over. With the destruction of the new enemy starbase, human forces plant their boots on the ground to reclaim what is theirs. After a lengthy ground battle the Pollop forces cannot withstand the human combat prowess and determination. The victory fleet went around to reclaim all our colonies and is preparing to take the fight back to Pollop space...\n\nAll in 8 hours of non-stop gameplay. This is the kind of story you can create for your empire. The challenges you will face and how you can overcome them using strategy and wit. Fleet variation and devised roles are crucial, as opposed to two walls of ships slugging it out as seen in games like Sins.\n\nThe AI's are good and difficult, but not impossible to take on. The game is so much like MOO2 it's rediculous, but in no way is this a bad thing. Spectacular visuals, awesome gameplay and the games create their own narrative. All complemented with the amazing and very suiting soundtrack.\n\nThe only things are that ground combat could use a little more polish and depth. Persistent debris would also be cool in the tactical battles.\n\nOverall an epic edition to the 4X sub-genre, and truely the spiritual succesor to Master of Orion.","April 12, 2015","true","61.1"," 47 of 72 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","47","72","7","0"

I still have my reservations about the game, however Zero is patching the game to address some of the concerns I've had about difficulty.\n\nTruth is if you play the game 'smart', you can win. Having said that, I tend to turtle. I like games with a slow burn to them. I don't like getting into wars very early. Maybe that's where my frustration comes from. I would still like to be able to refine AI behaviors much more and tune them to my preferences and hopefully we'll see the implementation of that.\n\nRegardless, Zero seems to really care about the game and the community. I believe he'll do everything he can to make it fun for everyone. Those that want an easier game, will probably get it, and those that want the challenge, definitely already have it.\n\nBottom line is, the game is worth it. I don't want to turn anyone away from this with an overly negative review. My original review had nothing good to say about the game and that's very very wrong, the game is worth the price tag and definitely worth your time.\n\nPreviously published negative review:\nThere are a great many things to like about StarDrive 2 but unfortunately the incredibly unfair and difficult AI outshine anything good this game currently has to offer.\n\nThe main problem comes from the fact that the AI seem to be able to 'cheat'. They always have these impossibly massive fleets that more than out match yours regardless of how advanced your race is. Diplomacy is laughable. It's always completely one sided, the AI will make you an offer but will almost always reject your counter offer even though it's more than a fair trade. If you refuse to trade with them on account of you getting a terrible deal out of it, be prepared for them to invade you almost immediately.\n\nThe problem is two-fold because the difficulty setting does NOTHING for the AI difficulty. The only thing it does is change how hard diplomacy is. Because of this the difficulty setting might as well not even be there. Even if you are able to get a race on your good side, and you give them everything they ask for and more, they will inevitably declare war on you for seemingly no reason and they will always win that war because they're somehow able to match your forces 3 - 1 or more.\n\nThis is not even taking into account the amount of 'random' enemies that spawn very early into the game and destroy any progress you make. They never stop. You can't destroy their bases because you aren't given enough time inbetween each attack to amass a fleet large enough to destroy them. The worst is when your main fleet is blown to bits and they go after your freighters. You can't defend your freighters because an enemy engagement with them is an automatic combat failure. They're just destroyed. So your colonies starve and die out. If you create more, the AI that's camping your home world will just immediately destroy it. You can't send reinforcements because the game forces you into a combat screen with no way to send more ships to help.\n\nThis is a huge problem because your fleet could be RIGHT NEXT to your home world but the attacking fleet manages to get in just right so the only thing fighting on your side is the orbital station around your world. So you just have to let them destroy it while you sit there unable to do anything about it.\n\nThe combat 'fun factor' suffers for me because if they decide to attack my lone scout vessel two feet away from my main fleet, I have no choice but to waste a good 30 seconds entering combat and making it retreat when it would be so much better if I could just have my main fleet join the battle.\n\nIn short, the current state of this game is frustrating. The negatives I mentioned here would be completely manageable if not for the freaking AI steamrolling you 10 minutes into the game.","April 10, 2015","true","8.5"," 75 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","75","122","0","13"

I doubt anyone praising it has actually beaten it or plays many 4X titles. I could write a long list about why you should avoid this game, but I will keep it short. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. There is no ending. A silent video is all you have to indicate you have won the match. The game will continue even once finished. You have to exit to the main menu, quit to desktop, or keep playing.\n\n2. Conquest is your only victory condition. You cannot have allies, so there is no diplomatic option.\n\n2. The UI is a direct copy from MoO2 in every way. Managing colonies at the late game is tedious, and will take up almost all of your time unless you ignore them.\n\n3. The AI is terrible. If you need proof, go read any of the other 500+ reviews telling you it is terrible.\n\n4. Diplomacy is pointless. The AI will only use diplomacy to threaten you. Once again, you cannot have allies.\n\n5. The ground combat is terrible. It is similar to XCOM in style, but is devoid of any strategy. There is no cover, and only a few weapons / items in the entire game. You take over entire planets with small squads of marines.\n\n6. The game is too quiet. The only sound is the music (which is very lackluster especially in combat), and basic UI / combat sound Fx. There are no voice overs except for the tutorial. It truly feels desolate and without character.\n\nThere are a multitude of other issues, but I will not burden you with them. The end all be all is that the game is not what it should be. Your play experience will not be good, and when you finally beat a match you will be extremely disappointed by the ending assuming you survived the boredom of the late game.","April 14, 2015","false","39.8"," 124 of 210 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","124","210","8","5"

I loved StarDrive and had a ton of fun with it, I practically threw my wallet at my monitor when I found out StarDrive 2 existed and had already been released.\n\nThe graphical and sound options aren’t abundant but the consistent and unchangeable graphics are part of what’s unique about this game. It has a cool look to it which is appealing. The best planets in your empire come to life as they grow, space stations can be seen orbiting them and large cities lights can be seen from space.\n\nReal time battles look nice and it is exciting to watch your ship designs stomp the enemy. On the contrary it’s also fun to watch your ships get smashed because you never took that class on the importance of point defense. The trial and error required to design a potent military add an exciting element to the game. I have never been engaged in a large battle however, every battle I have fought has consisted of mostly between 10-30 ships.\n\nDiplomacy doesn’t seem to do much at the moment. Each faction will contact you (probably once every 10 turns so get ready for the spam depending on how many AI you have encountered) and offer trade agreements or technology swaps (or to demand tribute if they're a more aggressive AI). The AI honor their treaties as far as I am aware (haven’t had any issues myself but others might have). By treaties I mean trade agreements or non-aggression pacts and nothing else. The game has a weird way of negotiating using some sort of tolerance system which I haven’t figured out yet.\n\nSpies allow you to perform multiple functions. Defensively they protect you from enemy spies. Offensively they can steal technology (in the form of moles which are currently unstoppable to my knowledge), reveal enemy fleets and movements and two other functions I cannot recall. Essentially you can just spam build spies because they can be produced quickly and have no cost or maintenance. Once you have an armada of spies you can plant an infinite number of moles to steal all the technology you need (the AI will do it to you so I hope you don’t enjoy your privacy).\n\nTechnology works in (nine?) different tech trees. When you research anything in one of the tech trees that tech tree advances. You have to choose what is important for now and trade or steal (probably steal) the rest. The tech you unlock includes everything from ship parts, new space stations, upgrades or buildings for your empire.\n\nGameplay wise imagine that someone told you civilization five was similar to a real time strategy game. All you have to do is hold down the end turn button. The problem is that it doesn’t work. It isn’t entertaining and StarDrive 2 ends up feeling painfully slow at times. The larger your empire gets the more it needs to be micromanaged (which is to be expected but ends up being oddly complicated).\n\nAs the game slows down you’ll find yourself dealing with countless nuisances. Neutral AI entities will spawn at a constant rate to attack your undefended systems. Wormholes will open up faster than a hookers legs. I have not had a single game where a wormholes have not opened up in the heart of my empire to allow free reign to anyone who wanted to ravage my sweet virgin body.\n\nCountering the pirate/neutral AI threat would be fairly easy except that there are unreasonable soft population caps which punish you for having a fleet capable of defending yourself. I have not figured out a way around this aside from raising taxes to obscene levels during incursions or just having a huge surplus of space cash. Couple this with the fact that finding habitable worlds is like trying to find a straight guy in a gay bar. Your empire will end up being large and spread out but still only containing 4-5 good planets (meaning your limited size fleets had better be well managed)\n\nIn conclusion StarDrive 2 is not a bad a game but at this time there are too many small annoyances that keep me from enjoying what might be a great game. It feels like I spend most of my time fighting everything but other empires. Its problems leave it average and unenjoyable. In time this game will probably become great through its mod support and continued developer input (the dev has been working non-stop to fix issues). <3 you Zero.\n\n5/10.\n\nPlease pardon any grammatical errors, I am but a simple plebian.","April 11, 2015","false","12.3"," 53 of 85 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","53","85","12","0"

"What if I built my ships this way?" This game has a lot of replayability and is one of those games you can happily sink many hours into.\n\nPros:\nLove the tech tree. I was initially put off that I could not research all available technologies, but later, I realized why this choice is a good one. 1. It forces you to choose your tech to match your strategy. 2. Encourages diplomacy with other races to trade technologies. 3. Adds replayability.\nGood AI. SD2 can be very challenging.

The tutorial covers what is needed without overloading you with detail and stopping you from playing the game. Getting started with StarDrive 2 has been a much better experience than I've had with other games of this genre.\nCons:\nLoading screen takes a while.\nGround combat was not as refined as I would like it to be. I realize a game can not be all things perfectly. Look at Spore for example. Comparing SD2 turn based combat to a game like XCOM would not be fair either. I've had fun with the ground combat, but at times, it can feel a bit tedious. The thing to remember is that ground combat is a relatively minor component of this game, and is not the primary emphasis.\nThe biggest feature that I appreciate about SD2 is that it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. I didn't play enough SD1, since I don't play on Windows as much as I used to, to adequately compare SD2 to SD1. That said, StarDrive 2 is a good game.\n\nI had a chance to play the closed beta and was not paid.

Won first try. I didn't just win, it was like beating a blind child with a spiked mace.\n\nWhy?\n\nProbably because the AI... Well I should say the entire game, is so poorly made it is atrocious.\n\nLets go over my experience:\n\nI have never played StarDrive 1, but I was a pretty big fan back in the old days when it was a Warcraft III map. I researched this one and thought it would be pretty similar, I mean, the WC3 map was a relatively simple but fun game, it would not be hard to add to it.\n\nThe character/race customization for this game is decent, pretty good range of selection, and lots of races to choose from. My only issue was not being able to change the protrait, which in the end doesn't matter cause you never see it anyways.\n\nI started a campaign and was pretty excited, and if you played galactic civ, you will find it really easy to pick up the mechanics of this game, well maybe too much, it is almost the same game. When the announcer came up, it seemed like "alright, this guy will give some interesting narrative to the game!". Nope. In fact, everything he said, I already read on the character discriptions when looking through all the races to start the game. So this quickly became an annoyance, that I shut off.\n\nI did start this game on the hardest possible difficulty so I thought I should rush my economy, and build it up along with my capacity to build ships. I had races constantly asking to trade and demanding bribes. I quickly learned the following about diplomacy in this game:\n\nThe diplomacy is complete nonsense.\nYou can not ally\nThere are no "friendly" races\nthere is 3 real options - Trade, Give, or Die\nAll wars are to the death, you may accept or ask for a peace, but because the hostility system in this game is so poorly balanced, the bot will soon declare war again on you.\n\nSo.. besides a few side "quests", who's rewards are incredibly unbalanced to difficulty/reward, that they give you a massive advantage in the game.. There really is no more depth or story added to this game past the startup screen.\n\nMy other big issue, and the reason I could beat this game, hard mode, so fast, was this game crippling fact: In battles, the AI is completely garbage. they recently boasted a patch that gave the AI 1500 new space ship designs to choose from, but I never saw them build a ship larger then a frigate (medium sized), so once you get the larger size to that, you are good, pretty much till the end of the game. So.. I built a few titans 3 to start out with, and just bounced planet to planet, fleet to fleet, and just utterly obliterated the AI with fleets of 50+ ships. Game over.\n\nSo absolutely no replay value for me, unless I go for achievements, which I commonly do, but the fun is all gone. I really wish steam had a rating system instead of the yes or no, cause although I would not recommend this game to people who want an in depth and long lasting game, it is good for 1 play through, but a slightly unsatisifying play through at that.","May 16, 2015","false","30.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

Ship customization is awesome, Space combat is great fun and if you have the tactical mind about you, you can destroy whole fleets with just a handful of ships if you do it just right. The game is extreamly difficult passed easy mode, making it high risk high reward game. Random events will happen, like a random ship will apper with bugs on it, or your planet will have sharknados. This increases replay value and keeps me wanting to come back and find all of these. The Ui is simple and nicely laid out, making moving troops and building ships a breeze.\n\nHowever this game does have its issues.\n\nGround combat is not as in depth as Most people would like. Its just a simple move-here xenonauts like combat, except not nearly as in depth, as previously mentioned.\nThere seems to be only one way to win. Build a huge fleet, and steam roll the galaxy. Trading and negotiating simply puts war off. I wish there were other ways to get other peoples colonys with out bombing it from orbit. For example, Maybe spreading your culture across the galaxy will cause certian colonys to turn to "earth culture" and that colony joins your faction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erkenfresh/recommended/252450/","erkenfresh","Erkenfresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erkenfresh/","99 products in account","I think I can sum up the game in one word: tedious. StarDrive 2 is a modern remake of Masters of Orion 2. It adds some neat features, like placing modules in specific quadrants of the ship but takes away on some of the others. I'll try to break down some of the main areas.\n\nColony Management - It's very tedious, much like MoO2. There are some auto-builder scripts you can select from to focus on food, research, or production. But, when I pick one like production, the manager often moves some of the people off of production and over to research. If I try to correct this, the colony goes back to manual mode. Also, you may inadvertently get technology for colony buildings you don't want (some have drawbacks), and these will get rolled into the build queue by the colony "AI".\n\nShip Combat - Actually the best part of the game. It plays similar to Homeworld, but without the bells and whistles that make Homeworld cool. You can't pause combat, which makes any kind of tactics pretty much impossible so you end up charging in with everything you got. Fighters are essentially unselectable as they flit about the main ships of your fleet. Still, it's satisfying to watch your enemy ships explode into debris.\n\nShip Design - The design is another aspect of the game that is fairly good, but still lacks something. I found that at the end of the game, lasers were still on par with the best tech in the game. Either my math was way off, or there's really no reason to try new guns. In MoO2, it was fun to try out different weapon types, especially boarding enemy ships. But, I just didn't feel the same enthusiasm here.\n\nGround Combat - Very very tedious. Similar to ship design, a lot of the tech you get for ground combat is useless. The skeletal upgrade gives +20 max HP but leaves your soldier wounded by 20 HP. Since they don't naturally heal out of combat (until late game), the upgrade is pointless. Guns like the fusion carbine will do 20% more damage against unarmored foes, but 86% less against anyone with armor, which is pretty much everybody. The AI is really stupid too. You can stand still and let the enemies exhaust themselves walking into your firing line of fresh troops. However, if you press Auto before combat, you're likely to lose a ton of troops than you wouldn't lose by playing out the combat. Also, Mech Units are very disappointing. They are very slow which makes me just want to use regular troops more. (The dinosaurs with lasers are pretty awesome though I must admit). Also, you must equip every single troop. If the enemy invades a far off planet and you didn't equip those troops with the latest tech, they are likely to be holding stupid worthless knives and get rolled. All the clicking involved here is very tedious, it would be nice to set a master template automatically used for all new troops.\n\nResearch - Sad. I don't recall ever looking at a research screen in a 4x game and thinking "wow, I don't want to research any of this". Not until StarDrive 2 anyway. Many of the "upgrades" come with drawbacks. Like, you can grow food on radiated planets but it makes your people mad. Or the aforementioned carbine rifle, or pretty much any ship weapon. Some of the colony upgrades are very useful, but incur heavy upkeep fees which force you to raise taxes so much that you lose any additional productivity from the buildings. If the upgrades didn't have so many drawbacks, it would be so much better.\n\nSpying - I didn't try this much because it seemed too slow to be useful. You send spies in and they gather intelligence points which you use to plant a mole... which then gathers research points... which finally delivers enemy tech to you. But the enemy's spy network can destroy your mole fairly fast meaning you probably never steal any tech. It's far easier to just assimilate it or trade for it.\n\nDiplomacy - It's not great. You can trade for tech, but it raises this intolerance meter which requires time to cooldown. The other races are quick to declare war, on Normal difficulty, even when you have great rapport with them. This is something I expect at higher difficulty levels, but not Normal. I do like how the items offered in trade have point values so you can quickly tell how likely they are to accept.\n\nGUI - Sometimes my fleets would split up, especially after an invasion. One time I saw a fleet that said it would arrive in NaN turns (not a number!) and just froze in space. If you click on a planet from too far of a zoom, you won't be taken to the colony even though it highlights. The GUI just feels like it needs too many clicks to get what I want done.\n\nOverall - The game just feels tedious. I got to where I owned half the galaxy versus three small remaining alien races. I could tell it would be another four to five hours of clicking to finish the game when I decided to just uninstall it. It seems like it has a lot of potential though, and there aren't a ton of bugs. Fix the colony AI, add troop auto-equip, make the tech more enticing, UN-balance the ship weapons and I think you'd be on to something.","November 29, 2015","false","13.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

Forget the trollish reviews--a lot of people are reviewing the game not its own merits but by posts by the developer or experiences with a prior game (SD1, which is a different beast, but related).\n\nYes, the game is HEAVILY indebted to a classic 4x space game, Master of Orion 2. It's not quite as good as that game (but what it is, eh?), but with some polish and an expansion pack, I think this game might surpass it.\n\nWhat you should ask yourself is this -- do you want a space 4x game with a turn-base strategy and a RTS tactical map? If so, SD2 is for you. Really, there are not many hybrid 4X games out there. There's the Total War games, Sword of the Stars series, and . . . ? Most game companies don't do these type of games--they either go turn-based all the way, or RTS all the way. Why? It's really hard to program two-games in one and figure out the proper way the two should mix.\n\nSD2 manages to pull off this hybrid approach really well. On the strategy side, you colonize planets and build buildings that help improve the economy. There are many buildings that can help improve industry or science or food. you can then use trade to boost these variables.\n\nOn the tech side, the tree is deep enough but not too much to allow individual techs to feel unique and useful. There's still some balancing to do, but the nice thing is, lower tier techs, mostly the weapons, still have their place. You're also limited by your race and your choices, so nearly impossible to get the entire tech advances in one game. This offers some interesting strategic choices up front--do I choose better weapons or better buildings or research options?\n\nCombat involves an RTS game where ships duke it out. Lots pew-pew here with cool weapon and shield effects. Some battle can get pretty crazy, especially when there are lot of ships. Sometimes, the RTS mode can be buggy, and when you ahve a lot of ships on screen, the game lags. The developer is working on this problem and has posted some potential fixes.\n\nThere's a lot more to this -- included is a scenario and campaign editor. You can also experiment with a "battle-only" mode, where you can design ships and see them duke it out. No reviewers mention this! It's such a great idea, and i can't think of any modern game that includes this option.\n\nGive this game a chance --it's a one man developer, and you can surely get a good 50-60 hours of this game, if not more if you mess around with each race and the scenario editor. There's a ton of content to play around with--don't get sucked into the negative hype. The game is well worth your money.","June 21, 2015","true","225.7"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","30","47","0","0"

The game is now harder, many of the problems below are fixed. This game is still not one of the best 4x game but I would give it a 6/10 in it's current state.\n\nGround Combat is still boring as hell, feels out of place, takes a hell of a long time (and you can't save during the battle) and makes planetary invasion very tedious and boring. I really miss the old Stardrive planet battles, but even more I wish they could have gone for the MOO model instead. Stardrive 2 is basically just planetary bombardment=automatic win without any real consequences (you get some insignificant pollution). Planetary bombardment of your own planets is still just a pop up message.\n\nAt least now the game offers a challenge, although it is usually a predictable one, the only interesting factor is seeing what tech the enemy have gone for. But usually its just standard configurations.\n\nThe space battles are great, colonization is cool, empire management is okay. As stated above it is a 6/10 now.\n\nOld Review:\n\nEdit: Many fanboys are thumb downing my review, they have obviously never played any of the great old 4x games and I wish them well on their journey into the 4x space genre. The developer is working hard to rectify many of the detriments below so I may be changing this into recommended. Want to add like many other of the no fanboy reviews that long range cannons make the game very easy to exploit. Hope to see this change as well like the dev was hinting in the last update.\n\nThis is the best Strategy Starship customizer and battle simulator to date, sadly though I can't recommend the game as a full 4x product because of it detriments.\n\nHere is a summation of the Detriments:\n\nGround Combat:\nAwkward out of place RPG grid turn based board game that is slow, boring and does not belong in a 4x game ever. The customization of the soldiers is tedious, the limited amount of soldiers is stupid as it makes planetary defence which was a very cool aspect of the original Star Drive impossible. No more massing an armada on nearby planets planning your military invasion in steps in a grand strategy. Now its just 12 ground troops=automatic Win. If you need some inspiration then check out a old glory game called Imperium Galactica or it's prequel Reunion by one Hungarian team, or even better use the MASTER OF ORION II system with two armies basically just slugging it out on a battlefield referencing Empire Strikes Back battle on Hoth. Not a RPG slow grind that take ages for a simple comat which is in truth a wierd minigame within the game.\n\nNote: The Diplomacy has been greatly improved in the last update, so this criticism is no longer valid.\nDiplomacy:\nWent from exploitable in Stardrive the original into plain stupid in Stardrive 2. In the original stardrive you could get any treaty if you just sprinkled it with enough techs or capital, which made it very easy to get a cease fire even when the Opteris or Rayleh had just destroyed your armada and they stand ready to commit genocide. Now even throwing everything at a normal trade treaty the AI just says "wow you are giving me too much, this would tip the balance of power too much in our favor and we are so for equality and fairness we can't accept this"...\n\nPlanetary Bombardment:\nSo I guess the developers wanted to go back to Master of Orion II, which would be great. But don't half ♥♥♥ it! The Planetery bombardment in MOOII was great visually and strategically with planetary shields, planetary hangars, orbital gun batteries etc. But no, none of the Master of Orion goodness instead it's just a text that appears "Your planet was bombarded *YAWN*". This is just plain boring, especially visually.\n\nRaces and the lack of Factions:\nInstead of learning from other great 4x Games such as Distant Worlds where a limited number of races equal an almost endless number of factions, we are now stuck with the same 8 opponents forever, same personality, same lack of diversity and same predictable diplomacy in every game. Please add some randomness to the factions with different personality traits equaling different approaches to expansion, military and diplomatic behavior.\n\nLimitation on fleet size:\nThe new system based on command points or whatever is not a bad system, it's just a step in the wrong direction from the first game. There is no rational or logical explenation given for why i.e 7 cruisers wrecks the economy whereas 6 cruisers is just fine, just fine. Why even have this system? Why not let each component have it's maintainance cost with ability to dock your ship at planets for lower maintainance? That would make sense.\n\nPoor Camera in battle control:\nThis really bugs me, for a space battle simulator with excellent graphics you can't tilt the camera 360 degrees or even 180 degrees. Why? Even in old games such as IG2 or Homeworld you have this option, granted these games also let you change altitude of your spaceships but compare it to another game with same gameplay as Stardrive 2 which is Empire at War, where is the awesome battle cam?\n\nUnit control:\nIn general the unit control is simple and good enough with the ability to give orders like target enemy with broadside or the bow depending on what type or role or guns the ship has, and if it should keep moving in order to avoid missiles, torpedos or artillery shots or stay stationary if it's a artillery gun in space ship design. But there is no attack move function and there is no attack everything or target enemy fighters option for your own fighters which leaves you micromanaging the fighters which is tedious at best and very very frustrating at worst.\n\nLack of Multiplayer:\nStill no multiplayer for a game that in 2015 when everyone have high speed internet connection connected to steam 24/7 and would be perfect for multiplayer.\n\nWith all this being said this is still a great game, but I can't recommend it as a full fledged 4x product which it promises to be in the desciption. The humour is great, the space battles are awesome, especially the ship customizer and the general campaign is an okay game the fact that the campaign is more static than the first Stardrive and have horrible ground combat which is such an important aspect of the game leads me to the conclusion that this is not a recommended game.  It does space battles very well even with the bad camera and unit control but it is a step in wrong direction and is not an improvement over the original.","April 14, 2015","false","50.7"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","31","49","0","1"

So far (14.6h) I've been playing as Humans (with my own custom civ traits of course - they make a MAJOR difference in your gameplay experience) on Normal difficulty, huge system with 9 other civs, and I'm currently faced with enemies on both my northern and southern space borders. I'm also becoming quite chummy with some samurai space bears.\n\nNow I've seen some complaints about Stardrive 2, and I have to admit my first few hours had a couple of complaints - mainly research and... well, I'll tell you what else when I get to it. Further into the game I found out how they downgraded the spy system, but let's get back to research. I was annoyed at how you could not research all the tech on the same tier, and then I encountered my first race. (I'd like to mention that I don't go exploring the entire galaxy, so I don't encounter multiple races before I'm ready to deal with them. That'd just be STUPID... Hmm was that too rude of me?) When I entered diplomacy with them, I was happily surprised to find out that you could trade the tech they had researched for whatever you feel like giving them. After encountering a few more civs, and by the time I met up with my favorite bear shogunate, I realized that unless you take diplomatic action towards these aliens, they're gonna wonder why they should keep the stupid foriegners around rather than kill and conquer them.\n\nI should probably mention that being able to customize your ships relatively freely is a big plus for me. They made it a touch simpler than the original StarDrive, but while it was disappointing at first - I realized it cut down the time I spent designing my failures and designing new ships to replace the failures (since they sucked in combat) or redesigning my redundant ships (due to new tech). For example, in SD1 you could face all your weapon firing arcs forward. In SD2, the location of your weapon decides where it aims (except cannons/mass drivers - they always aim forward) The way around this though is to select the *arc extend* feature on the turrets you mount so they cover a 180* angle - aka they can fire forward.\n\nI'll be updating this review in a few days once I'm back home and play a bit more, so I'll leave you with this: if you like customization and you find that you can understand a game's mechanics fairly quickly, then you'll enjoy this game.","April 10, 2015","true","34.1"," 65 of 112 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","65","112","2","0"

Think Total War in space: turn based strategy map with real time space battles.\n\nLots of good humour and references to SciFi in the game, as well as colourful characters / races / art. Lots of random events and anomalies to explore - the galaxy is a big place.\n\nShip designer is quite deep and uses a module based system where you drop and drag engines, weapons etc onto your ship. Everything is directional, so shields placed on the left side will only shield the left side, and weapons have firing arcs depending on where they are placed etc. For those who don't like making ships, the game comes with default designs.\n\nThis game is heavily inspired by MoO2. If you are looking for a massive complex game like Distant Worlds or Europa Universalis, you won't find it here. Ground combat is turn based tactical similar to Xcom or Advance Wars. I would say the ground combat is alright but not great.\n\nSome of the menus need polish which I expect will come as the dev tweaks the game post-release. I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs, but the game did freeze once and the one time the UI disappeared while I was in the ship designer. There are also some game balance issues which are of course being worked on by the dev.\n\nEven still, it's worth picking up.","April 15, 2015","true","29.4"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","0"

This game begs for comparisons against MOO2 because many of its features are straight from the game and other predecessors, which is perfectly fine by me.  I actually prefer strategy games that build on the best aspects from prior games rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nThe Major Gripes:\n\n- No multiplayer.  Unfortunately, the AI is just not smart enough to maintain my interest, so after 50+ hours, I'm probably done with this game, which is kinda sad because its very solid\n\n- The AI is dumb.  I play on the hardest setting and there's just never a point where I don't have the upper hand.  I'm absolutely baffled by all of the reviews on here that say the game is too hard.  If you build two of the largest size ships you can build (with the original starting tech), no enemy player can touch you for quite a while.  Now, I don't mean to say that the AI is particularly dumb in this game.  Its not.  The stupidity of the AI, unfortunately, is a problem that spans most 4x space strategy games like this (I'm looking at you SOTS 2, MOO3, Gal Civ 3, Civ 5, etc).  However, without multiplayer, that sorta ends the game.\n\nRandom Musings:\n\n-  Designing ships is fun and just complicated enough without being too complicated and there's a lot of viable approaches to take.  Make ships super fast and give them devastating close combat weapons or slow your ships down with lots of long range artillery and kill the enemy before they get to you.\n\n- I've never found any use for building smaller than the largest ships.  The AI hasn't seemed to figure that out though, so my fleets always completely annihilate them (even on the games hardest setting).\n\n- Unfortunately, without multiplayer or a brilliant AI, your enemies will never adapt to any of your strategies, so you'll never need to vary them up.\n\n- Turn based strategy map with real time combat space combat is my favorite combination in strategy games, but this is probably a personal preference.\n\n- You can specialize worlds.  Have a very fertile planet?  Make it your bread basket.\n\n- Its pretty.  Its not going to win any awards, but its crisp and attractive and not a throwback to the 90s like Distant Worlds.\n\n- Ground combat is xcom style, but unfortunately its very limited to not being worth playing at this point.  The AI is particularly easy in ground combat once you figure out how to use shields properly.\n\n- Its got solid game mechanics.  The economy is complicated enough to be fun, and simple enough to not be tedious.","April 24, 2015","true","75.9"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","32","52","0","0"

The tutorial seems very helpful, but that's somewhat deceptive.  It doesn't tell you how to make money, for instance, and it merely touches on most of the game's concepts.  Sensing that the game had multiple layers of complexity, I started on easy to familiarize myself with the game's mechanics.  My starting position was horrible.  I was placed on a nice, resource rich planet, but was producing negative food.  Before I could stabilize that situation, I had lost two citizens to starvation.  Perhaps even worse, the tutorial forced me to colonize the nearest planet before I was even able to stabilize my home world.  The tutorial actually said, "You have no choice" and made me colonize.  The trouble is, the nearest planet was incapable of growing any food whatsoever, which meant simply that it starved out in four or five turns, wasting a colony ship.  The tutorial did say, however, "here's how to fix the lack of food - import food from  your other planet."  Very helpful advice, and I'm sure I could have managed it if, perhaps, my home world was even capable of sustaining itself at that point.\n\nIn terms of finances, I was constantly running a negative of at least -2 BC (billions of credits), usually -5.  At one point I went from -30 BC in the bank to a surplus of over 300, with no explanation at all.  Then my surplus slowly dwindled.  Or quickly, because in the first part of the game, you're really just hitting "end turn" as fast as you can because there's nothing really to do.  There's no concept of time, or how long things should take to build and some of the items seem prohibitively lengthy to construct.  Even with my citizens focused on production, the most basic of star ships took 15-20 turns to produce.\n\nOf course that's to say you have an idea of the relative power of the ships to begin with.  You don't, at least not initially.  You don't know what ships are good, and certainly not compared to the AI's ships.  You don't know how big you should create your fleet.  With the construction times, it turns out that if I were to produce a fleet that was big enough to defend against the armada the AI brought to the final battle, I woulnd't have produced anything else in my home world, and I even then it would have been big enough.  If you don't have a big enough fleet, well, by the time you realize it it's too late.  It's hard to add two ships to your fleet in hopes of staving off the enemy that just appeared in your system when the smallest ship takes a half dozen turns.\n\nUndoubtedly this can all be chalked up to my unfamiliarity with the game.  I was unable to colonize any planets effectively (I finally retook that first colony, only to have it destroyed from orbit a few turns later), whereas my neighbors had six, seven, or eight planets all, ostensibly, churning out ships.  I hope that I'll get better at it, though at this point it feels like several hours of my life were wasted.  Coupled with the utter hopelessness of seeing a big fleet appear when you thought you were content with four or five small ships...  Hard to want to keep playing.  Plus the AI is quite deceptive; the first engagements were very easy to win.  You're lulled into a false sense of security with a modest fleet, focus on building up your population and home world, and then the AI hits you hard.  Game. Over.\n\nSpeaking of the AI: It's pretty aggressive.  My first encounters with it were positive.  Let's trade?  Okay?  Good.  You want to trade tech?  Sure.  Then it demanded tech, for nothing.  Then, all the sudden, it tells me, "I told you I claimed that world, now I'm going to take it!" and declares war.  He never mentioned that at all, first of all, and second of all, it was my home world...\n\nTechnology is a bit awkward.  As I understand it, you can only research one tech in a given part of the tree.  After you get the one, that's it for that part (unless you trade tech) and the tree moves on to a different part.  Sort of interesting, I suppose, but you feel pretty locked in, and if you make a mistake and research something that doesn't fit with your eventual style, tough.  And I think that even the first techs took at least seven turns to research.  The third or fourth tier jumps to over 60.\n\nShipbuilding and fleet management is also a bit awkward.  I can't see any way of retrofitting new tech like armor to existing ships.  You can change the ship's template, I think.  But even that's klunky.  I didn't see any way to strip a template to start from scratch, so you have to manually remove everything.  There's probably a way, but I didn't see one.  I don't see any way to remove designs from the list of designs either.  The concept of this is fantastic, and it looks great.  But there could be some refinements.  For example, there's a button that allows you to replace all the steel armor in a design with a newer form (plasteel).  However, when you click that button it only replaced half the armor and removed the rest, leaving huge blank spaces.  I'm sure there was a reason, but the game offered none.  So by clicking that button you made your ship invalid (because every design must have 75% of its space filled with components).  It isn't as simple as replacing armor, now you have to add other stuff.  The second time I tried it, a few turns later, it replaced all the armor properly.  Again, no explaination for what went wrong or anything.\n\nAll in all, I think the game has a lot of potential.   I love the idea of being able to customize your ships.  But the game is not very forgiving.  The tutorial is somewhat lacking.  And you don't know if you're doing anything right at all.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, probably.  Just be aware that the learning curve might be a bit steeper than you anticipate.","April 10, 2015","true","8.3"," 48 of 82 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","48","82","3","2"

The way the AI worked, the combat system, the whole game really. I hated it. Just like I hated the first Stardrive. You know what I did though? I kept at it, until finally, I got the hang of it. I loved Stardrive after that and I was expecting something different from the sequel. I was a little disappointed, but you can't always get exactly the things you want. No, this game isnt exactly Stardrive. It's Stardrive 2. It's great in it's own way, JUST like Stardrive was.\n\nJust because it isn't exactly what some people were expecting doesn't mean it's a bad game. It took me almost two whole days to actually start enjoying this game. Now that I figured it out, I love it. If you liked Stardrive, then try this one out. It's a different experience but it's great all the same. If it's not for you, then it just isn't. No need to leave a bad review on OPENING DAY because it has problems or doesn't meet your expectations. This guy, Zero, put out two patches almost right on top of each other after listening to peoples complaints and bug reports. Where else do you get  service like that for your games? You don't, or at least not anywhere else in my experience. Be happy about that at least.\n\nAnyway, in conclusion I suppose, this game isn't exactly Stardrive, if you want that play Stardrive by all means it's a great game. So is this game, it just takes some time to adjust. The "customer service" from these developers is insanely good. Don't like something or think its broken? Bring it up, they'll probably fix it. Buy this game if you like Stardrive, or space games, or 4Xs. You'll enjoy it if you do.\n\n","April 12, 2015","true","187.2"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","0"

A lot of time working on blackbox....\n\nI didnt really play the game as a game until it was released because i wanted to wait to play the real thing.\nI was not thrilled about the game being TBS. I know people like that but I really dig 4x RTS. being tbs was a big turn off to me.\n\nBut... It works here. i can take my time. put it down to do something else. I still am much more attracted to RTS 4x but something about this game i find very engaging. I think its the ship design and how it fits in with the game.\n\nI find there is a connection between ship design and strategic use of the ships. research labs on a ship provide research points and provide ship combat function.\nsensors are useful.\ni find myself making my own command ships. ships with larger bridges and long range weapons and sensors and what not designed to give the rest of the more combat ships a better strategic use.\n\n\nI find myself making diverse fleets of ships with specific roles and not just mobs of super combat ships.\nI like that a lot. Thats not a feeling i get in a lot of these games where the ship design feels part of overall game.\n\nThere are also all these mini quests and adventures. like what sd1 what trying to do with the revoran and such but did not make it and some of these quests are just killer in concept.\n\nbut... There are launch bugs. Ill update this review in week or so and see where its at. There are not a lot of game breaking bugs. the one i hit was in the ground combat with deployable shields where i put the shields down in such a way that blocked my progress and it stuck me. no way forward no way out.\nthose kinds of things will make me put a game down pretty quick but that is the only one i found like that and its avoidable.\n\nthere are other bugs that muck up the gameplay too but i havent hit them.\n\nFinal word... I enjoy this game. i dont say that lightly. I find it engaging and entertaining. Making my ship designs and feeling like they are mine and they make a difference and have a unique kind of role makes me feel part of the game.\n\nPeople say the AI is hard. i have not found that but i say thats good. I want a good AI. I dont want it to cheat. I want it to smartly kick my ♥♥♥.\n\nedit.\nthe AI is not really all that good. it has an initial good economic model that will cause people looking to take it easy a hard time but once the player learns the game they will stomp the ai currently.\n\ndev is still working on that.\n\ngame is still pretty fun though.","April 11, 2015","true","321.4"," 42 of 73 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","42","73","3","1"

I have played stardrive and many many other 4x games.  Probably my favorite Genre.  Honestly i was on the fence about this one.  I didn't know if i wanted to spend the money and jump in, but after watching some lets plays, I had to try it.\n\nThe Good:\nStardrive ship customization. Probably the biggest thing here.  You can literally make any ship you want and make it work, Its based on these little squars blocks outlining your ships interior and its 4 quadrents.  Each quadrent having a different gun facing and its own hps.\n\nThe 4x-ness- spying, diplomacy, trading, combat. Multiply paths to victory.  Side missions and quest.  Which i might add can be harder than some of the AI players.\n\nThe fact that there is ground combat. So, This is also a negative but still the fact they they at least have something representing ground combat is good from the point of future development.\n\nThey game iteslf is Turnbased, but the combat is real time in an instanced battlefield.  I really like this!  One thing I didnt like about Stardrive 1 was that a battle would be really messy and meander all over the place. Some might like that, but for me having an actually formal engagement really made this fun for me. It also opens up battle arena that is also in the game.  So less persistant RTS and more Gratuitous space battles.\n\nThe look and asthetic is well done. Hard to believe they have such a small team working on it.\n\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nSome things are half done or not fully fleshed out.  Ground combat needs a lot more love, but it is still enjoyable for me.\n\nThere are some bugs here and there that need fixing\n\nMany racial weapons/tech/ship layouts are unbalanced or non existant.  I.e Kulrathi have their own melee weapon and defensive skill for ground combat, and they have tech that furthers this in the ???? tree for research. Pollops and Squids have it also, but races like human Vulfar chukk are kind of out in the cold.  Not to mention an optri cruiser has almost 2x the space to put modules on it than the vulfar.  I know that this is being looked at but for now its in the negative column as it directly effects the game in a big way.\n\nThe game to me seems more like a beta, but I am a purist that believe games are not launched until they are ready and polished.\n\n\n\nConclusion: ok so I would not have recommended this game when it launched, but in just a few days the developer released so many big changes in under a week that I had to take the plunge.  Sure, is it not finished and buggy. Yes, but I would rather have a game where the developer is constantly updating it to make it better than a ok game that gets and update every 6 months to a year.\n","April 15, 2015","true","207.0"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Both in features and bugs. It is a shame though because the game is surprisingly well done. The UI is fluid and pleasant to look at (contrary to Galactic Civilizations 3). It has both tactical space and ground combat. It has beautifully rendered planets and the map is organised and does not become cluttered when you zoom out (again unlike Galactic Civilizations 3). But where it fails is in two areas.\n\nThe game is incomplete. The ground combat is woefully underdeveloped, diplomacy is not very well done, building starbases is almost useless (except getting command points) and it takes way too quick to max out research techs which makes the game almost feel like a rush-type 4X game. The tactical combat, although refreshingly good for a 4X game, is not balanced and the different weapons and defence system can range from really good to practically useless.\n\nThen you have the lack of variety of ships where every race has only one ship model per tier.\n\nAnd then ofcourse you have the bugs. The worse is probably when you invade a planet and sometimes you are in control of your enemies(!) units instead of yours. It is nothing that can't be fixed but still reduce the gameplay quite a lot.\n\nThat being said there are a lot of good things with the game. I already mentioned the good UI and tactical combat and how you fit your ships is really nice with a lot of cool weapons and utility modules. Sadly though that the rest of the game has so many problems because this is truly amazing game if you take into account the fact that it was developed by only one person.\n\nThat being said, I found it well worth the money because you can replay it quite a lot. So despite the lack of bugs and incomplete areas, it will still give you some fun for your money.","October 5, 2015","true","151.0"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","28","47","0","0"

This is a game made on a shoe string budget by what seems to be a single guy. He releases regular patches to fix the things he has broken in previous patches. The graphics are not going to win any awards and the gameplay at the end gets a bit repetitive. With all those negatives, this is actually a really really good game. I would put this in a similar league to tetris when it first came out. It's one of those games that will eat away at your life as you play again and again. The sight of your intergalactic empire sending out fleets of ships to defend against an attacking race is exciting. Will my fleet make it to the planet before I lose it to an invasion, will my state of the art research win the technological arms race and allow me to turn the tide of battle?

Sunk a good 200 hours of time into this game throughout it's development cycle.\n\nThis game styles itself as a kind of spiritual successor to MoO2. It's a mix of turn based strategy with real time tactical combat. Because the game instances the fights, similar to Total War (But in space), the game is able to support hundreds of fleets, and thousands of ships in the same galaxy.\n\nThe main feature of this game is that, like in SD1, you design the ships you take into combat. There's a few pictures on the store page that depict it. You can design your ships to do whatever you want them to do in combat. You can load them down with fighter bays and kill your enemies with bug bites, artillery ships that stay far back and lob Gauss cannon rounds and torpedoes, short range anti-fighter ships with beam and flak weaponry, or ships that combine multiple features. By far, this is one of my favorite features of the game. There's nothing like designing your own fleets to send against your enemies.\n\nThe replayability is also great because of the customization options for your species, and because each species gets their own unique technologies. Both ground combat and space combat can be autoresolved based upon the relative strength of your forces VS the enemy's forces. This is helpful in the late game, when there are a lot of small skirmishes (Which I usually autoresolve) and a few huge battles (Which I command myself).\n\nAll in all, I think this is a wonderful 4x game. I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys strategy/4x games, and for sure anyone who played and enjoyed MoO2.","April 9, 2015","true","237.2"," 53 of 95 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","53","95","0","0"

Slightly buggy, but I found it more fun than MOO2 (!!!).\n\nThe long of it:\nCompared to the initial StarDrive, this game removes a lot of mechanics (real-time play, space battles integrated in the strategic/galaxy view, ability to research the whole tech-tree), making it less of a successor to SD1 and more of a spiritual successor to Master of Orion 2.\nIt plays almost the same way, with some added complexity (real-time space battles, ground battles, empire resupply range), while updating the UI to make the game play faster (sortable planet list, fewer clicks required to do most actions etc.).\n\nI played MOO2 and SD2 side-by-side, and I had more fun with SD2, especially due to MOO2's ponderous interface. Also, SD2 has a bit more *oomph* during battles, better spy mechanics and more race options. So, I'll say that SD2 does almost everything the same as MOO2, some things better, and I'll just list the (potential) drawbacks:\n\n- [edit: mostly fixed:] still slightly buggy, still slightly unbalanced, but stable and patched often.\n- tactical space battles replaced with real-time batles. Faster games, more ships, but less control.\n- ground combat is quite simple. Tactics, research, quests and individual equipment decisions make a huge difference, and this reactivity makes it fun.\n- [edit: Fixed! Game is much less micro-intensive now:] no auto-build/governor. The game slows down in the later stages because of this big issue.\n- no ship capture / scrap to get techs mechanic.\n- some racial traits, technologies, ship modifications and mechanics "missing", like converting Gas Giants/Asteroid Belts into planets, Core Dumps to get rid of pollution, and many end-game MOO2 niceties. Some new mechanics do compensate (ability to colonise Asteroid Belts, racial trait to generate less polution).\n\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game, and I give it a 19/20.\n\nBelter Pride.\n\n---\nEdit:\nAfter playing more of the game, I did encounter more bugs, including the switch sides one (where I get to control only the ships of my enemy in combat). Still, game support and update has been good, and so is stability.\nI also love the developer's hesitance to nerf, and desire to seek alternate solutions for balance (i.e. counter).\nI would lower my score to 17/20, but still remains very much recommended.","April 24, 2015","true","93.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

Yes, and no.\n\nThere are nine awesome races that all have an unique feel. But all these nine are not very well balanced. A race of robot bugs are the most op with a cruiser class ship with as much room as a battleship from other races while the wulfar has very limited space to work with.\nI would prefer that you could choose a layout you wanted and a look you wanted. You can choose to play the wolves with the same traits as the Robot-bugs, but not the same ship. A bit weird.\n\nThe map generation is good, you can choose how many opponents, who these opponents will be and if you want random pirates attack. The size of the map can range all the way up to 100 stars, and each star can have up to four planets soo get ready for some exploration.\n\nThe early game runs really well and with a tech-tree where you only get to choose one of two or three really good upgrades you will feel that your decisions do matter. You'll get a few colonies up and running (more likely than not on barren ultra-poor high G planets but still) and you'll tech up some new fancy moduel like mass drivers for you ships. Now comes the fun part. Building the ships!\n\nThis is the reason i feel like you should buy this game, The shipbuilding is awesome. You need to carefully think if you really NEED that last cannon or if you should add an other layer of armour. You'll need to think how long this ship will be in battle, is 226 sec enough for a whole battle? Will you need more ammo?\nI could spend hours in this part of the game.\n\nThe mid game starts when you have found the other races, some of them will want to trade with you, others will just want to take your hard earned stuff. Here the game falls flat. There is no point of being friendly to the others. There is no such thing as allies in StarDrive 2.\nEven if the flower-plant-alien loves you to 100% you still have you still have to kill them to win.  If you are combat oriented however you'll do just fine.\n\nLate game is weird. If you get here it's too late. One of the other races have half the galaxy and the number of ships in each battle are above 30 capital ships on each side. All with their own massive effects. The number of small ships can be over 60 + fighters(4/module and a ship could have 3-10 of these). It just gets too laggy to play and you'll find that you just want to peace out.\n\nHow ever, I do recommend this game. There are rumors on the forums that there soon will be a fix to diplomacy. And even just as it is now I cant help but too love it. Seeing your ships destroy 5 times as many as you have is rewarding. Ground combat is fun even if it's a little bare bones. Tending colonies are not the most fun but not the worst either. As for difficulty, the game is kinda easy when you get the hang of it.\n\nShipbuilding doe! There is no other game that does this as awesome as StarDrive. just oh my god. If you into customization give this game a try!

It felt buggy and weird sometimes but it also felt somehow right and had a lot of good ideas. I never got to finish a match though, because in the end there were always some flaws which made it impossible to continue (always attacking remnant fleets for example which felt immensly like a bug but I couldn't say it was).\n\nThe second part is similar but loses its real-time focus. In some parts this felt worse: for example my favourite moment from the first game was when ships warped out of a sector and this is gone. But when you play a little bit you get to like the turn-based, more "strategic" command of your fleets. Battles are not taking place in the "real" map, but in special battle areas, similar to the game Gratuitous Space Battles. This is fine I think.\n\nBut how these fights get started feels often very strange, for example when an enemy fleet is attacking one of your planets and you put your whole fleet there. On the way, however, the enemy is passing another of your planets. The AI clearly didn't intend to attack this other planet, but since it's in the proximity of this planet it starts a battle and you lose a planet. It's strange and there are a lot of those moments in this game.\n\nOne other example is a remnant fleet attacking your planet, but since it doesn't have ground troops it just blocks it. Now, I don't know if I'm maybe just to stupid to find it, but you can't stop freighters from transporting food. So this planet was constantly spawning my empty freighters and the remnant ships destroyed them instantly. All in all I feel like there is a lot of options from the first part missing (for example the dialoge with alien races) and replaced with strange other things (like the AI television show). All of this feel like it was put in with a lot of vision but it lacks in execution.\n\nI couldn't finish a game there either. I played on easy but the AI constantly spammed me with ships which was just so annoying that I stopped playing. Every round in the end-game was micromanaging for me. And not the fun kind. Sorry StarDrive, I really liked your premise and I really hope you improve. I will stay tuned, but in this state I can't recommend you.","December 2, 2015","false","27.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's very good. In my opinion it doesn't (yet) surpass the incredible MOO2 but it might be the best space 4X to come out since then. That said it is still something of a rough diamond and there is definitely room for improvement, fortunately the developer is generally responding to constructive criticism and I am hopeful that he will continue to refine the game.\n\n\nThe good -\n\nThe whole game oozes personality, ships look amazing, races are well designed and battles are really impressive.\n\nThere are some really nice innovations. Designing ships is great fun. Interactions with events and minor races are on the whole well implemented and the way these elements play out is both interesting and rewarding.\n\nThe diplomacy system - it's innovative and I really like it in principle. Although this is countered somewhat by the limited number of diplomatic interactions.\n\nThe basic game mechanics are a lot like MOO2 and that, for me at least, is a very good thing.\n\nThe space battles are a great spectacle and a lot of work has clearly gone into them. There are some weapon balance issues but these are already being looked at and patched.\n\nIt's generally stable, I have experienced no crashes so far and have encountered only one bug, which has already been fixed. As far as I can tell it's in a much better state than SD1 was on release.\n\n\nThe bad -\n\nThere's only one victory condition and it's via the total elimination of all opponents. I have some concerns that the need for complete eliminations will make the late game a boring grind, this is one of the biggest issues with 4X games in general and I am disappointed that SD2 has not addressed it, at least not yet.\n\nThere's no benchmarking mechanism to see how you compare to your opponents, there's not even a basic score counter. I realise this is personal taste, to an extent, but for me it is a significant issue and I hope to see it addressed soon.\n\nThe lack of fleet formations, you fleets turn up for battles in any old shape. This means you can either manually arrange every single ship before any battle or just don't bother, I found my approach quickly became the latter option, and that is irritating and immersion breaking.\n\n\n\nOn the whole the bad bits haven't (so far) detracted from my overall enjoyment of what is a fun game with huge potential. I would unquestionably recommend Stardrive 2 even as it is at present and if improvements continue to be made it could just be the true MOO2 successor that many people have been waiting nearly 20 years for.","April 14, 2015","true","120.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

You can manage the individual buildings on a colony simmilar to Masters of Orion.\n\nYou can only reasearch one tech in three. This forces you to trade via diplomacy or steal with spies. A good game mechanic. Diplomacy is transparent and fair. Tooltips tell you all the bonuses, makes it easy to navigate alian diplomacy.\n\nReal time space battles are very good. You send in your custom designed starships, and let em duke it out. Not much in the way of stratigy. Just who has bigger guns and more armor. Wide variety of webs makes it interesting. I'm alwase testing new ship designs.\n\nOnly con I have is that ground battles suck. The graphics are very poor in this section. Your troops are put on a chess board, and attack a few times per turn. Really boring. If it wasn't so crusial to defending my planets.  I would never use it.\n\nOverall 8/10. Probbably the best 4x game out right now. But that isn't saying much.

From the very beginning, you are met with hyper aggressive ai pirates and crystals entities who invade your space.\n\nThe design philosophy here is that you MUST be combat-centric in order to survive and succeed. You MUST focus on military and defenses. This is not a matter of subjective, personal opinion, even the dev has stated this is necessary.\n\nAnd that is why it deviates from the traditional, popular, successful 4x genre that most 4x fans enjoy.  This game is a 0x, 0x, 0x, 1x game.\n\nThe real problem with the design: No Freedom\n...this is not an empire building game. It's not an exploration game. It's not a "focus on advancement game". It's not a diplomacy game. It's purely a "do specific actions so you are as efficient as possible." Why? Because the AI is incredibly efficient and does not play as a human being would (flawed) or simulated race would, it plays as a computer trying to be as efficient as possible and does so with no setbacks.\n\nI yearn for the days of MOO and MOO2, even Gal Civ series. These were 4x games that did it right. They allowed freedom in how the player would mold their empire and interact with the universe. You have no such freedom here.\n\nA 4x game (whether it is set in space or otherwise, typically gives the player the opportunity to focus on non-military philosophies. You can't do that with SD2, it's all about military power and having it as early as possible, and having as much of it as possible.\n\nA 4x game typically allows you the freedom to focus on being the most advanced race. You can't with SD2, it's all about military power and having it as early as possible, and having as much of it as possible.\n\nI, like many playhers, enjoy turtle races, taking the higher road, the more benevolent path. Focus on maximizing colonies to their fullest potential, maximizing diplomacy, maximizing technology, and having a big stick (advanced military) that is capable or sufficient, but isn't needed for rapid expansion or constant defenses due to hyper-aggressive ai. You can't do that with SD2, it's all about military power and having it as early as possible, and having as much of it as possible.\n\nCool mechanics, good graphics...all goofed up because of silly design choices that require the player to focus on military might or else.\n\nSD2 does do some things right, but when it comes to allowing the player to play a variety of strategies and roles...it fails miserably IMO.\n\nEasy Mode?\nA recent patch was implemented to make it "easier" for those who felt the ai was too aggressive. What this did was made it so you had a slightly better chance at combat in the beginning. You still have to focus on establishing a strong military however.\n\nIn other words, the patch address the concerns of those who wish to focus on combat and aggressive play by making it easier for them to do so...but it does absolutely nothing for the fans of the 4x genre who actually enjoy different strategies other than combat.  You are still requierd to quickly build up a solid defense and military so you can succeed.\n\nConclusion\nFor those who are wanting a traditional 4x space game like the classic such as Masters of Orion or Galactic Civilization, you will not find it here. You will be heavily disappointed.\n\nFor those who prefer to play with a very aggressive military, focus on combat and a large or advanced military (as it is required), you will probably enjoy the game.\n\nAs others have said in the forums, the inspiration for this game does not appear to be the traditional 4x space game, but rather rts games (SC2 for example). The game probably would have been better received if it were an RTS actually as that is the crowd that seems to enjoy it the most.\n\n"Combat! Combat! Combat!"  If that isn't your "rallying cry" for what you want in a game...then Star Drive 2 probably isn't going to appeal to you as that is all it is, a space combat sim...and one that you really need to be efficient in as the AI does not make mistakes or cut corners when it comes to building fleets or engaging yours.","April 11, 2015","false","2.7"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","28","49","2","0"

I still think this is an amazing game BUT The things this game needs to fix is the dipomacy the AI wants to War all the time even if they are consider a "good" race. The AI does cheat and the rules that the human player needs to follow the AI does not for example, If the human player enters the AIs empire space they can kill the ships without going to war. If the AI comes into the human empire and we try to do the same thing we have to go to war with them. ALSO! The AI can claim planets in the human empire but when we do it to the AIs they pretty much delcare war. The pirates only spawn around the human players empire and never anywhere else which is dumb but atleat you can turn off pirates.\n\nIf the depomacy in this game would to change for the better and have the AI follow the same rules/laws we have to this game would be 10/10 in my books","April 14, 2015","true","69.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

We are to version 1.0h, and none of the bugs mentioned below have been addressed. Meanwhile the developer has plans to release a named patch with new features while balance issues still exist. This misplaced sense of priorities makes me think the game will never be balanced, or patched, correctly.\n\nThe good: It's an addictive 4X game that steals a lot from MOO 2. Many of the tech are taken directly from MOO 2 and choosing one topic locks you out of other choices, just like MOO 2, forcing you to use diplomacy to acquire them. It's a pretty game overall. The switch to turn based play for the galaxy map is a good one. The real time ship battles look great. It has that one more turn feeling. This is Moo 2 brought up to date. That should be good, right?\n\nThe bad: Here are just some examples to give you an idea of what I'm complaining about.\n\nShip design: it's a fiddly process. The game doesn't remember your previous choices in terms of size and quality of your components, forcing extra clicks as you fine tune your design. Also I have had the game simply refuse to save designs I've spent 10 minutes making, losing my work. Speaking of losing my work, the game will erase your work if you click a new hull. There is no 'mirror mode' that would allow you to quickly apply armor to 2 sides of a ship.\n\nThe game's soundscape is poor. Some sounds are simply not mixed correctly. The game released with serious balance issues in terms of the different difficulty levels. This has been addressed somewhat in a patch, but still needs work. When being attacked, you can't see the components the enemy ships have. Listening posts and refueling stations have the same icon on the galaxy map, making it impossible to tell which is which at a glance. At the moment, listening posts are bugged and acting like refueling stations. When one of your planets lacks something to build, the on screen notification of that is ridiculously tiny and tucked in the bottom right, making it easy to miss.\n\nI hope this gives you an idea of the general state of the game. There are bugs, and there are things that are either just plain wrong, or clunky, when managing your empire. As I said above, the deveoper seems to be more interested in 'building buzz' by releasing a 'superpatch' than polishing his game.","April 16, 2015","false","97.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The AI just rolls in and mucks about creating all sorts of annoyances.  These aren't annoying because they are challenging, it is because it feels cheap.\nI absolutely do not enjoy the systems in place for taking over planets.\nMore systems need to be put in place to respect the players time.  My biggest annoyances with any 4x are always late game empire management.  The game does not notify you when a planet isn't working on anything.

The AI also DOES NOT CHEAT. It will unsettle most of your 4x game habits. You will not get 50-100 turns of peace to quietly build resources & infastructure and expand to your hearts content. You have to prepare for an attack immediately. It may not come, but it most likely will.\n\nIt is different than most 4x in that your in danger from turn one. I start every turn with the question, can i fend off an enemy fleet this turn if a wormhole opens up on my homeworld. If i answer no, then build ships. This game heavily rewards players garrisoning units (half command points and no maintanance).\n\nThe AI is AMAZING! Any game you have ever played where the AI decision making could be exploited and you thought to yourself, I shouldn't be able to do this. The AI is actually very cunning. It will wait for you to launch attacks outside of your teritory, so your ships are low on fuel and have trouble returning to defend. It will steal from you, it will backstab you.\n\nThere is no science victory, there is no diplomatic victory. You have one goal, domination. You can turtle, but only to counter attack. Yeah, expect the AI to have garrisons.\n\nI highly recommend this game. You will have to practice at it to get better. The in game tutorial is excellent. The tooltips are excellent. Do not give up on the game if you start losing.

It has a lot of promise, but it is simply too unpolished to be considered great or even good. Every game basically starts the same, Same unoriginal encounters, same spawn problems. Even choosing the largest possible map (100 systems) the game always seems to spawn all the races right on top of each other. Meaning that normal 4x expansion and exploration is severely limited as you are effectively boxed in from the start. Ground combat is a joke. It is nearly impossible to defeat the bear race on the ground, they will walk over any garrison you build no matter what tech you have. Other races will often make unreasonable demands, even if you are friendly or allied with them. The Opteris, for example, demanded several of my worlds in order to not declare war on me, even though we were allies at the time. I've also had races declare war on me only a few turns after meeting me. It doesn't seem that the faction relations (good, bad, hostile, whatever) have any bearing on how that race reacts to you. The game does have a decent shipyard though, allowing you to customize any ship with upgrades and new tech to your hearts desire. With time and work put in, the game could be great, but at this time, even after patches, it is still lacking.\n","August 16, 2015","false","28.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

In combat if a round hits your left flank and that's where you decided to cram a bunch of unshielded nuke reactors you can kiss your butt goodbye. Try a bit more armor next time. To supplement the AI's ability in this area they will occasionally use templates you made for their race when you play against them so beware. This sytem is slightly simpler than in SD1 but I think that's all to the good, having to lay wiring was kind of dumb in my opinion.\n\nYou move these ships between star systems and engage in RTS fleet combat that often looks a lot like "Gratuitous Space Battles." It's great, it runs better than in SD1, and there's a lot of strategy involved as before. My only complaint on this front is that click and drag selection is a little fiddly and you can't always tell a group of the same ships to use their ability simultaneously. You may think that your ships are being unresponsive but it's probably that someone scrapped your engine with a well placed shot or took out your power supply!\n\nPlanets have a mapped out surface where you place buildings and any planetary invasion or boarding action turns into turn-based infantry combat that looks like a less developed X-COM. Sadly, this is the weakest element of the game at the moment because planetary invasions play out on a flat open grid with no obstacles and you have vision of everyone the whole time. In my opinion that sort of takes all the charm out of the X-COM model and I hope we get more varied maps and fog of war in the future. It's servicable though, and if you want you can avoid it by bombarding planets from orbit or auto-resolving the battles.\n\nDiplomacy is pretty cool and a big improvement from the first game. Any item that can be traded or negotiated for has a numerical "trade value." You can attempt to trade anything for anything (colonies for techs for trade rights for an exchange of citizens) but there is a "tolerance" stat that puts a hard cap on how much you or the AI is willing to give up. It's dictated by racial stats like whether your trade partner is a repulsive insect monster and also by past dealings.\n\nSpying is simplified from the first game and works a lot like Civ V or BE spying -- you can have defensive spies or deploy spies to enemy sectors. Not a lot to say about it really, functional but uninteresting.\n\nThe tech tree is VERY Masters of Orion (two thumbs up!) You get to pick one of three techs on each tier of a discipline, leaving the others behind. The only way to acquire those extra two techs is to trade for them, steal them with spies, or assimilate them when you conquer another race. It means races develop very differently and I prefer it to the "eventually learn everything" approach of Civilization.\n\nCitizens are juggled between farming, industrial production, and research on each planet and you can ferry them around to populate your new colonies; This is accomplished with freighters, which are also your trade ships. Like trade caravans in Civilization V or BE they're vulnerable and their routes need to be protected.\n\nLastly there's a mission system at play here. Some missions are to do with the "Hero characters" you can pick up who have different traits and can be used in combat or to govern your colonies. They vary wildly from each other which is pretty cool, the whole thing is well done. These hero characters are not invincible and you have to be very careful ferrying them around or running them into combat. Other missions will be random occurences or show up as anomalies on the strategic map that you go check out. Sometimes non-faction NPCs will spawn to harass you and there are also space creatures lying in wait to ruin your day.\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting pull the trigger and be prepared to die a couple of times learning the ropes! There are quite a few more mechanics I didn't get to but this turned into a wall of text already so i'll spare you any more. If none of the above grabbed you I really don't think this is your genre because this is a fine example and very impressive for such a small studio.\n\nPS: Fuel demand driving you crazy? BUILD TANKER SHIPS FOR YOUR FLEET! Fuel is shared between all the ships in your fleet so there's no need to cram it into every vessel. Just make sure that you warp those tankers out of harm's way when a battle kicks off or you're gonna have a bad time.","April 13, 2015","true","54.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Good tech trees.  Interesting species. Similar character traits.  Thats where my pros end.\n\nBoring, slow, space combat. "Tolerance" keeps politics from reaching its full potential.\n\nPoor AI makes for horrible automated fights especially for planet invasions. Fight all your battles yourself.  That said the land battles are painful to be part of.  They are unintuitive, difficult to work through and unrewarding.  I feel like they are punishment for invading.  If you choose "auto" resolve be prepared for ridiculous consequences.  In land combat, Its very common to grossly outnumber your opponent by 50:1 and lose all your troops, and then have the game crash.  I assume its because there is only so much space to place your troops the computer automatically kills them before battle begins.\n\nAs for space combat, mass driver cannons are overpowered and take out any thought or development from ship creation.   You will need to micromanage your own ships as the AI really is not bright at all and you will find your overpowered ships pulled apart by an unintuitive computer admiral.\n\nOverall, not very polished and needs to be updated with some of its bugs adressed. With all of these bugs and oversights I think the worst has to do with pathing.  The pathing problem keeps ships from entering refit queues as they "hop" and "skip" over the planets they should be docking at, this same pathng problem occurs when trying to attack planets or passing fleets.  Of course this is only a problem if you can actually select the ships themselves which is an ordeal, the only thing harder than that is trying to mouse over several ships at once.  A process that works 50% of th etime.\n\nAnother issue that annoyed me to no end was the "overlays".  When a new menu, map or option was overlaid upon another you could still access the GUI under it, so while trying to build something on a planet economy screen I would actually click the queue on the main map listing all of the items created on the turn before.  Annoying.\n\nAll of these problems make it nearly unplayable as these bugs often cause game crashes, forcing me to reload an "autosave", only to lose the last 4-10 turns and the hundreds of actions that likely went with them.  I play it not because I love it, but because for the price point it sucks less than the alternatives out there.\n\nIn the end I think I should have saved my money until the problems were adressed rather than having it forced through like so many other "indie"games only to have updates added later.\n\nThere's a reason it has dropped to half its price and put on sale so many times in two months.\n\nEdit ** The first two patches have actually made the game more unplayable.  You can no longer choose to NOT send in your leaders in planet auto combat, so now they die.  THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER "AUTO COMPLETE" GROUND COMBAT!!\n\n-Fleets will now randomly disappear and become unuseable. THIS MAKES GAME COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE\n\n-Added "governnor control" is poorly implemented and far from potential.","June 21, 2015","false","229.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

My time with Stardrive 2 has been very up and very down.\n\nLet's start with the up's. First the price of the game is competitive with other indi games. Second the races are fairly balanced. Third the tech tree that forces you to skip a particular tech but later aquire it through trade is a fantastic idea, forcing you to expand your playstyle into areas you might not have chosen with diplomacy mattering. Fourth is designing ships. Seeing a ship that you custom built wreck the universe is one of the best parts of the game. Last is having the ship battles being free moving and not on a grid. Gridded ship battles would have been so much easier to create but free moving ships that can dodge with a proper timed burst of speed or be swarmed with smaller ships is the best.\n\nNow the worst. Bad starting systems can spell doom on turn one. Having a hero buff three even four planets can be such a huge boost to playability that getting stuck with only one hurts bad. Next is wormholes. Wormholes often give a direct perment route to your home solar system which spells doom for the player as the AI seems to cheat with ship building production. Also on the topic of wormholes a mysterious race will nonstop attack you with much more advanced ships when you least can afford to be attacked from special random wormholes. Most of my playtime was spent turtling due to wormholes. Kind of kills the explore part of 4X. Special research is avaliable but has to be turned on and off with a slider by the user and isn't explained very well. Hell sliders don't work well at all due to zero percise control of the numaric imput. Ships need a testing ground because important battles have been lost because a ship did not function as I believed it would. DO NOT USE MISSLES. Take my word for it. Last is the stability/loading issues. I did have a few nothing a autosave load didn't fix but after patch 1 I cannot load a campaign more than 33% rendering that mode useless. Deleted the game and redownloaded but same issue. I guess I will wait for patch 2.\n\nAt the moment I feel very torn about the game. It is very much a 4x game but with amazing RTS portions that make it very fun to play but the speed you make contact with hostile AI combined with often lack luster starts can force rerolls untill a viable start can be had. That paired with the INABILITY TO PLAY THE GAME makes it where I cannot recommend the game to anyone who is reading this. Maybe in a month when it has been properly patched but that is another review.","April 11, 2015","false","136.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

In my opinion, Zero made an update and enhancemend to Master of Orion II! Many tried to, no one succeeded. But Stardrive II will be the historical landmark after 18 years to be the No. 1 in 4X strategies! Yes, the game is not easy. I've never played such a challenging 4X game in 25 years, which was in a playable condition at the same time. They've brought out a finished product at release. That is unfortunately not common since developers can easily patch via Internet. The game needs some tweaks and a bit further development to reflect the issues raised in the feedbacks, like more victory conditions. But the new patch looks very promision and I am convinced, it will soon have reached the polished status, which makes Stardrives the all time No.1 in the 4X genre.

The real-time "pause every 3 seconds to stop your fleet's ai from being dumb" is just clumsy and aggravating in my opinion; and I think alot of old school 4x fans (and those new to 4x who love the MOO2 gameplay) feel the same way.  It just gives a better foundation for all aspects of the game.\n\nFrom the reviews that I've passed by, almost all had a critique similar to "Diplomacy underwhelming... too much focus on combat".  ...Of the game's major aspects, diplomacy does pale to the rest when it comes to the matter of depth and detail.  However, I'm one of those that prefers to blast my way through and spend hours mastering my own path down the tech-tree.  (Not to mention the new and more fun to use ship editor). And I'd much rather see the devs focus on more tech-tree additions, new random events, and stuff like RTS'able special skills I can unlock and use during combat!\n\nMaking the ships fun and exciting to watch as they destroy each other seems to be a lost artform. I've been dissapointed countless times with poor or flat out missing combat graphics.  If my end game death-ray has the same graphic as every single beam type weapon in the game, then I'm going to have a bad time.  It's a perfect example of why some gameplay fundamentals just shouldn't be messed with... only added to and refined... and as long as Zero Sum doesn't read to far into today's under-experienced, generic, newgen gamer mentality and pull a "Diablo III", then they will be the first among a painful amount of failed attempts to finally revive and modernize that epic 4x I fell in love with nearly 20 years ago.","April 25, 2015","true","89.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

There was always something.\nI admit, for me the canon is MOO2 and I must say Stardrive 2 is the closest game to it that I found during years. You can notice in everything around the game. The races, the research, the design, freighters... etc etc. One special mention for the ability to move the colonists around. I was showing the game to a friend and he almost cried when he saw it ;)\nBut Stardrive 2 has its own potentialities: RTS Ship Combat, complex ship design, TBS Land combat, the humour, surprises... you have to play it to feel. And of course and not less important a polished and beautiful UI and solid and very good graphics.\nIf you like 4x space genre, you must own this game. Its the best by far in years.\nWhen I think that this game its basically the work of one man, as a coder myself I only can think wow! Thanks Zero.","April 10, 2015","true","47.2"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","18","32","2","0"

There are so many interesting aspects of this game. Galactic empire building. Space combat. Diplomacy. And an xcom style ground combat.\n\nThe custom ship builder is the best in any 4 x space game I've played and the AI offers a true challenge without being given an unfair bonus.\nThis is a challenging game so expect to lose and have to adapt your strategy.\n\nThat being said, SD2 isn't a perfect game. Having only one victory condition (military  victory) means that you will be going to war early and often. Being beside an aggressive neighbor can be difficult and require you to figure out ways to avoid an early war.\n\nRandom events in the game are a lot of fun and interesting. But if your unlucky, can cripple a great starting in this game. A wormhole next to your home system that leads to an aggressive race , when your not ready, can make for a quick defeat.\n\nSmall frustrations aside , this is a great game.\nDon't let any negative reviews or outspoken forum members sway you from taking a serious look at SD2.\n\nOne plus SD2 has over any other space 4 x game is it's sly humour. There are many fun and interesting references to nearly every sci fi movie, show and book riddled in the game. It doesn't take itself to seriously and just pokes fun at every stereotype the genre has to offer.\nThis isn't a selling point for some people but it's a great addition that breaks up the raw , tense gameplay from time to time.\n\nWatch some lets plays, read some reviews and base your decision on that.\nIt's an excellent addition to any 4 x fans library.","April 12, 2015","true","160.7"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","23","42","0","2"

You will get your money out of it. Compared to other 4X titles currently out, this game's strength is space battles and its connectivity to ship design.\n\nMy thoughts on the different aspects of the game and how it compares to other titles:\nSpace Battles: Graphics are good and you don't just watch.\nShip Design:  Not overly complicated, but not simplified to much. Focuses on ship components/weapons and not the apperance of your ship. Weapons have a facing and it matters which arc you place them in.\nGround Combat: Not on par with the quality of the rest of the game. Only enjoyed playing it 2-3 times, but auto resolve is absurd (Based only on total HP), so you have to keep playing it. The upcoming DLC should have a solution to this.\nTroop Design: You get to choose what your troops are equiped with.\nColony Managment: Empire management screen is easy to use\nColony Development: Not as enjoyable/detailed as GalCiv3, but more detailed than Endless Space or Distant Worlds.\nExploration/Colonization Phase: Smaller galaxy size than most of the recent 4X. Less to explore, but smooth and quick turns. You can mod this, but I didn't find a larger galaxy more fun to play for this game (unlike GalCiv3 and Distant Worlds!).\nResearch System: Different. Forces you to choose 1 of 3 options and you don't get the other 2 techs unless you steal or trade for them.\nDiplomacy: There are no long term allies. If you work hard you can make friends for a few turns. Most relations will be neutral. Eventually, you will fight everyone.\nVictory conditions: Domination by eliminating everyone else. No diplomacy or tech victory. This is fine with me as the best part of this game is the battles.\n\nPros:\n-Ability to conrtol your ships in combat.\n-Empire management screen is easy to use\n-Designing ships is great.\nCons\n-There are bugs, but they are not as bad as other reviews make them out to be. I've only encountered game breaking bugs twice (In my experiance I've encountered more game breaking bugs in Star Wars Battle Front, CoD: Black Ops III, and Galactic Civilizations 3).\n-Ground combat as addressed above","March 4","true","389.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The only aspect of this game that I would warn people not to expect a multiplayer experience.

That being said, it is incredibly small for a 4x game. After one short play through you will have experienced all the random events and found all the strange anomalys. It's ship designers is a direct downgrade from StarDrive 1, which is a real shame considering that was one of it's best features. The AI isn't horrible, but it also does not act naturally or organically by any means. It will provide a challenge, never researching the wrong tech or mishandling it's economy. The ground combat is a direct improvement over the first game's, with chess-like turn-based battles that are satisfying but easy to win once you know what gear to use and have one of the few heroes who mop the floor with ground based units. The game doesn't take itself seriously enough, with the dialogue of your enemies simply being silly and somewhat childish, which is a unique twist when it comes to the genre but in my opinion not a good choice. Rather than introducing a universe and advanced species with a lot of lore and depth, we get plant like creatures who act cute and cuddly, space bears who act like japanese samurai, and space lycans who act like dumb evil dogs who miracuously managed to get into space. The space battles, although in theory would be fun, are unplayable without a CPU with the minimum power of 3.5 GHz quad-core (even then you will lag with the largest battles) once the AI creates fleets which numbers are in the hundreds, all firing 20 projectiles a second. Late game, this issue renders the game unplayable for a lot of those who have purchased the game, including myself. This is the game breaking issue for me, because although the base game is somewhat underwheling in comparison to other 4x games, if I were able to play into the late game without lagging to death I could add some pretty great mods to turn this into a game I put a bunch of hours into, as well as continue my support for the developer. So overall, the game isn't terrible, but I would not recommend paying more than $15 for it, and that is only if you are really itching for a new 4x game.","June 29, 2015","false","21.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The tile-based ship design is particularly interesting and I actually like the research system that many people seem to be complaining about.  Rather than being able to research everything in the game you have to choose between one tech for each level of a particular scentific discipline.  It helps differentiate individual empires during a game and gives the player some decisions that can radically alter each playthrough by picking a different technology in the early game.  Perhaps you would rather have each farmer produce an extra 2 food on farmable planets rather than being able to place an airponics(air-grown plants) facility on any planet, including those planets who can't normally be farmed which produces a flat 5 food per turn.  The improved farming technique would add up quite fast, but airponics would make colonizing more hostile planet-types easier...  without airponics they cannot produce food at all which means any potential colonists must import food via freighters.\n\nWhat can I say, I am an absolute sucker for games that force you to make substantial decisions rather than just providing the illusion of making serious decisions.  If you can unlock everything via research then every game will look almost the same, and there is a reason I never could get into games like StarCraft 2 where there seem to be single optimal strategies and deviation or slow fingers means certain doom.\n:SidMeiersAcePatrolMissionLeader:","March 13","true","57.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's possible this game was once a bit buggy based on older reviews, but I can happily report that as of yet I have encountered no bugs at all, zero!  This is the game that Endless Space should have been (but was too buggy to ever work right).  The only thing lacking at the moment is more modding in the workshop.  This game could potentially have a very long life with additional DLCs and more modding options, but even in it's current state it offers incridible depth and is extremely satisfying to play once you understand it's nuances.

Just like Stardrive 1, I saw the potential of some of the features of this 2nd game, although in the same fashion I was almost always disappointed by their implementation, feeling like the developper sometimes did not even realize how good his own ideas could have been if just a bit more passion had been put into polishing those specific features.\n\nThere is - or there was? - a potentially very good game again in SD2 (as it could have been in SD1) but once more the fact the game is crippled by a sheer amount of bugs, a clunky UI lacking ergonomy, and that overall many of the features lack "that little something" that would have made them awesome. Also, while there are difficulty levels and several options to activate or not it is pretty clear there is a balancing issue (try playing brutal x4 without deactivating the attack events and you'll most likely get crushed by a master remnant fleet around turn 100 or something (6 shielded mid size ships using disabling EMP attacks and having very decent firepower), and if you miraculously manage to beat that fleet, good luck with catching up with the AI empires after focusing on building your military till that point in game).\n\nWhile tons of references to "geek culture" in sci-fi/fantasy fields can be found in the flavor text, they sadly get old pretty quick (provided they were "fun" in the first place) and sadly don't add enough to the enjoyment for the player to forget or in some cases forgive the effort put in those instead of making the core game much more solid in every critical aspect.\n\nBut at the end, this 4X can deliver its share of fun and has a bit of replayability especially when you try to optimize custom races for some specific playstyles.\n\nI would never ever recommend it on full price though (its simply too expensive for a half-baked product to fully back it), I could say it's a ok game game that could provide you with several hours of fun and is somehow challenging, at least if you don't encounter game breaking bugs (I did encounter mostly UI display bugs and UI functionality bugs on my side). But if you are tight on budget and want a polished game that will last in your shiny library, it would be wise to avoid this one which has big chances to end up in your bin (of shame?) at some point.","May 12","false","34.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I still miss some parts which I thought were great in SD1, like Station design. But all in all it is a good and fun game, one of the most enjoyable 4X games.\nSadly the DLC brought quite a few bugs with it, some even hangup the game.... which means lost turns, revert to last save etc.\nThough Zero is hard working on fixing them, already got the second patch... or was it the third? :D\n\nPersonally I find the pricing of the DLC totally okay, I mean with GalCiv3 they charge 5€ for a Planet pack...\nSome more new modules would have been nice, but the groundbattles got a overhaul, we got a sector system with deep space stations, new related techs.\n\nDont forget he´s one guy working on this. So it takes more time working on stuff.\nIf you want to buy the DLC only if it is bugfree, wait for a few days or weeks.\n\nAll in all it is one of the top 3 4X games on my personal list.\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 10","true","77.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

True descendant of Master of Orion 2  BUT much much better!! I thought i would never see that but it's true. This one is much much better than the new "re-imagined" "master of orion" that has actually no core mechanics of original master of orion 2 and just simplified boring another 4x for younger candy crush generations that can't concentrate on things for more than 10 seconds. This is complicated game but in a very fun and logical way and not in a tedious and unlogical way like Distant Worlds (thought it's almost ok for me game). Those who hesitate which game buy, try this one on evening with lights down and you not gonna regret, the music, graphics, events are so space magic.\n\nAnother thing, i see that many people are not happy about this game but i got this game only with sector zero expansion. So i never played it without expansion. So may be vanila game without expansion sucks, i don't know BUT i do know that the game with expansion is very fun and very enjoyable! Those of you who didn't try expansion, should try it and you wil change your opinion cause game is really fun.\n\nUpdate:\nGame has mixed reviews. I found that unfair after i played it. I never played without expansion, so may be vanila game sucks, i don't know. But i do know that game with sector zero is very good, especially compared to other 4x out there. So the fact that game has mixed reviews is totaly unfair at this point. And it's a factor that don't allow new players to buy this game when they see that game has mixed reviews. I did't wanted to buy this game either.\n\nI played stardrive long time ago and i hated it. So it was abandonded by dev who wanted to focuse on next one "to make a great game from the start" I remember i was p_issed off and decided never to buy game again cause i thought it would same result. NOW after i played this wonderfull game, Stardrive 2, i understand that it was the only right desicion from developer's side, cause he couldn't focuse on this one (stardrive 2) if he had to use his time and resourses on that sh_itty game stardrive 1. So i am thankfull to developer that he abandonded old stardrive 1 to make this great game Stardrive 2, so that he gave us a lot of fun with this game (ofc i understand it has some minor bugs and so on but he works on them).\n\nSo as i said above i wasn't gonna buy stardrive 2 cause of stardrive 1 and another fact that stardrive 2 had only mixed reviews. We all know that mixed reviews make players to ignore games. The only fact that made me to buy this game was the "new" master of orion from wargaming. After i read reviews on new "re-imagined" master of orion, i found out that developers decided to dumbify/simplify it for younger candy crush style generation players. They even tok away core game mechanics that made original Master of Orion 2 so great game for many years. So in their forum i read one commentar that Stardrive is true descendant to MoO2. And i decided to give a chance to Stardrive 2 though i had doubts.\n\nAfter i have started to play stardrive 2 the only thing/person i was really pi_ssed of on was me cause i was angry that i haven't bought this game earlier)) This game is indeed true descendant to MoO2 but much much better at all aspects that i can see at least (the only thing that i am not totaly sure is ship combat, i like turnbased but must admit i like combat mechanics in this one a little bit more cause it makes it more alive for me to see and maneuver in real time, move defence ships forward, faster ships around etc - makes more fun than turnbased - i thought i would never say that;) But don't start eternal turnbase combat vs rt discussion - it's not what i am talking about here;)\n\nSo those of you who didn't play with sector zero expansion try it and you not gonna regret.\n\nSo those of us who are happy about game are too lazy to write review and that's why this great game has mixed reviews though it's a great game and fans of space 4x like MoO2 deserves to discover this game and have fun with it. So we need to give them such chance. To do that we need to write reviews on this. Good people, do not be indifferent or evil wil take over ;) Go write review on this lovely game!","March 15","true","73.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I'm very happy with the way he has set it up. I actually like the hexagon style gameplay and the game has been more streamlined. For example:\n\n1. Ship Design - it is a ton easier to design a warship and not have to worry about the secondary systems or having to line up everything perfectly. Hours could be spent in here but thanks to the streamlined process, I can design the parts I want to mess around with and let the "behind-the-scene" nerdy people figure out how to power it and etc. Excellent improvement.\n\n2. Freighter - this entire process has been automated and I'm vastly relieved as this was too much micro-managing. The AI now does it for you, provided you build enough feighter ships to transport the necessary items to the colonies.\n\n3. AI - the AI has been vastly imporved and I LOVE LOVE LOVE having to deal with pirates, space monsters, and etc. This keeps me on my toe and I can't just send all of my fleets of warships to the border but actually have to watch within the terroritory and intercept any troublesome pirates/space monsters and so fourth. Just a fantastic addition to my gameplay\n\n4. Colony Management - this has been streamlined by a huge margin. I do not have to try to micromanage each colony but I can still set a theme of what I woud like the "AI Governor" to follow in building up the colony, such as focus on Science, Food, and etc. Furthermore, I do not have to bother with managing the tile management but only mindful of the total number of buildings there are and plan accordingly. Huge burden been taken off and managed by the AI. However, you still have a lot of control over the colony management but can automate it, if needed.\n\n5. Space Battles - I do think this is an improvement over the StarDrive where we had fighting occuring on the strategy map and that was tough to juggle. Now, it's more streamlined and allows me to focus one thing at a time. I do think there's room for improvement but it's an improvement nonetheless.\n\nI do think there's some issues but the developer has been intent on hearing about it and working on fixing it. However, it is far less buggy than it was with the original game. The developer have made it clear that this is just the first release and will continue to improve it. If this is a sign of what's to come then I feel very good about the game improving even more with more content.","March 10","true","33.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It's fairly easy to start as the creator has a fully voiced tutorial and the game is a little less complex than it's predecessor (be warned if you jump around menu to menu while in a tutorial the tutorial will end and leave you helpless). If you have played the last StarDrive and really wanted this to be a good game, I have bad news and good news. Good news the game isn't broken like the last one and playing for several hours (as I normally do) caused no framedrop or resources hoging. Bad news the game is now a turn based strategy instead of one big realtime. This may not be a bad thing for all of you but it's something to consider, because it is a turn based strategy fleet battles now occur on a different screen. This once again is not really bad but the strategies you can use are limited since you always start on opposing sides and pretty much just clash in the middle every time. The ground combat is dull and managing your foot soldiers is a pain. This combat pops up often and it is rather dull with very little strategy besides shoot the things and not get shot by the things. Certain ground enemies are also really hard to kill for arbitrary reasons and will often cost you a well equiped group of soldiers. Talking about equiping soldiers it's impossible. Soldiers spawn with random gear and more likely than not the worst gear you have. There doesn't seem to be a way to say how many of each soldier you want or to even to limit their selection of items to make sure they spawn with more than a combat knife.\n\nAll this said I have had a lot of fun with the game. Ship building is what I spend most of my time on but I just wish a few more QOL things were in the ship builder like the health and shields of the ship. Managing your empire is simplified with one screen that shows you ever planet you have, what they are building, worker allocation, and so on and so forth. Tech is kept interesting with multiple routes that you can take. If you take one tech you lose the others and are sort of herded toward using diplomacy to gain the ones you missed or the spying system. Subterfuge is rather simple but does the job with multiple missions that your agents can be sent on.\n\nI give this game a thumbs up and I think anyone who enjoys the one more turn mindset of Civ 5 will have a blast wtih this game.","July 1, 2015","true","33.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This game contains a good number of quests, special galactic and world events, randomly forming wormholes (short-cuts into unexplored and enemy territories) and more that work to keep the game interesting.

I love the create your own ship aspect, and it being turn based on the star chart it gives a great mix of everything i love. I am an old school red alert fan from back in the 90s, and i love xcom enemy within so this sounded like the complete package!\n\nUnfortunately, like many other people all over the net i feel that it is wayyyy to unbalanced. Even on "easy" i rarely get a couple of hours into a campaign before im crushed. The AI seems to either know everything already in terms of research or they have unlimited funds or food in order to focus everything on science. It would have been nice to have an AI that, like some of us, are completely new to the fanchise and will experiment with different research to give a change of pace to battles. Alas, no, new game after new game, its the same get up. same concepts, different factions.\n\nIts really no fun getting 2 or 3 hours into any game, only to realise you have absolutely no chance. Its a shame as im rarely taken in to purchase any game at full price.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nAfter 31 hours, i have figured it out. its not  a case that the AI is to difficult, i think beating this game is more about the way you HAVE to play. I tried over and over for the first 10 hours trying different settings and methods of gameplay. Eventually i found one that worked, rendering the AI powerless to my fleets. The key is to hide for as long as possible. I found the easiest way of doing this is to use the "clusters" option.\n\nThe AI is SUPER fast at playing at the start of the game, but it slows down a lot in the later game. I must have spent about 2-3 hours in game before i met my first enemy, who almost immidately declared war, but was crushed as i had unlocked the titans and he had not.\n\nAfter all the frustrations for the first 10 hours the game actually began to get a lot more fun. If there were any thing in the middle of yes or no i would have chosen that, as i really dont think you should HAVE to play in this manner. You should be able to play whatever strategy you choose.\n\nI do love the game, but there are still plenty of things that need fixing. I am sure my "no" to recommendtion will likely change over the next few patches.","April 18, 2015","false","39.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

I'm a die-hard fan of StarDrive 1, even though it had its quirks and flaws.. I dumped more time than I care to admit into that game. I waited a day or two after release to see how the game fared, because I was a bit apprehensive of all the new changes. Mostly, I thought the transition to turn-based and instanced combat was neat and a cool way to go, but I felt the ship design was severely lacking in comparison to the first game.\n\nIt is certainly a little less complex than in StarDrive 1, but I couldn't bring myself to dislike it. The ship combat just works out to be so much more fun. The small simplification in ship design has actually served to enhance the whole experience, and makes designing ships take a little more nuanced approach. Ship combat now feels a lot more massive ("slow motion" is awesome and feels more like "cinematic speed", and gives you lots of time to issue commands. I can't even play it in normal speed anymore).\n\nOn top of this, due to the command point system you tend to value each individual ship far more, especially because they gain experience and can be given names. It certainly makes for a far more immersive experience, when you have a battlefleet of eight or ten heavy cruisers, and each one means something to you, which means battle losses actually make you feel kind of sad. I might have won a great victory over one of the enemy core worlds, but the valiant crews of the UFF Retribution and UFF Valiant, who were with the fleet and served with distinction since the start of the war, did not live to see it. Such is war!\n\nThere's a little bit for everyone in the game and in ship design/combat -- for the Honor Harrington nerds, ships at long/medium engagement distance loose enormous waves of missiles, which slowly get plinked away by point-defence, flares and jammers as they approach (and it's incredibly entertaining to watch).. for the Star Trek geeks, there's ships which can swing around at breakneck speeds and blast eachother with photon torpedos and phasers. For the Star Wars junkies, there's waves of fighters and big ships with batteries of laser cannons.\n\nGround combat right now is a little bare, but the designer will likely improve this as time goes on. The system itself is certainly a good foundation.\n\nAs much as I wanted/figured I would dislike this game, I can't help but really enjoy it. For a mostly one-man team, this is still likely the best 4x currently on the market -- or at least will be once some minor issues are fixed and things like ground combat are padded out a bit more.","April 11, 2015","true","30.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Though if you're looking to get your butt destroyed then play this game on normal or above with the minor factions attacking you all simultaeneously.

I feel as if this game is limited to an extent but Im sure a mod will come along sooner or later.\n\nCons:\n-1.5 Stars for not being multiplayer and there is ZERO evidence in becoming an MP game at a later date.","April 30, 2015","true","38.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Nothing to really grab you in terms of mechanics, and seems to rely on cheap shots in the form of space threats like Red Crystals or whatever they are.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kimsels/recommended/252450/","Kimsels","Kimmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kimsels/","254 products in account","When evaluating this game, one must bear in mind that it has been made by one person. With this in mind, I have found this game to be very, very impressive. It feels like any 4X made by larger studios, and in some ways surpasses them. It only launched recently so there are still some bugfixing and balancing to do, but it's perfectly playable and the hours will fly by while you play this game\n\nYou will like this game if you prefer 4X games with more of a focus on combat and ship-design. It's ship designing feature will have you endlessly tinkering with your designs, and the combat is very satisfying with explosion sounds and gfx providing you a suitable reward for your aforementioned tinkering. If you mainly want a diplomacy/empire-building 4X, this game still is perfectly fine but you might get more satisfaction from other games.\n\nFinally, beware that the game can be a bit challenging. Balancing of things is still on-going and I'm sure countless mods will spawn to help out with that, but the game will have you sweat a good bit and the AI can be quite aggressive if it notices vulnerability. The space combat AI seems, in comparison what other games of the genre have done so far, actually fairly good. The Diplomacy AI needs a bit of fine-tuning still, but it's already decent in it's 1.0 state.\n\nI recommend this game.","April 13, 2015","true","49.1"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

I'm still mostly on the fence on this second game.  If your new to Stardrive and enjoy turn base games like Civ V then you should like this one. On the other hand if you played the first stardrive and enjoyed the free flowing real time feel of being able to build fleets and move them around easily to patrol your empire, set up governors to manage the bulk of a large empire then your in for very very slow and fusterating game. (the first stardrive had its memory bug issues as soon as 700 ships were deployed in game you were on borrowed time any moment the game was going to freeze and crash)   I do like the side quests but the staging needs work especially when you can't zoom out and control your units and they are hidden behind a pop up and you wind up basically stuck since the enemy units refuse to advance. Oneside mission I completely gave up on after I couldn't manuver my units because I couldn't select them because the info boxes were in the way. That seriously needs to be addressed. AI is extremely onesided reminds me very much of the early days of CIV where all empires are super aggressive and would declare war at a drop of a hat especially if you colonize a world after they are introduced to you. Bug they need to fix is the AI spams a huge fleet more than I'd feel is possible with a hand full of worlds.  Or they are so far up the tech tree its ridiclious cheap, one thing I don't like is the AI having the abvility to use my own ship designs. Personally that breaks the game for me why spend an hour building a kickass titian ship that can wipe the floor with every emipre out there and ten minutes late the AI has it and spams 10 of them in five turns while you might be luckly to get 2. For now I'm going to give this one a rest least till most of the bugs are fixed.","April 18, 2015","false","46.9"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

I didn't like stardrive 1, but because i really wanted this franchise to be good so i gave it a rather naive second chance and that was quite a mistake.  There is a fine line between homage and ripping off other games and this game is a blatant rip off of Master of Orion II, but it lacks the soul MoOII had.  Besides the ship building there is nothing unique about this game, and to top it off the ship building is massively unbalanced, some factions have ship layouts that are way smaller than the other races, others have such weird shapes that you can't possible do anything useful with them.  And then tiny little things like not putting things in alphabetical order in sorts, or not being able to filter menus really make this game just plain mediocre.

There are abilities, 2 of them, both useless cause you have to activate them for each ship separately. No formation moves. No random stuff like asteroids or junk. Selection often bugs out and selects the wrong ship. There is a slow-mode, but no fast-mode, so in the lategame i just alt-tabed from battle and went for a tea/surf net/whatever.

Every his planet has a negative income, every his fleet is over his limit (2-5 fleets of that size would eat really A LOT), but he somehow manages to get even more of that stuff.\nEmpire screen: if you copy something from another game that was good, why not to copy ALL the features? That screen lacks half of the functions you would want and expect.\nVisuals: the only thing that is good and not bugged in that game, but really, how can you make a buggy graphics?\nDiplomacy: well, already mentioned it in battles and AI section, it is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nRaces: MOO set of traits, that was, imho, done worse. Why do metal-made creatures eat food and not production? No idea.\nPlanets: a beautiful screen from GalCiv without GalCiv functions.

It is exceptionally similar to MOO2. I know it is common to say that when discussing any space 4X game but it is really true in this instance. The pace of the game, the way research is conducted, the complexity and scope of the game is almost exactly like Masters of Orion 2. There were a couple of good ideas from Stardrive 1 that carried over including the factions and the ship builder. I love the graphical style too.\n\nIf that impression held throughout I would give StarDrive 2 a firm "good" rating. I've never played any 4x that evoked so much from MOO2 which is generally a good thing. The feel of the game is very similar to that classic game, down to the research options. The art style is wonderful, the ship builder is exceptional and the AI is more than competent (in fact, it's brutal). There's a lot to like in the game.\n\nBut it falls down in a few areas and could use quite a bit of work.\n\nThe middle to end game is not very good. Every game will devolve into the same pattern - at some point you'll expand too much, your neighbors will get upset and it's just all-out war at that stage. There are no really cool random events to upset the balance of power and no distractions to occupy the player's attention elsewhere. It's a drudgery of cycling through building on planets, pushing units around, auto-resolving battles and repeat. This is a common problem in 4x games but it's magnified here because there is only one victory condition - extermination. Thus the entire endgame falls apart and the whole game breaks down.\n\nWhich brings me to the next problem...\n\n...the Victory Conditions. The player has no choice and it becomes very tedious. Instead of building a consensus or achieving enlightenment or fighting some external foe, I'm forced into a policy of being a ruthless warmonger. That's not a lot of fun IMO.\n\nThe random events are exceptionally limited. Usually it's me getting .5 fewer food per farmer. Big deal. Where are meteor showers or a comet to explore? Where's a powerful earthquake that changes the orbit of a planet, a new resource to be discovered, a really cool derelict ship to add to my fleet, an uprising by an alien species or things like that? The "?" in space tiles seem to be exceptionally limited and not very interesting.\n\nThe diplomacy system needs work. That's putting it nicely. Diplomacy is a train wreck. I like the fact that we can't spam requests to rob the AI blind, but often I'm so hamstrung I have an option of either a non-aggression pact or a trade agreement because there aren't enough points to get both. Considering I have to do this every 30 or so turns, this part of the game feels woefully underdeveloped. There aren't any options for long-term peace, coalitions or friendships which then leads to the train-wreck ending of extermination because nothing else is possible.\n\nI also think the spy system needs work too. I don't feel like the AI is playing the game game when it comes to esponiage. It seems that they have far greater opportunities to take techs from me whereas I have to wait far longer. My spies seem to get caught almost immediately. So this part of the "game" it just shunted aside - I build a half dozen spies, put them on defensive and ignore this aspect. Why? Because building enough spies to accumulate 500 points and THEN using land troops to steal a tech is a heck of a lot of work. Nice idea, but the reward just isn't worth it.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest making the actual building portion of the game a bit more interesting. One good thing from Gal Civ 2 were the special tiles that were on planets - some gave more food, others more production, others more science, etc. It made building more strategic in nature and helped foster better planet specialization. I'd love to see something similar in SD2.\n\nSD2 has a good foundation. It's just that Zero never expanded upon it - and when he finally did, it was to charge for DLC to fix fundamental, core problems with the base game. SD2 is one of the biggest disappointments in my library because it is so close to being so good but never fulfilled that promise. Thus the base game can not earn a recommendation. Your money is better spent elsewhere.","March 23","false","24.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I've played MoO2 quite a lot and I've played tons of other 4X games and none were this close in design and yet still feel modern and well thought out.\n\nthe game's not perfect but it's definitely one of the best 4X games out there. with a bit more extra development, some DLC adding some more depth and some cool mods by the community and it probably will be the best out there.\n\nbest parts:\n-ship design (lots of choice and flexibility without some of the hassle from SD1)\n-combat (AI is pretty clever, including that of your own ships)\n-research (MoO2 style, wish it was copied more)\n-no unneeded micro-management (like freighters. thank god)\n-easy to understand, hard to master economic system overal\n-solid diplomacy system. (takes some getting used to but when you get it it works fine)\n-bit of genre savvy humor on the sides, lest we take the game too seriously.

I don't really feel the empire management screen is a proper replacement of an easy to use galaxy map, though it does what it should well.\n-no multiplayer! no real dealbreaker as truthfully I hardly ever play online with or against other people, but considering this game's outstanding ship design feature it really would suit it particularly well.\n-the game secretely hates your guts and will let you know about it any chance it gets. 20 turns in and get your first ♥♥♥♥♥♥ corvette out the door? congrats, let's celebrate with a remant fleet at your doorstep you wouldn't have a chance of defeating 200 turns in. do not overestimate your 4X skills and just start your first game on easy like a noob should!","April 12, 2015","true","36.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I'll try to cover both good and bad elements of the game and readers can make their own decision.\n\nEdit: Decided to cut down the review to something a little more succinct.\n\nBugs and some dodgy design aside, let's cut to the chase. If you want a Master of Orion 2 clone, with a fair amount of bugs (although Zero has been working on resolving them), then great! Buy it, you'll probably like the game a lot.\n\nIf you're looking for Stardrive, which was a flawed, but an extremely fun and novel mixture of RTS and 4X with some Master of Orion character with some especially amazing ship design mechanics and that gave you the feeling of running a living and breathing real time empire, with some additions and improvements, then don't buy it, because like me, you'll hate it. This isn't really Stardrive 2, it's a MoO2/Stardrive inspired typical 4X.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love 4X games, but why buy one that is basically a reskin of a 20 year old game with mechanics that have long been improved on and, quite frankly, surpassed in every way? Be nostalgic all you like, but after a few rounds on any of Amplitude's 4X's, this is going to feel bland as grey buttons.\n\nI feel for Zero, I really do. SD1 got pilloried for never really becoming a final product. A lot of it was unjustified - typical Reddit gamer entitlement that makes you ask - 'When you got 150 hours out of a game, how can you justify being so upset?' really buried it. SD1 was ambitious, new, and with a little TLC and maybe a larger design team, could have got closer to it's full potential. SD2 felt like that was that opportunity, but instead ditched everything that was innovative and played it safe.","April 13, 2015","false","3.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Right?\n\nI'm gonna' start with the positives;\n- The game has a nice UI when you're playing on the strategy map, it's relatively easy to use and tells you every thing     you need to know at this perspective.\n- The games empire management screen is useful, it allows you to manage a large empire quite effectively from one screen.\nI find that I quickly run out of positives, the reason I've played it for as long as I have is because there are star wars and star trek model mods for it, most people don't know because the games steam workshop is broken.\n\nThe negatives, unfortunately this may take a while;\n- The game severely lacks originality, it doesn't innovate the genre at all and uses most of its aspects from the master of Orion game series. All of the races apart from the Chukk affiliation are ripoffs from MoO, and all of those races assets are reused from the old game, infact most of the assets of the game are reused from the first game, the buildings and the ship designs, the game has even less ship designs then the original which doesn't help.\n- The game has six options if that, including the ability to disable the gnn broadcasts, which can get annoying, you can turn v sync on/off and fullscreen on/off, change the quality with 4 different options from fastest to best, you can change your anti-aliasing settings and change the resolutions. It's extremely lacking in option customability.\n- The planetary production is boring, you can change the workers from science to production to food, again like MoO.\n- The ship design has changed to become much less customizable, the firing acrs aren't customizable and it's less balanced.\n-  There is only one win condition total dominance of the galaxy or you can just quit when you kill the masters.\n- The AI doesn't favour diplomacy and they will all declare war because they can't do anything else, they don't really value allies or friends, performing diplomatic acts just pospones the envitable. They can't design new ships just the default ones which are terrible so if you have a decent few ships you can completely destroy their fleer, which brings me to the envitablility of ground combat. Unless you have nukes on your ships to exterminate the enemy soldiers and sweep in with some soldiers to capture the planet, you will have the unfortunate displeasure of meeting the ground combat. Its performance is terrible, it's ridiculasly unbalanced, dull and auto resolve is unreliable so you are force to do this monotonous task if you want to win.\n\nIt's an unoriginal easy sequel that is buggy with a bad developer. Don't buy the game, if you want a game that's like this but more polished and by a reliable company, I'd either buy stellaris, GalCiv or the new master of orion.","February 25","false","110.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This game is just plain boring.  Everything that made the last game cool and unique has been stripped away.  I loved the real time battles and micro turns of the first one, they made the game challenging and fun, but now it's a space bar holding simulator.  Not enough happens in one turn to justify making this game turn based.  This how it works, you pick a research and then you hold down the space bar for 2 mins, and then the research bar is done and you pick a new one.\n\nThe research UI is horrific.  I still haven’t figured out the tree.  In fact there doesn’t' seem to be one.  Or maybe the UI is just so terrible I can't tell.\n\nMaking the battles a separate screen takes you out of the action a great deal, it's not fun at all.  Even designing ships isn't even fun anymore, because you start with like half the modules unlocked.

Moreover it is so blatant about it that it feels like it is flirting with the breaking the fourth wall not something I am a huge fan of.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential in the ship design and strategic aspect of space and ground combat and the level of depth that it allows you to manipulate your empire.\n\nI will say that it was better than MOO III in general fun and striking a balance between allowing depth and getting carried away with it.\n\nMy big gripes about the game are as follows.\n\nTechnological advance doesn't yield significant upgrades until you get very very far along in the trees. I almost always had better luck researching a few basic (tier one or two technologies), the pumping everything into producion ships and troops and conquering the galaxy without ever doing more than cursory reasearch.\n\nThe AI literally cheats on basic settings, I have tested rich homeworlds on small maps with optimized industrial output and the AI will invariably massively outcolonize me and outproduce me (in terms of fleet and fleet size) very quickly in the early game. You can still win by being clever or cheesy in your builds, but the fact that it literally plays by a different set of rules on default settings really really bothers me.\n\nThe technologies are poorly balanced to create a stable empire. The game forces you specialize each of your planets because of prohibitive maintanence costs (making one planet that has all upgrades and buildings your empire is capable of will put a big dent in your wallet). Basically I find myself skipping almost all of my unlocked buildings on most colonies just because of what it costs to maintain them. The way various technolgies interact and overlap with each other just makes a lot of them feel useless or redundant or only of use on a very small proportion of your colonies.\n\nI do think the game has a whole lot of potential and with some patches or balance changes could be more fun. Essentially my complaint it that it forces you to play in one of a few very specific ways if you want to avoid getting wiping out quickly on default difficulty. It felt more like how well can I implement this strategy which I know will be the only viable one for this map/race selection rather than what type of empire would I like to build this time. It feels like the game has mechanics for amazing strategies and fun but makes it impossible for you to implement them before you have already taken control of the map.\n\nBottom Line I just didn't have fun playing it.","April 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

They are similar, especially the tech tree, which is brilliant and, as I hoped, never ending throughout the game, however long. But SD2 has much more to offer, peppered with more than 100 potential random events. And it’s much improved over SD1.\n\nI see negative reviews that have only played for 3-8 hours. I’m on my first Normal setting game (probably should have gone Easy setting first) and I’ve played for 2 days against 5 AI, 161 turns, without the end in sight on a 70 star game (out of 100 at the moment). Granted, I’m carefully reading every well-written description of tech upgrades to plan strategy and learn the game. Nearly every item has a mouse-over tooltip to help. Love that. Developer has already stated on forums that he’ll make the Easy setting a bit easier for those who found it too hard and he says the AI doesn’t cheat or spawn ships as needed, it just plays more efficiently.\n\nTutorial is nicely done, getting you off to a good start. The artwork is beautiful, from splash screens to the solar systems, ships, icons and elegant UI. One reviewer thought the UI was clunky but perhaps he didn’t know that you can back out of windows with a mouse right-click, so boink, boink, you’re back to the strategic or planet view in a second. You can zoom in to the battle scenes and see the hits and scorch marks on ships. Sound effects are very cool for each variety of weapon. One reviewer claimed he could only zoom completely in or out on the strategy map. Must be a scroll wheel problem. I had no problem smoothly zooming to any size view on the strategy map or battle view. One click on a planet and the planet view opens to plan your next building or ship. Right or left arrow can take you to each of your planets from that window. You can also build from the Empire Management screen or pick out your next planet to colonize from a list of explored planets with several filters. Planets may have a special resource or condition that can be beneficial or harmful in some way. If beneficial, it may affect your entire empire. If harmful, there is an opportunity to reverse that affect through special research. I’m just getting into the spy system and it strikes me as very cool.\n\nYou can start a tiny colony on rich asteroids that fuel production with no pollution or build a refueling station on a gas giant, so eventually every planet in game has a use. Better explore early game to find those few Terran planets. Swamp, ocean and tundra planets can help produce food until you develop Aeroponic Farms, Subterranean Farms, etc. Build some freighters that will automatically deliver extra food to colonies that need it. Freighters are also used to move colonists between planets and for ground troop transport. You can also research an Experimental (read mystery) tech and get something unexpected. Last one I got was Unsavory Cantina, boosting morale, that wasn’t on any tech tree. Later in the game, you can research a Colony Ship that deploys a free Rover Bay (+production) and Aeroponic Farm (+food) to speed colonizing late game. Brilliant. The Terraformer, deep in the Bio-Chemistry tech tree improves the class of a planet every 25 turns until reaching Gaia. Looking forward to that! Stop at an unprotected enemy planet and pick up a few slaves for your Slave Pits, if you have that tech and mind set.\n\nSD2 has a lot to offer the space strategy gamer and I highly recommend it. I’ll be playing it for years as the developer refines the game and adds DLC. Just loaded my saved game for today (2nd day after release) and it’s already version 1.0c. I’m guessing the Easy setting has been changed already.","April 11, 2015","true","557.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","0"

The ships design is really well done I am enjoying it. The diplomacy is really well done but could use a few moe treateis such as alliances wouldn't be bad. The tutorial is exalent if it is your frist time playing use it. ,but the game does have some flaws the random map events have been the same every playthrough ive done and I am able to hold off fleets with 4 medium size ships that are twice my size which makes it kinda stale and I miss the formation making from sd1 sometimes if you dont take down all of the small ships fighters included they will run out of the radar and your ships will try and prusue but they will never catch up and the battle will never end  this games needs some form of multiplayer when you refit your ships their names won't change and you have to mnnually do it this is really annoying another thing is the Ai is OP now when I mean OP I mean OP for example the dumbest race in the game is the wolves when you play them on their default but when the Ai gets a hold of them its the exact oppisite they are somehow able to research and expand 2 too 3xs faster then you thast on normal and goes for all races the Ai plays and finaly the comabt fleet combat best combat I have ever seen but the ground combat is meh compared to the fleet combat yes I know what I said before but that is in the early game now on to the ground comabt you can fell its trying to be xcom but just not even close to it you can delpoy sheilds for teporary cover but when you get done to it their really is no cover system to it and its pretty much how much ap? is the target in range select weapon click repeat the fleet combat on the other hand is a blast the best ships or ships depending on how you put it in my oppinion are the fighters once you get enough of these little suckers on one of your carrier ships which is about 20 (each bay holds 4) and give them ion beams minimum they can be equal too or better then your best equiped ships then reasons being there is a ton f thme focusing on one target all shooting at them same time its like watching a bunch of angry hornets attacking a bear except it is space bear samuri its as awsome as it sounds and the "bear" in this case is an enemy ship that can retreat which will take 24 seconds or die either way its so much fun to watch once for example I have my main fleet with 3 carriers 24 fighters each and 2 battle ships 4 fighter each this adds up to 83 fighters total I have my fighters equiped with shields yes you can shields for your fighters and you dont even need to go into the shipyard to upgrade them the games does it for you automaticlly which is nice and disrupters which are better then the ion beams but back to the story now I was attcking a planet with said loadout of fleet with a few more ships in it those aren't important lol and sent all of my fighters to attack a battle station and I kid you not the station was gone in litterly seconds with its shields up seconds! truly awsome!

It is a solid experience and has nice variety for those who look for it. That said though it is a little lacking in some areas. A few complaints are in areas like diplomacy. The lack of a Federation system as was present in the first game is noticable to me and combined with the demanding AIs always pressing your tolerance limits is an annoyance. The ground combat is weak in my opinion though permissable as it isn't the focus of the game but allows some break up in space battles. Most interestingly is that this game feels designed with multiplayer in mind. The tolerance limits would play well into players not over coorperating, the leader system means that no empire can have all the cards and players would have to consider sharing techs to get what they want. This would also help explain the lack of Federation since it merges two empires into one. This leads into my final point where, other than seemingly bottomless ability to throw ships and troops at you AI is a little lightweight. They don't use great unit cohesion in ground combat and I found them to use numbers rather than design to win space fights. A player would pose a much more interesting threat and I might actually have to bust out the Hazmat suits. Again a good game but it has a way to go to become great.\n\nAddendum: Thought of it as I was writing the above. I know that they simplified space to ease the burden on computers and such but I miss: being able to build battlestations in deep space, being able to jump ships in and out of danger, or the possibility of ships getting stranded in space after their engines are shot out, FTL and combat thrusters, ability to redesign transport ships (could be converted to combat use), designing stations, exporting production and assigning governers to build and manage things on planets. Regardless though I think this game is an improvement on small scale galaxies but needs some upgrades to help managment on large maps.

This is customer service as we want it.\n\nGame shows up like a very detailed 4X title with a mix of usual turn-base play and real-time battles. Additional you get some X-com like ground fights. You have full authority over your ship builds and could even more decide detailed parts, which you could micro-switch probably larger distance for less hitpoints or else to your conveniance. Even your ground troops could be equipped from a pool of very different weapons, armors, health bars or whatever you may research.\n\nThe game is mixed with a lot of surprising events...like stumbling over a wrecked ship with your scout...but you need some ground troops for further investigation. Once you start the mission you'll find yourself surrounded by a load of 'bugs' which pretty much like your taste. ^^\n\nPlayed now for 4 hours on release day and can't wait to go on the other day...\n\n***\n\nOk, found a minute to give another response after nearly 100 hours of play.\n\nThis game is great, it gives you total into depth ship design, research planings or just colonization road to think about. Anyhow it is released and we currently are on version 1.01 there are still some rough edges. But Zero with his one-man-dev-show is working hard behind the scenes to bring new features every patch and recognizing every single bug response to make this game fun for every customer.\n\nOnly thing I do miss is multiplayer, but currently I'm more into playing a StarTrek inspirated conversation mod with plenty of new ships and other stuff to get into the story.\n\nAnyhow it is same genre, I do not like to compare SD2 with GC3 as both games do aim completely different and have only turnbased and sci-fi in common. But besides that, SD2 is much more dynamic and brings more fun to me at the moment.\n\nCheers!","April 9, 2015","true","144.0"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","18","34","0","3"

This game looked, at first glance, to be an attempt to create the game SD 1 was supposed to be. A lot of the changes are good (turn based but still quick gameplay), tech tree in which every choice feels like it makes a difference (but also extremely remniscient of MoO2) and hints of a story you might learn if you spend enough time with the game.\n\nShip building is basically similar to the first game, but streamlined, which I highly approve of.\n\nThe bad (and/or not yet done features) are too many to give this game a pass. If anything, this most certainly belongs in early access. If the designer disagrees, he ought to stop making games.\n\nA few specifics:\n-The tech tree is basically a mash-up of SD 1 and MoO2. But with sparsely any game effects visible (except for buildings, which are all well detailed, which makes the difference all the more obvious). The description certainly doesn't convey how utterly useless researching Plasma cannons was (in every way a worse choice than the weapons you start with, since they just almost never seem to hit) nor that researching and equipping rail guns to my troops would be a worse choice than sticking to the laser rifles you start with.\n\n-Ground combat. Wow. Are you serious? You release a game with this "feature"?\nGraphics are acceptable, if barely, but there's neither good advancement nor is there ever a point to this. The enemy advances in a direct line at you and will select it's targets and use it's abilities in the same exact manner every time.\nThere is no way to define a standard equipment for your troops, you have to adjust every planet on it's own (not like there's really a point, your starting equipment is what you'll switch back to, once you realize how superior it is to later research, unless you go really far in the tech tree).\n\n-Diplomacy: The basic system is alright, but it sadly needs work.\n\n-The space combat is nice, but very one-sided, with some weapons being utterly superior to others. But there is great potential here. But there really needs to be a way to speed up combat. There's nothing more annoying than waiting forever for a fight that's been decided minutes ago to end and it taking forever because there's one last annoying small ship or fighter still alive and dodging like an ace.\n\n-The game's seriousness or lack thereof. It's not that there's humor in here. It's that the game seems like it's trying too hard, while also insecure about how funny or serious it should be. I wouldn't mind either way. Even a slight shift in either direction might be enough, but as is, it's in a weird place. Whenever I start taking the events in the game seriously, something reminds me I ought not to.\n\nI could go on, but while I don't want people to waste their money on this, I also don't want to make the wrong impression: There is real potential here. I had fun with this game, but I can't see myself playing it in this state.\nCurrently, it feels less finished than most early access games I have.\n\nThe bad, sadly, vastly outweigh the good. At this moment, I strongly suggest watching this game from a safe distance and waiting for it to either evolve into what it might be or to stagnate as the first one did.","April 10, 2015","false","33.5"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","19","36","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/libertygeek/recommended/252450/","libertygeek","Libertygeek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/libertygeek/","850 products in account","I have changed my mind on Stardrive 2.  I am sticking to the prior posting that I don't really care about the Stardrive 1 complaints.  That said I am getting rather upset with the game balance.  After a number of hours I keep hitting a brick wall against the game's AI.  I am not a master of RTS or TBS games but I can usually hold my own against AI.  That said even on easy I am getting my butt stomped regardles of what I do.  I have read up what I can but it seems like I am not the only person running into what almost appears to be a cheating AI.  At first I thought I was expanding too quick eating up resources because of that and the AI was able to build a huge fleet to come at me, regardless of me owning 90% of the map.  So then I started playing it slow, building up a pretty good fleet or two with just a couple star systems under my control.  Nope still get stomped.   I have went back and trying countless different tactics and regardless of what I do I can't get anywhere near the fleets that the AI is putting out.    The game isn't bad but the AI is either cheating or there is something else going on.  Like I said I don't claim to be a strategy expert but even at easy I am getting stopped.  I don't mind hard games, but I don't like games that AI has balance problems.   Zero put out a patch that was supposed to make things better on that front, but if anything they have gotten worse.    Stay away for the moment if you want a game that has an AI that plays fair and isn't going to trash you over and over again even on the easy setting.  I can't imagine what the harder settings must be like.   I know I am going to get some L2P comments.   Maybe I am missing something major but after hours of play I continue to get slaughtered by the AI regardless of what my tactics are.\n\n\nReview at the 90 minute mark - outdated\nI had the first Stardrive. I didn't have a big bone against it like some people.  I didn't play for Multiplayer anyway so it not getting included in didn't bother me.  I can see how some people were upset though.  I am not going to say that Zero didn't hurt himself when he dropped support of the first and started working on the sequel, however I understand why he did.  Personally with the 90 or so minutes I have spent in the game I can say that the sequel is worth the money.  I would have liked to see a bit of a better discount for prior users but still for $20 it wasn't that bad and if you don't already own the first I feel like the game is stable and more than fun enough to say that it is worth $30.  Do I understand why some Stardrive players feel slighted, yes.  Do I think it is unforgiveable?  No I don't.  As long as Zero continues to support 2 and doesn't run off starting 3 before everyone feels any major bugs have been addressed I personally think everything is fine.  I have a ton of space 4x games and 4x games in general, and I can say that SD2 does a lot of unique things, and well enough that it sets itself out from the crowd.","April 9, 2015","false","34.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Combat is real time, cinematic like BOTF but with more strategy.\n\nMain thing holding it back from truly replacing MOO2 as the king of 4x space is the remaining bugs. This is also the source of a great many of the negative reviews here--many people feel that a DLC expansion should not have gone through until bugs were fixed.\n\nBut hey, the creator seems really active fixing the bugs that are being found.

There is the potential here for years of worthwhile content, Crusader Kings 2 style, as long as the bugs are squashed thoroughly first.\n\nI personally decided to buy it now with a sense of optimism and hope (which I think the developer is currently proving he is worthy of).

I was shocked to see it had mixed reviews and realized I didn't post one.\n\nI keep coming back to it over and over again because it's easy to fire up and play and there are so many races and types of ships to build it makes each game a new experience. Originally I thought of it as a modernized clone of MOO2 (till I learned it a little better) but... I hate to say it.. I mean I really do because I'm a big long time fan of MOO2 but I'm starting to think this game is actually superior to Master of Orion 2. It's just got more of everything that is great about MOO2 in a slicker and friendlier UI. I can't believe it was made by one guy. I guess sometimes one persons vision is better than an entire team of developers with conflicting ideas. I was looking to get the the new Moo early access remake and... ya know I think I'll just keep playing Stardrive 2. Expensive voice actors don't really make a great game, it's gameplay that make them great. Great gameplay is what makes us play various games for over 10 years like MOO2. It's not the fluff of cut scenes or voice acting. It seems Zero understands that.\n\nI think this game gets some negative reviews or is called "incomplete" by some people is that they expect the game to have some kind of splashy story and a easy "story mode" setting.. and that is not really what this is. This game is about terrific 4x gameplay in the vein of old style gaming (like moo itself). You will not win every game and that is a good thing because it puts the pressure on an makes you take risks. As far as bugs go, I haven't really noticed any serious ones but I play it on Linux so maybe it's more stable. In all the games I've played maybe it's crashed a couple of times.. big deal. (I've seen major titles that are waaay worse,)\n\n\nPros:\n* Great ship design.\n* Tactical ship combat is really good.\n* The UI is friendly and well thought out.\n* Planet management is fairly easy. (compared to Moo2)\n* It has a lot of cool races each with their own unique ships that is more than how they look they actually affect what weapons you can research and equip so various things work better on various races.\n* Customizable galaxy with random things to discover in it.\n* Sidequests that open various new technology and can impact your builds.\n* It's very challenging. (I play on hard or brutal mode usually)\n* Plays great on Linux.\n* High replay value.\n\nSome things it could improve on:\n* No DLC! - Seriously zero take my money.\n* Occasionally (on my hardware) the game slows down on 100-200 ships shooting it out. (w/ thousands of missiles or fighters especially)\n* Ground combats pretty basic. (tho better than MOO2)\n* Spying could be abit improved.\n* No Stat system or charts to see how your doing. Sometimes you feel a little blind.\n* No peaceful solution. You have to kill everyone. (tho diplomatic win is kinda meh..)\n* No real ending. You just win. (I wasn't expecting much but nice victory screen or stats would be nice)\n* Some of the larger ships are not symmetrical and have more space on one side or the other. It's an oddity..\n\n\nHaters be dammed.. this game rocks. If you like 4X, it's a must buy.","March 3","true","304.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Really like the design and concept, but the UI is clunky, there's no key mapping, and cant save Ship Designs, which is a BIG part of this game.  Shipyard itself is generally buggy, the UI keeps shifting and sections keep overlapping other sections, plus it's really slow to respond.  Will continue playing to see if issues resolve for now, but disappointed in interactive execution.\n\nEdit - reload did solve the Shipyard problem (for now).  However, when running into alien races framerate drops dramatically.  The animation seems to really slow down the game.  Ground battles can experience the same issues - when selecting units the game freezes for a few seconds.\n\nOh yeah, and what's with the 0 Food production on just about EVERY planet.  Out of over a dozen habitable planets, I've found a whole whopping TWO that allow any kind of food production (and both of those were minimal at only .5/farmer).  This wouldn't be so bad if your colony ships allowed more than 1 population on them, but NO customization for Frieghters and Colony ships means they aren't capable of increased capacity or armament.  Hell, you can't even control Freighters, so if you have a distant planet you want to settle, you can't accompany your Colony ship with a Foof Freighter so your people dont starve before you get some food there in the only way possible allowed by the poorly designed game mechanics.\n\nBased on this HIGH dependancy on food transport between colonies, there are some obvious racial benefit choices when starting a new game.","April 10, 2015","false","6.9"," 57 of 112 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","57","112","5","0"

Ship customisation was a really cool thing, being able to build your ship from scratch from a general hull type is really cool.\n\nBasically the only cool thing that was transferred to SD2 was the ship building mechanic, and it received next to no improvements anyway. It went from real-time to turn based, and in doing so basically became a MoO clone. It tried to differentiate with an XCOM/HoM&M style ground combat mini-game where you could control your units. However it was such a half-baked and often buggy experience that it detracted far more than it could ever give.\n\nSD3 if there is going to be one, needs to return to its real-time roots, which was its biggest USP, as far as I'm concerned. The series has a chance to really make a mark in the space 4X genre, and it's unfortunate the second entry in the series has been so let down with lazy copy-cat design.","March 4","false","23.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The 4X element are present and have a fresh code of paint (or an old one if you compare it to MoO). All gameplay aspects sound cool. Like managing your population, trade Fleet, Military Fleet, Ship design, research and colonization.\nThe sad thing is all of this works fine but when you play longer and deeper you hit points where it feels like somebody run out of asphalt when building a road.\nAll the features i mentioned (and more) have some point where you think, this is not polished at all and many aspects of this should be done like this and that if you were a capable and compassionate developer.\nThe next thing is that spark to your mind, hold on did i just buy a product that is still in development or just abandon on the last 100 meters?\nFor example the Statistics at the screen when you win a game just have a big "coming Soon" sign there.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658934441\n\nWhen you go an voice your concern in the community hub\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11260360/1.png\n\nYou have many people you agree with you and some disagree with you but agree with you after you explained your points.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11260360/2.png\n\nBut the Developer ignores it and after one insulting post of someone else\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11260360/1.jpg\n\n\nThis happens.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11260360/Therediditgo.JPG\n\nI dont know anymore, after the debacle of Star Drive one being abandoned and now this thing happens. Personally i would not buy and Recommend ZeroSum games anymore.\nAll my concern and critique i voice wouldn't be necessary when Zero had not made such decision like releasing Star drive 2 in such a state. The game would be a perfect candidate for Early Access, playable but still needed polish. I can only come up with scenarios that end in a bad light for Zero why he had done what he done.\n\nI can not recommend this game at this price 27.99€+9.99€ (You NEED the DLC to even make the game to a state that i based my review on. The base game was not as good as with the DLC)\nBuy it for 10 or less in a sale. It may be unpolished and the Developer maybe a very shady guy, but it is still a good game.\n\nSee Also:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11260360/KEK.JPG","April 3","false","26.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Firstly, the music and graphics are outstanding.  Secondly, the ship editor is both in-depth and intuitive...though I'm still trying to figure out optimal designs as the default ones don't seem to last very long in combat.  The races themselves have unique personalities and I appreciate their quirks and dialogue.  The tech tree is different in the sense that you have to pick between 2-3 techs every tier, meaning you'll pass on the others and may never get them.  This made me really think about what kind of empire I wanted.  Combat was also very fun and satisfying...I liked watching my creations attempt to work with what I gave them (shields and beam weapons, mostly).\n\nAs far as what I don't like: the game doesn't tell you when a planet is not producing anything (it does tell you when new research is available) and the AI is still too difficult, even on "Easy".  I am not ashamed to say that I could be playing better and designing my ships more efficiently, but I'd also like to see "Easy" made even easier...that is, I'd like to build up my empire in relative peace and then attack when I'm ready. It would be great if there was a way to turn off the AI's ability to attack altogether and instead have it play a defensive game. Either that, or limit their CP in some way.  Of course, there are those that think "Brutal" is too easy and don't want the developer to change anything. That's why there are multiple difficulty levels...I'm sure it's possible to change one difficulty setting without touching the others, making the "don't nerf the AI for the casuals" complaints irrelevant. Some of us don't want a challenge, just a way to unwind after working 10 hour shifts. I'm just the type that prefers a "light" challenge...*shrug*, everyone's mileage will differ.  If some feel that "Easy" is just right, then perhaps an "Easier" difficulty setting could be added.\n\nLong story short, casual 4X players may get frustrated (like I have) at times when the AI decides to come at you with a vengence despite your attempts to be passive.  Difficulty aside I'm really enjoying this one and I can easily recommend it to 4X fans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxB-vpqlQUk","April 14, 2015","true","9.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I never had an issue like that with other games where if I decline them a research project, they would flat out attack me over it.  It is more along the lines of if I am pushing on their boundaries or if I go into their territory with an army then I get declare war.  If you decline them money, trade routes, or research, they attack you.","April 14, 2015","false","22.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

The game is buggy and has serious balance issues\n2. A DLC pack has been released, which should have been a update.\n3. Very little bugfixing going on\n4. Developer has dropped out on previous game, leaving it in unfinished state, and seems to want extra money to provide expansions when the game is still as unbalanced as day one.\n\n\n\n\nI liked the idea of this game, I thought it would be a successor to the Masters of Orion games, and in some ways it is. Its not a bad game, but it feels unbalanced and unfinished. I bought the Original StarDrive too.\n\nThe Developer abandoned that project stating it was in a playable state, which to some sense it was, but it was not what was promised, unfinished tech trees, an intresting storyline with the mysterious remnant race, which just ended half way with no explanasion, despite it being clear there was more to the story.\n\n\n","March 8","false","73.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veneke/recommended/252450/","veneke","Veneke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veneke/","203 products in account","As of 1.0g I can safely say that this needed a longer period of beta testing.\n\nThe balance is off, by quite a bit, in some places. This is most obvious in terms of the weapon systems where early-game tech is typically the best option throughout the game.\n\nSome of the available options don't work, like special research projects to remove some planet maluses. Sometimes these fancier systems work poorly like subspace projectors which are difficult to place, impossible to deconstruct, and do not provide a consistent bonus in their area of effect.\n\nThe AI would sooner spite the player than actually attempt to survive in the game. I reduced a 10+ planet AI empire to 1 planet, and it consistently refused to surrender anything but one early game technology for peace. This wasn't a tolerance limit, but rather that it simply didn't see enough 'profit' in the deal.\n\nThe worst of it though is the FPS drop on the tactical map. Depending on the weapons you and the AI have this can occur even on moderately sized battles (about 20 ships a side, most of which are corvettes). I have a beast of a machine, (i7-5820k, GTX 980, 16gigs of ram and SD2 is running on a SDD), and the FPS can drop to nothing. What's irritating about this is that SD1 had bigger battles, with bigger ships, and worked much better at these numbers than SD2 is doing with an only moderate difference in graphics.\n\nYou couldn't justify it at $29.99. If you owned SD1 and can pick it up for a third off then it's a solid purchase. Otherwise though, you're better waiting for either a reduction or a fix to some of the above.\n\nThat said, it is worth picking up eventually. This is probably the closest we've come in modern times to a 4X classic like MOO2.\n\nManual ship and ground battles is a huge selling point. This is one of the very few 4X titles that has these mechanics, and it does both pretty well. The AI is a bit weak but that's hardly unusual. There are plenty of customization options for your ship, and while the balance is a bit off at the moment and you'll get to the point where you're mass-producing things very quickly so customization can be more tedious than enjoyable (like naming ships), they are very nice things to have.\n\nSomething else that struck me is that the galaxy is very much alive. You will be bombarded with things happening in your empire - ski resorts being set up, restarting the gravitational spin of a planet, wormhole studies, pirate attacks, and just this great collection of events. There's not a 4X title out there that offers the same level of activity. There's also quite a bit of passive universe-building like ion storms and the 'grimdark traverse' with more than a few, not really terribly well concealed, easter eggs about other sci-fi titles. The AI, while not terribly smart or understandable, has great character. As a veteran of SD1 I had hoped to see a few more races but the existing ones are still very enjoyable.\n\nEmpire management is also quite cool. You can have different races within your empire, and each provides their racial bonuses (so an Opteris citizen will get its smart bonus even if you don't have that trait). I spent quite some time setting up a few foreign exchanges and giving each race its own planet. I would have liked the ground combat units to reflect the racial make-up of the planet, but that's a small thing.\n\nIf you own SD1 then picking up SD2 for 20 bucks before the discount disappears is a smart move. If you don't then waiting a bit to see how much patching Zero will do and how effective it is more prudent at $30. When it drops though, even if Zero hasn't managed to iron everything out, it's still a very good purchase. It's not flawless, but aside from the optimiziation issue in battles there's nothing in it that can't be relatively easily fixed.\n\nUltimately the flaws with the game are mostly down to balance. That's something that would not have been an issue had it had a longer, or more exposed (but probably not on Steam Early Access), beta period.\n\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the tolerance addition to diplomacy! In some ways it's a purely contrived mechanic, but how it ends up working is a really nice in-game restriction to prevent you from gaming the AI. Unfortunately diplomacy has some trouble at the moment (see above), but it's one of the innovations in SD2 that actually forces a different approach to the genre norm when it comes to interacting with the AI.","April 22, 2015","true","28.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

This is truely one of the better 4X games out there and definitely one of the best produced in recent history. I can only assume that at least part of that is due to the fact that StarDrive II is totally different than StarDrive I. I didn't like StarDrive I personally so I would say thats a goood thing. If you liked SD I then you may feel differently. StarDrive II is a true classic 4X space opera title.\n\nShip customization is a real standout with this title. You can pick all the systems from weapons, shields, hanger bays to powerplants, C&C systems, and medbays and place them on a wide variety of ship sizes and shapes. Which adds another minigame type aspect that is well done and adds to the enjoyment and variety of the game. Each playthrough you can tweak and scheme to build ships that are a little better.\n\nThe real-time space battles are great with a well done variety of weapon effects (lasers, projectiles, missles, point-defense, etc), the ability to launch fighters for defense or offense, give standing orders, manually direct ships if desired, deploy mines, engage planetary stations, zoom in or out, whats not to love here?\n\nThe atmosphere is engaging and quite complete with a solid and well thought out lore. The races have real 'personality' and quirkiness that actually makes them standout and be remembered long after you play the game. This for me anyway pushes this game towards 'classic' quality. The custom race generator is quite excellent and balanced and allows you to make well balanced custom races that cater to your own playstyle.\n\nThe AI is above average for the genre. Clearly if you, like many of us that enjoy the 4X genre, have been playing these games for 20+ years the AI will rarely 'beat' you but it will give you a reasonable challenge. I have not seen the AI doing truely stupid thing like sending fleets to attack fleets twice their size or leaving planets undefended as I have with other 'bigger name' titles.\n\nThe diplomacy system is well done with many options to trade; money, treaties, trade, technology, planets, etc. The diplomacy screen gives you immediate feedback of the 'value' of both sides trades so you can clearly and easily see the likelyhood of making a successful offer. The races traits even affects what types of goods/technology they value more than others. Well done.\n\nThe graphics are quite varied and interesting. Not ground breaking but well above average. Different races ships look quite different. The universe scale map is quite nice with attractive atmospherics. The UI is well done and presents all the information needed to make decisions in an attractive and functional way without menu surfing.\n\nPlanet development is standard faire for the genre with a wide variety of planet sizes, types, and environments. The varied environments interact with various racial abilities. Planets can be mono or multi-racial with associated ups and downs depending on your technologies. A wide variety of buildings can be placed to upgrade your basic production values of industry, food, reseach. Your tech tree selections provide more than enough options for specializing your planets and giving them different roles within your empire.\n\nThe tech tree is perhaps not as deep as some would like but it is more than amply long for all but the longest of games in huge universes. The mechanic to pick one of three techs at each technology upgrade is innovative and ensures that on each playthrough the tech is varied and plays out differently from game to game. The tech tree can be easily modded if you really desire more.\n\nSome people complain about the ground combat but I actually find it quite a fun 'mini-game'; sure it's not C&C ground combat quality but its a great way to break up the monotony of moving fleets and setting build orders. It's 'fun' not 'deep and complex'. Many of the ground combat scenarios are interactive story missions giving the game at times an RPGesque aspect which is nice and fairly innovative for this genre.\n\nThe game is fairly moddable so I love being able to easily tweak and mod minor annoyances in ways I prefer. Compared to the many other recent 4X games this is the one I would recommend over many of them.\n\nIn my 80+ hours I have seen few (if any) bugs and the game runs extremely stable which seems to be a rarity in todays world of 'early access' drivel.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the classic 4X space opera genre.","November 21, 2015","true","82.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The empire management is simple and easy to learn. The ship combat is a simple order you ships to attack this target or move here, BUT each ship takes damage to a certain part, front back left or right and once all the modules are destroyed, they can attack the core. Destroying the core destroys the ship. So you can maneuver your ships so that they last longer. The ship desgining is easily the most fun part of the game, you drag modules onto a layout of a hull and the positioning can change the part of the ship the shield will protect, the firing arc and more. There are also cool events that can happen, such as an infested ship or finding a planet of dragon people.\n\nThe Bad: the only victory is to exterminate all the other empires, and the AI acts like they know this. Diplomacy is tough, as the AI tends to ask you for your stuff and threaten war otherwise. Some of the races hull designs are certainly better than others, as the Kulrathi and Opteris Hive seem to have larger ships than the other races. Ground combat is kind of clunky and slow, and I find myself autoing the invasion, even if it makes me lose troops. The Mac version also crashes quite a bit, but it is getting less and less common.\n\nBUY this game!","April 30, 2015","true","44.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

It's brilliant.\n\nDifficulty\nI'm playing it in "easy" to learn the ropes and have disabled the random space creatures and pirates from attacking. This option helps avoid early fledgling empires from being crippled by an early attack by the random spawns in the galaxy.\nI reckon the difficulty for 'easy' is about right now - since a few minor patches to adjust the easy difficulty level. Great support from the development team hear. I wouldn't be put off by it being to hard.\n\nWhy i like it so much\nThe complexity is about right. There appears to be loads of depth across the different aspects (economy, tech, fighting, expansion, diplomacy, espionage etc.) but no single aspect is hard to understand or control.\nThe ship battles are brilliant. They give you enough control but don’t require excessive micro-management, they are pretty and you get a good feel for what weapons and ships work, and what don’t.\nThe ship designing is excellent and not too time consuming. I usually get put off with designing ships because it's often too tricky to make the link between what you design and seeing the effect of those designs. Not here: as stated above, you easily get a feel for what works.\nFurthermore, you get plenty of information about how much power, ammunition, engines (etc.) you should be adding so you can ensure you don’t deploy something that just won’t work.\nDiplomacy seems to work.  I can easily understand what something is 'worth' and can make effective decisions around what to trade and what not to... Again, the game provides you with the information you need.\nSense of humour. The game doesn't take itself to seriously.\nGround combat. I think there should be an 'auto' option (i don’t think there is one), as long term I’d want to auto fight ground combat IF it occurs frequently.  Hmm.  That sounds negative. I like the ground combat mini game, it does it's job, but it's not what I *personally* want to spend my time on.  Overall though, it's a positive inclusion.\nExploration is fun! There's plenty of variety and strategic resources etc. that no game will be a like.  The strategic resources are all worth having and give noticeable bonuses.\nIt's stable. I’ve not had any stability issues.\nIt's not 100% perfect yet. There are a couple of minor annoyances such as not being able to see the plant population cap when viewing your planets list - its a rare case where you don't quite have all the information you need. Also, sometimes your planet will say 'starving' because it thinks it's short of 0.5 food, but actually it's not having a negative effect.\nI hope this review helps!\n","April 12, 2015","true","72.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Hopefully, future patches will improve it.\n- Cannot customize fighters beyond simply researching tech and having them auto upgraded\n- The community (Many people are griping about Stardrive 1 being abandoned too early.)\n\nOverall, I give Stardrive 2 a 7.5 out of 10, and I expect it will likely improve over time with modding and content patches or DLC.","April 28, 2015","true","16.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

Somewhere in the middle between GalCiv (strategic, planet management), Sword of the Stars (combat depth with some physics) and MoO (ship design and management on MoO2 level). All in all, I'd say - It is very fun. Has a lot of small, nice events that add up to the general gameplay too. Tactical combat is interesting enough with ship design being amazingly fun.\n\nThat said, it has a little bit more bugs than you'd expect, and of a sort you'd not expect. Most notably:\n- Fast fleets tend to overshoot their destinations - and then try to get back and overshoot again. This circus can for last a few turns if you're unlucky.\n- You can't enter the purple wormhole right after researching it. Need to wait for a new one to spawn. And then to not overshoot it ;-)\n- Very rarely, but sometimes you control the wrong ground force during ground combat.\n- Very rarely, (happened to me only in corvette-only fights) forces refuse to engage and you do not seem to have control over any of the ships.\n- Leaders appear so rarely that it's entirely possible to have a complete playthrough without ever encountering one\n- A lot of the weapons are not really much of an improvement over their predecessors - effective dps seems similar.\n- Auto resolving battles kills ships that would have not a single chance in hell of dying had the battle actually taken place.\n\nI would also be happy with a bit more documentation on weapons while placing them in the shipyard. It's not trivial to remember at first which weapon is 'beam', which a 'particle beam' etc, and if installing, say, a particle capacitor makes sense for one.\n\nThe game's also a bit too easy. I have not lost a single game ever - even the new brutal modes seem to only give the AI more resources, but don't really make it any scarier. I think you can safely ignore any difficulty below 'hard' even on your first playthrough.\n\nAll that aside - I would recommend to friends. Which I am hereby doing.

It has so many bugs that I wonder of the devlopers acually played the game before releasing it. I have fleets disappering, invisible enemies, freezing and crshing on minimal settnigs, and that's just the tip.\n\nThe game itself introduces nothing new. it is essentially a reskin of its predecessor, but actally feels more limiting rather than less. Planetary governors have been removed, forcing you to micromanage every planet. Heroes were added, but barely rate a footnote. Espionage no longer has individual agents with their own names and rankings, Ground combat is clunky and frustrating, fleets will hover around, miss, or otherwise loose targets which you had ordered them to find, board, or engage, Diplomacy is socompletely unbalanced that it would require a separate review.\n\nAnd then there are simple things, like persistant scenario memory, that further frustrate me. You spend time setting up the ideal scenario for your game and then for whatever reason choose to restart and have to do it all over again. There is no apparatus to save  races or campaign settings.\n\nAll and all, I was too frustrated to have fun.","April 19, 2015","false","32.8"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

Lots of ideas taken from there, so you can adapt very quickly to the game. So if you like MOO2 you will like this game.\n\n3. A nice ship combat system, really nice to watch, and you can actually apply tactics--especially if you design your fleets well. You won't just sit there and watch the battle happen. Unless you have a titan packed with mass drivers, defense guns,and a tough armor or shield.\n\n\n4. Focus on planets has improved drastically, especially how population and building special buildings has a huge impact. Colonists can either be taking care of the food business, the production business, or be Einstein-tier researchers.\n\n5. Customize ships. Shipyard is back, and while it isn't as free as Stardrive 1 the limitations are there because it makes the ship combat more realistic. Far more choice too with every component, want it to be armored-its going to be heavier,cost more, and take longer to build. Lots of different weapon options as well.\n\n\n6. Lore, lots and lots of it. Also add to that the funny jokes and items you come across taken from many different sci-fi series\n\n7. Enjoy mods, because this game is build to support plenty and plenty of mods. Star Trek mods are already on their way. Also, with the current game engine choice it's bound to look  good.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nStardrive 2 has innovated upon\n\n1. Concept of freighter fleets is high in this game, don't remember if MOO2 has it though. So protecting freighter fleets is very important unless you want your empire to stagnate and crumble.\n\n2. Simultaneous turns system,it's turn based with a realtime feel.I might be the only one that really likes this system though. Turns happen instantly,not many(or any) 4x games have such a quick turn system.Also, every empire makes the turn at the 'same' time more or less.\n\n\n3. 3D ground combat, you rarely if never see that in a 4x game, while it is at the moment simple it has great potential.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThen again, the game could use quite a few improvements, but these are\n\n1. More detailed ship battles, they are amazing as they are now, but nothing is ever perfect!\n\n2. Better ground combat. Perhaps in a future expansion?\n\n3. Better user interface in certain sections, speed timers in the battle interface?\n\n4. Larger galaxies, 100 systems is huge but the universe is the limit!\n\n---\n\nOverall, great game-shines over its predecessor. A great single player 4x game, quite refreshing to see.\n\nAdded bonus, it's the first turn based 4x game to come out on gnu/linux!(as far as I know).","April 10, 2015","true","35.4"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

The quality is AAA all the way from the excellent animated cut scenes and incredible still art to the intensely helpful professionally voiced tutorial to the gameplay mechanics everything radiates superb polish.\n\nShip building is very exciting as one tries to see what is the best design for the job you intend to do. It is a major high creating a ship and seeing its purpose fulfilled exceptionally whether its for combat or colonizing or to transport workers and troops to another planet. There are also supply lines one has to keep open by avoiding enemy blockades as you will need supply lines to keep your ships fueled for the long trek into enemy territory to destroy their main empire planet.\n\nCombat is tense and alot of fun as i was maneuvering my ships to avoid enemy fire while getting in the best position to do the most damage while being able to pause at any time to revaluate the situation. Winning commendations after a battle also gave a added sense of satisfaction after a victory over raiders or another empire.\n\nRaces are varied and interesting from the honorable shogun like bear race to the violent pyschotic wolf race. There are also space pirates to contend with which will harass your territories until you deal with them.\n\nThere is a vast research tree which allows for the discovery of many new advances from ships to making life easier for your planetary populations such as increased population breeding and stronger lighter metals for ships along with better handling power plants to keep energy weapons going along with many other discoveries just waiting to be researched.\n\nMusic and sound effects  have a excellent science fiction vibe creating moments of peaceful stellar harmony as you view the vastness of the space map or watch the humorous galactic news feeds. Many a focused moment i have found myself suddenly in a relaxed mental state taking in all the audio goodness with hypnotic futuristic music by the legendary likes of Isao Tomita. This combined with the soothing visuals made me feel i was back playing MASTER OF ORION 2 but with modern enhancement making for a smooth user interface experiance with excellent tool tips popping up revealing information on every single big and little thing happening on the screen. I definitely appreciate this and it has made my enjoyment of StarDrive 2 a much more richer experiance.\n\nStarDrive 2 a spectacular over the top intricate yet easy to get into masterpiece thanks to its incredible interface of star ship combat and empire conquest where galactic catastrophies will leave you smiling in awe as empires rise and fall.","April 11, 2015","true","10.8"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","21","41","2","2"

Every time you play you get an almost completely new experience. The research, galaxy generation, and the AI's make the game feel like there's is still so much more to the game. Not to mention the AI with the collaboration of GNN give the game charactor and purpose. It's always best in my opinion when you feel you are in the game and running a real empire.\n\nThe combat for space battles in StarDrive 2 is amazing. I don't understand why some people find that this type of combat is like Total War or some other strategy game, it's completely different, and in my opinion much better. When you want to take a break from Campaign, there is always the Battle Arena which places you in the combat immediately controlling an entire fleet. Ground battles honestly could use some work. When I went into ground combat, I felt suddenly seperated from the real game and I ended up feeling bored and the gameplay felt tedious. Ground combat is still an important function of the game so I hope Zero Sum games can change things up a bit in the future.\n\nThe strategy of the game overall is fantastic. I was placed in situations where I had to make difficult decisions for the good of my empire and these types of challenges are definitely what I look for in a 4X strategy game. For the sake of not revealing too much information, I will conclude by saying that Star Drive 2 was probably the best purchase I have ever made. The graphics are great, the strategy is amazing, and space combat adds an amazing twist to the experience. I recommend this game to anyone who not only enjoys strategy, but enjoy a replayable game that will provide you with with plenty of challenges. Enjoy\n\nWorth Buying?

You can only use special abilities with 1 ship selected.\n\nAlso the "ammo used per second if all weapons fired at once" can be misleading. You could have a module that uses 100 ammo but only fires once every 10 seconds. It will show 10 ammo per second, but will never actually fire if you don't have at least 100 ammo capacity. You'll have to keep this in mind when building ships.\nDespite all these things I found the game to be fun. Maybe it's not compared to other 4x games in it's genre but this is the only one I've played. Considering it was made by such a small team (only one person?) I can look past things. It can be hard and confusing at first, but once you understand it then it's easier. Building ships is one of my favorite parts. I look forward to this game being further updated (there was already one). At least it isn't a triple A game asking for 60-70 bucks while hardly being a game.\n\nI would recommend to wait until it's on sale or improved upon.","April 11, 2015","true","33.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Higher tier weapons are actually a detriment and higher tier ships are a little too cheap to bring to the table. Both are purely numbers, though, and can be fixed very easily/quickly so that is the only reason i say its not perfect.\n\nThe new turn-base system allows much more relaxed play even in the late game. SD1 had a bad reputation for becoming a micromanaging nightmare late game due to the RTS nature it had. The people that say otherwise should go play Starcraft if they want a fast-paced RTS, not StarDrive.\n\nPersonally i love the new shipyard mechanics. Many complain about it because it removed a lot of customization with firing arcs and the ships are smaller, but i welcome it. I could spend upwards of an hour in SD1 designing a Titan ship because of all the firing arcs and power management it required. In SD2, probably 10min max. Much prefer the vastly faster customization vs the amount of customization.\n\nDifficulty meters cater to a wide array of players. The "Normal" can be rather unforgiving until you learn a few tricks of the trade, but theres a lot of ways to make it easier while you learn the game.","April 12, 2015","true","62.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Ya me too. There's lots to like about this game but the game still has a few warts.\n\nPro's:\n\n1. Ship design and ship combat. Personally from a Realtime perspective I don't think there is a current game that does this better. If you like TBS combat look elsewhere but I think this game makes a valid case for the transition to realtime combat in space 4x.\n\n2. Race diversity. I think the species that are in this game add a fair bit of flavour. I know the moo races will always have a special place in my heart but these are pretty good.\n\n3. UI in general is clean and bugfree.\n\n4. Planet management is decent and not overly tedious.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Ground combat.....ugh.....its hex based ground combat. Why or why after making the wise decision to go realtime for space would the developer go with hex based combat? It's so tedious and not fun. Fortunately its not a major part of the game.\n\n2. Diplomacy is rather weak in general. This is a flaw in many 4x games except for a few. This game is strictly centered around winning through attrition. One path to success. The game feels a bit linear in the approach in this sense.\n\n\nOverall. I'd recommend the game but it leaves me wanting. Combat is great but Diplomacy/victory conditions are just as important and the ground combat is the bitter pill to swallow in between.\n\n\n\n","March 2","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I really wanted to like this game, and was pleased to see a Linux port on a space 4x-er. After 111 hours in I am going to be deleting this game from my library. I spent those hours trying to find the promise that drew me to the game, but was delivered in frustrating little bursts of mediocrity: diplomacy, ship design, UI, land combat, and ship combat are all poorly executed. If the developer had put in the consistent work and updated the game maybe this game would have reached its initial promise. Instead, the game feels like an orphan, and a developer with a past who seems to spend more time defending himself in forums then making a good game. Again.\n\nFor a contrast, check out Hearthlands (a totally different game) for a game that popped at the same general time as Star Drive 2. Look at how many updates and changes this game has gone through, and how much better a game it was then a year ago. And all those updates have been free. I am just pointing out the work by the developer, not the quality or genre of the game.Too bad for Star Drive 2.  And when Stellaris is released this game will be a memory.

Turn based strategy, real time combat. All of the original races are back along with a new race. Very good game.  There Can Be Only One! No alliances here, but you can butter up your neighbors. If they cask to trade for a really good tech, give them something lower and avoid diplomacy penalties by getting a diplomacy bonus! Trade and Non-Agression treaties can buy you time.\n\nThis is a game where you need to build colony ships for each colony you want to colonize and there are three population tasks - Food, Industry and Research. You can even move population around.\n\nFood is available across the Empire - provided you have freighters (easy to build). Everything is handled by the game for your freighters. Poor planets give the same amount of money as any other, however, production suffers. Research is great! The larger your Empire the more expensive research is. There are research fields, and you only get one item from the list of three. You can trade or maybe capture the other items.\n\nRaces are neat. Each is different with different traits. Racial traits for the playable race can be adjusted. This is Way Nice!\n\nCombat is pretty neat. This game does not have as many ships as Star Ruler 2, both games are very good. There is also ground combat, so bring troops!\n\nThe only negative I have is that in the late game things slow down. However, the developer has stated he is working on improvement in this area.

First, congrats on taking the MOO2 skeleton and fleshing it out.  Took some guts, and it could have easily been a very bad move.  Second, I really dig the storyline missions and the interactions that come with them.  Good job.  Third, ship building is wonderful, and pretty fast.  A boost to what I expected (I really just want one more feature, changing the arc of fire).  Next, I love the medals for units.  And good job with the revamped ground combat system.  Finally, the small specialty random events ("Your planet is becoming very skilled at building freighters...") is a brilliant stroke and really adds to the game (is there a way that these bonuses smack you in the face, to make it easier to see, and more difficult to lose a planet to an invasion?)\nA couple of things:\nLet us trade, steal, or develop new ship layouts!\nMore tech, racial tech trees, and storylines.  Yeah, I realize I'm asking for addtional content.  I'm happy to pay for good DLC.\nLet us shift the firing arcs in our ships during the build.  Some arcs on the lateral build sectors should be able to reach fore and/or aft.\nBetter player-side AI management of resource management.  It seems that my planets are always producing food, no matter what.  Even a simple radio box "New population produces X by default" would do wonders for play flow.\nI would love to see a "Civ-Style" unit advancement system upon experience boosts.  Let us choose if the unit gets an offense, defense, or other boost.  I love the system there, and I wish we had it here.  It gives units more personality, and attachment.\n\nIf you miss Masters of Orion 2, get this game.  If you looked at MOO2 and said "I just wish it had...", get this game.  If you want a game with decent detail, but no overwhelming micromanaging, get this game.","April 12, 2015","true","159.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It is some kind of known system, but it fits well in the game.\n\nTroop management and equipment adds an individual aspect that I have never experienced in a 4x game before (I played most, beginning with Space Empires IV).\n\nThe turn system is pretty much the manual version, in my point of view, of the predecessors 5 sec turn instance system. With 8 AI enemies 5 turns, as for my machine, are 5 sec in sum. When needed, this system provides you with planning-possibilities you might and/or will need.\n\nTo criticise, in my experience, is the 8 ships only build list. You can edit it, ok, but I do not like to manually swap the updated designs for the older ones. Stardrive 1 had the better system with actual and obsolete designs, autoupdates and (for me) never ending design list to choose from.\n\nUpdate: After long hours of intense gameplay, i came to a different understanding. Unique ships are worthy units. You bild them once, they remain in service till they are destroyed or dismissed. Mainline battleships are build often, destroyed often, and updated regularly. Even a humble frigate becomes the cornerstone of a fleet, advances through the system of achievements, collects experience and becomes even more valuable; even a carrier can have experienced fightersquads that are much more survivable and do a better job than freshly produced ones. This feature requires some micromanagement, but time is not a matter.\n\nNow for the games key feature: Ship design\n\nEverything matters now, not just the sum of components. You can armor them, outfit special characteristics.... Range, angles, everything matters now. Weight and other subsystem-characteristics are detailed and explained within the editor, so no more one-shot ships that need constant supply because their reactors are woefully underrated (engine rating should at least equal power consumption rate). Unfortunately, as of this build, the powergrid system (a rector only supplies power within a limited range) is lost.\n\nDamage is applied to different sectors of the ship, is one gone the ship or station is as well.\n\nI am continuing to play, have not encountered any bug within 8 hours of gaming.\n\nTill the next update!\n\n(Playing United Federation)\n\nOBSOLETE - (with bugfix link, all credit to original poster of the solution mentioned)\nFirst of all, it never started. My desktop (PC) easily fulfills all recommended requirements, but nothing happens. An error pops up and the game ends.\n\nTill that bug is removed - DO NOT BUY IT [it is a once in a thousand bug/glitch that occurs while installing, or sth like that. A link to the forum explaining the extremely simple debug - delete a folder in the games user/app.... - is provided, thanks to the guy who identified it. After that, the game runs extremely smooth!\n\nObsolete - first day of possessing Stardrive II\n\nUpdate: now i see the starting screen, but nothing happens. Please wait 0% for 10 min\n\nUpdate 2: still waiting for anything to happen..... 1 hour straight - waiting and nothing happens, till my steam client crashed.\n\nUpdate 3: reinstalled for the 4th time. Getting a random file missing file there note. Funny thing: except for microsoft windows security essentials no antivirus is running.... and I do not recieve any conflict or whatsoever info. Still hung at loading screen, but this time zerosumgames took a full minute to vanish.\n\nUpdate 4:\n\nlooked again and someone found the solution. Testing it right now\n\nhttp://stardrivegame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10997\n\nOk: Crash!!!\n\nUpdate 5: after deleting everything again and again it now starts loading, I am not stuck at 0%. Wellll\nIt seems to be working now. Starting a game for the first time.","April 12, 2015","true","21.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

The learning curve was really frustrating at launch, but the dev has already made a lot of changes to soften the blow. And now that I'm fully familiar with how different options at game creation play out, it's easy to set up whatever sort of game session I'm in the mood for.\n\nThe sarcasm in this game is strong, along with plenty of 4th wall banter; I get a good laugh pretty much every time I play. My favorite feature of the game though, is the developers attitude towards modding. He seems to me to mainly hoping to provide the community with a new and powerful engine to develope their conversions on Workshop and I am super excited for the possibilities.","April 22, 2015","true","99.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Was killed later by crystals.\nFifth game, started to learn the basics of the game at that point and got into the groove of it. Managed to control half the map till pirates started to attack my homeworld from the edge of the map, couldn't get there in time and soon whole race died.\n\nEventually I'll be able to win one game but even still, I'm having a blast playing it. Sure, it may be a dumbed down version of it's first title but thats good for someone like me. I feel this game appeals to both hardcore 4X gamers and those just starting out.

It does a very good job in helping you relive those glory days before the marketdroids at the game companies came up with the stupid term "4X".\n\nAnyway, StarDrive 2 is NOT stupid, it's in fact a very enjoyable game. However, where MOO2 fell short - diplomacy - is where I find SD2 to have a similar weakness. Just like in MOO2, there's always one or two races out in the galaxy that are hellbent for war, and really just don't care what you think, and they're going to build up a huge fleet and come dig up your entire planet's lawn and pave it with concrete - after they burn down your entire civilization and erase all memory of it from the collective universal consciousness, of course. An alien's gotta' have his priorities, ya' know!\n\nThat said, if you loved MOO2 despite it's flaws, you'll like SD2. It's worth it, and just like MOO2, this game will suck away your real life time faster than the Millenium Falcon doing the Kessel Run.\n\n7/10 parsecs.","June 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

If you have put hundreds of hours into either over the last decades, modded them and have been lurking on the boards of the differen BotFe remake community projects this is your game, especially once the total conversion Star Trek mod is ready...\n\nThere are some differences to MoO2 and BotFe, but those departures are truly sound decisions that enhance the game experience. The ship design functionality is awesome.\n\nContrary to what you may read from the many trolls and haters griefing about StarDrive 1 this one-man-developer obviously deeply cares about the games he creates. This is a man who has the education and CV to earn significantly more money in his original job and gave that up to follow the dream of making his own game(s). I kinda envy him for that courage. StarDrive 1 could not be further developed because Microsoft ended support for the still flawed engine it was based on. StarDrive 2 is different with the departure from realtime but IMO more true to the original vision and a great advance on Stardrive 1.\n\nThis game was released as  a fully functional version more mature than too many AAA titles and the developer has been quick with updates containing bugfixes, game mechanism adjustments etc. based on customer feedback. I believe he did not sleep for the first few days as the patches would closely follow each other within just a few hours. Compare that to the actions of AAA publishers and developers where you have to wait for months to get obvious, and obviously simple, bugs fixed...\n\nCurrently the tempo of patches has abated a bit but the next announced patch will be a major improvement with great enhancement of the AI, more game setup options and further bugfixes. This is the kind of patch we need to wait more than half a year for with Total War games.","May 4, 2015","true","144.1"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Turn based strategy, real time combat. All of the original races are back along with a new race. Very good game.  There Can Be Only One! No alliances here, but you can butter up your neighbors. If they cask to trade for a really good tech, give them something lower and avoid diplomacy penalties by getting a diplomacy bonus! Trade and Non-Agression treaties can buy you time.\n\nThis is a game where you need to build colony ships for each colony you want to colonize and there are three population tasks - Food, Industry and Research. You can even move population around.\n\nFood is available across the Empire - provided you have freighters (easy to build). Everything is handled by the game for your freighters. Poor planets give the same amount of money as any other, however, production suffers. Research is great! The larger your Empire the more expensive research is. There are research fields, and you only get one item from the list of three. You can trade or maybe capture the other items.\n\nRaces are neat. Each is different with different traits. Racial traits for the playable race can be adjusted. This is Way Nice!\n\nCombat is pretty neat. This game does not have as many ships as Star Ruler 2, both games are very good. There is also ground combat, so bring troops!\n\nThe only negative I have is that in the late game things slow down. However, the developer has stated he is working on improvement in this area. That will be good.\n\nStar Drive 2 is a really good game, it is very similar to Master of Orion 2, and I think even better.

But I find it limited. I also find that its bugs make it unplayable. Here i am, 5 hours into a game, ive just lost 3 fleets and 2 planets. No no, dont missread, i wasnt defeated in battle. The enemy flew off the map and i was faced with a choice. let the battle play out, or end the match and sacrifice the match. I gave the first match like this 15 minutes, and no conclusion came. I am currently playing out the third match like this as i edit my review. Zero, the dev, has no intention of releasing a finished game, or even a playable game. This is just a cash grab by him. Why would i claim such? well Stardrive 1 wasnt particularly improved, but was just left as he started the project for SD2. The last patch notes Ive seen was released Nov 24, 2015. The game is on sale today for 7.49 usd. It isnt worth $2.00 usd. Fix this game Zero.

Basically all of the orig game mechanics are there, but all of them are slightly enhanced (in the way that you think this is what is should have been in the original). Some of the mechanics seem to be new (ground/troop combat), but overall, very good design and approach for those players, who strive for a new and deep MOO-type-of-4X-game.\n- Very good overall graphics/sound design: Light, but effective, pleasing one's eyes. Some menus are very well organized so e.g. the empire management is thus very effective, even with lots of colonies.\n- Very good ship designing: Create multi-purpose or very specialized ship designs; mix fleets in a way that fits your gaming style. In general, there is a great variance of ship's weapon and module types.\n- Good ship2ship combat/battles: Ship design plays a big role in combat, but certain tactics are necessary and are a definitive advantage. Still, tactics are not the core of battles, it is mainly techlogies and ship design. Ships get various medals/bonuses for certain combat achievements and retain these for life; these are also upgradeable. Battles are also very well graphically designed to please one's eyes. Thus, some battles can be quite epic.\n- Well designed diplomacy: You know exactly what they think about you and why and what you did good to help the relations, what you did bad to harm them. You know exactly where your current diplomatic limits with each of the races are. Spying is yet another game concept which reminds of good old MOO2, but is nicely extended, so that a player has a better control of offensive actions.\n- Additional in-game candy: You can build Space/refueling stations whereever you need them on the map. Exploration of space anomalies - some trigger combat, some additional research; all provide various in-game bonuses and content. Various planetary enhancements, generated randomly ad-hoc as a result of certain long-term situations (sport resorts, merchant guilds, private shipyards, ...). Space-creatures. And a dark story, affecting the whole galaxy...\n\nCons:\n- Diplomacy: Despite diplomacy being very well designed and informative, it seems its purpose is not to seak diplomatic victory in this game (e.g. a concept of permanent alliances is missing). Diplomacy does not need an ovehaul, but an extension to have even more possibilities.\n- No SpaceStation designing: This is a "minor" issue; but not possible to create customized space station designs. Neverteheless, space stations use the best tech the player has available.\n- Groud/troop combat: Although developer put quite an effort into modelling of this concept, it is a bit dull. It has a great potential, but it feels like it does not work as originally intended. This is overhauled in DLC.\n- MOO2 Rip-off: This might not be ideal for players ho seek new, unorthodox approaches to 4X gaming.\n- Some bugs: From time to time, there are small bugs/glitches in the game, usually not gamebreaking, but sometimes quite annoying. The number of bugs went down quite a lot just before the DLC release, on the other hand, DLC release might have introduced new ones. Anyway, the (only) developer is working to fix those too.\n\nVerdict: 8/10\nVery good content, sometimes spoiled a bit by occasional bug. This is an excellent 4X MOO2-like space strategy game, probably the best one out there.\n\n===========\nGet the DLC!\n- More exploration / remote mining of more resources.\n- Nebulae\n- Bigger universe, more stars, epic games\n- Extended research tree","March 11","true","75.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's fun to just sit back and look at the pretty map, or watch the space battles.\nExcept if you just sit back you may well lose. How you approach combat matters, as does ship design. If you like to get hands-on with your ships, expect to spend a fair amount of time designing them.\nSound design and music are very satisfying. Everything sounds right, which goes a long way towards selling the game.\nInterface is informative, understated, and polished. It avoids the overly minimalist interface of Endless Legend, but doesn't distract you either.\nEmpire management is understandable, but hasn't been dumbed down. It's very similar to MOO2.\nThere are some bugs, but the game continues to receive updates after its release, and nothing I've run into has made me regret buying the game. I'm very excited about the new DLC, and I intend to purchase it soon. Do bear in mind that the developer is basically a single person; this isn't the product of some big studio. One advantage to that is that the developer has responded to player requests; larger galaxies were asked for, and were delivered, first in a free patch, and then even bigger ones in the DLC.","March 11","true","73.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Turn based strategy, real time combat. All of the original races are back along with a new race. Very good game.  There Can Be Only One! No alliances here, but you can butter up your neighbors. If they cask to trade for a really good tech, give them something lower and avoid diplomacy penalties by getting a diplomacy bonus! Trade and Non-Agression treaties can buy you time.\n\nThis is a game where you need to build colony ships for each colony you want to colonize and there are three population tasks - Food, Industry and Research. You can even move population around.\n\nFood is available across the Empire - provided you have freighters (easy to build). Everything is handled by the game for your freighters. Poor planets give the same amount of money as any other, however, production suffers. Research is great! The larger your Empire the more expensive research is. There are research fields, and you only get one item from the list of three. You can trade or maybe capture the other items.\n\nRaces are neat. Each is different with different traits. Racial traits for the playable race can be adjusted. This is Way Nice!\n\nCombat is pretty neat. This game does not have as many ships as Star Ruler 2, both games are very good. There is also ground combat, so bring troops!\n\nThe only negative I have is that in the late game things slow down. However, the developer has stated he is working on improvement in this area. That will be good.\n\nStar Drive 2 is a really good game, it is very similar to Master of Orion 2, and I think even better.

The AI is super agressive from the get go so its usually a struggle for survival from the outset so there is not a lot of time for development (the 4x part), you end up having to follow one quite specific path to get through the beginning and its a military approach, many of the quests and missions are interesting but there are a limited number, you usually need to do them to survive the early game and this detracts from replayability.\n\nLastly, ground combat is not great but many others have covered this. It could be an interesting enough little mini game on a mobile phone, but compared to the ship customization and the superb realtime 3d ship battles, it does not really fit the grand scale of the game.\n\nHowever obvious limitations aside, there are glimpses of brilliance in Stardrive.\n\nI really hope the new DLC's adress the problems because if they do this may well be my favourite modern 4x space game.","December 18, 2015","true","118.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I don't know what really happened, but people get REALLY pi**ed off on internet forums - we know this - you'd think they spent their life-savings, their left hand and a firstborn child on it or something, rather than a handfull of quid (I picked it up for a little under seven).\n\nIts not perfect, but it has all the solid staples of a good 4X, is very pretty in parts and has some unique selling points of its own - the ship designing is fun and effective for example, and the turn system is different.\n\nIt *is* a bit too obvious what television programmes the developer likes to watch though... Gold-pressed Latinum? MalFillion? Breaks the fourth wall a little.","November 28, 2015","true","24.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you are in the middle and gets sorrounded by enemies then you are more or less screwed.\n\nThe good point is the combat, really fun. When a faction delcares war on you, there is this arms race that is a load of fun, atleast for me. Gets destroyed by rockets one battle, and then refit your new fleet with anti-missile defences, and wreck them. Small things like that really makes the game really fun. But I get the feeling that the AI don't change much, after refitting my fleet with anti missile defences, they still used them, which is kinda weird, especially after like 8 big battles.\n\nAnd the customization of the races is fun, but it feels lacking at some parts.\n\nI would recommend this if you are a really big fan of Sci-fi strategy games, but at the same time, I would not recommend this over games like Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion though.","April 13, 2015","true","35.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I think there are a select few 4X players who won't be turned off by the overbearing management required to win in a campaign.  I am not one.\n\nStarDrive 2 is very tedious.  There is a lot of variety in what you can do, what strategies you use or ships you build.  This game does a lot of good things, but nothing extremely well.  The RPG aspect, planet management, tech trees, diplomacy, and ship building are a positive.  Ground combat was definitely improved with the DLC.  Space combat however is its major weakness.  Both the actual battles and preparation for them, are lopsided.  It's the most frustrating aspect of the game.\n\nIf you are a 4X fan, and see something in this game that makes you want give it a try, by all means do.  However, I don't think most gamers in general would enjoy StarDrive 2.","April 4","false","99.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

They asked me to hand it over, i was like no ♥♥♥♥ you it my planet i colonised it its mine. Their responce was a evil invading fleet. so i sped up my fleet production and sent a fleet of ships to attack this evil invading fleet. By the time my fleet arrived they had taken my planet and a awesome real time battle ensued. i wiped out their fleet in a spectacular battle. i then recolonised my previously own planets, they sent another fleet. i wiped the floor with them again. it was awesome then the deplomacy window popped up they were begging for peace and friendship, as we were good friends before i forgave them, but next time they betray me i will wipe them out.\n\npros\nDecent graphics\neasy to use UI\nSpace bears\nturn based fleet movement\nReal time space battles\nPlanet management\nbuild your own ships\nDeveloper that updates and fixes according to community feedback.\nClever AI\nHuge improvement over Stardrive 1 (not that i didn't like stardrive 1 because i did)\n\ncons\nGround battles are turn based would be awesome if they were real time.\n\nover all pretty awesome game as good as any AAA game if not better, it's like total war in space. I'm a huge total war fan although Rome 2 was a bit Naff. If your tired of creative assemblys ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugged releases and fancy a change in setting give this one a go.

This review is based on patched version 1.1a.\nA few comments:\n\nStability and completeness: I've played this game for 40 hours. It never crashed. All features are present and complete...I assume the "this is a beta" reviewers were playing an earlier, unpatched version, or that I simply haven't encoutered the severe bugs they have. For comparison, every Bethesda RPG I've ever played had more and worse bugs than this game, even in GotY editions, and SD 2 is a one-man-show that cost me $30 undiscounted. It's not a beta.\n\nSpace combat: emphasis in ship design is on tactics, not customizing appearance. I love this...that's why it's a MOO II tribute game. The real time combat does allow you control of targeting, movement, and some special ship abilities, but it's simple enough that you can resolve a large battle expediently...unlike MOO II. Much better tactical combat than Galciv 2 or Endless Space, with or without extensions.\n\nGround combat: it's a simplified variant of Heroes or Age of Wonders style combat on a grid. You can customize troop loadouts, deploy shields, etc. Early in the game there are some nice ground combat missions that give you a challenge and reward early on, but once I figured out some simple tactics I found planetary invasions a bit easy: the AI is weak here. Personally I prefer the combat grid to the dice roll that is common for combat in 4x space games, especially in the early game.\n\nAI: Challenging, at least in the early game. I need more playthroughs on harder difficulty to assess this properly, but so far it's better than the really stupid AI in competing games, including Civ 5, etc. I suspect big publishers know the player wants to win, even if he's rubbish! I do think the AI needs some better ship designs in the late game.\n\nI've played the following similar games: MOO II, Galactic Civilizations 2, Endless Space, Sins of a Solar Empire. I actually bought Distant Worlds: Universe at the same time as SD 2, but opted to try SD 2 first...it's a good time for 4x gamers!","June 13, 2015","true","200.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

Not a single crash, laggy moment or instability.\n+ The research system is vastly improved and adds a few features I've not seen in a 4x game, including a system that makes diplomacy and espionage very important.\n+ The ship varieties are nice, the game is very pleasant to look at.\n+ There's even a little X-com like tactical game for your ground troops\n+ Random events and regions of space can trigger special research projects that can help your empire\n+ Freighters and cargo transport has been hugely streamlined, this used to be very frustrating in SD1 having to micromanage all of your freighters.\n+ Good variety of planet features that give extra depth to the colonisation system including some nods to classic sci-fi.\n\nAll that being said, there are some things that could have been done a little better:\n\n- The sound design suuuucks! from random 'sci-fi beeps' on the tactical map and cheesy 'pew-pew' noises in battles, the sound design could have been so much better, honestly can't remember what the music is like other than I turned it off pretty quickly.\n- there is a max 100 system limit. the galaxy doesn't feel particularly big, gets crowded quickly with more than 3 opponents.\n- A couple of balancing issues could use looking at\n\nAll in all though, this is a solid 4X game that improves greatly on it's predecessor, pleased to have bought it.","May 24, 2015","true","15.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

Since this game is like a remake of the all time classic I will compare the two games\n\nOriginally written at release, edited on release of the DLC\n\nPro:\n-It does have a great economic system that is heavily inspired by MoO2 and even improves the former ones.\n-The Space fights are Top, also the Ship desgin system\n-Nice Graphics\n-Really good strategic space map and boarder simulation (Note: got even better with recent DLC)\n-random events with some story\n\nNeutral:\n-early random pirates can really hurt and bascilly trough the game, so u HAVE to prepare before expanding\n-the diplomacy has the potential to shine, but it needs some more tradeobject. like force someone to declair war to someone etc.\n-the UI is not as compact as MoO2, and could need some more links and detail tooltips\n\n\nNegative:\n-Like MoO2 it still has some bugs BUT the dev is stil actively working on the game (as of 2016 still active, just released an DLC)\n-german langunage is partly bad translated, better play in english\n-you feel like with some final relatively small adjustment this could be the best 4x game ever. (with the recent DLC this is even more true)\n-I dont like the ground battles. (its like a streamlined XCOM). I feel sorry for the dev since u can see he invested quite some time to develop this. It just doesnt works out that good in a game focused on space (THIS IS FIXED WITH THE DLC's new ground combat system!!)\n\nTotal:\nI enjoy the game, and I am looking forward to every patch from the dev. If you liked Master of Orion than buy this. Some points Stardrive2 does better others MoO2.\n\nAs of 2016 with the recent DLC, this is the true succesor of MoO2 and the very best 4X available at the moment.","May 22, 2015","true","160.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

Pough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chopaksnes/","242 products in account","Stardrive 2 have been a highly anticipated game for me personally this year so i eagerly sat down and started playing it the 10th.\n\nFirst of all it was completely different from SD1 and so there was alot more to learn, but if you know the basics of x4 games this wont be too difficult as you need to follow the basic "explore, expand, exploit and exterminate". Thus you will do this and the AI will do this during the whole course of the game through a wide variety of strategies with invasions and diplomacy.\n\nWhat i really like is that the tech tree has been improved, now i am still a little uncertain if it is for the better og worse as you only get to choose a handfull of technologies (in a normal game), but this will push you towards "roleplaying" or acting more with your races' traits, if you choose the trait "creative" however you will be able to get all the technologies except racial/experimental tech from the other races. I was a big fan of SD1 not exactly being turn based so everything happened in real time like space battles and exploration, but to compensate for that the developer gave us BATTLE ARENAS! which i for one enjoy very much and it makes for a more interesting experience though i hate that i always manage to get destroyed.\n\nWhat i dont like that much is mostly a few smaller problems like when i try to box-select my ships in a battle arena the mouse cursor may touch the minimap and then my view gets teleported to the other side of the arena which is annoying. I am very unsure about the ground combat, but that is my personal preference, it does however feel a little quick made in many ways; firstly it looks bad but i can always get over that fact, Secondly the player is too prone to missclick and give orders by accident, there should be some way to give the soldiers orders in a proper way (example: i tend to click and check what soldiers are equipped with so i can send my short ranged soldiers to the front, but it is too easy to give them orders so they will either shoot or walk somewhere by accident).\nThese are tiny problems of course and i will enjoy the game to the fullest no matter, but it would be nice to see some sort of fix for this.\n\nNow i havent even touched the surface for how good this game can be, i mean the best part about it is to construct your own ships and send them into combat to see how long they survive, but it seems to me that the remnant invasion, angry crystal ships, pirates and the other empires loves to harrass the player alot. (i was so lucky to get the "Zapp Brannigan" leader on my first run and didnt understand why i was attacked so much). Maybe i am just a complete idiot and embarrasingly bad at constructing ships too, but i spent most of my time researching tech and turtling while being blokaded by remnant ships and pirates until the empires around me sandwitched me to kingdom come.\n\nSo all in all if you are still reading, this game is very good! it is easy to understand and get into, the AI will destroy you on Normal and you must learn that Patience is a virtue, i recommend this highly, especially in the future when there probably will be alot of exciting mods to come from a great modding community.","April 11, 2015","true","32.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

This game needs more good reviews, so I'll make it my first.  As a veteran of every major 4x and strategy game since I played the first Civilization as a teenager, Stardrive 2 stands out as a real gem.  Major pluses:\n\n+Depth and complexity in race and game setup without endless sliders and checkboxes.  You have several meaningful choices, which can be combined in complex ways to make for a very different play experiences, but customization isn't a total swamp of minor adjustments.\n\n+The planet characteristics (Size, Type, Gravity, Mineral Abundance, Strategic Resources, Special Features) can be combined in an absolutely cool and endless number of ways to create a very unpredictable variety of planets.  This makes for great choices to make on the strategic map.\n\n+The graphics are effective and evocative, and the game text and lore have a sense of humor matching the gamestyle.  This is an unusual and really beneficial thing - too many games have beautiful art that's not so evocative, or err on the side of grim-and-serious when that is not a needed aesthetic for their other choices.\n\n+Ship design is fun, deep, and offers many ways to optimize your ships together or individually, while refit system encourages you to redesign when needed without a major gameplay penallty.\n\n+Battles are pretty, quick, and offer an appropriate level of micromanagement.  They break the turn cycle with a real-time experience, tracking individual ships with medals and such for accomplishments is also a nice touch.\n\n+Tooltips abound, meaning the complex mechanics can be explored and understood easily.\n\n+Ongoing patching seems to indicate developer involvement and dedication.\n\n+Diplomacy system uses trade, different weights for different groups and players, and a "tolerance" mechanic in an effective and interesting way - but see below for critiques of diplomacy.\n\nNo game is perfect, though:\n\n- UI could use improvement and efficiency, with better keyboard commands and such.  This includes things like idle planet notifications.\n\n- More and more interesting random events are needed to keep the universe outside of the AI players more alive.\n\n- Some races feel less balanced than others, in the area of advantages and ship designs.  Same with weapon designs.\n\n- Total randomness of setup can create very unfun initial game conditions, or conditions where you don't realize how much better other player's starting areas were until you're already a ways into the game.\n\n- More diplomatic options and win conditions could make this feel more like a "complete" 4x game.  The AI's tendency to want to kill you at first sight could also be watered down a wee bit, at least for the 'not genocidal' races.\n\nThis is not a complete review, just a few isolated thoughts.","May 6, 2015","true","155.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I was surprised to find that the game had changed from a real time strategy to a turn based format, although space combat still happens in real time. The turn based format does not hamper the game flow however, and Stardrive 2 is just as fun as it's predecessor in terms of a space 4X Game.\n\nPros:\n-Diplomacy system is greatly improved from SD1\n-Space combat is simple, but effective. Your ships will have multiple weapons and can engage multiple targets at the same time.\n-Ground combat is now a turn-based system, unlike SD1's "Land troops on a planet and cross your fingers" system.\n-Ship Building has been simplified but still very easy to grasp.\n-Unique missions and events featuring neautral factions keep the game interesting.\n-Interesting and diverse factions with different personalities. Factions with similar personality traits get bonuses in diplomacy.\n\nCons:\n-The game can be very hard for players not familiar with the genre.\n-The game does not tell you if a planet is sitting idle and not constructing anything. This results in lost production so it's important you keep your build queues full.\n-Less ability for automation compared to SD1. For example, you cannot tell your scouts to Auto-Explore, or your ships to defend an area.","April 13, 2015","true","24.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

In a good game, my empire doesn't get squashed 20 turns in from making first contact and it reminds me of all the good parts of Masters of Orion.\n\nBut the really sucky thing, is that there is a game stopping BUG (and I do't mean an alien bug) when your fleet destroys a large enemy fleet of small ship. A list of the destroyed small ship names appears on screen and doesn't go away. Effectively Game Over! This especially sucks because it happens when your empire is kicking ♥♥♥, a rare event.\n\nSo, overall, excluding the BUG which must be fixed, I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. And, with practice, you can learn which weapon and armor techs work best and actually kick ♥♥♥. Plus NEVER sell the good war techs your enemy doesn't have, but that is just  common sense, not a problem with the game.\n\nAs far as game management is concerned, their MUST be a central ground troops load out screen for the entire empire.

WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?!\n\nSeriously though, this game is wicked. It's a vast improvement over its predocessor.\n\nWhat I love the most about this game is that the developers have taken StarDrive (1) and gone back to the drawing board with it; keeping in the awesome and cutting out the naff.\n\nMy number one hope was that they would keep in the awesome races, MoO ship customisation and the battle screen. Done.\n\nWhat I hoped they'd take out was the Gal Civ-esque 'real-time turn-based' time progression - which was both infuriating and rubbish. Done.\n\nThe new focus on diplomacy and the ad-hoc intergalactic economy that it creates is really cool. I love that making friends with the AI is not just a pointless sideshow. If you don't play nice with them, you can't trade for those sweet sweet techs that you didn't pick in the new research tree (which is great as well) and your holla dolla generation just tanks if you stay isolationist.\n\nThat being said, the AI can 'play nice', but it's my experience that it comes down to what race you're trying to suck up to. If the race is hellbent on galactic domination and keep on asking you for tribute and gifts... OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO END UP INVADING YOU.\n\nI have had a couple of freezes on the loading screen, but honestly - it was twice in 15h of playtime, which is a damn-sight better than some games on release.\n\nI love that this game isn't an 'early access' title too. It's something that really put me off of StarDrive (1) which ended up with me only putting a few hours because of how buggy it was.\n\nI wholeheartedly look forward to where the devs take this game.

The battles are very well done as the ship fitting system. The experience levelling of ships is also very interesting, made by levels and medals that give you bonus in battle. The game is more about managing the fleet, create good fittings, managing planets and expanding. Diplomacy is quite fine and the gameplay can be very deep. The ground battle could be improved, maybe doing it a bit quicker, or make the troups auto-fighting. The core and best aspect is to me the fleet battle where you can pause the fight and study a good strategy, according to your fleet composition / fittings. Technology tree could be a bit more clear, but is still working fine. Defenetly if you liked Galactic Civilization 2, you must play Stardrive 2. I feel is a naturale improve of GC2.\n\nPro - Deep ship fittings system\n- Nice battles to watch and manage\n- Good longevity, replayable\n- Very nice system of levelling of ships, with medals according to kills/assists and Xp\n- Good map generator\n\nCon - Not 100% customizable faction\n-  Battles on ground are not so enjoable as space battles\n- Still not enough mods","April 16, 2015","true","18.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

In its own rights 4x Strategy games is about freedom and building your empire your own way but there is something different from Stardrive 2.

SD2 Combines the best parts of Moo, Moo2, Gal Civ and other 4x games. The crown jewel of Stardrive has always been the real time space combat and SD2 does not disappoint. The combat is now faster, yet with more control, more streamlined and less frustrating YET more complex with more tactical choices in battle.  Choosing the most optimal Strategic counter response to threatening enemy fleets can win or lose the game. In a recent game I designed a slow, heavily armored and shielded fleet to demolish a Vulfar massed frigate/CRV  swam only to have a another race tear my primary fleet to shreds from all the way across the battle map with long range stand off missile fleet.  SD2 has  By FAR the most engaging and fun tactical space combat in any 4x game.  -1 point for some lingering bugs/ AI issue/ things need to be fleshed out (occasional Crashes)  but with future mods an patches this game will deliver me (and any 4X fan)  years of fun.","May 28, 2015","true","62.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Please, make a full info bar for ship design. There is no info about HP, abilities (energy to engines for example), CP, and other.\n3. Why it's impossible to merge ships into the fleets? On a strategic map and in battle. Even Space Empires 5 (2006 year) can do that and more - make a preset battle formations.\n\n\n4. There is no science pics. Boring. It should be unique science pic for every science research. One pic for all research and for all 6 types (construction. biology etc.) really boring.\n5.

A wrong choice can cost you a planet in the the blink of a few turns, and random alien and pirate attacks are only slightly more dangerous than your own poor choices when it comes to colonization, research focus, and ship construciton.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game, and I why recommned it to any 4x-Space fans, is that Star Drive 2 comes closer to modeling real space colonizization (at least the way I imagine it) than any other game of this type that I've played. Despite the seemingly small number of star systems, space is big and you don't have enough ships to protect all your borders. As with other excellent military strategy games, SD2 starts you off with barely enough power to defend a single front. Overextension is as a dangerous as too little expansion. And if you designed your ships poorly, well ...\n\nBeyond the challenging strategic (and tactical! w/ ground units) military aspect, the game has a difficult, frustrating, potentially rewarding, and potentially disasterous diplomacy system. I love it. Never has a game come closer to modelling something as futile and hair-pulling as real international diplomacy. Some of the time, you can get 1/4 of what you want, and it usually comes at a cost that makes you nervous about repurcussions down the road.\n\nThe writing is funny. The tech tree is challenging, rewarding, and full of great literary and film sci-fi references that made me smile. The music is solid, and the map is pretty. Races can be customized, and difficulty can be greatly upscaled to match increased knowledge of the game's tech and combat loopholes. All of this to say, re-playability is high.\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nThis a funny, atmospheric, and surprisingly difficult game that required me to think more than most 4X games.\nOnce I stopped being mad about dying more than usual  XD  I loved it.","June 24, 2015","true","66.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Super fun, super difficult, and super addicting. The ground troops building is very confusing. They appear when you build an infantry base, but the number varies and the time to spawn or if they respawn is not obvious, still good though. However the space AI does odd things. 386 command point fleet (chukk) crossed open space on cluster map and snipe colonies. They have about 14 colonies. I have more colonies and I have about 33 command limit. Now you can build past your limit, but it is expensive so I really have no idea how they are not bankrupt. The only thing I can think of is that they don't take upkeep on their buildings or they don't pay penalties past their command limit. The devs have said that the AI doesn't cheat and I believe him, but I just can't believe something glitchy or buggy isn't happening. By the way, this is on easy difficulty as well.\n\nQuestions I would ask are, does the AI suffer attacks from random events, remnant, crystal ***holes, and pirates and do they follow the fuel rules? Is their a cheat to toggle fog of war to see how the AI is doing this, and how do I take a break from playing this amazing game without withdraw symptoms?","April 18, 2015","true","26.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

I have yet to actually crash or be unable to complete a game. Auto saves and Prebattle saves insured impact was minimized.\n\nLarge battles could use optmization, however even though things slow down, it still works, which i call a winner so far.\n\nAI clearly is able to bypass some of the limits in the game.  Fuel, CP limits, constantly nagging you for tech in diplomancy, so you can never actually build up points to ask for large, if you decline to trade you still lose points to ask for what you want later.\n\nLate game the AI does not seem to have the ship designs needed for combat against high tech ships? Seems to spam low tech instead.\n\nAs with Stardrive 1, no real late game closer.  even on tiny galaxy, 40 systems, spreading domination across the map can take hours, though you've got death fleets moving in all directions. Just turns into an exercise in OCD.  Its like tracking down coch roaches.\n\nLeaders don't actually manage, or build ques.  More then 10 coloneys there should be profiles for building things on each world.  The bigger it gets, the slower... kind of the problem.\n\nSome things in the game arn't really clear... Whats on your starbases, what zombies do, rugs?, Infected planets?, space highways how to, what guns do what and fire at what. How many things you can build on your planet??\n\nThe shipyard needs a SIMULATOR, so you can test your design.\n\nThe big black ship on the other side of the worm hole is a beast, that was fun.  But thats it?  I was sure i would get something to help me kill everyone with.\n\nThe game is either too easy, or hopeless, or just too long.  Fun is shortlived once you start wining.\n\nThe fun is really in watching your ship designs work.  I honestly believe the future of gaming is in here somewhere,  When a game lets you design the content, but we are still a long way off.\n\nLook at Reassembly, its single player, yet incorporates designs from other players into the player's experience... Seems like this would be a good idea here to apply.  The posiblities of ships and designs are more then 1 developer could ever come up with... what if the AI used valid designs from other players in its war effort?  Things they have the tech for from a pool of player made items?  You'd never know what to expect?\n\nUltimatlely I feel like this is a more finished version of Stardrive, the first game was commonly reguarded as unfinished, and as someone that put 100s of hours into the first game, I feel the game is unfinished, yet still had potential.\n\nStardrive 2 should be considered Stardrive 2.0 not a continuation of the game, but a more finished version of the first game.  It feels like the developer took what he learned from the first game, and improved on the game.  Discounting it for those that bought the first game, good call. Clearly Zero has put in a lot of work on this, and deserves a pat on the back, because this is far more then just an update on his first game, he's completely over hauled it.\n\nCombat optimization, maybe some PLayer AI assistance both in combat and in over all map control could be helpful.\n\nGround combat is my only real beef with the game, its just bad in many ways... needs to be more like fleet battles, like a RTS when it goes down. and NEVER AUTO ground combat... really just dont.\n\nConclusion...\n\nIf you like 4x, pick this game up... the art work alone is great, I honestly love the aliens.  You already know what to expect from other 4x games.  Music is pretty good... bugs sure, but the developer seems to be addressing things harder for his new baby.\n\nWhat else are you gona do?

The turn base aspect is a great improvement and it really gives you time to think.  One of the best features that I like is being evil actually has amazing benefits.  By making a race that can sacrifice people for research and money, taking the trait that allows me to assimilate other’s tech when I conquer them, then researching slavery and xeno assimilation.  Wow, I just advance up the tech tree.\n\nI can walk into a solar system with my fleets, slave the enemy planets down to 1 population, capture the planet, get two technologies, and then all along the way be sacrificing my slaves for money and tech.\nOnce I have an enemy planet, I can just start cloning the population and sacrificing them.\nMoney, technology, and power come through slavery.

This one doesn't feel very unique. It's like Galactic Civilisations 2 lite. It tries to do a bit of everything in GC2, but doesn't excel in anything.\n\nPrepare to go to war from the start of the game. There is no diplomacy in this game. AI will come knocking as soon as they meet you.\n\nThe space combat is average. Not like the first game where you can have hundreds of ships duking it out.\n\nShip design is like the first game. But your choices are simpler because you're not faced with as many units as the first game. You just have to kill whatever is in front of you before they close the distance to your ship, so mounting an array of long range rail guns and flak cannons (for point defense) = like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nThe ground assault is meh. It's like XCOM but there isn't much variety in units, gear or abilities even with full tech research. The limited amount of troops (only 4 units) permitted in ground assault is a let down. I ended up bombing from orbit rather than deal with the frustrating ground assaults.\n\nPlanetary invasions are buggy. You clear out the sector of enemy ships, but then you can't invade or bombard.

So far I am lovin it!  I found it easy to get in to and was quite impressed with the interface and game systems.  Its clean and plays well.  I like the spin on a the tech tree where you have to choose a single tech in a given category/level and can only get the others in that category/level through diplomacy or espionage.

More decisions when it comes to expansion and building.  I found that the normal 4x land grab rush may not work as well here due to various encounters and mechanics.  It can be pretty dangerous right out of the shoot even close to your home planet.  A more planned and thoughtful build/expansion strategy is required.\n\nAt the end of the day, I find the games mechanics to present many more meaningful decisions than some of the other 4x space genre fare out there.  Kudo's to the SD2 team!  Looks like you might have a winner!","April 10, 2015","true","24.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The turn base aspect is a great improvement and it really gives you time to think.  One of the best features that I like is being evil actually has amazing benefits.  By making a race that can sacrifice people for research and money, taking the trait that allows me to assimilate other’s tech when I conquer them, then researching slavery and xeno assimilation.  Wow, I just advance up the tech tree.\n\nI can walk into a solar system with my fleets, slave the enemy planets down to 1 population, capture the planet, get two technologies, and then all along the way be sacrificing my slaves for money and tech.\nOnce I have an enemy planet, I can just start cloning the population and sacrificing them.\nMoney, technology, and power come through slavery.  Other games have had the ability for you to “say you are evil”.  This game has captured the essence of being able to actually choose between what is right-“good” and what is easy – “evil”.\n\nAnd the difficulty level! Horray for a challenging 4x game that will actually destroy me the more difficult it gets.  Rather than just being a milk run, I have to think, adapt and change my strategy.  If I have picked a bad strategy, I find out fast when I lose!\n\nMOO was amazing, Space Empires V was fantastic.

This one doesn't feel very unique. It's like Galactic Civilisations 2 lite. It tries to do a bit of everything in GC2, but doesn't excel in anything.\n\nPrepare to go to war from the start of the game. There is no diplomacy in this game. AI will come knocking as soon as they meet you.\n\nThe space combat is average. Not like the first game where you can have hundreds of ships duking it out.\n\nShip design is like the first game. But your choices are simpler because you're not faced with as many units as the first game. You just have to kill whatever is in front of you before they close the distance to your ship, so mounting an array of long range rail guns and flak cannons (for point defense) = like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nThe ground assault is meh. It's like XCOM but there isn't much variety in units, gear or abilities even with full tech research. The limited amount of troops (only 4 units) permitted in ground assault is a let down. I ended up bombing from orbit rather than deal with the frustrating ground assaults.\n\nPlanetary invasions are buggy. You clear out the sector of enemy ships, but then you can't invade or bombard. The only way is to leave the system and come back and try again. Annoying.\n\nFor $20... its ok.

His politics and bargaining system is quite ingenious in preventing the typical barter everything at once exploit that no one else (of whose games I've played at least) has manged to do.\n\nCombat is pausable real-time and what you outfit your ships with and  how you use them makes a difference. Same goes for ground combat which in most other 4x is largely ignored or marginalized.\n\nModding support looks to be great (I'm not a modder but already upon release theres a good playable Star Trek mod in progress)\n\nThe only area where some other 4x games have over this is victory scenarios other than all out total conquest. Thats it. Graphics, depth, ship/hull customization, ground combat, thought out diplomacy. This game has a lot!

Depending on your starting race you have an advantage instantiously when it comes to being able to colonize planets and expand so you can sustain a larger fleet.\n2. If you pick a race that is inherintly needing a terran environment or a Human environment, good luck. I have done twenty random huge maps and in general you will only get your starting homeworld to being specific to your needs and maybe find 1 or 2 more planets that work for you. If you find more the NPC has already claimed them and is already about 10 more solar systems farther then you are.\n3. The NPC is very advanced it seems. In the first 40-50 turns I was being invaded and I know it takes 23 turns for me to build my own frigate class ships yet the NPC had 3 of these along with a command point structure of 18. I personally haven't been able to figure out how this is possible. Also the NPC had 5 colonized planets which lead me to believe that even in Normal difficulty you are handcapped and the NPC is given an advantage.\n\nI recommend this game not for the MOO2 similarities but the fact that is was a close remake of a genre of games I used to play from when I was 5-6 (MOO) all the way too now. It also tests you to see how to best start your first 20 turns and how to also judge and gadge what the NPC and what quests will help you in the long run.\n\nA definite must in my opnion is that the tutorial needs to be better for people not willing to learn by failer.  I personally find this game frustrating and find my self restarting every 2 or 3 hours of gameplay because I was to slow or I never did enough diplomacy so that I could stay with the technological curve of things.\n\nThere are many more blemishs but also postives about this game. Those were what I found to be the most annoying so if you are not willing to play through trial and error for a few hours or even maybe days until you figure out what works just for the one race you keep playing, then this game is not for you.","April 12, 2015","true","41.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's biggest flaw was its bugs and engine issues late game, and the developer team discontinuing updates due to difficulties with the Unity engine.  That said, it was still an above average game in it's genre.\n\nAlong comes StarDrive 2, offering a more traditional Turn Based approach (though it's made to progress turns rapidly until something interesting happens).  Changing some of the aspects of the first StarDrive (though keeping the excellent races, lore, ship building, and real time combat), StarDrive 2 aims to mime Master of Orion 2.  This to me, is a good thing, as MoO2 is a classic for a reason, that hasn't been remade.  If any 4X game is deserving of a modern revamp, it's MoO2.  StarDrive 2 gets a lot of things right in it's tribute, and a few wrong, but is a very solid game overall, and aims to better itself over time.\n\nStarDrive 2 does have it's share of bugs (currently), but it's developer is releasing patches on a regular basis to try and fix these, as well as rebalance passes to curb the difficulty spike (or easiness spike, depending on who you talk to) that many have experienced while playing.  So long as the team keeps at it's current rate, this will be an overall better game than the prior version.\n\nPros\n---\n+ Great ship building system\n+ Real Time Instanced Combat looks clean and is uncomplicated\n+ Follows the Master of Orion 2 template almost tick for tick\n+ Events and Quests add spice/lore\n+ Thematic, enjoyable music fitting a space empire\n+ A new addition to diplomacy that limits player abuse while keeping it interestering\n+ Unique races that each lend their own personalities (and in some cases, unique playstyles) to the game\n+ Samurai Space Bears...\n\nCons\n---\n- UI could use a few more tooltips and usability changes (ship management for example isn't overly informative)\n- Space Combat could be spiced up with more things to do / active abilities\n- Ground Combat gets tedious fairly quickly and could be spiced up as well\n- Auto-Resolve is currently terrible for both Space and Ground Combat\n- Only one victory condition (extermination)... would be nice to have some more common 4X conditions like tech, diplomacy, etc... other ways to win the game other than wiping out all your enemies (though that is fun)\n\n* Note: This is strictly a single player game, and while this has been a note of contention for some, shouldn't bias the game negatively.  That said, multiplayer would be a nice addition if another StarDrive game is made, as that is becoming fairly staple for the modern 4X genre.\n\nIn conclusion, StarDrive 2 is not without it's faults, but Zero Sum have seemed to have learned from their mistakes of the first game and have crafted a better product as a result.  While not for everyone, StarDrive 2 delivers an enjoyable experience to 4X fans that can easily keep you playing just one more turn.\n\n\nTLDR: Different than the previous game carrying the StarDrive name, but better in just about every way (unless you really liked the original being Real Time).  Modern remake of Master of Orion 2.  Real Time Space Combat, Turn Based Ground Combat, Turn Based Empire Management.  Though it still has some growing to do, it's definitely a Recommend.","April 21, 2015","true","49.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Spend the money, cuz MOO2 is back again, but now with space wolves!  Beware the purple spies.\n\nReview for those who are hardcore 4x gamers who play for the challenge:\nStardrive 2 is a phenominal game that will test your endurance, wits, and resource management skills from TURN 1.  There are a LOT of things you need to know to play this game, but if you have ever played Masters of Orion 2, you're ready to tackle this game on Normal.\nPros:\n1.  Ship design - While some games allow you a fair deal of customization, Stardrive 2 allows you nearly 98% customization of your fleet.  The only thing you can't customize is which ship 'hulls' you use, as that is determined by the race you play as.  For those of you out there who played Stardrive 1, there have even been some hulls that were removed, but the selection is more than adequate and what you can do with your ships is peerless.\n2.  Difficulty - This game is HARD.  VERY VERY hard.  I have beat Masters of Orion 2 (the game this game is effectively emmulating) countless times on the hardest difficulty.  The first playthrough I attempted in Stardrive 2, I tapped out as I had pirates, 3 races, space crystals, and the Remanent (The Antarans, if you're a MOO2er) all coming after my homeworld of Earth.  If you enjoy a TRULY dauntless and unforgiving game - this is IT.  That's not to say this game isn't beatable, but you can seriously lose this game on turn 1 if you don't know what you're doing.\n3.  Graphics - Beautiful starship battles framed in slow-mo bullet-time-esque speeds await you.  Expertly drawn and animated unique races bring you into the rich universe.\n4.  Gameplay - Everything you do is it's own task in this game - managing an intergalactic empire takes the form of many screens feeding you the information you need to make the correct decisions, star ship battles are done in a real-time strategy where you can control your AI's engagement ranges and behaviors, ground combat is done on a hex grid.\n\nThis game is definitely a must buy for you.\n\nReview for the Casual gamer:\nThis game has far too many things that aren't explained or are intuitive enough for the casual gamer.  If you're looking for a game where you just build up ships and watch them clash - this is not the game for you.  If you see the pretty starship battles and think that is the majority of the game, I'm just going to say that isn't the case.  The game will be ludacrisly difficult for you, and you will rapidly become frustrated with this title.\n\nUnless you are serious about entering the 4x genre, this title is definitely not for you.","April 13, 2015","true","34.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I bought it day one, and started playing.\n\nAs evidenced by nearly 90 hours into the game over the last week, I have been blown away. As many have noted, there's a real "hardness" level to the AI - even on easy; recent patches (which by the way, what developer do you know puts out 4 patches in 2 days, and works over a weekend?) have added a true easy mode, but I was honestly unchallanged by it - even normal mode with special events turned off felt too easy. Having a real challenge is fun - regardless (again to the folks complaining about the AI cheating) of how the AI accomplishes the challenge. I actually have to design ships specifically to take out each race's ships - its pretty neat in my mind that I can tool up a bunch of ships with long range weapons, shred the enemy, and then get owned by the next group because I don't have enough point defense and they have tons of carriers with swarms of hundreds of fighters.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding; the game is filled with easter eggs to various Sci-Fi tropes; almost to the point I'm afriad some annoying lawyer will pop up and sue Zero. Some of them are aboslutely hysterical - such as the human fighter pilot hero.\n\nSound is good; the real time battles are fun and engaging, and tactics really do matter.\n\nThere's some bugs in Stardrive 2, but I'm confident Zero will get rid of them, and I also believe he will update and improve the already outstanding game over the next 6 months. I'm looking forward to modding it and doing some neat things.\n\nMy final comment on StarDrive 2 is this - it is the kind of game that makes me say "5 more minutes", and in my mind, the best compliment a game can be payed is the "5 more minutes" feeling - its the halmark of a great game.\n\nThere are many games out there that cost 50 bucks and are nowhere near as fun, enjoyable, technically sound, and replayable.

I have to admit I was leery of the new turn based system but in the scheme of things it makes sense and it's a welcomed addition.\n\nCurrently I've restarted the campaign 3 times as I wrap my head around some of the new mechanics and because my poor human civilization was blasted to death by alien scum - which means either I'm terrible at this game or it's hard, which is awesome!.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, especially the way space combat looks, the planets are all awesome looking as well, the new hex system and fresh.\n\nThe mechanics of researching and building your fleet is pretty much the same as SD1, which is a good thing.\n\nSpace combat is enjoyable and satisfying, nice big explosions and a slow motion mode too! One gripe I have in space combat is that weapons don't lead targets, they aim at where the target was, not at its expected position. Missiles don't turn to intercept targets instead they make weird turns trying to catch up to it... it all feels very unnatural and I hope it's addressed in a patch.\n\nWhen it comes to planet colonization, the variety of planets is massive making the whole experience of picking and choosing where you want to focus the new seeds of your civilization as engaging as it is important.\n\nI like the way they've handled the freighters. Moving food and colonists around really saves us from a lot of the needless planetary micro from SD1. However freighters are not controllable, combine that with the smaller fleet caps and it makes it difficult to protect freighters when your main fleet is off attacking or exploring, they will literally fly directly at an enemy and suicide themselves. We should be able to control freighters, either directly or give us the ability to force them to dock at the nearest planet until the enemy fleet is taken care of.\n\nFleet Caps: I really don't see the point of fleet caps. Since each ship has an upkeep cost which in itself is the fleet cap, to compound that with an additional cap to me seems redundant. I like the idea of the fleet cap but instead of having it give you a monetary penalty, it might be more interesting if it gave you a penalty to ships rearm and repair rate, maybe even a damage dealing reduction to ships. Reasoning being they just aren't receiving the maintenance they should.\n\nGround combat. The research and upgrades aspect of it is well thought out and implemented however the actual ground combat is meek, it needs a re-tune. If it would have followed in the footsteps of Fallout 2 or X-COM it would have been amazing! But currently, weapons have a hard limit of minimum and maximum ranges,\n\nCovert Ops: Works similar to the first one, but different enough to be fresh, that being said I think it needs a re-tune. I have 5 spy's doing counter espionage which is the max and I'm still getting tech stolen from me every few turns, which is really quite frustrating. Perhaps remove the spy caps for home defense?\n\nSpatial anomalies, these are quite fun and new, really enjoying them so far and is a very welcomed addition.\n\nInterface: interface is well designed, lots of tooltips and the information is easy to understand and readily available in most circumstances. A few gripes I have, on the planetary screen, when cycling from planet to planet via the arrows - every time you click to go to a different planet, the arrows location move to a slightly different spot, making cycling planets in this way annoying, and dizzying. If a fleet is hovering over a planet, the planet under the fleet becomes un clickable, there's also a few other minor annoyances that needs that little bit extra polish.\n\nOverall, StarDrive2 is an engaging experience and I will surely play many more hours of it as I attempt to conquer the universe however as much as I like it, it's not quite there yet. everything seems 70-80%. It just needs one more good thick coat of polish to make this game really shine","April 10, 2015","true","37.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I think it could use some scaling back on how challenging it is right out of the gate. There have been some minor changes to the ship design that are a tiny bit irritating (like that you can't dictate your firing arcs of your weapons other than upgrade the arcs to be larger) .  The ground combat can be clunky at times.\n\nNow having said that:  The game is a BLAST to play. I’m having so much fun with it.  There are a TON of scifi references to discover. The ship combat while still not 'perfect' is organic and you can win or lose a battle based on some micro managing tactics.  (which is nice) .  I'm having a ton of fun and have mitigated some of the difficulties by playing on easy mode and reducing the galactic threats.\n\nAnyone who enjoys Space 4x games should enjoy this.\n\nChallenging but fun.\n\n\nAdded:  The game isn't really difficult persay.  It just has some wonky pacing that one some play thrus will pit you against (non AI ) random opponents that most games wouldn't have you encountering until mid or late game.","April 10, 2015","true","99.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

But what i still see every time on the bad reviews are "this game is early access and sucks, dont buy it its buggy and doesnt work." well im sorry if you count stopping at 97% at the loading screen a bug to make this game not worth buying. i even modded the game with star trek and star wars mods and they work fine. saddly thanks to the new update the moddles dont have any texture to them, but they still work everytime i play with them.\n\nOn another not, this game was made by 1 man, not a huge team of people, 1 single person. you have to give him credit for what he is doing on his own.

There are not even space or ground skirmishes against other players (at least as of 1.0c). This is a pure Singleplayer vs AI game. If you want Multiplayer strategy, that princess is in another castle.\n\nFor the rest, it takes some of the best concepts of other (indy) games. The game plays on 3 areas: Galactic, Space Combat, Ground Combat\n\nGalactic:\nIs turn based on a 2D map.\nThe colonisation and colony building closest resembles Civilisation for me. Other liken it to Master of Orion, but I have not playe that series. It focuses more on few, well developed colonies with the right buildings.\nIt borrows planetary effects and random events/miniquests from Galactic Civilsiations.\nYou can freely pick you fleets destiantion (no squars/hexes), but fuel greatly limits range outside of your territory.\n\nDiplomacy has two unique turns:\n1. The evaluation mechanic is open, with the game actually telling you leader personalities and the weighted values of diplomacy items.\n2. The tollerancy mechanic means you cannot simply ignore negative relation modifiers or past deeds of the AI. Your people are a factor too and just won't allow certan deals to happen.\n\nResearch:\nYou can only research one tech per "Tier" giving you some hard choices and you have to aquire the others via espionage or diplomacy.\n\nSpace combat:\nIs realtime on a 2D map. It closest resembles space empires for me.\nIt seems to focus more on decisive, large scale battles rather then skirmishes.\nShip design is also seems heavily borrowed from SE, but simplified. Facings matter. There is few geartypes/hulls and almost no levels, but there are lots of modifiers (1-4) you can apply to nearly every item.\nUpgrading and retrofitting is seamless.\n\nGround:\nTurn based on a isometic, square based map.\nBattles are fought by small elite teams or "boarding parties" rather then large armies.\nTroops can have up to 3 abilities (active and passive, with cooldown or without) and based on technology and events you can almost freely choose thier gear while at a planet.\nThere is no boarding outside of events.\n\nDocumentation:\nThere a lots of tooltips and spoken/interactive toutorials.\nTech descriptions for new ship modules are often quite vague wich can result in picking the wrong tech.","April 11, 2015","true","131.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Sure, there are features you'll miss if you played SD1, but SD2 offers so many other gems instead! I got completely hooked, the "just one more turn" addiciton is right there. I have to admit: I started the game on easy after having read some reviews regarding the hellish degree of difficulty. On easy, it's fine. For a first play through, it's still challenging, but certainly not unfair.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game and highly recommend it, if you are into not overly complicated 4x games.

The scale and diversity of the gameplay is fantastic. The integration of space battles, land battles, stragegic play, creativity, DESIGN! diplomacy, both realtime and turnbased aspects is something from a gamers dreams. The fact that this is mostly one mans creating is mindblowing. Stardrive is mechancially more ambitious than AAA games like civilization finding a perfect ballance of deep mechanics but simplistic and easey to undersand delivery. Here are some examples of thigs the game encompasas: optomizing planets for specific puposes (food, production and science mainly) which gives them strategic value adding to the turnbased strategic play. Engaging in diplomacy and espionoge to try to give yourself an advantage over the other free-for-all combatants in the galactic rat race to the top. Taking the information you learned to design ships that help you to win the real time battles. Control of space allows you to transport your  troops safely to take the enemies planets in turn based tactical battles. Now that you have a planet we are back to the beginning although ingame you can have at a hundred systems with nine races to do this all at once with. So cool, soo much fun.\nA few things worth noting:\nThe AI is pritty good not terrible!!! unlike other  AAA strategy games which is a huge pluse\nThe diplomacy is really well done and ballance except on brutal difficulty where it is supposed to be hard\nThe facty one person made this sometime shows with minor graphical buggs inconvienances like things on top of each other\nThe ground battles are not super fun and easily the weakpoint but still not terrible or even without stragety just not geat, I suggest using auto rezolve as there is little point to many of the battles where one force is 3 times the strength of the other, however I have had some tense battles that were importand and I was trying my hardest to win against poor ods.\nLoad screens can be slow and performance although improved is not amazing, of course that is in battles with thousands of units I was able to run this on my gpu-less laptop\nBuggs happen but not too much.\nThere is a learning cuve and you will loose some games which is a good thing. I think some people get angry with this game because they don't understand this kind of strategy well enough and perceve the game as unbeatable or think the AI cheats like crazy. (In this type of game, difficuly has to be added in the form of better AI start locations, More units at start and lots of modifiers to their economies).\n\nIn conclusion this is so worth the money if you have any interest in any kind of strategy or 4X games. It is challanging in many ways but fairer than many strategy games. Designing ships is soo cool and addicting and the realtime battles where you get to put them to the test with your own skill commanding is just and amazing gaming expeience. The ground battles are the weakpoint but can be dealt with with bombing and then autoresloving the boring ones. My number one complaint is that there is no multiplayer not because the AI is bad my any means but because the gtame is soo enticing to my strategic side and creates such epic situations that I want to have that experience in a free-for-all galactic war with my friends.","July 2, 2015","true","174.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I played for about 100 hours and enjoyed the game thoroughly.  It may not be as grand as some 4x's but it is well made and worth what I paid.  As of today the developer is still active and fixing some of bugs in sporadic patches.  He apparently is working on new DLC or version.  I didn't seem to encounter or notice any bugs in my gameplay hours.  I had no crashes, just the program slowing some as I conquired every planet in the galaxy.\n\nI played the humans during my play, other alien races are available and will be encountered and negotated and fought with.  The gameplay is not complex but has similiar depth to the old master of orion series.  Space combat is real-time that can be paused.  Ground combat is representative and turn based.  Difficulty can be selected from easy on up.  There is minor races to conquer and you can, if you wish, enslave other alien races to speed population growth and production.\n\nThe game captured enough complexity and depth of gameplay to hold my interest (not the easiest task since I own hundreds of steam games)....researching that next beam weapon or device to bombard the enemy planets with.  Perhaps, building new ships variants which are more powerful and faster.  Something always kept me engaged.  Ignore the board trolls, for some reason this particular steam board was inundated with them? Most have had nonsensical arguments or some wacky agenda now that I've actually played and seen the product for myself.\n\nI would recommend giving this title a try for anything under $20 US dollars.","December 13, 2015","true","87.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

After 127 hours I definitely haven't explored the entire game, but I do feel like I've exhausted most of the appeal. Hopefully they'll fix a few of the things below and then it will be even more awesome.\n\n***Things I've liked about it***\n\nYou can customize your ships by placing individual components onto the hull at different locations, and you have to consider the cost, power, weight, size, and hitpoints of different systems. Not all the components are the same size/shape, either, so designing a ship is a lot of fun.\n\nIn battle, ships acceleration matters - you can't accelerate to maximum speed instantaneously and can't turn immediately either.\n\nThere are many styles of weapon - beam weapons with essentially infinite speed (but still limited range), artillery with long range but no guidance after they're launched, and rockets with good range that home on enemits, plus many, many other weapons and/or variants.\n\nGround combat is interesting and doesn't feel contrived - there are lots of different weapons, and the units have actual coordinates during ground combat, allowing for more strategy.\n\nYou can customize your race at the beginning based on whether you want to boost research, production, combat, and lots of other things. Each race also has a few race-specific technologies and/or abilities that can't be customized and add a little more flavor.\n\nThe tech tree is interesting because there are several branches that are independent. Also, each branch has tiers of three technologies where you can only research one of those three technologies before moving on to the next tier. This leaves you to get it from another race (by trade, extortion, spying, or assimilation), or to live without it.\n\n***Things I don't like about it***\n\nThe battle arena prepares you for a much harder game than this actually is. Once you design a sufficiently good ship to win the battle arena, that ship is probably roughly 12 times as powerful as another AI ship of similar cost, and then the normal game gets pretty easy (you can build no military, wait for them to declare war on you, and then quickly build a ship to wipe out their entire fleet by the time they arrive). The way that I'd like this to be fixed would be for the AI to more clearly pay attention to the kinds of ships that it knows/expects that you have, and to build ships designed to beat those ships. I'd also like for it to design slightly better ships in the first place.\n\nStarDrive 2 has the same problem as lots of empire-building games where as your empire grows, it takes more time to micromanage all of it if you feel that urge. Unfortunately, if you don't assign a planet to build anything then it doesn't build anything, and the game doesn't remind you that some planets aren't building anything. There are notifications when a planet finishes building its latest building, but sometimes those notifications dissapear if other things are happening in that turn too. The way I'd like this to be fixed is first for the turn to not allow ending if planets are idle, and second to allow the user to set a default build order that planets follow if they have no planet-specific orders.\n\nThe AI doesn't know how to evaluate the ships that I build. When I try to autoresolve a battle, the AI is much more likely to favor the opponent than if I were to actually fight the battle. That's understantable, but it's unfortunate when combined with a bug where in some battles (perhaps 2%), if you click to fight the battle then there never appears the button to actually start the battle, and the game is then stuck. Usually this can be fixed if I reload the game from a save, but not always.\n\nWhen forming a team for ground combat (which is a lot of fun (unlike what I expected); good job guys!), sometimes characters will be designated as starting the battle with fewer than their maximum hitpoints. This can be reproduced if you have two preset loadouts, one having the Bone Weave attribute and one without it. The steps are 1. Restore the character's equipment from one preset loadout. 2. Restore the character's equipment from the next preset loadout. 3. Toggle the presence of the Bone Weave attribute by clicking manually. Note that now the character's starting hitpoints has adjusted by 20 (positive or negative depending on which way around the loop you went). It looks like someone else noticed this at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=422949843 and was even able to make a unit whose starting hitpoints was negative (presumably by going around the loop three times)\n\nThe zooming could be a bit smoother - I wish that the zoom would spend less time animating and instead would adjust more quickly.\n\nSometimes colony ships will get stuck on the strategy map and won't respect orders to colonize the planet that they are at, but if you tell them to move away from the planet and move back to that planet then they are willing to colonize it.\n\nThe AI's don't have as good of an alignment between their diplomatic goals and strategic goals as I'd like them to have. Mostly it feels weird that they tell you upfront how much they value each technology, but they don't adjust their valuations based on circumstances. I've been able to give some unimportant economic technology to an enemy who was about to take one or two of my four planets in exchange for a peace treaty that bought me more than enough time to build up a much bigger army. The AI diplomacy doesn't really bother me that much since it's a very hard problem, but it's still another opportunity for improvement.\n\nIn some special-mission ground combat battles (but none of the important planet-taking or planet-defending ones - don't worry) , the zoom prevents the leftmost column of squares from being visible, so I can't select my units and therefore can't fight :(","July 10, 2015","true","172.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Is it perfect?  Well no, but it still gave me several dozen hours of fun (and the developer intends to support the game further).\n\nThe game's biggest flaw is that as it stands (and this is intended to change eventually) there are only two victory conditions (one official, one secret that says you won when you beat a final boss encounter).  Diplomacy as it stands cannot be used to form long lasting alliances and the end goal is always conquest.  The player can mentally set their own goals, such as controlling and containing all threats, or getting friendly with as many other civilizations as possible, but there are no built-in alternate victory conditions yet, and the ability to win by forming an alliance would add another facet to the game.\n\nThe ground combat has a very mixed reaction.  Personally I like it, but I can see why some do not.  The developer does want to improve this eventually.\n\nJust like the first game, ship building is a huge aspect of the game's fun.  To summarize, I think it's a really good game but focuses a bit too much on the aggressive side of 4x play, but as I said the developer is accepting feedback and does want to fix that.  I do not feel an imperfect situation is enough for me to give a negative review.\n\nAs far as how the game looks and feels, for the most part I think it feels quite well done.

While I was a huge fan of Stardrive, the sequel just rings hollow.\n\nThe first title was born of Steam Early Access, and gave the developer a large swath of suggestions, criticism, and feedback during its cycle. The developer would later make it pretty clear that he wasn't terribly fond of getting feedback during development, that there were too many voices in his first game and chose to develop Stardrive 2 behind closed doors.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the result of a developer and his hubris stuck in an echo chamber. There's no one to point out flaws in design, resulting in poor decisions being reinforced as good ones inside one's own head, where they become entrenched.\n\nShip design is still good, but not quite as dynamic as SD1. There's far less freedom to build.  Faction customization is expanded. The tech tree is improved, but still not great and leader missions are fun the first time, but grow stale.\n\nOutside of that, everything just falls flat. Ground combat is half-baked. Colony management interface is poor. The AI leaves a lot to be desired in both strategic and tactical combat (mathematical advantages are applied to make up for it). Diplomacy is even less useful. The move to a turn-based strategy map has taken away the immediacy of naval engagements.\n\nEven with all the bugs, which I can forgive, this culminates into the two most damning critiques of this game:\n* The game is shallow and has no spirit.\n* It's flat out boring.","June 27, 2015","false","133.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

SD2 is likely to become my favorite 4x game. I enjoyed playing SD1, but this is a whole new level.\nMy impressions:\n- Turn-based strategic mode is far better than "real-time" SD1. Everyhting is kinda easier to manage.\n- Art is beautiful.\n- Random stuff that you can explore if you don't feel like exterminating the galaxy ATM.\n- Ground combat: well, frankly specking I didn't like the way it was implemented. It seems to be another game of singificantly lower quality unfortunately. But the game has an option to autoresolve, so that's not a major issue.\n- Difficulty. Don't take me wrong, I like when the game is a challenge, but the difficulty here is nearly absurd. I started on easy level to learn game mechanics (though already being familiar with the game thorught videos) and the enemies kicked my ♥♥♥ almost immediately. I did almost okay in the second game, but still this is a bit ridiculous: easy should not be hardcore. Things here go significantly more difficult than in playthroughs of beta (with quite reasonable balance).\n- Space combat and ship design is awesome. Just nothing more to say here, great job. Just a small issue with selection (sometimes selector doesn't respond to mouse) and inability to set the engagement range for several ships at once.\n- Diplomacy is transparent, as promised. But I hate the moment when some guys want some of your techs, want to trade, but their tolerance to you isn't enough to take anything of the same value from them. And after I dismiss the deal they become angry that I refused to trade with them. What a nuisance... Hope that will be fixed, because it really spoils your diplomacy.\n- Game runs smooth. I remember late-game lag of SD1 and I was afraid to find the same problem here. But no, everything is fine.\n\nI encountered some bugs in the first release, but Zero fixed them in a couple of hours after the report. Some minor issues exist, but they are rare. Had to reload the game once because build queue went crazy and also found the remnants stuck because their wormhole dissapeared. Nothing serious so far.\nSo, 9/10 from me.","April 10, 2015","true","100.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You have full control, but a lot of tedius micro is done for you by the fraighter system.\n-The research tree presents you with hard choices, but doesn't mean you can never have the things you don't research.\n-The planets have several characteristics that make for more hard choices when colonising.  You might desperately need an outpost for your war, but all the planets in that system are small and toxic.

Apart from the similarities to MOOII it's ship design system is easily the best of any game I've seen so far yet. Ground combat is dealt with in a style similar to XCOM, sometimes I like it, other times I don't. Its good for the away team themed 'events' but lacks realism for planetary invasion.\n\nThe strategic layer and ground combat are turn based with ship combat being realtime. Ship combat needs a minimum of input generally your main input is to dictate which ships should focus on broadsides or frontal volleys. Really you should be able to default this in the design screen. You can micromanage as much as you like but I prefer to click begin and watch my ships crush the opposition. Speaking of which the workshop has already started to pump out ship models of the classic sci-fi races with the inclusion of the Federation fleet.\n\nThere are so many nods to the SciFi genre in this game. Especially in the achievements and in the tech tree. The game is a unabashed celebration of science fiction.\n\nThis may be my favourite 4x yet. It has some issues (see cons) but I'm hopeful they'll fix them soon.\n\nPro's:\nShip design\nSciFi geek out\nMOOII\nGood AI opponent's\nExcellent plot / event scripting\n\nCon's:\nNeeds AI planetary governors\nNeeds auto colonise or 'Send Colony Ship' option on the Planets screen\nA 2x or 4x speed would be nice in ship combat.\nGround combat doesn't feel right in planetary combat.","April 13, 2015","true","49.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The turn breakdown helps me keep track of everything and manage my empire more effectively. All the old familiar faces are back, plus one new race. To be honest I hoped there would be more and a little more variety in the AI personalities, so far everyone just wants to go to war with me.\n\nI like the inclusion of extra events going on in space, it's just hard to go and investigate some of the phenomena I encounter when everyone around me wants to go to war.\n\nThere are some bugs though. Mostly sound bugs and they'll destroy your eardrums if you're not careful! I have my audio set at 4 freaking percent and the music played when I discover a new technology could wake the dead!

If you have played it you will feel instantly at home with how colony building and allocating population works, switching them between farmers, workers and scientists.\n\nPlanets themselves come from several types, from Toxic wasteland to Gaia type planets and asteroid fields which can hold different amounts of population, which can be upgraded with technology. Tech tree itself is set so you have several fields to pick from and you can only pick one, leaving the other two to be obtained other ways, namely diplomacy and spying.\n\nDiplomacy itself gives you "point" limit with determines how much you can do with other races which increases as you do deals with the race. Eventually allowing you to do treaties such as non agression pact and alliance. Unfortunately AI and limited amount of victory conditions ingame undermine diplomacy a bit and sooner or later (usually sooner, due aggressive AI). You will end up fighting with the AI, which especially at harder difficulties can be brutal. On my playhtoughs I saw AI wield sneak attack fleet that was larger than my entire fleet.\n\nSpace combat itself is a mix original Master of Orion 2 and rts, you equip your ships with different equipment and then command them in real time view which for the most part works smoothly but one of games issues is that it does not have reinforcement system, so with larger battles your computer can slow down to a crawl. Once you win space battle it's time to bring in the ground troops, which too can be equipped and heroes to be hired who can directly help you with ground combat.\n\nGround combat itself is turn based system bit like X-Com except much simpler where you command your troops and your mechs until one side gets killed, problem with ground combat is AI is bit stupid and it can be easily exploited, I had same squad of 6 timid warriors (they receive penalty to hitpoints) and I was still able to eliminate most of enemy fights without losing single soldier due AI being poor at ground combat. It really needs to use it's special abilities and formations better.\n\nLategame when your empire starts to expand on several starsystems and you have lots of colonies one of games biggest issues start to shine, there is no way to have manager for colonies which would build stuff based on your preferences, so you end up changing build orders a LOT, even when you have them queued it gets tedious and you really wish for some kind of governor system.\n\nOverall good game that could use some polish, especially quality of life improvements.","April 16, 2015","true","27.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackdragon74/recommended/252450/","blackdragon74","black_dragon74","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackdragon74/","166 products in account","Stardrive 2 is an unapologetic Master of Orion clone that seeks to stay true to the classic standard of space 4X games. Besides a great number of direct references (Kulrathi? Really?) mechanics, buildings, and technologies taken directly from Master of Orion 2, there are more subtle parallels such as the occasional menace of the "Masters", which appears from sudden and inexplicable rifts to harass you for no apparent reason and give you problems in case you're not busy fighting anybody.\nAnd surprisingly, it stacks up pretty well. The array of different races are colorful and the differences between them are substantial. The space combat is fun, and expansion requires difficult and meaningful choices.\nTwo areas in which Stardrive surpasses Orion is in ship design and diplomacy. When making ships, you don't just decide on modules and heap them onto a ship until some arbitrary "mass limit" is reached. Rather, ships each have a footprint, and modules - which include everything from weapons to engines to less obviously useful "capacitors" take up space, energy, and have mass, which slows the ship down. There are a lot of implications resulting from this, but the simplest is that you can choose to focus on speed, defense, or firepower without having specific technologies specifically suited to each area. Just pile on more armor, more engines, or bigger guns. Diplomacy is quite streamlined, with each offer being given a straight value that needs to be matched or exceeded for the deal to go through. Meanwhile, a species "tolerance level" keeps you from making very large deals, which is a very interesting and thoughtful cap on inter-empire trading.\nOther areas in Stardrive 2 fall a bit short of their promise. Ground combat consists of a clunky lineup of a handful of soldiers in simple, turn-based combat, and it's quite hard to imagine such small and low-octane encounters deciding the ownership of entire planets. The technology tree also seems a bit stunted, and could use a few tiers that only offer one technology to research; some very important technologies simply should be acquired as a matter of course, such as battleships and terraforming. Nobody would seriously give up a larger ship footprint for a larger starbase or improved armor plating. It's also strange that there's only one ship footprint for each ship size, which changes from species to species. It's hardly unthinkable that ships built for different purposes would have different basic frames, but we have to settle for simply filling them with different modules. Also missing from Stardrive is a government system; all races apparently have the same system of managing their empires, modified by their species. Finally, BUGS. Lots of bugs. And not in the sense of an insectoid, hive-mind species (curiously, the Klackons didn't make it into this MOO clone). Things like ships suddenly taking on the appearance of other species' ships, fleets vanishing, sometimes being unable to name new ship designs, and - my favorite - being assaulted by an enemy race and then being given control of their troopers while the computer controls my soldiers. None of them are game-breaking, but you're not going to get through the game without finding a few of your own.\nThere are a lot of other things that could have simply used MORE. The planet types are stripped straight from MOO (toxic, radiated, barren, desert, all the way to gaia) with no interesting new alien-ish worlds on offer. There are neat little mini-quests and mysterious objects in space to explore, but they're exactly the same from game to game and quickly run out. Space combat is a lot of fun, but ships could use more tactical settings other than "frontal attack/broadside" and "sit in place/move". There's an engagement zone setting, but the blasted thing resets from encounter to encounter, so if you have a preferred setting (plasma cannons are infamously useless at long range) you have to reset it in each new combat. And as far as I can tell, there are no sudden galactic events that affect all players equally, such as space monsters or subspace shutdowns. A missed opportunity.\nThat said, Stardrive 2 is still a great game, and stacks up to its ancestor admirably. But I'll be looking ahead to StarDrive 3 (and hope that in that respect it is NOT like Master of Orion).","May 31, 2015","true","70.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

AS it stands, making Stardrive 2 into an equivalent of "Total War in Space" was probably the best idea, yest you can't reinforce fleets in battle anymore but at least the game kept it's staple of real time combat scenarios to help it stand out.\n\nMy only major compaints with the game are as follows: the lack of victory conditions and no sandbox ship editor. There's no turn limit (at least not that I've found) and no other way to win excepyt total military conquest. I'd like to see a return of the "ascendence" victory from the first Stardrive as well as diplomatic or science based victory options. As for the second, I want to be able to experiment with ship designs freely outside the game and, most importantly, figure out wxactly what layouts each of ships for each race have, I want to say I love that each races' ship has a unique style and design to it that is more than just aesthetics but even with that I can't help but wonder how it will affect my ship designing when I can't figure out ahead of time which ship layout I prefer.\n\nOnly get this game if you understand what you're walking into, it plays Total War in Space and I love total war, this isn't quite it but it's the best attempt I've yet seen. Is this the best game since "master of orion 2" in the 4X sapce genre... well I can't say. The overall space based gameplay is msotly the same between each series but I will say I much prefer the real time space combat over the turn based space combat I've seen in every other Master of Orion successor. And kudos to finding a way to make "creative" both overpowered but hideously difficult to use, it's still the best trait in the game though and it almsot triples your research speed, I just with the penalty and bonus limits were higher or adjustable iun single player","May 6, 2015","true","61.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What would be nice would be some more depth to the history of the races and the galaxy itself, add to the immersion of the game.\n\n* Not a fan of the ship design UI, feels very clunky and doesn't really match the feel of the rest of the game, some people might like tediously placing 1 tile at a time when making their ship designs but its basically lego on an established blueprint. The whole system could be completely redone in my opinion. *hint hint, MOO2's design screen worked well*. Also with regards to upgrading/refitting/redesigning ships if they stick to the clunky model, have a way to sort weapons and equipment by technology level and stats.\n\n* More depth for your *not Antaran* incursion race, and fix the dimensional portal.

After 127 hours I definitely haven't explored the entire game, but I do feel like I've exhausted most of the appeal. Hopefully they'll fix a few of the things below and then it will be even more awesome.\n\n***Things I've liked about it***\n\nYou can customize your ships by placing individual components onto the hull at different locations, and you have to consider the cost, power, weight, size, and hitpoints of different systems. Not all the components are the same size/shape, either, so designing a ship is a lot of fun.\n\nIn battle, ships acceleration matters - you can't accelerate to maximum speed instantaneously and can't turn immediately either.\n\nThere are many styles of weapon - beam weapons with essentially infinite speed (but still limited range), artillery with long range but no guidance after they're launched, and rockets with good range that home on enemits, plus many, many other weapons and/or variants.\n\nGround combat is interesting and doesn't feel contrived - there are lots of different weapons, and the units have actual coordinates during ground combat, allowing for more strategy.\n\nYou can customize your race at the beginning based on whether you want to boost research, production, combat, and lots of other things. Each race also has a few race-specific technologies and/or abilities that can't be customized and add a little more flavor.\n\nThe tech tree is interesting because there are several branches that are independent. Also, each branch has tiers of three technologies where you can only research one of those three technologies before moving on to the next tier. This leaves you to get it from another race (by trade, extortion, spying, or assimilation), or to live without it.\n\n***Things I don't like about it***\n\nThe battle arena prepares you for a much harder game than this actually is. Once you design a sufficiently good ship to win the battle arena, that ship is probably roughly 12 times as powerful as another AI ship of similar cost, and then the normal game gets pretty easy (you can build no military, wait for them to declare war on you, and then quickly build a ship to wipe out their entire fleet by the time they arrive). The way that I'd like this to be fixed would be for the AI to more clearly pay attention to the kinds of ships that it knows/expects that you have, and to build ships designed to beat those ships. I'd also like for it to design slightly better ships in the first place.\n\nStarDrive 2 has the same problem as lots of empire-building games where as your empire grows, it takes more time to micromanage all of it if you feel that urge. Unfortunately, if you don't assign a planet to build anything then it doesn't build anything, and the game doesn't remind you that some planets aren't building anything. There are notifications when a planet finishes building its latest building, but sometimes those notifications dissapear if other things are happening in that turn too. The way I'd like this to be fixed is first for the turn to not allow ending if planets are idle, and second to allow the user to set a default build order that planets follow if they have no planet-specific orders.\n\nThe AI doesn't know how to evaluate the ships that I build. When I try to autoresolve a battle, the AI is much more likely to favor the opponent than if I were to actually fight the battle. That's understantable, but it's unfortunate when combined with a bug where in some battles (perhaps 2%), if you click to fight the battle then there never appears the button to actually start the battle, and the game is then stuck. Usually this can be fixed if I reload the game from a save, but not always.\n\nWhen forming a team for ground combat (which is a lot of fun (unlike what I expected); good job guys!), sometimes characters will be designated as starting the battle with fewer than their maximum hitpoints. This can be reproduced if you have two preset loadouts, one having the Bone Weave attribute and one without it. The steps are 1. Restore the character's equipment from one preset loadout. 2. Restore the character's equipment from the next preset loadout. 3. Toggle the presence of the Bone Weave attribute by clicking manually. Note that now the character's starting hitpoints has adjusted by 20 (positive or negative depending on which way around the loop you went). It looks like someone else noticed this at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=422949843 and was even able to make a unit whose starting hitpoints was negative (presumably by going around the loop three times)\n\nThe zooming could be a bit smoother - I wish that the zoom would spend less time animating and instead would adjust more quickly.\n\nSometimes colony ships will get stuck on the strategy map and won't respect orders to colonize the planet that they are at, but if you tell them to move away from the planet and move back to that planet then they are willing to colonize it.\n\nThe AI's don't have as good of an alignment between their diplomatic goals and strategic goals as I'd like them to have. Mostly it feels weird that they tell you upfront how much they value each technology, but they don't adjust their valuations based on circumstances. I've been able to give some unimportant economic technology to an enemy who was about to take one or two of my four planets in exchange for a peace treaty that bought me more than enough time to build up a much bigger army. The AI diplomacy doesn't really bother me that much since it's a very hard problem, but it's still another opportunity for improvement.\n\nIn some special-mission ground combat battles (but none of the important planet-taking or planet-defending ones - don't worry) , the zoom prevents the leftmost column of squares from being visible, so I can't select my units and therefore can't fight :(","July 10, 2015","true","172.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Is it perfect?  Well no, but it still gave me several dozen hours of fun (and the developer intends to support the game further).\n\nThe game's biggest flaw is that as it stands (and this is intended to change eventually) there are only two victory conditions (one official, one secret that says you won when you beat a final boss encounter).  Diplomacy as it stands cannot be used to form long lasting alliances and the end goal is always conquest.  The player can mentally set their own goals, such as controlling and containing all threats, or getting friendly with as many other civilizations as possible, but there are no built-in alternate victory conditions yet, and the ability to win by forming an alliance would add another facet to the game.\n\nThe ground combat has a very mixed reaction.  Personally I like it, but I can see why some do not.  The developer does want to improve this eventually.\n\nJust like the first game, ship building is a huge aspect of the game's fun.  To summarize, I think it's a really good game but focuses a bit too much on the aggressive side of 4x play, but as I said the developer is accepting feedback and does want to fix that.  I do not feel an imperfect situation is enough for me to give a negative review.\n\nAs far as how the game looks and feels, for the most part I think it feels quite well done.  Perhaps my play time speaks for itself.  My stance is if I put this much time into the game, how could I at least not recommend it?","July 16, 2015","true","75.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

While I was a huge fan of Stardrive, the sequel just rings hollow.\n\nThe first title was born of Steam Early Access, and gave the developer a large swath of suggestions, criticism, and feedback during its cycle. The developer would later make it pretty clear that he wasn't terribly fond of getting feedback during development, that there were too many voices in his first game and chose to develop Stardrive 2 behind closed doors.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the result of a developer and his hubris stuck in an echo chamber. There's no one to point out flaws in design, resulting in poor decisions being reinforced as good ones inside one's own head, where they become entrenched.\n\nShip design is still good, but not quite as dynamic as SD1. There's far less freedom to build.  Faction customization is expanded. The tech tree is improved, but still not great and leader missions are fun the first time, but grow stale.\n\nOutside of that, everything just falls flat. Ground combat is half-baked. Colony management interface is poor. The AI leaves a lot to be desired in both strategic and tactical combat (mathematical advantages are applied to make up for it). Diplomacy is even less useful. The move to a turn-based strategy map has taken away the immediacy of naval engagements.\n\nEven with all the bugs, which I can forgive, this culminates into the two most damning critiques of this game:\n* The game is shallow and has no spirit.\n* It's flat out boring.","June 27, 2015","false","133.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are peripheral areas of the game which feel rushed or unpolished, not for lack of effort as I understand it, but lack of manpower. Unlike SD, the mechanics and overall gameplay is SOLID. I liked SD but there are segements of that game which were flawed.\n\nDiplomacy is much more responsive and worthwhile in SD 2. The different factions in StarDrive have a lot of character and its something you actually want to engage in.\n\nNot feeling the need to slow down time to a crawl in order to micromanage every detail of a star-spanning empire, is great. While I miss combat actually happening on the stategy map, turn-based allowed the rather spartan and unwieldy management aspects of the game to flower.\n\nIt can almost go without saying that StarDrive's defining aspect; ship design and combat have been developed, honed and polished to outshine any other 4X. It moved ahead in leaps and bounds, and it is fun, fun, fun. The are more options and everything is really slick. On top of that, there are special technologies and components you acquire outside of the actual scientific tree through various means. Some are stellar, others feel gimicky - which isn't a bad thing. The only addition I don't like is the proto-molecule device which is underwhelming - not because it underperforms, but because it is pretty superflous and there is a sizable build-up to actually getting it. Also because the mechanics which underpin it are perhaps the one weak point in SD2's fleet combat\n\nIt highlights the one real complaint I have with shipboard weaponry in the game. Ships can carry massive Subspace Artillery and Mass Drivers which by any yardstick should be able to get the job of bombarding a planet done. Instead ships have to carry a seperate arsenal of otherwise useless weapons, which take up precious space, in order pummel planets into submission. It is extremely arbitrary, especially one one considers that tactical and strategic nukes are available form the very start of the game - long before any sort of ground-based counter is available. A doom fleet in orbit, armed to the teeth with kinetic weaponry and only able to 'blockade' is a sorry spectacle. Maintaining planetary defenses on more than a few planets seems prohibitively expensive, even of it wasn't useless because most of the AI strategy is based around landing troops anyway.\n\nAt times playing on defensive boils down to playing wack-a-mole with invasions fleets amongst your holdings. That will probably be alleviated somewhat by wormhole junction forts and other defensive options in the 'Sector Zero' DLC.\n\nPlanetery invasions were unwieldly (in capital letters) in SD1, and while massive focus has obviously been put into tactical ground combat in StarDrive 2, it feels tacted on and doesn't really add much to the experience at this point in time.\n\nOverall though, the game is fun which is to say that what it does well, it does really well. The feature set it touts is there and it is solid. It is the little things where this game looses ground. I dwell on the little things a lot, but that is nitpicking. This game deserves a much better rating then it has.\n\n","January 8","true","113.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are not even space or ground skirmishes against other players (at least as of 1.0c). This is a pure Singleplayer vs AI game. If you want Multiplayer strategy, that princess is in another castle.\n\nFor the rest, it takes some of the best concepts of other (indy) games. The game plays on 3 areas: Galactic, Space Combat, Ground Combat\n\nGalactic:\nIs turn based on a 2D map.\nThe colonisation and colony building closest resembles Civilisation for me. Other liken it to Master of Orion, but I have not playe that series. It focuses more on few, well developed colonies with the right buildings.\nIt borrows planetary effects and random events/miniquests from Galactic Civilsiations.\nYou can freely pick you fleets destiantion (no squars/hexes), but fuel greatly limits range outside of your territory.\n\nDiplomacy has two unique turns:\n1. The evaluation mechanic is open, with the game actually telling you leader personalities and the weighted values of diplomacy items.\n2. The tollerancy mechanic means you cannot simply ignore negative relation modifiers or past deeds of the AI. Your people are a factor too and just won't allow certan deals to happen.\n\nResearch:\nYou can only research one tech per "Tier" giving you some hard choices and you have to aquire the others via espionage or diplomacy.\n\nSpace combat:\nIs realtime on a 2D map. It closest resembles space empires for me.\nIt seems to focus more on decisive, large scale battles rather then skirmishes.\nShip design is also seems heavily borrowed from SE, but simplified. Facings matter. There is few geartypes/hulls and almost no levels, but there are lots of modifiers (1-4) you can apply to nearly every item.\nUpgrading and retrofitting is seamless.\n\nGround:\nTurn based on a isometic, square based map.\nBattles are fought by small elite teams or "boarding parties" rather then large armies.\nTroops can have up to 3 abilities (active and passive, with cooldown or without) and based on technology and events you can almost freely choose thier gear while at a planet.\nThere is no boarding outside of events.\n\nDocumentation:\nThere a lots of tooltips and spoken/interactive toutorials.\nTech descriptions for new ship modules are often quite vague wich can result in picking the wrong tech.","April 11, 2015","true","131.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This is the game you will like if you prefer MOO2. Research and colony management is about the same. Strategic map and ship movement is similar.

If you have 4 of them, having additional advantages.\n\nProblems I have seen:\n\n1) If you play it again, start to be boring.\nBuild the largest ships always and win all battles\n\n2) Diplomacy\nTolerance is very low, since all races are in war with you\nPractically permanent war, this game is just about simply wipe out all other races\nIrrational diplomacy management, very week races go to war with you then sit and wait to be killed\n\n3) Spies\nVery slow progress\nBut expensive upkeep\n\n4) Construction ship\nSubspace Projector accelerate the ship not too much, need to build many projectors in a row or what?\n\n5) Ground combat\nHuge potential in this piece but space for improvement.\nHard to discriminate between soldiers hit points…overlapping\nSimple moves\nDumb AI\nCannot build walls or trenches or fort\nAll weapons and shields, etc. are available since the beginning…you can win with the basic set\nWeapons you can research worse than the original ones (until research the rocket launcher)\nHealing of ground troops....how?\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game but can see opportunities to improve it.","May 3, 2015","true","149.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The minimum requirements for a 4X game are there, and what's there is well done.  But there are several eyebrow-raising things, such as the inclusion of a tactical ground combat minigame.  It's not a terrible minigame, but it isn't very fun.  It's pretty boring.  You just move your guys and click "fire".  The interface is pretty poor and even a fairly simple encounter is very tedious and long.  It feels like a projhect they gave the junior programmer, or like a senior project for someone in game school.  It oculd have easily been left out, and shoudl have been in favor of more polish on the main game.  There are just.... oddities.  Missing stuff.  There seems to be no way, for example, to see how you're doing in relation to other empires.  The AI is fairly weak.  There are basically zero options beyond screen resolution and audio.  It could genertally use a really indepth round of interface enhancement.  But overall, a pretty good effort.

AS it stands, making Stardrive 2 into an equivalent of "Total War in Space" was probably the best idea, yest you can't reinforce fleets in battle anymore but at least the game kept it's staple of real time combat scenarios to help it stand out.\n\nMy only major compaints with the game are as follows: the lack of victory conditions and no sandbox ship editor. There's no turn limit (at least not that I've found) and no other way to win excepyt total military conquest. I'd like to see a return of the "ascendence" victory from the first Stardrive as well as diplomatic or science based victory options. As for the second, I want to be able to experiment with ship designs freely outside the game and, most importantly, figure out wxactly what layouts each of ships for each race have, I want to say I love that each races' ship has a unique style and design to it that is more than just aesthetics but even with that I can't help but wonder how it will affect my ship designing when I can't figure out ahead of time which ship layout I prefer.\n\nOnly get this game if you understand what you're walking into, it plays Total War in Space and I love total war, this isn't quite it but it's the best attempt I've yet seen. Is this the best game since "master of orion 2" in the 4X sapce genre... well I can't say. The overall space based gameplay is msotly the same between each series but I will say I much prefer the real time space combat over the turn based space combat I've seen in every other Master of Orion successor. And kudos to finding a way to make "creative" both overpowered but hideously difficult to use, it's still the best trait in the game though and it almsot triples your research speed, I just with the penalty and bonus limits were higher or adjustable iun single player","May 6, 2015","true","61.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What would be nice would be some more depth to the history of the races and the galaxy itself, add to the immersion of the game.\n\n* Not a fan of the ship design UI, feels very clunky and doesn't really match the feel of the rest of the game, some people might like tediously placing 1 tile at a time when making their ship designs but its basically lego on an established blueprint. The whole system could be completely redone in my opinion. *hint hint, MOO2's design screen worked well*. Also with regards to upgrading/refitting/redesigning ships if they stick to the clunky model, have a way to sort weapons and equipment by technology level and stats.\n\n* More depth for your *not Antaran* incursion race, and fix the dimensional portal. It's bugged three times now in my games and cannot access it even though it says "go explore it".\n\n* More race traits and customisation options.\n\n* More anomalies and galactic events, as well as more unique planetary anamolies.\n\nThe game is really good, and it has a huge amount of potential.

I played for about 100 hours and enjoyed the game thoroughly.  It may not be as grand as some 4x's but it is well made and worth what I paid.  As of today the developer is still active and fixing some of bugs in sporadic patches.  He apparently is working on new DLC or version.  I didn't seem to encounter or notice any bugs in my gameplay hours.  I had no crashes, just the program slowing some as I conquired every planet in the galaxy.\n\nI played the humans during my play, other alien races are available and will be encountered and negotated and fought with.  The gameplay is not complex but has similiar depth to the old master of orion series.  Space combat is real-time that can be paused.  Ground combat is representative and turn based.  Difficulty can be selected from easy on up.  There is minor races to conquer and you can, if you wish, enslave other alien races to speed population growth and production.\n\nThe game captured enough complexity and depth of gameplay to hold my interest (not the easiest task since I own hundreds of steam games)....researching that next beam weapon or device to bombard the enemy planets with.  Perhaps, building new ships variants which are more powerful and faster.  Something always kept me engaged.  Ignore the board trolls, for some reason this particular steam board was inundated with them?

Can't negotiate or forbid military access/ expansion.\nInconsistent difficulty. First few games can be incredibly difficult (powerful neutral factions)\nFactions need proper battleship and titan designs and should be able to field them more regularly.\nFinicky controls. Difficulty splitting fleets on the campaign map. Releasing and targeting fighters is a pain.\nSome technologies become completely redundant and on repeated playthroughs aren't worth taking (speed bonuses/command point research for example).\nLand battles are unbalanced. AI needs to be taught how to upgrade and use their ground forces better.\nNo victory conditions aside from domination. Superweapons/ faction specific uber technologies would be cool. Instead of a deathray, what about a victory condition tied to the remnants?\n\nHonestly though these aren't real significant detractors.

It was, for lack of a better term, a masterpiece. The graphics were worse than the modern game FTL, but at the time that was the standard. And in this game, that didn't matter: You were the commander of a space empire with distinct characteristics. You designed spaceships, sent them into battle, researched exciting new technologies, and negotiated with other empires for exchange of goods, technologies and money.\n\nThe Good: Stardrive II is a modern reinvention of that game. It does nothing to reinvent the 4X genre, but the execution is the closest thing to the old Masters of Orion II that any game has in recent history. Trust me, I've played them all. This game gets some things brilliantly right, however: Turns play out at a pace you set, either calculated and one at a time, or mash the turn button and let it run for a few turns. Space combat is semi-real time, while ground combat is turn based. Outside of certain scenarios, they are also auto-calculable, which is nice at times-- Battle can feel slowly paced, and skipping it can be appealing.\n\nThe Bad: The game is also riddled with bugs and poor interface decisions. Hero's skills, like "Bloodthirsty," which allows a hero to gain passive governing bonuses for every enemy defeated in ground combat, doesn't work at all. Loot, which gives you bonus BC (money) doesn't either. Occaisional crashes happen, and the game doesn't support multi-monitors or borderless windows. Ground combat is also tedious, and it can be easy to make an uncorrectable mistake that costs you a battle due to the poor interface.\n\nMOO Fans will enjoy the fact that most of the old species play style can be recreated, despite certain traits not being present in the default characteristics. Creativity, for example, allows you to research every technology in a tier, just like MOO2 Psilons-- but requires taking a lot of negative traits to achieve, like low gravity homeworld.\n\nI can't say that this game will be appealing to a newer audience. But if you loved MOO2, you'll love Stardrive 2.","May 20, 2015","true","50.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Perhaps that was true at one point - I didn't start playing until after the Sector Zero expansion - but I've had zero problems.\n\nThis game is basically a homage to, and close to a copy of, Master of Orion 2.  From what I'm hearing it's certainly closer then the 'new' MoO.  There are things I may wish the developers did differently, but I've not run into any bugs or anything that suggests the game is not stable.

Yes AI is hard, you just have to switch up your play style you normaly play with as the creator knows how the average person plays. The creators of this game seem to be doing their best to help everyone. I found it hard like crazy the first 4 goes at it. Then it became simple. You just have to understand the game, how it works how it makes money. Do not listen to everyone writing this, this game will keep you on your toes and it makes you want to finish the game and wipe out the other races as they made you mad and sacrifice them all. I use to just play and play and play with other games like I am god or something with other games, this one you are just one of the races out for a fight. The game is fun, the battles are fun, you just have to understand it. You think you are ahead in this game and you are a god again and everything is easy then BAM.....very engaging. Been a while sense I had some fun, not  becuase I can lose, but a I can win, just have to do things differently and you can not seem to keep to one play style. I am now going to play on normal. Just make sure you create good ships. This game is great so far no bugs nothing, which is more then I can say for the first one they made. People like to just sit back and relax and play, and I understand being a God of a game is fun to, also can be boring eventually. I will go back to easy if I want to play a God way.\n\n\n\n\nafter playing this game it became easy and there is no love in it, no diplomnacy. I played allot of hours on this game and ya I will play it as it is fun to some point. I want to give this game a 5 out of a 10. There  is no love. Everyone is rabit dogs and everyone wants to kill you. The first one you cound get them to join you and your empire and be friends with someone, gain access to their stuff and build with their ships. This one wipe everyone out and kill everything and eveveryone is rabit mad dogs. It si fun to a point as everyone hates you and it is a challenge. But there is no allies no, diplomacy, just kill everyone. That is why I changed it. If you like to just kill everything and this is a empire game and love it there is no allies or anything. Then this game is a great game if you like the loner stuff. The first one was great in the area you could ally and get them to join. This game is great do not get me wrong great graphics, game plays somewhat good had some glitchs nothing bad bad....but the war war war war war war war, just gets so boring. The game is by the way easy once you get to understand it. I would go to hard mode as it is to easy for me, but there si no love in this game and it bores me.\n\nThey seem to keep changing it to make it better so I am now going to give it a better update. The AI is not as crazy with somethings anymore. They are still nuts and will hate you, but the game can be really fun. I do enjoy the battles. So I will now give it a 7 out of 10. I still wish there was Allys in this game it would make it a perfect game for me anyway. The thing is in order to make this game easy, you have to get a ultra rich astroid as your 3rd capture or collony and make sure you max it out quick with people.  If you have that with 2 planets the game is easy. Astroid can dish out a army quick. The comptuer is a ♥♥♥♥♥ with land battles(thank God) so they can never defeat you just make sure you have troops there. Store up a army and then fight. From the get go I had 2 people declair war, I had really no army. They came and tried to take over my place, If found my astroid, built a army quick and then kicked their butt. The game is easy so far, has some moments that it is hard. But follow that adivse and of course learn to make a good ship and always pick the subtarian trait, so you can have that 3 person in the astroid, production powerhouse, but that is up to you. I find missle ships are the best in the biginning with some decent counter measures for missles.  You will rule the space if you have all crusiers for a time  Do not listen to the people the game easy I have only played on normal so, I am not sure about the other lvls. the AI is crazy though, they just hate you...kinda do not like that but it is fun.","April 11, 2015","true","163.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a shame you cannot colonize moons, gas giants, or even stars. What what am I talking about? Well the moon part should be very easy to understand Ganymede is larger than Mars and if it wasn't orbiting Jupiter, it would be another planet in our Solar System between Mars and Venus in size. Titan, Europa, Triton, Calisto, and Io are also moons of relative planetary likeness. I know adding in "EVERYTHING" would be an impossible task, but you could at least extend to eight planet bodies with at most 4 moons. Although moonlets like Phobos could also be considered but for decoration since it would addup too much clutter. So you can have additional "moons," but you they would just be for show, like what you currently have for moons.\n\nWhat I would consider is something like Endless Space but instead of solar systems, you click on a planet it will pop up that particular planet with its moons (the ones you can colonize) right after the planetary entity.\n\nhttp://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/21/20976/EndlessSpace-2012-05-05-22-51-52-96.jpg.jpeg - Like this, just with the first entity on the left being either a gas giant or a large planet like entity and its most likely to colonize moons.\n\nYou can click on each celestial body and it will pop up into your planetary management window that you would currently experience with StarDrive 2.\n\nThis also means you might need to modify the govenment management tab so that you can easily list moons with planets. Since this is quite a lot, you should also be able to have automation with a little more focus on what you can do to modify how your governors behave. Sort of like a gambit system from FFXII (Final Fantasy XII), build, if not build, then trade or maximize on science. You can do the same with fleet admirals as well. This is very similar to what you can already experience in Distant Worlds.\n\nThis way when you decide to colonize say Titan, you send a colony ship to Saturn and it will pop up a menu in which you can look Saturn and its moons.\n\nColonizing a Gas Giant is something more practical after you develop matter alteration technology, although you should be able to mine it before colonize it. Similar you should be able to mine Asteroids and worlds without an atmosphere before you can colonize it. Mining should allow you to gain resources, thus increase income and gain access to valuable resources, but you won't be able to build anything or have a thriving population until you colonize it. This could be done with a constructor.\n\nEventually you should be able to colonize a star, but this is done in steps after you have the technology to colonize a gas giant, starting with Brown Dwarfs, then Red Dwarfs, then Average Stars, then Giant Stars, then White Dwarfs, then Supergiants, and then Neutron Stars.\n\nWhat is this technology. Well you can create floating population centers similar to the one in Star Wars Episode V. This also means there should be different types of gas giants. Helium, Hydrogen, Methane and Oxygen types. Hydrogen is easiest to synthesize, making it the easiest to colonize when you got the right tech. Helium is difficult, but offers an easier abundance of Helium-3. Methane types also offer valuable resources and oxygen types are more practical for environmental residences, because you already have air you can breathe, well with minimal adjustments considered of course.\n\nAs for Stars, we are talking about a dyson sphere. Take everything concerning a gas giant and just multiple your gains a hundred fold at least.\n\nYou also need those sorts of anomalies you can mine like in Galactic Civilization 3. Antimatter is easier to acquire from a black hole and that needs to be a resource you should acquire. I suggest looking at Distant Worlds, Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations 3 to see what types of resources should be considered as strategic for certain uses necessary in the game.","April 11","true","77.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although a bit of a questionable move, I can understand why the developer has chosen to go this route.\n\nThe DLC makes the game much more fun, the addition of the hex tiles means sensor range is more sensible now and the construction ships offer an additional gameplay mechanic with more resources to control. The new ground combat is much better and more suitable for 4X games.\n\nPlease don't be put off by the learning curve, even on normal it will take a few games of getting your ♥♥♥ wiped on the floor by the AI before you learn how to take them on. What's great is that everyone will develop their own strategy naturally.\n\nMy one gripe is the AI. Now I like diplomacy in 4X games but you HAVE to keep in mind that the AI is also trying to win and there can only be one winner. As soon as the AI thinks you're weak, they will take advantage. My advice is to avoid AI until you can defend yourself but be warned, from mid-game onwards the AI will produce fleets that will literrally take up the whole screen before the battle starts, so build a fleet you think will be of adequate size, then make it tenfold.\n\nAlso, try not to use the default ships as they're a bit lacklustre, make sure you take the time to experiment in building your own ships.\n\nEnjoy!","May 16","true","40.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But i can understand that one man sturio can't afford to have so resource intensive thing as functioning multiplayer. All effort was used to make Single player experience as good as possible.

But it had quite a few problems too, so I was a bit skeptical in how the sequel would be.\n\nI was however positively surprised! This game addresses nearly all my issues I had with the first title. The presentation, and game flow feels far better this time around.\n\nIt does however still have a few random bugs every now and then, even if none of them game breaking it can be slightly annoying. Besides that, the game itself runs smooth, and the turn changes are near instant. The prequel had a tendency to become near unplayable at higher difficulties due to performance drops, as the enemies would clog the galaxy with endless fleet battles. I think the new instanced battle system is an improvement from the old one in that regard ( no late game lag anymore ).\n\nAs for the people complaining about the AI “cheating” in some reviews – I see no proof of this, and I have no trouble personally keeping up with the AI at medium and hard difficulties ( currently halfway into a game on hard as Vulfen, with me owning 1/4th of the galaxy ) . The game however does have bit of a learning curve, and the AI is quite aggressive for some races. Expect to die a few times before you learn the ropes.  ( when to expand, what to research first, figuring out what ship designs to make etc )\n\nI for one like the AI this time around, it feels more clever than before. Although I’d guess a “Beginner” difficulty setting wouldn’t be a bad thing though, to let new players get to learn the game at a slower pace. (I might write a beginner guide sometime )\n\nI don’t really have a lot more to say. The gameplay is fun, the races varied, and the artwork is neat. If you like x4 games, and don’t mind a challenge. This is a solid indie buy and I would recommend it to my friends.\n","April 10, 2015","true","46.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

No matter how hard I try. Game has numerous problems that really hurt the experience and generally it is quite unpolished.\n\nThing that ticks me off most are the ridiculous "random" event raids and attacks. Yeah, they aren't random at all and if you were planning to try pacifist playthrough I got some bad news for you. Every time you encounter your first race you soon get these warhawks with 2 options, either declare war on newfound race or get attacked by a considerably large fleet. So you either build war fleet or build war fleet, great and diverse options. Then there are these crystal things coming after your butt constantly, as well as remnant wormholes popping left and right. Wanna guess how well your diplomatic approach works on these buggers? Not very well. You can either have no random raids at all, ever. Or you can have them every single time in same order forcing you to have large fleets ready no matter what playstyle you would want to use. Would be nice to have some options to the mandatory fights.\n\nDiplomacy is quite literally worthless for anything else than getting more tech, many of the races are hyper aggressive and will just demand tributes and send their fleets after you anyway. Tolerance is unpolished feature and will simply hinder any attempts to do meaningful trades. You can't ask other races for example to freaking bugger off from your space as they fly all the way over your area and colonise a planet right in the middle of your solar system when you have 5 battleships orbiting the damn thing waiting your own colony ship 1 turn away to get there.\n\nSo, what we have at this point is pretty much a turn based space combat game. Now you might wonder if that at least is amazing... well no, not at all. Battles are boring to play and watch, and auto battle doesn't know anything about how the battles would actually turn out making you lose about 4 times as much fleet. Modules are horribly balanced too, fighter bays seem to be the be-all-end-all module and bunch of carriers will just wreck the AI every single time (also wrecks your performance and freezes the game for a while after every battle). Ground combat isn't any better, it's just slow and boring and auto battle again will just lose you troops for no reason.\n\nTech tree is just plain bad and some of the choices make no sense at all to exclude another. Got fusion shields? Great. Now you might want fusion engines? Too bad.\n\nUI is bad with many features needing unnecessary clicking and scrolling around with relevant information not being where it needs to be. Like the empire overview, why can't it have X/X population numbers?\n\nTurns are annoyingly short and you will find yourself mashing spacebar more than your keyboard can handle.\n\nI guess the ship building is cool though... that's about only nice thing I can think of, although UI makes even this much worse experience than what it needs to be.\n\nI hope this game gets some serious patching, that might well be what makes this game worth your time.","April 12, 2015","false","12.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

But be warned...there are some bugs to be aware of.  I only encountered 2 bugs, but they were rather game breaking, and I hope I'm the only one who is encountering them, though I doubt it.  Read the rest of this review and other reviews before you buy, and you'll probably want to buy this on sale, like I did, though if you have the original SD you already have a 33% discount(I waited for an even better deal).\n\nPros-\nIn depth ship customization\ngood diplomacy\nfun battles\ngreat empire building\ncustomize your own race\n\nCons-\nThe game will crash if you don't auto-resolve battles with too many ships, as it will crash upon trying to load casualty lists\nIf you auto-resolve even larger battles, the casualty list will cover your screen, causing you to be unable to do anything.  AT ALL\nThe auto-resolve is bad...though it is also pretty much the same in other games.  I played out a battle, won without losing more than half a dozen small ships, crashed trying to load casualty list, auto-resolved, lost my whole fleet, and the casualty list from THAT covered the center of my screen and made it so that I couldn't click on anything and I could only use hotkeys and had to alt+tab and close out the game\n\nConclusion-\nFun overall, but it has some game breaking bugs, and is poorly optimized.  Judging from past experience, I'm not sure whether or not Zero will even optimize the game or finish bugfixing...he abandoned the original Stardrive long before it was done, and moved onto this project.

My god. I'm not saying it's a difficult game. I'm just saying that Dark Souls is like Kirby's Epic Yarn in comparison to this game. That said - once you realise that you need to play it smart and stop thinking in terms of this being a 4X game - the game becomes really interesting.\n\nThe only way to win is to take an intimate interest in your empire's stats. Like some kind of super micro managing mother. Use all the tools you are given to carve out a bloody path for your empire to success, because otherwise someone else will carve a bloody and desperate path right through your face.\n\nPros:\nThe UI is buttload better than most of the other space strategy games out there. It's not great. It's just better than most, which I call a pro.\n\nThe management of the planets and ships makes sense. I've yet to go "Oh. I wish I could do that."\n\nCustomising the loadout of your ships both works great and is absolutely vital to victory. Because only you know what kind of ship you need for what kind of scenario. Need a pure tank to absorb the initial attack and then a bunch of fighters slam into the enemy dealing the real damage? You gotta make it happen yourself. And you can. And it's awesome.\n\nCons:\nThe tutorial. I sort of didn't want to put it as a con, because it's not bad compared to other space strategy games. But it's still narration. "Do this, this happens." That said - it's short, to the point and gives you the important stuff. As someone who never pays attention to tutorials, this one worked well enough to get me into it.\n\nThe difficulty is a bit odd. On the lowest difficulty I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me. This was until I started customising my ships, but even so. The lowest difficult is supposed to be a "try this button and see what it does." kind of affair, not "you want easy? You can't handle easy. Here, have some insanity."\n\nOverall - if you want a challenge, and a good space empire game, I say grab this one.","April 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

I do seriously lament the lack of multiplayer, which is not yet present here either, but to be honest, for now I'm quite happy to play SD2 by itself, which is weird for me because I'm very MP oriented.\n\nI really thought I would miss the contunous play aspect of SD1, but to my surprise the instanced fleet action gives a bigger sense of scale than was present in SD1, which for me, at least for now, makes up for the smaller map sizes. This is much more a spirtual successor to MoO2, with proper characters, events, and buffs/penalties. The graphics are excellent and it runs quite smoothly on my, admitedly powerful, laptop. There are some minor bugs that i've come across, but no deal  breaks and I've no doubt that Zer0 is working hard to fix whatever crops up.\n\nI was fortunate to get the SD1 discount, so this worked out to be slightly more expensive than a trip to the movies, and there is no doubt in my mind I will get more than 2 hours of solid enjoyment out of it.

Ignore them.  These people are terrible at strategy games.  I won my first game on easy, which, while challenging at the beginning when I had no idea what to do, quickly lived up to its name.  As I write this, I'm currently blazing through my first normal game as a cybernetic civilization where I basically wasted my first 60 turns doing jack squat.  If this game is too hard for you, go play baby's first tbs, the garbage known as Civilization V.\n\nThat being said, I was originally wary of this game.  StarDrive 1 was a bundle of broken promises and not a very good game, and made me wary of anything with an 'early access' label on it.  To this day I'm still annoyed at just what 'could have been' if the game had ever actually been finished.  I was never going to buy this game, but I saw that it had gone from real time to turn based and talked to a few people with decent amounts of played time, and decided to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  It is a good game.  Not a spiritual successor to MOO2, but it comes bloody close.  With a little more work and polish (or even a single, well made expansion pack) this could be the game moo fans have been waiting for.\n\nJust remember this -  mass drivers.  Mass drivers everywhere.\n\nPros:\nThe space variant of 'roaming barbarians' are actually more than a minor irritant early game, and can wipe out entire fleets if you don't pay attention.\nAI is much better than it was in 1.\nTechs are much more fleshed out than in 1.\nMass Drivers.\nThe diplomacy menu and tech trading is way better, ala galactic civilizations 2.  You can see what they'll accept and how much more you can push it.\n\nCons:\nStill too few techs, doesn't feel involved.\nAI could be better.  They'll declare war on you for over expansion when you have an empire and a fleet twice as big and nasty as their own.  It's also far too easy to get them to leave you alone.  Throw them a few techs and they'll back off even if they have a clear advantage.\nAside from a few standard lines, the AI chatter quickly becomes dull.  The 'humor' seems forced at a few points.\nThe GNN.\nNot as many ship types, weapons are either worthless or overpowered, with no inbetween.\nThe "traits" for various species need more work.  There needs to be more variety that and more traits that actually mean something.\nTolerance is a bit hard to figure out, keep in mind I've only played for over a dozen hours though, so this is a mechanic I might just not have grasped fully yet.","April 12, 2015","true","47.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

If you like things like empire management, designing ships, tech trees(not quite a tech tree but something better imo), and some good old real time tactical spaceship combat then this game might be for you. There's just one thing you might want to consider before buying it. Do you like a challenging game that has a lot of depth that is hard to learn and hard to master?\n\nAt first I found the game very frustrating. The first half a dozen games I played ended in utter failure. In my first couple of games the AI got a huge lead and dominated me. I did better in the next two and managed to compete with  and beat some of the AI empires but one still got a lead in the end and beat me. The last two I was doing well and it looked like I was going to come out on top but I ended up making a huge mistake and it ended up setting me back enough that I lost. I'm on my seventh try right now and I think I might actualy win this one though I'm not certain as I suffered a fairly big set back before I decided to turn in for the night.\n\nA lot of peopel would be upset by this kind of experience and I can understand why. It's very frustrating to be beaten so badly and wonder how things could have gone so wrong. It can feel down right oppressive and if you don't enjoy a challenge then it is certianly overwhelming, but the thing that has made it all worth it to me and the reason I am recommending this game is because I'm getting better each time I play and I'm enjoying more each time I play too. The game has a lot of depth and I've only scratched the surface so far but each time I play I understand more about how the game works. I'm not confused as to why I lost so badly in my first couple play throughs now. I now understand the mistakes I made and I won't be making them again.\n\nThe game is not easy to learn and that is going to scare a lot of people away but it's very rewarding for the persistent. If you play this game you are probably going to lose pretty badly on your first games and that's a tough sell for most people. However, if you stick with it and keep playing you will find enjoyment in this game and won't regret the purchase.","April 12, 2015","true","85.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I've been playing as the opteris( cybernetic bugs, passion to expand and destroy everything in their way) and I've restarted probably about 8 times now.\n\nthe first mistake I made was ship design, trying to cram good weapons into frigates and make as many of them as possible. its simply not practical since the AI somehow created a fleet of 400( yes, FOUR HUNDRED) frigates and were about to wipe me off the face of the galaxy.\n\nat first i thought this game really did cheat the AI into being a ship building superpower, raining death on everything like others say. I ws going to shelf this game for good,  but then i started playing in the battle arena, and realised its all down to how you design your ships! now after many attempts at starting an empire and failing, I am on my way to completely eradicating the squid people, all thanks to about 5 ships designed by me, tearing through these masses of enemy fleets!\n\nso if you are thinking of buying this game, I would get the idea of amassing a huge force out of your head and binning it. stardrive 2 runs on brilliant  ship design, trial and error, and understanding how to create as few fleet killing ships as possible, rather than a massive armada to do your bidding.\n\nso if you enjoy a challenge, love an in depth design system full of a hundred different weapons/ systems to choose from, and won't cry when the odds are against you, buy this game. I've had great fun playing the game so far and will be playing around in the shipyard a lot more!\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","36.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Firstly this game does what other space strategy games get wrong.  It has real time space battles that are fully controled by the player with really awesome spaceships to fight with.  The artwork in the game is great fun to look at and even though i like a more serious tone to my games the design of the races are fun and badass at the same time.  The game has a sort of humour intermixed with some serious lore.  The idea of cycles of destuction with the races of the galaxy destroying each other each cycle.  Theres also fun side quests that pop up every so often with crystal ships, ancient black cruisers appearing from insects, space worms and of course space pirates.\n\nHowever there are some problems,  like the races are a little overly psychotic and are not interested in deplomacy like other games.  It can go from a promising start to instant war just from discovering your existence.  Some races also have way too much power and shoud be nerfed slightly.  Theres a couple of bugs and battles can run a little slowly if alot is happening.\n\nBut for all of the problems their is still alot of patching and tweaking here and there so im sure itll get better.  In my opinion if you want to wait it out fine but id recommend picking it up cus man you will not regret it.","April 13, 2015","true","25.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

However I did get it and... surprise! Had so far some great time with fun and lots of adrenaline. A mixture of ingredients from other similar games that even reminded MOO but with original components as well.\n\nBut honestly for some reason I find it difficult to make a sort of “traditional” review because there are many issues and aspects to put down on the ground. So I will choose a rather unconventional method of approach...\n\nStardrive 2 is definitely not like an expensive gourmet restaurant ala card menu. Neither is ma's or granny's good old dish. It is like a neighborhood canteen junk Food! But a very tasty one, addictive, full of fat, crunchy and juicy, spicy with lots of exotic stuff inside it.\n\nNow if you are the kind of person that likes variety in food styles then go for it. But if you are the “snub” kind of a character that likes healthy food and especially sensual delicate pleasures in taste, than i should tell you to stay away from it. But I won't. And yet for this to happen the devs must in the fist place prove that the game will soon get to it's promising potentials making some improvements, developments even changes as well.\n\nJust really hope to see this things happening in future updates because this game can really become a hit.\n\nBon appetite!\n\nP.S And one thing to start with improvements, among others, is just changing the ridiculous ground battle mode where it doesn't fit the general grand strategy idea(!) where in some level the game flirts with.","October 4, 2015","true","84.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I loved stardrive one, it was easilly my favorite game durring that period and I sank hours into it.  When I heard that they were making a StarDrive 2, I thought it was going to be a money grab.  I was a little dissapointed.  I am glad to say that I was pleasently wrong.\n\nLooking at StarDrive 2 on its own merrits, I enjoy it a lot. To me the best part of the game is the customizable ships.  While some parts are more simple then Stardrive 1's but it works.  What they did with the randomish quests and story elements really reminds me of playing Masters of Orion Two with a updated UI and real time space battles.  I would recomend this game to people that are a fan of space combat games or Masters of Orion.

The dev for this game treats it like a baby and listens to the people, its had some manjor bugs in it but it was patched the day right after, most bugs were squashed, also I have found out Daniel (the Dev) is doing modding tutorials to help people mod his game after they asked him to make it moddble as possible (Star Trek, Star Wars anything space related)\nPros:\n1. Muther F***ing Space Bears\n2. Muther F***ing Space wolfs\n3. Module ship building design (make your ships how you want them you want your battle ship to have only armor with no weapons then let it be you crazy f**k)\n4.Its a 4X game that works\n5.Interesting/ awesome art design (space bears!!!!)\n7.Cool 3D enviroment battles, ships will go over and under each other to get an advantge.\n8.Skill level system, ships gain veterency and improve their aim and flying skills.\n9.Land battles this one is a bit of meh, Its Xcom based gameplay I love, the skills are only very interesting too!\n10.Name everything! Name your ships! name your planets, name your race and choose different trait  for them like better ship builders (20% faster at building ships) or have replusive as a trait (making them ugly as ♥♥♥♥!) and no one wants to be your friend!\n11. Leaders, you get an abundance of leaders to pick! some of which are jokes from star wars or futurama. (you can get zapp brannigan as a space leader!)\n12.The music, omg the music its amazing, I just can't believe how nice it is, its  like Frank Klepacki did the music for this game like Star wars Empire at war, its just ♥♥♥♥ing great! You can really feel the atmostphere for the game.\n\nCons:\n1.High diffculty\n2.Land battle AI is pretty dum.\n3.Need better skills for ships. (maybe skills from modules)\n4.Need more space encounters like some kind of awesome rebellion.

As a hardcore fan of MOO1 and to a lesser extent MOO2, SD2 is about as MOO2 as it can be done without calling it MOO2. Basically everything is same but with improved engine.\n\nI will recommend this game on the grounds that it's basically MOO2 in new clothing. However potential buyers should be aware that game have issues and glitches. Most infuriating are big battles. If you go into batle with hundred of ships in both fleets, game (battle) is guaranteed to crash at the end.\n\nWhat I would love to see is to expand the universe even further. 100 star systems max is not exactly ground breaking, many other 4X have thousands, so building massive empire is not exactly possible. One of the problems of SD2 is that you bump into other races far too quickly (at least IMHO). And tech tree is rather primitive (same system like MOO2).\n\nTo sum up: If you want to play newer version of MOO2 (without DOS or W95) go ahead, but be advised because of the bugs you may get very frustrated on more than one occasion.","September 5, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I played SD1 and it had some interesting ideas but also had some big flaws that made it hard to enjoy playing for very long.  There seemed to be some changes in this version so I tried it out.  Long story short, while it has some nice bits the pieces do not fit together well at all.  Some UI elements that you have to use every truen are tedious to access.  Many turns, nothing happens.  The AI is poor and only excells at massively cheating up units.  I experienced multiple crashes and lock-ups in the later game and late game fights were slooooooooow.  And this is a super minor thing but the background 'spaceship' sound effect is not controlled by the audio sliders in game, so I had to turn off all sound from the game to keep it from making my head hurt after a while.\n\nThe wrost part is some aspects are less good than the first one.  Such as the ship combat and ship design, both of which I think are more simplified to the point that they are just busy work.  The ground combat got an upgrade but it is still tedious.\n\nI doubt I will play any more games of this.  It was not expensive, but still not worth the time invested for a game that feels half baked.","April 24, 2015","false","22.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You can look it up if you don't believe me.\n\nThe creator is amateur at best when it comes to handling anything bug related and all the races play the same.  They all have the same upgrade and the same effects for their weapons.\n\nWith all this though the true reason to not get this is becuase of what the creator did to everyone who got the first one.

But there are some things that make this game beyond broken and not worth the money.\n\nFirstly, the AI is stupid, it buys every upgrade, masses little ships, has no strategy, and on higher difficulties all it does is cheat more, no extra strategy, just gets extra stuff for free. It has complete map awareness at all times, knows where your fleets are on any difficulty, and a plethera of other aweful things.\n\nSecondly there is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of ♥♥♥♥ing bugs that makes me question, how on earth this game even is released as a compelte game. Crashes all the damn time, during space fights enemies will run off the map where you can't see them, so the fight never ends and the only option is to forfiet destroying all of your ships... Seriously that is the only thing you can do, and hope you saved before the battle.\n\nThe end game is bad, just plain bad. There are 70 solar systems in a normal game, and the information displayed to you makes it nearly impossible to navigate your enourmous empire. Allocating resources, troops, knowing populations, will take you about 40 minutes a turn once you start to get a lot of stuff. It's not am enjoyable 40 minutes either, it's trying to remember how much population planets have, which planets are where, what type of abundance are they, etc etc. and you generally have to navigate 3 to 4 different screens just to try and gather all this information... It is beyond frustrating.\n\n\nThere are some wonderful features in this game,random encounters, ship design, good humor in the stories of heros and missions, andship battles(if there was a bit more strategy, but it's still fun blasting 100 enemy ships into dust with long rauge gauss cannons before they reach you). But these features will not satisfy you.

This is not a game where you try to win with a peaceful empire by intrigue, colonization, science and diplomacy.  While these parts are certainly a part of the game, they have habit of getting into one another's way.  Given that, the game's focus tends to be in ship design, logistics and space battles.  But most of all, this game lacks diverse content that is usually a requirement for any 4X game.  The game's pacing also feels like it's not been thought out, with research, exploration, and conquest all working on their own pace, instead of supporting each other.\n\nThe good parts of the MOO2 are there, no doubt, and they will suck you into the game for a good 10 hours or so, before the flaws start to shine through the gaps in the awesome.  The alien species that seemed varied at the first sight, start to all feel more same-y with only a slight twist after a while, the short tech tree is past future-tech at the point around third of the galaxy is explored -- I haven't even met all species before the tech tree is done, and I am quite certain this problem will just seem all the more clear if you like to play research-centric species, which I do not.\n\nOn the other hand, the random-ish events and whatnot give some background into the galaxy, and fill some gaps nicely.  The worlds slowly turning into core-worlds, ski resorts built into tundra worlds and beaches of the ocean worlds all give nice flavor to your empire's worlds.  Designing ships is also fun, and quite likely the best part of the game.  Only thing I would love to have in the design is more options later on, but in the early-game, there were more than enough.  The problem there comes only later on, when you can just cram some full of long-distance weaponry and near-impenetrable shields, at which point any opposition just gets obliterated.\n\nThe diplomacy mechanics of the game are also good, which is a pity, since every alien you meet will want to murder you, however peaceful they claim they are (they usually don't).  The only empire I have ever managed to hold peace with, was the one trying to constantly steal my technology, to the point where I wanted to murder them instead.  And this is the problem with the alien species.  While they seem like really cool ideas with built-in shout-outs, you will soon see a certain pattern there.  There are Cthulhu-esque theocrats that want to murder you for not worshipping their gods, wolf-like evil warriors who want to murder you for the evulz, space-bears that want to murder you for honor, mind-controlling molluscs that want to enslave you out of boredom, robot hive-mind that want to murder you for lebensraum and plant-like "peaceful creatures" that quite likely just wanted to enjoy the gentle optics of my laser beam arrays on my ships.  The tendency of everyone trying to murder you, combined with AI's suicidal optimism and overconfidence about their odds about winning a war tend to lead them declaring war on you just to get horribly murdered instead.  And while this was fun the first time, it grew old fast.  There simply aren't any aliens that like to win the game, instead of giving you excuse to fight to showcase the game's combat mechanics.\n\nThe space combat itself seems OK, and ship designs seem to really matter.  The AI seems to just move towards you guns blazing though, regardless of its ship designs.  The UI is good enough, if sometimes a bit annoying, especially if you like to use fighters, since selecting ships is sometimes not as straightforward as it should be.\n\nThe absolute worst part of the game is ground combat.  It seems like an afterthought and the UI makes it constant misclickfest at it.  It is skippable, but the automagic resolution doesn't do as good job as you would with some equipment, so it becomes just a chore to be done before you can continue on the fun parts of the game.\n\nIn the end, the focus on the extermination and conquest strip the game of many of the strategic elements it should be capable of.  The space and ground combat lack good enough AI to actually showcase the best parts of the game -- the ship design.  The replayability also suffers when every game ends up in a war with only slightly varied opponents.  That being said, the game's strategic mechanics are excellent, and most of the bigger problems COULD be fixed with patches.  Even with all its flaws, this is probably one of the best space 4X games after Master of Orion 2.  The problem is, I still rather play MOO2, which currently costs quarter of this game's prize.  If this game would cost 10€, I would recommend it, but for this cost, it just doesn't offer enough.\n\ntldl: If you can look past some flaws and/or have infinite money to spend, this is a good grab.  Not worth 20€, probably not even worth 15€ at 1.1 patch.  If you can get it sub-10€, get it.\n","May 25, 2015","false","13.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The turn based method of colonizing planets and tending to your growing civilization is well executed, as the real time space battles are fun and a visual feast, but perhaps lacking in complex strategy. The characters that represent the various factions are all fun  to interact with and play as. The true meat of the game is in designing the various starships you make fleets out of, this is what really defines battle strategy and is very fulfilling when you can build your next evolution of ship for your fleet. Where this games sees some major downpoints is a lack of multiplayer, and some difficulties late game as the number of ships in battle can reach  in the hundreds per side as the game needs to calculate trajectories for every shot and damage for every piece that makes up the ships you design. another annoyance is that while you can redesign your ships as you aquire new tech, the other factions do not and are relegated to predesgined ships that simple dont put up much of a fight. the game makes up for this as the enemy may amass giant fleets, that will cause the game to stutter as i said before. This is great fun and hours of play go by as the 'just one more turn' syndrome hits hard.  the characters are all fun, the game plays great, but despite some late game issues and a lack of multiplayer, its still a recommendation. The full price of the game is fair, but if it drops in price with steam sales and such, its a definate buy.","December 1, 2015","true","264.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

AI is terrible....makes totally random choices, nothing seems in character for the opposing races.... (everything looks to be simple dice rolls).  Colony management interface only half works.  Can't withdraw from battles as in Mo2.  When initiating a retreat, SD2 locks  you in a loop.  Your fleet keeps warping to the same escape point and re-initiates combate over and over.  I can go on but overall i'm  just terribly disappointed....\n\nThe real time combat is probably the best feature when it doesn't lock the pc.\n\nThe DLC does improve on the base game adding  more techs, some new twists,  and such.  If you're looking for what amounts to a space-shoot-em-up and are not interested in aspects such as diplomacy, strategy, etc, then this is an ok game.\n\nI will give a thumbs up to Zero who is responsive, listens to the community,  and has been fixing bugs, but there as simply too many issues (imo) to overcome.\n\nHere's hoping Master of Orion 4 hits closer to the mark...........","April 17","false","267.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

My ship simply cannot use wormhole because they keep ''overshooting'' the thing! I even sometime see the AI having trouble with the bug.\nThe auto combat is stupid! Got 5 of my titan coming out with all of their armor destroyed against a few cruiser and corvette when i can easily take out a fleet of 10+ battleship with a single titan. Same thing with ground combat! My mech get almost destroyed and reduced to 5-20 hp when they are maxed at 220! It would be fine if i could heal them outside combat but nooo. They can regenerate 5hp/turn but can't regenerate 50 hp in 10 years. even with a hospital built. Not enough time i guess....\nAnd one funny bug that i found but not able to recreate is when i switch fleet with the AI, i control his ship and he control mine so i just suicide his long-range ship and send one by one his close range ship...\n\nAnd there are many more bug that i wont list since i dont have all day to do that and this is not the place to put them but still, the game look like it should be in early access not fully release.\n\nThe space combat mechanic are annoying and long for no reason if you cant simply click and forget and hope for the best for your ship, you need to set the range of your ship every single time you do a battle you need to set the formation of your ship every single time you need to order your supply ship or support ship to retreat at the start of the battle every single time. Cant you save you setting so you dont have to do this every single time??? And when you try to select your ship to give them order you almost always select another one if they are too close.\nThe ground combat could use improvement too, if you are colorblind you will have a hard time to see the range of your weapon and then you when you try to select one of your troop you better not have forgotten that you have your rocket launcher selected on the last dude you tried to shoot because boom you just lost 3 of your men because of that\n\nThe diplomacy is almost optional, if you have slightly less ship than the AI does (and you will since the AI can produce them faster than you can with all of your planet focusing production) the AI will ask for tribute at best and then war if you dont agree. After the war the AI will be mad at you because you defended yourself and will ask for tribute after the peace ended and if you dont agree he will declare war again. If you can, try to have trade route with him before he get angry so you can at least get some money before the war.\nYou cant even have an aliance there is no research to do so and the AI would problably just say no anyway\n\nBut i still have fun when the AI does not send 137 ship agaisnt me when my supply limit is 30 (not kidding) and when he bomb my planet without any bomb on his ship (i checked every single one of his ship and no bomb on his design!)\nI wil play more game where i will rage when near the end because my ship just doesnt do what i tell them to do like attack or intercept the enemy fleet or use the wormhole because they keep ''overshooting''\nI like the game but there is so much that can be done to improve the gameplay its great and it have a good potential but dont buy the game unless you realy want to play it, there is many other game where you can have more fun.\nThere is a lot of bad thing i have to say about the game but its only because i want it to be better!\n","April 17, 2015","false","33.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's great fun to design ships with specific roles since every decision were you put which parts matters.\n\nBut there are also a lot of issues and some of them show that this is an indie developer and not someone very adept at game design.\n1. The combat is just boring. It has a lot of good things about it. The graphics are pretty, the ships move in cool ways and it's pretty tactical. But it just moves soooo slow. There is no option to speed of the passage of time which kills the pacing in these battles. First you position your troops, then you wait half a minute were they crawl across the map until their actually in firing range and then you wait till the ships slowly widdle down each others help until you're done. It's just too damn slow. I once had to wait two minutes being bored because my big ships turned too slowly and always missed a fast small ship of the enemy. The last one. The ship was way too weak to even get through my ships shields, but i still had to wait two whole minutes until my ships finally hit that little bugger.\n2. The ground combat is even worse. It's designed in an Xcom sort of way were you move your units around a grid to attack and finally kill the enemies. But it's just not fun. It takes way too long to finish any mission, because the enemies always have about 10 times your numbers and all you can do is crawl through the level.\nRule number one of game design: If you can't implement a feature properly don't implement it. These ground battles, which you can't auto resolve by the way, only add tedium to the game and are not fun to play.\n3. This all would not have been terrible if the strategy part of the game would have been great, but it's not. The game crawls very slowly. Often you are just forced to end turn after turn without doing anything, because the pollution mechanics means your production is pretty much always ♥♥♥♥ and takes forever to finish anything. The research isn't all that interesting and worst of all it locks you out of technologies unless you make a creative race or use the horrible diplomacy to trade for the tech.\n4. I heard from quite a few people that the AI cheats massively and stomps you with unkillable armies in the later game, but i didn't even get that far without growing bored.\n\nDon't buy.

I can not in good conscience recommend this game as it becomes unplayable the more time you invest in a game.\n\nAround the time when you can make the biggest ships in the game the "titans" the game is becoming increasingly more laggy. The fps takes a dive the more ships you have in your fleet attacking any other, and while that is to be expected. You must have a large fleet to combat the enemy's equally large fleet.\n\nAnother issue is the transition from combat to world map. Once you finish a battle between two larger fleets it can take in my personal experience several minutes (3-5 min) before all the damage taken, damage given and any earned medals that are given to the ships are done calculating and the statistics of the battle are shown.

Wait until the summer sale, check on its price and its update status, and maybe take a chance then.","April 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

SD2 is turning out to be very much like the MoO2 from back in the day with one noteable difference, ship design is much more sophisticated. It seems that none of the current 4x games offer much in terms of tactical battles, but at least this one does cut away from the game so you can fight the fight and send out some fodder or advance screen ships while your big guns start hammering.\n\nStarDrive 2 started out a bit shakey with a alot of bugs, but has come a long way. The DLC had added significately to the game but came with its own problems. Most of those seem to be sorted out and for the most part, the game now seems stable.\n\nAs for the balance and end game pacing, the game like so many seems to be more about your early choices, some placement and experience. This game seems to be more engaging than Stellaris from my point of view due to my personal taste in designing ships. Stellaris is more of a plug and play style, lacking in creativity. MoO is more along the lines of the old school MoO, ship wieght capacity vs weapon wieght. SD2 copies from ship design of Galactic Empires. If you can put up with the 10 year old graphics, then GE is superior.\n\nOverall, this game has something the other newer games don't, a more intriguing ship design, with Stellaris lacking tactical battles as well. Other than that, all three are very similar. As of right now, I rate SD2 > MoO > Stellaris. Until the others implement more features, this one gets my positive review.","May 15","true","62.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"\n\nFor the purposes of this review, I'm going to ignore the fiasco that happened with the first game. From here on out, let's continue with the assumption that had the first game been finished as it was intended, it would have gone on to become a great game - if you don't already consider it to be one. Why am I bringing this up? Stardrive 2 is a sequel. It is NOT a remake of the first game. And as a sequel, I"m going to compare it to the first one just like I would any other sequel.\n\nSo first things first:\n\nStardrive 2 is turn based - not real time. While some people might like this change, I for one HATE it. I personally feel that a sequel should try to be somewhat similar to its predecessors and this change is a bit overwhelming for me. I mean we went from RTS to Turn Based, and while I do genuinely like some turn based games (Civilization comes to mind), it felt very awkward for this game because I just wasn't expecting it I suppose.\n\nThe planetary menu/information screen has changed quite a bit. All the planets have hexes (instead of tiles) you can build on now and all hexes are unlocked where before Biospheres were important for unlocking all tiles on any given planet. I actually like this change quite a bit. Tiles that were disabled seemed too arbitrary before and this hex system seems much more balanced. Furthermore I LOVE the citizen/workers. You can now quite easily reassign any citizen(s) to a different role (Farmer, Scientist, etc.) and I think overall this change was extremely well done. It is far less tedious trying to get a new planet established than the original Stardrive which had major issues when you got "Bad Starting Territory."\n\nOf course the space battles and ship design have always been the major attraction to the Stardrive series and this game does not fall short in that department. I feel like the ship design has been tweaked slightly from the first game and I also consider this to be an improvement. Since the game is now turn based, you get encounters when engaging in space combat. There is first a deployment stage where you can move your ships around and decide what positions/formation you want them to be in, followed by the actual battle. You may NOT give attack orders during the initial phase. I find this to be quite frustrating for someone who likes to micromanage the entire fight but overall combat is still done very well.\n\nNow on to a few matters that really drive me nuts!\n\nCP stands for command points. Ships cost command points to maintain every turn and if you go over your CP limit, you now have to pay a heavy BC fee (BC stands for Billions of Credits IIRC). This forces one of two things: you either maintain an ENORMOUS empire, or you are forced to have a small fleet. Small as in compared to the first game. Hell I remember the nerf from the original Stardrive. I never actually looked up the patch notes, I just remember loading up one of my files where a had a huge fleet and looking at my massively negative income. I don't know if credit income was nerfed or ship maintenance fees were increased but I truly loved the massive fleet sizes you could attain in the original Stardrive before that patch. Even after it you could still field a somewhat large fleet. But that's the problem. I played the Original first and I know how much fun it is to watch that many ships having a chaotic space battle. In Stardrive 2 a LARGE battle is something like 20 vs 20. CP is a soft cap due to BC paying for ships but.... your economy probably can't handle even tens of ships past the limit.\n\nThe best way to increase your CP is to build new starbases (or their upgrade/Battlestations) on all your planets. So what this comes down to is not how much money you make, but is much more about how many planets you control. Therein lies another problem.\n\nI feel like the interface isn't very good for managing a large empire. After playing a few games I quickly learned I was having more fun on cluster settings with the minimum number of systems - 20.  Even at 5 systems you typically control somewhere around 10-15 planets. I can't stand just using the galaxy map at that point. Maybe I'm missing something or maybe the layout of the Empire Overview just isn't what I"m looking for. But ultimately in the original game I wanted a HUGE, MASSIVE EMPIRE! ...But in this game I just want to be small civilization :(\n\nLast but not least due to the fact that the number of ships for each race is so small, the initial fight seems to decide the outcome of the entire war. You kill their fleet, you go on to take over all their planets with little difficulty (Neuro Toxic Bombs quite easily wipe out the local ground oppostion). The last thing I want in a 4x game during combat is to have only ONE definitive space battle against any one race. Ships are hard to spam fast enough to recover from a loss that quickly, even with a Gaia world.\n\nOverall I feel the original game was much better, though there were obvious problems completing the game due to what happened. I guess the bottom line is that I would've rather had a remake than this version of the game.\n\nNote that I didn't quite go over EVERYTHING (like leaders) but this review is already long enough and I want anyone who takes the time to read it to make up their own mind.","May 19, 2015","false","10.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Overall I would recommend now.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great Visuals for a 4X game.\n- One of the best ship designs there is in a 4X games.\n- Good tactical combats.\n- Interesting lore reminiscent of MoO.\n- Interesting 4X game with a gameplay similar to MoO.\n- Mod friendly. It's very easy to tweak some Xml files to tweak some stuff out.\n- DLC is coming and it looks very interesting and improving many areas of the game.\n\nCons:\n\n- DLC is coming and yet the game doesn't feel like finished.\n- Modding community is very small and seem to have deserted the game. There are actually very few functional mods left.\n- Ground combat is not very interesting.\n- Balance is lacking in tactical fights. It's too easy to have one type of ship designed and stick with that, obliterating the poorly designed AI ships.\n- Unbalanced races. Some races have much smaller hulls than others for the same ship categories. They then must rely in more ships to have a chance to win but the more ships you have the harder it will be on your economy.\n- AI is poor. It's just plain dumb and only manages to keep you on your toes at higher difficulty levels because it cheats (I think).\n- The game feels like rushed. Lots of bugs still exist after almost a year of release.\n- The updates are few and far between with amost if any changes to the game and the existing bugs. After almost a year of being released the game saw less than 5 updates (if my memory serves me right).\n- The developer. Zero seems to lack communication and as such he appears as lazy and not caring about his community. I couldn't say that it is true as I do not know him but it appears to be.\n\n\nIn conclusion I cannot recommend the game in its state. I hope that the next DLC will fix and improve many things that are wrong with the game. I do believe that the game is interesting to play and has interesting mechanics for any 4X games fan  but shouldn't be considered a complete game.

Sword of The Stars, Endless Space, and now StarDrive 2. StarDrive 2 is the closest direct copy with (semi) modern visuals with the majority of its gameplay lifted strait from MOO2. Corn/Hammers/Beakers with Civ style buildings make up the majority of colony management. This is an exact replica only slightly tweaked by the maintenance cost of buildings forcing actual choices (that the AI is unprepared to make). Design wise this comes off as a fan patch that makes sense in the context of MOO2 but has no life of its own.\n\nThe stolen content is the best part of the game.\n\nAnything that was not mathematically or superficially lifted from the original is incredibly unpolished. The entire experience is like a house built with only a photograph as a reference. The AI does not know how to design ships or manage its empire, The new ground combat is a tedious slog of looped animations, and the "real time" space battles (though nice looking)  are not decided by player commands just the ships you carefully designed. It is reminiscent of gratuitous space battles except because you designed decent ships you can take on 5x the chaff that the AI is stuck with.\n\nI can not recommend this game to anyone who has never played Master of Orion II and even then not at full price. On the outside it looks and feels exactly like the MOO2 you may fondly remember while running on modern hardware. It scratches the itch in a way that irritates as much as it satisfies.

The dev had quite the gem with it and because of StarDrive, I had no hesitation whatsoever to purchase StarDrive 2, especially after the wonderful discovery of ground combat being added, even bought the digital deluxe one just to show support. I also tried so very hard to enjoy this game, I really did.\n\nThis game is a sham and a huge letdown, I haven't been this disappointed in a game since Unity came out after Black Flag, and CA tried to pass off Rome 2 as a playable game on launch.\n\nPros\n-Customizable ships (Although was far superior in StarDrive 1 as well)\n-Ground combat (Or well, the idea of it anyways.)\n-4x space game worth playing (When talking about StarDrive 1)\n\nCons\n-Ground combat (As it's far too easy and seems to be more of an aesthetic feature than anything serious)\n-Space Combat (StarDrive 1 was far superior to this drivel of a combat simulator, again this is far too easy. Also to mention that in StarDrive 1 you were able to move your ships into systems and they would automatically battle to the death with aliens, not some little battle screen that takes away the fun of the old combat system)\n-Tech Tree (Now I understand the thrill of being able to only choose one tech from a branch at a time and having to plan it out ahead of time but it gets way too old, far too fast. Being able to build onto previous techs is far more realistic than saying "Oh hey, should we focus on a rover bay or xeno mine?" Then you choose one, then suddenly "Well that's that, why should we bother with the other?" Now I didn't get too far in detail in the tech tree and if you are capable of going back to research the ones you didn't pick please leave an insulting comment down below although according to the tutorial you had to pick the other ones up through espionage or diplomacy which is fine if you want to get them that way but let us build on as in the first StarDrive)\n-Turn based (Now the beauty of StarDrive 1 was that it was automatic turns that happened every 4 seconds if I recall correctly (Please leave an insulting comment down below if I'm wrong) having to manually click to the next turn gets irritating because it allows you to ensure everything is done before you want to move on. In my opinion this makes the game far too easy because you never get caught out of sync and have to deal with a random invasion out of the blue, and holding the space button is just demented, they should have added a feature in the menu that lets you select continuous play or turn based. That feature actually set StarDrive 1 apart from Gal Civ for me and pushed it to my favorite.)\n-Customizable Ships (It feels like the ship design has been modified to make it "Easier" but far less creative and worthwhile)\n-Feels like a dummed down version of the original StarDrive with some aesthetic looks to make it smell less foul.\n\nI really am disappointed in Zero and sad to say he's been added to the list of terrible devs. If you have any soul or self respect left, please refund my money. I realize you won't, but you can't blame a guy for trying although I just want the money back for the principal. You may try and pretend that this is "an exciting and evolutionary step forward for the StarDrive franchise." But, in actuality it's a sad step backwards. Let's not try to take crap and call it gold, let's just call it for what it is. Even if you won't refund my money, please take this atrocity down from steam and give us an actual enjoyable experience that I came to expect from you. And as stated above, if any fan boys want to insult me, I welcome your comments. Make sure they're extra spicy as well please.\n\nDevs behaving like this is why I'm slowly turning more and more to tabletop gaming than video games in my spare time.","April 10, 2015","false","4.7"," 61 of 128 people (48%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","48","61","128","12","0"

What did I get? a game that tried so desperately to be different from the first that the smooth science tree is replaced with a clunky pick 1 thing lose out on the other two options. Ship designing that was nothing like the trailers, it offered limited choices and felt bizarre and all around poorly done. Which was a shame  because I loved ship designing in the first game, it was my favorite aspect. Then we get to freighters and population growth, apparently I can't send my freighters on trade missions, a planet needs to be starving for food to be sent to them automatically, taking even more control away from the player. Next is the turns, in the first Stardrive time passed and ever 5 seconds was a turn, you had the option of speeding up or slowing time, and even stopping it all together to make choices. Now time is paused from the get go and you have to hold down the space bar, wait a matter of seconds, and then it moved to the next turn as things jump ahead. Yet the game advertises as real time, to em this is a blatant lie as it is clearly a next turn button. This is all I could stomach of the game before closing it to play the original, as I don't want to be miserable on my birthday.  In summary, a soul crushing level of underwhelming game play and sheer disappointment, with the only perk being that the game wooks pwettyer than the first.","May 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

If you liked the first Star Drive game, stick with the first game, this game is more of a Master of Orion 2 update than a sequal to Star Drive. RIP my 20 bucks\n\nThere's still lots of bugs and the dev seems to be pumping out patches but there's just lots of strange behavior in the game, an enemy caught me spying and I have -675% diplomatic approval, but I'm always under constant assault by the ai's legion of spys which apparently cost the ai nothing to produce or upkeep despite having huge costs for the player to upkeep. The AI likes to request trades but you don't have good enough relations with the ai to request something in return so obviously you decline, which incurs a penalty. There are lots of descriptions that are filled out for some weapons that seem like they could benefit from someone re-reading them now that the game has been published so they could be clearer, lots of weapons that have slightly different terminology to describe them. My most recent game loaded up and my tooltips weren't displaying all my racial bonuses and I couldn't save ship designs after I spent 10 minutes customizing them so thats fun. Bugs I'm sure will be patched some day. Also, the AI seems to have unlimited fuel range and your ships can barely get to the neighboring system, but when I inspec the enemy ships... they have no extended fuel cells. Also, if you auto resolve combat, you lose about 20 troops even if you went up against 4 guys despite the enemy not being that much better at ground combat, so you have to play through each ground combat which is basically waiting for 3 turns then firing missiles from your mechs you bought on the black market, but if you autoresolve you somehow lose half of your 20 infantry, makes sense. Canopy shields are also totally broken, put one on each big ship until you have about 6 in a fleet, fill up on flak cannons and regular energy cannons and you can just walk away when the enemy sends a megafleet at you. Combat is so laggy during these mega combats that you can't tell whats going on, but if you auto resolve then you lose, if you circle the canopy shield wagons then you win but you have to watch combat for half an hour.\n\nThe game is fun when things work within reason, but I just spent a day playing through and all the enemy races declared war on me simultaneously after I killed the vulfars which is a race that declares war on you for the sake of declaring war. I managed to kill their bigger fleets which occupy the entire deployment area (which should also bankrupt the ai due to how fleet sizes should work) but then I have to play whack a mole with every other AI's mega fleet while they cherry pick my star systems with a mix of omniscience and unlimited fuel range and poorly designed ships and for every mega fleet I send my entire fleet after I lose 3 planets to bombing or invasion.\n\nBuy it if it goes on sale for 5 bucks.","April 15, 2015","false","60.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The AI does not respect Core Space. I've started several games and the narrative is always the same. Opteris colonizes beside me, sends a colony ship to Sol system. If I try to block it, its war and it sends wave after wave of fleets 7 and 8 ships strong.  Even if I manage to build a fleet of ten ships it always has more. If I allow it to build the colony then soon after I get a message telling me that I am in its space and need to vacate.  In which case its war and I have fight wave after wave of superior ships.\n\nThe AI seems to muster resources quicker that I can ever manage.  In all, these are 15 to 45 minute games with the outcome always the same.  It does not seem to suffer the same penalties for building ships as players do. The only weapon that was somewhat effective, the mass driver, now is useless because of the newly introduced aiming penalty.\n\nOne of the missions right off the bat is to colonize three systems for which you get 500 bc. However it seems that colonizing three systems really pisses the AI off and so it makes a bee line to my cololnies to take care of business. Doing this takes away valuable resources that could be used to build fighters.  However not  colonizing only postpones the inevitable.\n\nIt is obvious that there is no fog of war for the AI as it always goes for the weakest colonies and when it knows it has the advantage it swoops in and destroys everything.\n\nI like a challenge, but so far have not been able to find a way to stay alive against an enemy that knows all, builds faster and gets all the tech before me. Yes I've traded for tech. Other players have mentionted how the Ai does not attack with updated ship designs.  I have not found this. For me it is always a case of fighting outgunned and in the end completely outnumbered.\n\nI like where the game is going but hope some of the AI related issues get worked out. I feel that backing things off to give players time to figure things out a little more would make the game that much more enjoyable.","April 29, 2015","true","153.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It's a pure jewel. The economy and research system are an improved and modernised copy/paste from Master of Orion 2, so it's very good and also very solid. This part of the game is also quite well balanced for release, that's worth mentionning.\n\nHowever, as all 4x release, it's not perfect, the game has also some flaws due to its youth. The different ship modules are not as well balanced as the economy, some work is still needed here. The ground combat system is not as bad as it could look, but still, it need some work also (espescially the ground combat IA). The diplomacy lack some obvious options, like the 'Alliance' and 'Declare war to' ones. There is also some small bugs here or there (quite rare, no crash), and some optimisation to do for big battles.\n\nOn the overall, despite its youth's flaws, Stardrive 2 is wonderfull. Since release I have put nearly +70hrs in it, and enjoy it like crazy. It reminds me of the MoO2 birth in the old days : the game had lot of bugs (far more than SD2), and still I couldnt stop playing during nearly a month, it was a so good time.. as it is now with SD2 actually!\n\nTo end this review, and to be fair with you, readers, I would not say that it is the best space 4x ever created yet, as for me Distant Worlds, which is in real time and quite different on many aspects, has still the title. But trust me, considering all the passion Zero (the lone dev) put in SD2, it's only a matter of time before Stardrive 2 take the title. Six months? One year? I dont know, but for sure, it will happen! ;)\n\nThank for reading.\nGut/Gorko/Kruos","April 27, 2015","true","274.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

To understand why this review is negative, you need to understand Stardrive 1.\n\nThis was a game with high hopes and moddability, with support from an up-and-coming indie developer who interacted with the community.\nFor...awhile. And then support dropped off, and contact became sparse, and despite the game not being in a decently-finished state, it was abandoned, and Stardrive 2 was announced.\n\nStardrive 2 is a space RTS like its predecessor, like Master of Orion, you outfit ships, you manage planets, you enact ground invasions, you manage your empire, etc. The races are decently-mixed and have varied ship appearances, the story and characters are mostly light-hearted, the art style is appealing...the game play is unfinished, and buggy, despite patches meant to improve it. Some of these bugs are quite game-breaking, immersion-breaking, and some features are incomplete or end up rough around the edges. What is there is much like Stardrive 1: Full of potential, ready to be built upon, ready to be expanded...ready to be finished.\n\nWell, the game is finished. If you buy the $9.99 Sector Zero DLC, which essentially finishes up the content and fixes a fair amount of bugs, and changes some mechanics in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, it's paid DLC. Paid DLC to fix and finish the game. As someone who went the extra mile and bought the "deluxe" edition, I cannot justify spending yet another $10 just to have the complete game. I bought a game I assumed would be completed. Paid DLC is not complete. Fallout 4, for all its bugginess, is feature-complete, pre-DLC. XCom 2, is feature-complete, pre-DLC. Buggy GTA V is feature-complete, and their DLC is free.\n\nI could pick a whole mess of games who are feature-complete through dedicated developer support, and the DLC simply adds on to the game, instead of simply containing bug-fixes and completed aspects of the game left-unfinished pre-DLC.\nWhat other games are feature-complete before DLC and what is "feature-complete".\nKay, feature-complete entails that a game is decently playable and fulfills the goals stated by the dev, their store page, and the assumption when you're buying such a game, based on its history and your past experiences.\nWhat is a reasonable amount of developer support? Until the game reaches said feature-complete state, or a decent amalgam of such as defined by you, the person shovelling out the money for it.\n\nJust because DLC exists and can be shady or bad like this example, does not mean we sit here and joyfully accept it. Find your own list of what proof of decent pre-DLC, feature-complete games are out there, that's not the point of my review.\n\nThe game is good, but because I must pay to get the good aspects ontop of the regular retail price, I cannot justify giving the game a good review.","March 12","false","9.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"

That said I share the disapointments among the community.\n\nThere are bugs, interface bugs are the ones that I have noticed the most. I feel like the game hasnt had enough testing before release. It is still playable at least for me.\n\nMy biggest complaint about he game:\nThere are tons of different research options and weapons in the game. Most of the time you speed through research before even needing to use the things you have unlocked. I guess what happens is that you move along this research path too fast. By the time you get to fighting you never used those missiles, or that powerplant because now you have way better ones. Almost as if the research to those things served no purpose. It is like you can skip from tier 1 weapons to tier 10 weapons before you actually need to fight anything.\n\nAlso the pirates and the aliens that attack you are pretty ridiculous... They dont attack the ai as far as I can tell only you. The ground combat is poorly coded from what I can tell. The longer you are on the ground view the more memory gets leaked or whatever it is that is happening. The defensive base cannon does nothing.\n\nI mean the list goes on and on. Shady development is what it looks like. Cutting corners here and there to rush something out.\n\nEither way it is still a 4X game and it has a lot of cool things about it.\nThe exploration of new systems is good. The ship module builder is great. The combat is eye candy. Lots of great stuff but the overall balance and feel of the game needs work and the bugs need to be sorted out. If it is just one developer then perhaps the developer would consider spending some of the fortune on some help.","November 5, 2015","true","26.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The game is the first I have encountered that abandons support for 1024 x 768 and lower resolution.  This may sound trivial, but I believe it may be the start of an ominous trend.  Because of this withdrawal of support gamers using still good gas plasma displays will not be able to play the game.\n\nIf the game succeeds in getting away with this move it could be the beginning of the end for all players using gas plasma displays.  Other developers will quickly follow suit, and soon GPD users will find that their computer rigs are useless for any and all new games.   This progression will soon follow to higher and higher resolutions, finally leaving players in a frantic and never ending quest to own systems with the highest possible resolution.  What Microsoft has done to operating systems, games like this will do to monitors.  Each new game out will see a new set of resolutions and monitor types rendered obsolete.\n\nThis movement needs to be squashed before it has a chance to take root.  I urge all prospective buyers to refuse to purchase the game until it extends support to all currently used resolutions.","May 23, 2015","false","9.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The 2nd I was disappointed in, however upon seeing the positive reviews for the new DLC I thought I'd give it another try. Unfortunately I think this game needs more optimisation as I find everything in the game slow and jerky despite having a powerful rig. When it runs better I'll gladly give this game another look.","March 12","false","33.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"
