The developers made sure that every level provides something fresh to test your platforming skills\n+ Great challenge, each level introducing new concepts and builds upon it through out the game. The first few levels are easy but as you move further along things become increasingly difficult\n+ Lots of good platforming puzzles in each level, good satisfaction when you figure out what you have to do.\n+ Great artwork and graphics\n+ Lots of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie references\n+ Possibly one of the strangest endings in video game history.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Multiplayer community is dead so you won't be able to play any of the multiplayer levels. Their is a mode however that lets you play with one controller however this is very frustrating and is not the way the levels were meant to be played, still it was nice of the developers to include it\n- The game can and will be frustrating at times, this isn't necessarily a bad point against the game per se but if your a gamer who gets frustrating easily, you may want to avoid this game.\n\nConclusion:\nI loved this game and if you have the patience you will too. One of the best platforming games around.","July 2, 2014","true","20.3"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","62","68","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexplosion/recommended/105420/","sexplosion","Stridge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexplosion/","336 products in account","Ms. Splosion Man is the sequel to Splosion Man, which can be found exclusively on the XBox Live Arcade. The story is such: Splosion Man was created by a team of scientists and gets loose, and after a lot of death and building damage, is finally captured by the scientists who created him. In celebration, the scientists accidentally create his gender-swapped clone, Ms. Splosion Man, who begins reaking the same havoc as Splosion Man.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: It's a 2D platformer with long levels that can go in any direction. You 'splode. By sploding, you can kill enemies, achieve wall-jumps, activate traps, press buttons, and achieve super-jumps. The game has two types of death: certain items hurt you to no-sploding abilities, and then kill you, whereas some elements will kill you upon touch. Your score at the end of the level is mostly dependent on time.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent. You have to complete a level in a certain way, but the game does reward you for exploration with a collectible in each level: shoes. Often, you can try a portion of a level multiple times, giving you a little bit of breathing room. Other times, your platforming has to be near-perfect, each jump timed or going through the level as fast as you can do it.\n\nSometimes, the control is a little awkward, and a splosion won't work in the way you want it to. Combine that with some checkpoints being a bit infrequent, and you get irritated playing certain sections multiple times.\n\nYou can spend points in the mall for in-game bonuses, such as music, concept art, backgrounds, etc. They don't affect gameplay, but they're cool to look at. Since the game is very fun, you might find it worth it.\n\nOne of the key points to this game is it's humor. Splosion' Man has always been really funny regarding it's cutscenes, and this game isn't an exception. It's a great addition, especially since the cutscenes introduce new enemies, gameplay mechanics, and different worlds.\n\nMy only big qualm about this game: I really, really wish this game didn't require Microsoft Game Center. It's DLC that's unneeded since it's on the Steam platform. It uses it for Challenges, updated through Microsoft, a feature I think isn't really needed.\n\nSome people have a concern about the game's gender stereotypes. Some people may take offense to the valley-girl, pink, always shoe-craving, girl-power song-singing, pink, make-up and bow-wielding main character. I think the game is using this satirically, some people saying that it's the fact that this character is so inhuman that it's poking fun at it's laughable portrayal of female characters in video games. Others say that even by doing this, it's still encouraging the "girl" character stereotype.\n\nEither way you feel about this, this game is really solid. It's a good addition to a Steam library, and I would reccomend it to people who like singleplayer platformer adventures. If you want a multiplayer adventure, I'd reccomend using Xbox for ease. 9/10.","May 12, 2014","true","7.4"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","34","40","2","0"

I wasn’t expecting the quality of gameplay it delivered. The character alone is hilarious to control as she runs around spouting lyrics to popular songs and having random and wacky conversations with herself,the player and often enemies.\n\nMost the levels in the game are well designed with a nice flow that can get difficult or somewhat stay mellow as you progress through it. You’ll feel rewarded as you accomplish task and or pull off combo chains properly. And there are levels that are straight out ball busters and will troll you till you get it down pat with trial and error. Almost forgot the levels can be dynamic and change in mechanics as you go.\n\nThe game at times can feel like you’re playing a Super Meat Boy with lengthy levels, then other times it feels like I Wanna Be The Guy due to the traps and tricky level design which the user could possibly not react to or evade without knowledge of, aka trial and error. But you know that is a nice part of the game, wouldn’t be fun if it was hold your hand FEZ mode easy. Not to mention the game has outstanding music, some tracks that will make you laugh out of your mind and will make you feel ready to kick some butt.\n\nOne thing I personally like about the game is the insane over the top humor, the boss battles are unique and by far one of the best parts of the game. I don’t want to give away any spoilers but four words Mike Tyson Punch-Out, lol. On the other hand there are a few cons I think I should mention about the game as well.\n\n1: hard to see where you are or how you are positioned with all of the explosion effects/smoke. There is a part of the game where you hop on flying cars and I swear the smoke effects they used there need to be removed completely.\n\n2: You sometimes have no idea how many times you exploded leaving you to fall to your death because there is no real meter on the screen that shows it, I see what they were going for with the no hud display but the character(s) are too small to see the weathered effects on their body most the time.\n\nThere are some other issues but none that are as big as the two I mentioned here, but hey I give this game a recommendation and say those who like platformers should try it out. Don’t be deterred by its name (which is poking fun at ms.pacman). Like Jesus said in the bible Luke 24: 16-48 “Tho shall not judge a game by its name, but by its kickass gameplay.”-Jesus","September 2, 2014","true","8.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

Not so old school difficult as to chase people away but not as 'clean' as other modern day platformers. I'd compare the difficulty to a version of Donkey Kong Country with more frequent checkpoints added so obstical gauntlets are not as painstaking to have to repeat.\n\nThe game play itself requires only one button aside from the joystick and takes advantage of richochette and repel.\n\nI'm pretty sure that first level, however, had already proved this game to be a highly competent platformer with some pretty intense eye candy moments - it was just a matter of this recent patch getting us into the second level or having to wait for a quad core pc that could've overcompensated for the porting/optimizing mishap.\n\nSo anyone previously on the fence - I highly recommend!

Because that's the most notable part of the game.\n\nI personally dislike the aesthetic of the game and find it annoying. But getting beyond that you have yourself a very entertaining sidescroller that focuses on building momentum via propelling yourself with explosions. The game introduces it's systems gradually and it includes a Mario 3-esque overworld. The game also has an extremely good soundtrack that remixes 80's music, and the pause menu music IS just 80s music.\n\nMs Splosion Man is great for speedrunners or casual enthusiasts to sidescrollers. It also keeps a decent length and is challenging to boot. Bare in mind it's not for everyone and unless you're curious I'd recommend watching a video of the gameplay before purchasing.\n\nNOTE: While the game did at one point have Games for Windows Live, the developers graciously patched it out. I highly recommend you buy this game since the PC port is the best version of this game now.","November 27, 2013","true","5.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

The levels are pretty challenging and very dependent on your timing and reflexes.  There's a couple of challenging/frustrating areas throughout the three worlds, but nothing that I thought was too unforgiving.  There is a lot of replay value in this for those who are interested in beating their old times, and the feature to race against yourself or others on the leaderboard through their silhouette is pretty interesting.\n\nThe protagonist's endlessly repeated one-liners and sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue can get a bit tedious, and it certainly doesn't help in certain areas where you are constantly going back and trying to figure out how to platform through the section.  Not much of a "story" really happening, but the ending is pretty entertaining and I'm sure a real treat for those who might have played the original Splosion Man.\n\nOverall, the game is worth checking out and runs well on PC.

It was a somewhat masochistic platformer with a great gimmick of blowing yourself up to complete progressively difficult platforming challenges and its only real fault was that  the creativity sorta ran out by the game's midpoint.\n\nAt first glance, and even first play, Ms. Splosion Man can look and feel an awful lot like a reskin and rehash of the first game, but Ms. Pink and Sassy brings her own bit of originality to the formula that helps keep the concept flowing and interesting all the way to the end.\n\nWhile the original game focused almost entirely on platforming, Ms. Splosion Man dashes in a fun bit of puzzle solving, twitch reaction focused speed sections, and fun boss encounters to keep things moving along at a nice pace without ever fizzling out. The stages are much more varied this time around and their scope much larger, which makes hunting down those elusive shoes and secret exits much more fulfilling since the paths to reach them are often fraught with much more danger than a stage's normal path.\n\nAll that said, Ms. Splosion Man is still a fairly difficult game, and checkpoints in stages can sometimes be a little too far apart, so if you're averse to not always having a love-love relationship with your games, you may wanna pass. But if you're up for a bright, upbeat, and endlessly endearing bit of hardcore platforming, Ms. Splosion Man's got something that'll keep you nice and charged up.","October 5, 2013","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Is that a negative? I think not. From the moment you hear the pop based soundtrack you know you're in for a fun, feminine good time. The game is best described as a very hard puzzle-platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy, except with explosions instead of meat. While on the difficult side, Ms. Splosion Man, voiced by the fantastic anime dub voice actress Monica Rial (Stocking (Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt) and Tsubaki (Soul Eater), edges you on with her manic pop-culture references and pop lyrics from the '80's to today. One complaint I can think of is that sometimes the puzzles become a huge trial-by-error and can cause frustration that leads to four-letter-fury. Bottom line play this game if you are up for a challenge and to let loose and have silly fun.","June 30, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

No really. I had a blast playing this for hours on end, and it's such a unique expperience.\n\nIf you ever liked the original Splosion Man, this will give you more of what you like and more. It features a scaling challenge, unique level puzzles and platforming, nd blends them near perfectly. It also has optional stages which really push you to your limit. I know I had a blast with them, and figureing them out. The game throws just enough challenge at you to make you think, but not enough to frustrate you. Every time you die, you'll never blame the game for being unfair. That's the kind of challenge I personally relish.\n\nPlotwise, you're an explosive woman finding an explosive guy. Not really that deep, but it's not like you're playing a visual novel anyway, so the story isn't much of an issue. I like it because it's nice and simple, and never impedes your game. It's got a similar whimsy to your average Mario game, and I use that as a compliment.\n\nGraphically, it's pretty cool. Nice and colorful, but it can contrast with darker themes later in the game. The game certainly has varity, I'll tell you that much.\n\nMusically, it's surprisingly top notch. I expected dubstep or some kind of garbage for hipsters, but the OST is as divrse as the rest of th game. From 50's love serenades to high beat, blood pumping rock chords, and the classic theme with a more pop twist, the game runs the gamut of tunes. My personal favorite is "Oh Mandy".\n\nSo what's the verdict? This game is fantastic. Buy it on sale if you can, but it's still worth the 10 bucks.","September 7, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I just found the whole "slap pink on it and toss in some horrific stereotypes about teenage girls etc" to be really grating.\n\nI got it for something like $2.50, so it wasn't like I got horribly ripped off.

Not one for casual gamers, that's for sure.\n\nThe only issue I have is that the game has endless amounts of loading screens, as you jump from one section of the menu to the next. Also, the menu navigation isn't great, probably because they just did a direct port without adding mouse support for the PC.\n\nUltimately, I stopped playing because of that and the existence of GFWL.

Both of these games were originally Xbox 360 Arcade games. Ms. Splosion Man is a fun, difficult, 2D platformer. I like the game but it can be obnoxious sometimes.\n\nMain ReviewMs. Splosion Man is our main character. The goal of the game is to “splode” (jump) over obstacles. The game gets harder and harder as time goes on. The game really expects you make the jumps and good reaction timing is a must! The game even throws out some puzzles every once and awhile. Maybe I am just stupid but I did not like most of the puzzles and some took me forever to solve. The bosses also felt repetitive in that “old” video game style where they expect the player to do the same maneuver about three times. Also back to Ms. Splosion Man. She is obnoxious. There is no hiding it. She spouts out random pop culture references every  ten seconds or so. I personally find it funny but I can see how it may annoy people. The gameplay and controls feel very tight and I have nothing bad to say there. I played this game with an Xbox One controller. I like the music but some people might not like the vocal style of it.\n\nThe Good Tight controls feel very good and fair.\nThere is a one life hard mode for even more pain extra fun!\nIf you want a fast paced hard platformer the game is for you.\nThe badMs. Splosion Man will not stop saying pop culture references every ten seconds and she has an obnoxious voice.\nThe game gets very fast paced and hard so if you want a relaxing experience this is not the game.\nI thought the puzzles were odd and I did not like most of them.\nFinal thoughtsMs. Splosion Man is a very challenging and fun 2D platformer. If you want excitement and speed this is the game. That is… if you like the music and you can live with Ms. Splosion Man’s personality. I suggest watching a YouTube play video and see if you like it. I would recommend this game to people who like 2D platformers.","February 14","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
