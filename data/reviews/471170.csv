More like stage clear type puzzle game than city strategy/simulation.\nGood for killing time in short break, but not really suited for long time play (there isn't much to keep you hooked in). Even with sandbox mode, I don't think this game offers a lot of replayable stuff.\n\nUnless you like simple game to kill some time, stay clear from here if you want some heavy strategy/simulation game to get stuck in.","May 19","false","1.5"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","0"

Each time you succeed your notoriety increases and you will get better (though harder) jobs.\n\nCampaign It is divided in 24 levels of crescent difficulty and complexity. Each level has 3 obligatory objectives (Goals): all 3 are required to complete the level and they must be done before the deadline. Completing a level unlocks the next one.\nNote: There is an option to disable the "deadline". In this case, all you have to do is complete the objectives at your own leisure (unless you are after the medal).\n\nTo build the cities you have at your disposal: money, wood, stone and workers. Training workers, mining or  cutting down trees costs 1500 Dn, ordering wood or stone costs 500 Dn.\nMoney is gain from the people living in properties (like rent), so the better the properties and the happier the residents are, the more you earn.\nBefore building anything though, you must purchase its blueprint. Properties (houses/ apartments) require other buildings like temples or markets, otherwise the residents won't be as satisfied (happy). High-end properties require even more structures.\nConcessions allow to upgrade your properties, so more money can be earned.\nAll buildings deteriorate so, from time to time, repairs are needed.\n\nSince part of the rent is decided by the residents' happiness, you have to manage it carefully. Being near the wreck of any destroyed building or near a few specific structures will bring the happiness down by 1. Gardens, on the other hand, will make residents in the neighboring properties happier (+1 happiness).\n\nThat's the fun part of the game weigh the pros and cons of what and where to build; what to have near that building; if it is worth it spending money in upgrades, mining, cutting up trees or training workers (they are expensive but mid/late game they are worth the price, allowing you to multi-task and build more complex structures); etc., while trying to complete all goals as fast as possible.\n\nDuring the Campaign, you can also earn trophies and medals in each level.\nTrophy : to receive it you must fulfill a secondary objective before all the other (3) objectives are completed;\nMedal: you are only able to gain it, if you complete the level before a certain time. If you make just one wrong choice, chances are you won't earn it, well, at least, in Hard mode. Easy and Normal mode do, sometimes, allow a few mistakes and choices.\n\nSandboxBesides Campaign, there is also Sandbox where you can create your own maps, set the goals you want to achieve, determine the deadline, etc.","June 2","true","9.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Each scenario you are given a 5x5 squared grid to build on with obstacles (either in the form of tiles you cannot build on or buildings that impose a negative effect on your nearby structures. Objectives usually require you to have a certain amount of specific buildings or have a set amount of resources, which requires you to plan your city's layout.\n\nThis is all done with a time limit, too, so you either need to make use of the pause button a lot or know the game well.","May 20","true","6.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinryu_steam/recommended/471170/","shinryu_steam","Shinryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinryu_steam/","909 products in account","Romopolis is an old game that has been brought to steam to make the game more accessible to gamers that enjoy these sorts of games on the PC market.\n\nRomopolis is a great game for it's genre, though if you're looking for the same experience as Sim City or Cities Skylines, you won't find that here. Romopolis is not a bad game, in fact, it is quite good in the gameplay style it covers, however, I fear that for many people on the PC this could be a let down. You have a campaign mode which provides you 24 different missions to complete. Each level is more difficult than the previous and the time limit to acquire the medal/achievemnt is the biggest challenge which I find quite fun.\n\nOutside of that you have a sandbox mode, however, the sandbox mode doesn't work like most games. It doesn't give you an empty map and let you create your city, no, it is more of an editor to allow you to develop your own scenarios and share them with your friends. While this isn't a bad thing, it isn't really the traditional sandbox mode we all know and love.\n\nThe maps are small and scenario orientated. Once you're done with the scenario, that's pretty much it.\n\nAll in all it's a good fun game to play here and there. It has great visuals, the gameplay and upgrading systems are well thought out and the sounds are pretty good too. Overall. For $3.99, it's good value and will provide several hours of fun.","May 19","true","0.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

This is the only bad thing about this game, other than that, its a good buy to get, I plan to get the Megaopolis as well and write a good review for it as well, since they all are the same game.  Question is if you are a game collector and collect them, or you want a specific one to play.  Buy this game based on that more than just a game to play or not.\n\nThe difference with this one as compared to Townopolis, is you get to do your housing differently, and it seems there is a population difference as well.  Also there is more than just Happiness, there is culture, health, wealth, religion and other factors that your city has to have.  As your housing gets bigger the more demanding it is just like Townopolis however Happiness is done by gardens, instead of houses that are next to each other, so there is no positive or negative influences like Townopolis has.  So you have to think wisely where you place your Gardens if you want happiness.  With that said, there is the only gripe I have about this game is there is not enough happiness factors in it, I feel other buildings should improve happiness besides the Gardens, but that is just me.  It would be nice to have higher amounts of happiness is all I would like to have seen in this game much like Townopolis.  A plus to this game is the fact that all you need is one "Imperial Protection" to use and all your buildings are protected from damage, unlike Townopolis, where you had to Inspect each and every buildings, although the extra step is nice, I like that Inspections are not needed once you get "Imperial Protection" which is basically Global Inspections.\n\nThe final verdict of this game is a clone of Townopolis, not sure which came first, and is also a clone of "Build-A-Lot", if you liked "Build-A-Lot", or games like it, then I recommend buying this game. I give this game a 5 star out of 5 rating, despite the fact its a clone of some games like "Build-A-Lot".","May 31","true","2.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
