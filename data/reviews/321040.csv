This is a five year/nearly six year old game. Yet, the graphics department is not lacking to this date as one may expect! Neither is the game play. Look at the current videos of high quality settings, or my screenshots. This game still looks and plays great! That in itself is rare and a testament to CodeMasters and their numerous years spent creating quality racing games (for the most part). In fact I find this racer to be more responsive and acceptable to true skill via setup and personal driving style than many of today's releases and that's not a sentiment I pass lightly! So, please do yourself a favor and consider purchasing this gem of a racing game.\n\nFor existing users it has been stated numerous times already that GWFL has been removed :) And that not only have the Codie's revisited this game, and revamped it so its player base weren't out of luck like so, so many other developers?!?! No! And not only that, but they included all of the DLC, and guess what?! Look hard fans of old, as there are some new easter eggs and improvements that you will only notice if you spent a lot of time playing the original. I had 100+ hours in the GFWL version before they made this title available in Steam. I would definitely reinstall this "new" version if you own the original. I'd be highly surprised if you're disappointed in the decision but at the end of the day: To each their own!\n\nHave fun reliving this gem & generally speaking: Happy Gaming!","May 14, 2015","true","37.9"," 76 of 79 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","76","79","8","9"

What else could you want ? A decent Rally championship! That's what!\n\nDiRT series is my favourate rally sports series. It's also my most dissapointing racing game series ever. Why ? I'll tell you why!\nDiRT games have great physics, great handling, great music and great graphics. Everything sounds perfect, doesn't it ? But it just sounds like that.\n\nDiRT2 has muddy forest tracks. No snow tracks.\nDiRT3 has snow and desert tracks. No jungle / forest tracks. This right here is pretty R-Tarded.\nDiRT is supposed to be a successor to the good 'ol Colin McRae series. We all loved McRae games for the Rally Championships. Realistic tracks with decent length. Lots of tracks in one country and lots of countries in a tournament/championship. Point and time system was well in place. - This is all gone in the DiRT series.\n\nIn WRC4 or in old Colin McRae games you could drive through 6 tracks in Finland. Rank 1st, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 1st and come out 1st overall in Finland. Then proceed to Greek finish 2nd overall in greek move to UK. Finish 4th overall in UK and then judging by that you finish 2nd in the Championship (only there's like 8 countries not just 3).\nYeah, this is not happening in DiRT3 so let's take the look at the biggest flaws of DiRT3:\n\n- Tracks are only 1-3 minutes long (under 3-5 minutes is unacceptable!)\n- No decent championship mode (you can only do like 2-3 tracks in a row. WOW! Not even a full country tournament. Let alone speak of a decent championship with multiple countries in it)\n- All countries and terrains are not there (no desert tracks for an example)\n\nBut DiRT3 has huge pros tho:\n\n+ The best physics you can find in a rally game\n+ Best handling in a rally game\n+ Well detailed tracks and good graphics\n+ Good music\n\nDiRT4 needs to copy tournaments/championships from WRC4 while keeping the handling and physics of DiRT3 and we would have the perfect rally game!\nIt would be the best rally game to date!\n\nConclusion: Altho the tracks are short and there's no real championships in this game...It's still the best on the market. Yes, WRC4 has the perfect tracks and a good championship mode but the way cars handle...and the physics...they're pathetic, really.\nGet DiRT3 if you want to rally...Or any of the older Colin McRae games if you can bare the dated graphics and maybe the lack of a good controller support.\n\n*The complete edition is a free upgrade to the previous DiRT3 version owners.","April 2, 2015","true","45.3"," 76 of 87 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","76","87","7","16"

In fact of all the Codemasters racing titles car handling I think they got right with Dirt 3.\nThere's lots of tracks from around the world and different terrain which include tarmac, concrete, gravel, snow circuits. This is a Rally game but apart from Rally there's RallyCross, Landrush and Head to Head which mix it up a bit which I believe Codemasters latest to the Dirt series Dirt Rally is missing, as that game feels empty to me, no other cars to see except your own isn't my kind of game but each to their own. There's also Trailblazer (like rally only much faster cars) and something I and many others think the game could have done without, Gymkhana. But annoying as Gymkhana is, it does give you a sense of achievment when you manage to get past it.\nThe Online Multiplayer is still populated though to get the most out of it, you would probably need to be in sync with European timezones.\nThis Complete Edition is what it says, complete with all DLC and no Windows live. I liked Dirt 3 before , but with the DLC it's even better and got me into the game again (Windows live wouldn't let me buy the DLC before). Also now it has Steam Achievements.\nIf this game has passed you by until now so you haven't got this in your collection yet or if you like the other Dirt games or even Grid games and want a solid driving game give this a try, especially if it goes on sale.","July 4, 2015","true","107.0"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","62","67","5","13"

Dirt 3.\n\n--------------\nAddendum\n--------------\n\nWell alright, I didn't expect my joke to be at the top, but since we're here now I suppose I'll throw some thoughts about the game out here.\n\nFirst and foremost I just wanna say that sometimes this game looks almost uncanny, some environments in particular look quite photorealistic and while the car models aren't as detailed as in some more recent games, they're still competent and hold up quite well today, although I did notice at least 1 car has really low quality texture dials. Another thing I need to mention is how well this game runs, with practically maxed settings (@AAx2,shadows=med,SSAO=low, rest maxed) this game never really dips below 150fps for me, not even Dirt2 ran this well and let me tell you that at 144hz this is tangibly appreciable in a racing game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a whole lot of fun with many different types of events in a whole lotta different settings, and although I don't really like gymkhana personally, I still think that its a pretty cool addition to a racing game in order to change up the pace every now and then. But what I think sets Dirt 3 apart from just about every other racing game, is how it doesn't really ever get stale because of how it lets you choose lots of different cars from different eras for different events without ever having to buy anything, in fact theres no currency here at all, its all based on your rank, the higher your rank is the more cars you get to choose from, the more encouraged you are to continue trying to beat events and rank up. As far as I know its a unique game structure and it works great.\n\nWith all that in mind, the main reason I felt compelled to recommend this game is obviously because of the removal of the PC gaming disease known as GFWL. I was one of the many people who were afflicted by a seemingly random issue this game had with lagging out every few seconds due to GFWL, thus making it unplayable and with the only potential fix being re-installing windows, thats right, no amount of reinstalling the GFWL software would ever fix it, the only possible, but not guaranteed way to fix that gamebreaking lag was to re-install your whole OS and hope it just worked, it was a nightmare but after several tries(read full OS re-installs) I got it working and played through it a few years back.\n\nSo in the end, probably nobody is happier than me to see this game without GFWL. Now, you may not hear it, but I'm applauding CM with jazz hands for their effort and really hope to see them give the same royal treatment to FUEL in the future.\n\nGaben-blessed /10","April 3, 2015","true","34.2"," 114 of 146 people (78%) found this review helpful 124 people found this review funny","78","114","146","124","14"

I like this game, but only the Rally and RallyCross parts. The single player is fun, and I've had a lot of enjoyment with the multiplayer as well (on weekends).\n\nThe only real downside I see to this game, is that it can be really hard to find a multiplayer group, unless you just do a random Jam Session. If you have specific games or tracks that you like to play, and decide to create a new game, you'll probably sit in the lobby forever, waiting. It's usually the same few people that are playing the game online, so I don't know how large the playerbase really is.\n\nIt's a good game, but don't expect to get a lot out of the multiplayer mode, unless you find some friends that are always willing to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/recommended/321040/","mcmetroracing","MetroRacer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/","111 products in account","I have played nearly all Codemasters' rally games, from the iconic Collin McRae Rally 2.0 to the game we have up now, DiRT3. Collin McRae Rally 0.4 was until now the best of them all, leaving a high level to beat and defeating its trone despite being a 10 year old game. No wonder at Codies they have the formula for the perfect Rally game and they have showed it off throughout the decade, and now DiRT3 is the peak of the saga.\n\nDespite changing the name from Collin McRae Rally to DiRT (after the Scottish Rallying legend death, RIP), the essence keeps the same. It is a casual Rally game with a stunning variety of cars ranging from competitors on the WRC to classic icons like the Renault Alpine, the Peugeot 405 Pikes Peak, the Audi Quattro, etc. The amount of tracks and routes is astonishing, quite well thought and designed to make each stage on a rally be different as it was on the CMR games.\n\nDiRT3 though includes even more game modes and a partnership with Ken Block. That could only have an awesome effect on the game, and indeed it did. There's a huge extension on the Xgames field featuring Rallycross events and buggies among others. So as to the Ken Block thing, there's the famous Gymkhana translated into a game mode in which you  hoon round an area full of obstacles. Plus, of course, his breathtaking Ford Fiesta is included and ridiculously well made. There's also a Gymkhana competition game mode in which you have to work out drifting tricks to earn points to beat other rivals, which adds more excitement to the matter. Ken Block's WRC car is also included in the game, and some cars include a custom Ken Block inspired livery. All this new stuff doesn't leave the initial rally concept apart.\n\nNow that it is fully Steamworks, at Codemasters have made the best of the opportunity to patch certain bugs mostly regarding to shadows and general performance. Another good point from this is the online matchmaking. Although it has few bugs (online is never perfect on any game), matchmaking is quick but sometimes it kicks players itself. Joyride is particularly fun, and it is always challenging to challenge other users on a rally.\n\nGraphically, it's pretty nice. Light effects are everywhere and make the landscape realistic and beautiful. Textures are detailed and fit quite well with a tough-worked modelling of the landscape and track. Cars in that field are well made, some better than others but generally right. In a rally game the dust coming out of the wheels on sand must be dense and accurate, and it actually is in this game. As a tradition in Codemasters, the game is well built and rarely has FPS drops.\n\nHandling is amazingly well made. You can feel the difference between surfaces and every car is completely different from each other. Rallies are then tricky and great fun, top notch work from Codemasters there.\nIf you have never played any racing game on manual gearbox before then this is the time to start off. You'll have to rev up the engine in the shorter gears to make a proper drift and oh, with automatic shifting you cannot.\n\nAI as in all other Codemasters games is superb. Although you'll only face it directly in Rallycross and most Xgames trials, AI won't be dumb and will even make mistakes, resulting in amazing crashes which you have to avoid. More excitement to races.\n\nThe best way to play it is with a Xbox 360 controller. It is the best option for its triggers and full compatibility. Remember that this game used to work on Games For Windows Live, Microsoft brand as Xbox is so...\n\nCodemasters have gone in the right direction when making a honourable successor of the iconic Colin McRae saga. 100% worth all the money.\n\n10/10","April 6, 2015","true","32.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeevFactor/recommended/321040/","DeevFactor","DeevFactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeevFactor/","749 products in account","What we have is a top quality racing game that apparently has an obsession with having capital letters in all except the letter i.  I remember writing my original recommendation of the previous listing of DiRT 3 that it's a racing game and it involves racing on off-road tracks around the world.  Yes, these things still apply and this listing comes with some much needed improvements that people begged Codemasters to make for so long.  I think they got the message when some hooners kept bringing their cars to the offices and kept spinning all over their lawns.\n\nThe team at Codemasters decided that something had to be done.  The evil GWFL army had been keeping the DLC locked away in a heavily fortified Castle of Doom of Dooooooom, holding them hostage while laughing at the poor customers.  "Save the downloadable cars!" cried the minimum wage fast food employee. "I need to unlock the DLC races that prevent me from getting 100% completion."\n\nAnd so the coding masters sent a small army of rallycross and gymkhana drivers including Top Gear USA host Tanner Foust and shoe company owner Ken Block.  Oh, and he also does that whole gymkhana thing.  Rally purists hate him for some reason.\n\nAs the army descends towards the castle, the chief engineer gives some words of support: "OK, the car's ready to go when you are."  With this words said, the Ford Fiestas zoom through the defenses, drifting around corners, spinning donuts to confuse the opposing warriors with huge dust clouds.  Ken Block sees the DLC hovering over a jump.  He radios to the other drivers: "I got this. It'll be a piece of cake.  Mmm... chocolate cake!" He drops the hammer, the tires kicking up dust as his Ford Fiesta RS Rally Car speeds towards the ramp.  The car climbs up the ramp and sails over the gap, his hand reaching out to the bag of captured DLC.  He grabs the bag and the car makes a perfect 11 out of 10 landing shortly after, immediately pulling the handbrake to perform a perfect spin.\n\nFireworks instantly set off, and the crowd cheers loudly.  Al Michaels stands excitedly, yelling out "Do you believe in miracles? YES!" Soccer commentator Rey Hudson goes ballistic in his small sound-proof booth from a studio in Miami, watching the action on a 14-inch CRT TV, "That jump was like the one in the million shot in Star Wars!  Magisterial!" There was a big welcome back parade at the Codemasters offices.  Stacks of Monster energy drinks were freely hurled to the spectators, though I think a few people got sent to the hospital for being struck in the head.  But it doesn't damper the partying one bit.  In his excitement, Christian Stevenson ran up to the gleeful Ken Block and told him this: "That was awesome man! Now upload that footage onto Youtube!" Roll credits.\n\nOh, hold on a second... I was supposed to review a game, was I? Heheh...\n\nYes, this is still the same great game as before, with 120% less GFWL live, all DLC included, and Steam intregations/achievements/etc.","April 13, 2015","true","23.9"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","22","23","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/321040/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","I had played a little bit of DiRT 3 in its GFWL incarnation, but I can't say it really grabbed me. Then the Complete Edition came around and I figured I may as well at least give it another shot, and I'm glad I did. I still have the same problems I did with it then, but I think I've found myself enjoying it regardless.\n\nFirst of all, I suppose some historical context is in order. If you're not aware, the original DiRT is revered by rally fans for its realistic portrayal of the sport, closer to the simulation end of the racing scale than arcade. In DiRT 2 some concessions were made in order to make the game more accessible to a wider audience, but by and large it was still a rally game through and through. DiRT 3 adds yet more accessibility to the formula, though still manages to provide a high skill ceiling for the old fans. DiRT Showdown, which came after this, diluted the rally roots of the game practically out of existence, to the point that it turned off fans of the older style of game that was increasingly disappearing. Then comes DiRT Rally which is now in Early Access and promises a return to the true DiRT formula, focusing solely on rally driving and cutting back on accessibility features like the rewind mechanic.\n\nNow that we've covered some of the history, why does it matter? Well, when it comes to racing games, I tend to prefer games on the arcade end of the spectrum. Games like Mario Kart, where you hold on the gas the whole time, building up the longest drifts you can, are my bag, so to speak. Sometimes I go out of my comfort zone and find games I really enjoy, like Driver San Francisco, but generally the closer to simulation a racing game gets, the less I like it. Nothing necessarily wrong with them; I just don't like playing them. So why would I ever try DiRT 3? Even though it's the most accessible of the "real" DiRT games, it's still at its heart a rally game and definitely not an arcade racer. Mostly idle curiosity. I've played a few even more hardcore sim games just because they're in my library already, never was able to pick up the habit though. DiRT, on the other hand, managed to hook me...on the second try, at least. I suppose I should go into detail about why it failed for me the first time around.\n\nIn my first race...well, my actual first experience in that game was a nightmare partially fueled by GFWL, but that's not relevant to this version so we'll skip ahead. Anyway, in my first race I had the assists level set to Casual. I just wanted to get a quick feel for the game. Drove a little bit, things felt a bit weird, then I noticed that I could just hold the gas and it would completely manage my speed for me, all I had to do was steer. It was just like playing Mario Kart, but...not, in the weirdest way, the car handling felt like it was telling me I could do more, but I felt restricted by the assists. So I decided to turn it up to the next level, Intermediate, which turns off the auto brakes, acceleration, and steering assist (along with an adjustment to AI difficulty). Good, Get rid of the meddling computer so I could actually have some control over the car. There we go, that's much better, now we're getting...in a ditch. And a tree. And every other conceivable hazard. Huh. Well, tried a few more races both ways and neither one's much fun so I think I'll just save some space on my hard drive now.\n\nSo, what changed the second time? It certainly wasn't the difficulty. I tried again on Intermediate and found myself consistently placing 8th when I was consistently placing 1st in Casual. The cars were just too hard to keep under control, and the driving line didn't seem to do a good enough job telling me where to slow down. Maybe it only turns red where you need to brake, rather than anytime your speed is too high, which is what I prefer (along with something like raising the arrows to tell you to speed up). So I decided I would try to live with Casual. It still feels weird, and it makes drifting almost impossible since the ideal driver will slow down to take the turn rather than maintain speed. You rarely have enough speed to make a drift on any turn where it would be worth using. And it also makes "get your top speed above X" challenges hell too because you can't just hold the throttle open whenever you want, the game's going to pick the ideal speed for wherever you are. Anyway, the point is that Casual kind of breaks the driving in un-fun ways, but it's pretty much the only way someone like me can do it. If you already prefer sim racing, rejoice, the handling in this game definitely caters to you. Arcade players like me still have ways to play it, but it really only shines when you can turn the assists off.\n\nMoving on, the races themselves are somewhat varied, though mostly rally-like. It basically boils down to an open rally track or a closed circuit track and then choice of vehicle, but driving a Mini Cooper down the French Riviera in the Monte Carlo Rally feels completely different from driving a large truck through the ski hills of Aspen. Rally races can be mixed up by adding in other racers (all of my hate when one of these buggers messes me up!) or by using slightly different or very different rally cars, some of which aren't even rally cars anymore. Closed circuit races can have trucks and dune buggies, and they can have head to head (Head-2-Head I think they call it) races in parallel tracks at the same time. There's also Gymkhana events, which are basically Tony Hawk in car form. They take place on special stages rather than tracks. They also get progressively more tedious as they get harder. Oh, and there's other little things like Drift Challenges, but since I have to play with all the assists on normally I don't have nearly enough practice drifting to take those on.\n\nThe game is pretty solid on a technical level. Despite my weak machine I can manage above 30, usually 40 FPS at the lowest settings, and it certainly doesn't look bad at them. In fact, nighttime stages I feel bear special mention. The lights on those stages just look beautiful. They aren't anything fancy, but they still look great, and though you notice every time your brake lights come on, they never really distract you either. They're well crafted, simple effects that enhance the depth of the game. Another small detail I really liked was the spinning fans (I assume for a turbo, they even spin faster when you give it gas) in the backs of some of the vehicles. Makes me feel a bit like driving a jet or something. And it's not really a technical thing, but some of the cars just look so bloody cool. I like looking at this game, I like it a lot.\n\nWell that was a lot more of an essay than I was intending to write, but to sum it up I'd say I'd definitely recommend the game. If you like sim racing games, this has plenty for you. If you like arcade racing games the recommendation is a little weaker, but it still may be worth giving it a try. Even if you're stuck playing on Casual you might still be able to find some fun in it like I did. DiRT Rally is setting up to be a better game for the sim crowd and is only $5 more at the moment, but it's an Early Access title (which in itself rubs some people the wrong way) so you've only got part of the game now instead of the most DiRT 3 there's ever been, and DiRT 3's significantly more likely to go on sale to boot. So the hardest of the hardcore might be better served by Rally in the long run (though buying both would certainly not be a bad decision), but if you're on the fence about rally racing games at all, picking up DiRT 3 on sale seems like a good way to get into it.","May 17, 2015","true","8.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

They made racing games for the ZX Spectrum. <3\n\nThen they made DiRT 3 and suddenly we were all alienated.\n\nLong story short, DiRT 3 used GFWL and rarely ever worked. It has now been ripped out, this now uses Steamworks, so I get to review it! Yay!\n\n---------------------------\n\nOkay so now that is out of the way! DiRT 3 is a sequel to, yup, DiRT 1 and 2. but of course these were known as Colin McRae Dirt. Codemasters started out in the 1990's with a license from Colin McRae and Nicky Grist to use them in games and it became such a success they are often regarded as some of the best rally games out there. Whilst not a full on simulation, they are highly regarded amongst fans of the genre and or rallying itself.\n\nDiRT 3 starts off as an okay-ish game. We have our usual arcade handling, our usual graphics for the time and effects, and we have a ton of cars with choosable skins. We also have Ken Blocks Gymkhana. Now that last one is hit or miss with people as is RallyX, but we shall get to that.\n\nThe rallying in this game is much more than DiRT 2 and more along the lines of the original CMR games, being a much more integrated part of the game compared to D2, which had a lot of other forms of off road racing. Whilst this is all good, these games are what made Codemasters, and they were started from rallying. Pure, rallying. So cannot help to let the fans moan. I moan too!\n\nThe Rally Cross features and Gymkhana, are "okay", but really knock home that this game has been developed in the "simcade" setting (i.e. Arcade/Simulation). But saying that, if you can get a good score in Ken Block's idea of racing, congrats! Because I cannot! :D\n\nThe game as a whole is an interesting concept and you can feel that Codemasters wanted to give the long time fans some more rallying but whilst keeping newer and younger fans engaged with the pop culture of Ken Block and Monster Energy. For the latter I can understand as they may be the newer market, however us long time fans are what kept the game afloat so I think we need our place in the game too.\n\nThis "Complete Edition", after having been moved from GFWL to Steamworks, because of the wait, all DLC from the GFWL have been included so you do not need to buy them again. Any key you had for it will work, such as if you picked up a physical copy. Also of note, if you own DiRT 3, you own this too so install and enjoy.\n\nAs with most racers I recommend a G25/7 for this as it does add a somewhat better feel to the overall game.","June 29, 2015","true","2.1"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","1"

This game came out 4 years ago, yet it's still mindblowing. You can drive in four continents, in cities, on the savanna, among pine trees and nice lakes. In one word, I enjoyed all the maps and places.\n- great sound effects and musics.\n- on casual, it is a piece of a cake, while on advanced, it is like a simulator. I played on advanced and from the driver's view, and it imitated real driving experience more than well.\n- imaginative interface. High five to the guys who designed it.\n- cars from all types and ages. Everybody can find his/her own favorite.\n- random (I assume) events occur during the races. Rarely, but cars drift out, pile up, etc.\n\n\nThings I didn't like. (hated sometimes):\n- the game gets repetitive. Don't know if it is like that in real rally, but the tracks are mirrored. Not once, not twice, but many times. Oh man, it's a new season, another chance to prove yourself - says my mechanic. Then it turns out the race is the same, but this time it is backwards. I was extremely bored after the 3rd season.\n- the game cheats. The f***ing bots on advanced go like a madman, regardless of the conditions and the laws of physics. Let me give you an example: I went let's say 3:02 on advanced (hard) and achieved 6th place out of 8. Then I switched to casual (easy) and did it in 2:55 and was first, AND the bot with 3:02 was 2nd. Basically, the game creates their lap times after you did yours, the only difference is, that on advanced it lets you win a very few times, while on casual the time you went could mean you a podium. This is not how selecting difficulty should work.\n\nThe game has lots of opportunities and challenges, so the hardcore drivers can satisfy themselves.\n","September 2, 2015","true","26.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","21","23","3","0"

It has a massive campaign, single player racing and multiplayer racing, stats, achievements, leaderboards and all of that jazz. The game has beautiful graphics and runs extremely well. The racing mechanics are phenomenal and the AI difficulties are balanced. It's everything you could ask for in a rally racing game and now with the Steamworks update, its perfect. Everything is fluid now and the game actually saves your progress and doesn’t require GFWL to run. Good work to the Codemasters dev team.\n\nGraphics: 8.75/10\n\nAudio: 8.25/10\n\nGameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10\n\nRacing Mechanics: 9.5\n\nMultiplayer: 9/10\n\nSingleplayer/Campaign: 8.75/10\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid 9/10.","April 4, 2015","true","27.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

There are so many racing games, most of which have been ruined in my opinion due to yearly releases and obnoxios DLC. Forza, Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, the list goes on. Promising games that started strong and lost their magic as they were turned into money gathering machines.\n\nDiRT has always been an exception. Beautiful graphics, amazing in-menu experience, variety in maps, exceptional handling on the cars. This game has become one of the few "cherished" games I've owned. I bought it originally on Xbox, and bought it again here on Steam.\n\nThe game can be hard if you remove all assists, and crank the difficulty up. Some of the challenges become infuriating at this level. But if you are craving a good time and don't feel like trying at all to get there, turning down said settings provides with a pleasant yet rich experience.\n\nThere is a fantastic selection of cars, most of which handle really just like you would expect. The maps are well designed and pretty, spanning many different divisions, even including a free roam stunt map.\n\nThe multiplayer might be dead now, I'm not sure. But when I played it a while ago, it was a blast with racing, time attack, and even an "infection" tag style gamemode.\n\nDo I recommend this game? With all my heart I do. I'm honestly saddened to put it away. I know it's been a long time waiting for DiRT 4 (Rally), but I don't think it could possibly live up to the funky style that DiRT 3 brought to the racing genre.\n\nGo pick yourself up DiRT 3. You won't be dissapointed, and maybe you'll discover a love for the game as I did.","January 22","true","9.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

The community asked for more Rally races as opposed to RallyCross and other game modes? Great. Code Masters not only emphasize rally racing in the campaign, but also add in a bunch more new game modes (such as gymkana) without managing to take the focus away from rally racing. The game looks beautiful despite running on Code Master's proprietary engine known for using little system resources. The gameplay itself is fast and fun, and provides many different assists for racers of all skills to race like Colin McRae.\n\nHowever, there was outcry as the original version used GFWL, an annoying DRM I didn't really mind but everyone else did. So, Code Masters being the amazing devs they are, decided to remove it. Not only this, but the new version includes all of the DLC, which alone probably equals the cost of the complete edition. And the best part? The update is completely free for existing DiRT owners. Code Masters: Doin things right.\n\nEDIT: I want to address something I haven't seen in too many reviews. I dunno how active the community is but there are a bevy of multiplayer modes, of which many if not all are available for split screen coop.

Nice mix between a sim and arcade. One of those "easy to learn, difficult to master" games. Anyone can jump in and pick up the basics quickly, but there's always room for improvement, room to push yourself just a little bit more to lower your time just that much more. 600+ hours and counting...\n\nPro's:\n\n- GFWL finally removed!  This was huge for this game.  It took longer than expected, but credit Codies for sticking with it and finally getting this  amazing game transfered over to steamworks.  Not only that, but all DLC packs included for owners of the game.  Pretty cool if you ask me.\n\n- Driving engine/physics. The cars handle great and each has it's unique way it reacts to your input. Most classes have various cars that are competitive, so you always see a decent mix of vehicles in online sessions. Also, aside from class B (curse you Lancia Delta!), the DLC cars don't hold any advantage over the base cars.\n\n- Decent tracks. I understand the rally stages aren't what die hard Dirt fans enjoyed in the older games, but they're not bad. While I do enjoy rally, I'm personally into the RX side a little more. Of course I'd like a bigger variety, but I feel like most of the RX tracks pretty well set up, making them competitive and giving good places to set up passes.\n\n- Pretty good community. This is an "old" game, but even still it has a decent online community for it's age.\n\nCons:\n\n-AI is pretty terrible, both for the drivers and the game setups. Even the highest degree of difficulty of RX in single player provides no competitiion at all once you've learned the tracks. Rally is a little bit better, but the problem is all the drivers use the same racing lines for the most part. You don't really see them make mistakes much, they just drive slower on lower difficulties and faster on harder. Too predictable. As for the game setups, on certain game types where AI input is needed, it fails miserably. Example. Cat n' Mouse is a team based game. If you're playing 4 v 4 and one person on one team leaves, and someone else joins, the new person has an equal chance to be placed on either team, so you constantly end up with 5 v 3 or 6 v 2 scenarios by the end of a session. Seems like this would have been something very easy to fix, but never got done. As long as nobody leaves though, you can just set up even teams in the beggining and you'll be fine.\n\nOverall though, I definetely recommend this to any rally/RX fan or racing fan in general.","April 14, 2015","true","25.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The game has an interesting feature called a flashback mode, which costs reputation points to use, but essentially allows you to rewind time to a previous place in the race and get a do-over. It can be costly, but also could mean the difference between 1st Place and last, so it isn't without both merit and potential peril.

I bought the first Dirt 3 (with Windows Live) and it was okay (Put 80 hours into the game). There were a lot of crashes, a little laggy at times and no friend to play with but it did the job. Then one day the Complete edition came into my library and changed everything. Not only did it come with all the DLC but everything got fixed, it's like if they cared about the game (rare to see in the 21st century). The best part was that I payed $0 for the Complete edition. If any other company was in charge of this game they would of tried to suck the money out of me and make me pay pay pay, but they didn't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrei_dmny/recommended/321040/","andrei_dmny","Dmny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrei_dmny/","241 products in account","My personal favourite title in the Dirt series. It's more rally-focused than DiRT 2 and it has a bigger event variety than DiRT 1. It has both rain and snow and visuals held up really well, it still looks pretty even by today's standards (2015). The handling is a great mixture between realism and arcade, feeling believable but not too difficult.\n\n+ Steam achievements and trading cards\n+ All the content that was previously hidden behind the DLC pay wall is now free (Monte Carlo tracks and several cars)\n+ Free upgrade for Dirt 3 owners (great move from Codemasters)\n+ No GFWL (huge change, especially for multiplayer)\n\nThe conversion to Steamworks was worth the wait. For people who never played the game, now it's a good time to do it, it's still the best rally game to date (simulation enthusiasts will say that Rirchard Burns Rally holds that title but this is my opinion). For those who played it when it came out it's a good reason to revisit it and realize that it still is a lot of fun.","April 1, 2015","true","8.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/recommended/321040/","zweistein_Jimmy","monster elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/","226 products in account","Dirt 3 - Complete Edition is the no-GFWL version of Dirt 3.\nIn other words, you can play this game without caring about windows live software and all DLCs are included for free.\nTo put it down perfectly;\nDirt 3 - Complete Edition is the remake any game with bad DRM needs in order to have its digital content expanded with the 100% fully free material that should had already been there at release.\n\nIn other words, as a release product, for me personally, it's the ultimate example for no-DLC ruled full edition game productions.\n\nEveryone who already owns a copy of Dirt 3 gets to have a copy Dirt 3 - Complete Edition for free. Steam version gets automatically added on library while owners from hard copies get to have a free digital copy of Dirt 3 - Complete Edition by registering their old product SN.\n\n\nIF YOU DON'T OWN A COPY OF THE OLD DIRT 3:\nDirt 3 - Complete Edition is the worthy ancestor of Dirt 2. It's an awesome rally game. There are obvious improvements on graphics and physics as well as on some game play options like game modes. You get to see a wide variety of cars and an equally nice set of tracks to run on. There's also those tracks where you can do your tricks and drifts and donuts. There's less advertising of Ken Block (who I personally think is good for doing tricks and drifts but is very bad at rallying) and there's a very nice set of OST music tracks to enjoy. One major thing I miss from Dirt2 was the Malaysia set of tracks. They were PERFECT for me. Instead you get to run on some nice Kenya and Finland tracks but you will never get the jungly feeling Malaysia had. I spent on teh old Dirt 3 more than 60 hours and enjoyed it a LOT. It was an nice game but never had the chance to buy the DCLs. Now with the Dirt 3 - Complete Edition it was all posible so I decided to run and beat everything for once more. It was awesome.\nConpared to the old version, this one is even better and oh hell yes its worth buying!\n\nComparing to the Dirt 3.\n\nPROS:\n✔ Dirt 3 - Complete Edition works without Games For Windows Live. Need to say more? You don't get to bash your head solving issues about disconnection problems and account syncing crashes. Now the game runs on Steam with no user information issues at all. You get to have Steam achievements and Steam tradings cards too inc ase you are into these goodies. This is the way the game should had been at release!\n✔ All DLCs already there and 100% free (as I mentioned) which gives you access to the full list of cars, modes and tracks.\n✔ Enriched list of OST than before. There's a seriously much larger list of OST this time. They are awesome!\n\nCONS:\n✖ Was badly optimized at release. Full screen mode was bugged and crashed but it was fixed about 2 weeks after release. However there's a serious issue with multisample anti-aliasing taking up ubnormal amount of CPU power and can cause crashes (recommended to play with MSAA turned off)\n✖ For most PCs runnign Win 7 and Win 8 types of OSs the game is being installed with a .dll file missing making it unable to launch. it's a minor issue that can be solved. The fix can be found here http://steamcommunity.com/app/321040/discussions/0/611702631212584160/?insideModal=1\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nWith the exception of the minor performance issues this game is great. However many people had to do much searching to make it run properly from the start. I'm not sure how the performance issues occured during the port from Dirt 3 to Dirt 3 - Complete Edition but it's ncie to see the developers still working on it eventhough they already have a new Dirt Rally game to to work on.\nThe game is so exciting that I had no problem playing teh whole thing from start to end even if I already had burned myself with the old version.\nit's a sweet rally experience and it still has all the 2011 graphics engine level of requirements so it can run on most of PCs (provided you are keeping in mind about the msaa issue)!\nit's a 8.5/10 and totally recommended. It might had been lower for making me go through figuring out hardware issues due to its optimization, but hell free DLC and no GFWL?!?! This is how most games should be made and released like!","May 13, 2015","true","32.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","2"

It's beautiful, it sounds amazing, and it will test your skills to the limit with the assists switched off.\n\nBut what if you don't?\n\nRally is not racing like your dad watches on sunday afternoons. Rally is timed point-to-point all terrain racing. Instead of starting all at once or racing individually, drivers have a staggered start. One car will go, then ten seconds later another, until everyone has launched. The goal is not to finish first, the goal is to clock the shortest time between start and finish -- without wrapping your car around a tree, or hucking it off a rainslick cliff, or rolling it into a snowdrift.\n\nOh yes, there are no yellow flags here. You will race in the rain. You will race in the snow. You will race at night, guided only by your navigator's notes and the narrow beam of your headlights. You will race down narrow, bucking forest trails and over frozen tundra and along one-lane mountain cliff face roads and over the dry dusty desert, and you will do it in short, squat little hatchbacks with ludicrously oversized and turbocharged engines blasting absurd torque into all four wheels, still barely enough to cling to the unpaved track.\n\nRally does not require two hours on the circuit to test your endurance.

Some may not know too much of the Colin McRae name nowadays though. As a childhood fan of his, the series and rallying in general I decided to pick up this on sale in the '14 summer sale and it sat in my library doing not much for a long time until this rerelease.\nAs most are well aware, this version includes all DLC previously released and removes the abhorrent GFWL DRM. The visuals of the game are rather pretty especially for a game thats been around for over 4 years. The soundtrack is pretty dull but very quiet and quite easy to ignore especially as there is no in car audio, which I personally like. The driving experience is rather poor with keyboard so I would recommend using either a controller or a driving wheel if you can afford one and I'd also recommend playing on the "hardest" difficulty setting and then changing the ai difficulty if needed as the game gives way too much in the form of assists. The amount of vehicles in the game is a little less than I would like but theres still enough to create variety. A large problem is the amount of tracks in the game though as each of the rallies are just one short track cut up into stages of around 30 seconds to a max of 3 minutes in length and the trailblazer tracks are almost exactly the same and I feel the cars should have longer intervals before being released from the start. Rallycross events give more variety but are rather dull in my opinion. Land Rush events are particularly annoying as they restrict to only one single vehicle which are particularly difficult to control. Gymkhana is mostly just a pain in the ♥♥♥ and can be ignored for the most part.\n\nTL;DR Its a fun game but lacks content to be interesting for more than around 50 hours. If youre a more hardcore rallying fan the DiRT Rally may shape up to your desires but as it is in early access the end game is still quite a way away","June 16, 2015","true","64.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

NOT a racing game. Just juvenile nonsense, covered in music which wil be out of date in ten minutes, endlessly irritating commentary from an international bunch of peons which constantly talk patrionisingly to you (presumably because this is aimed at 10 year olds).\n\nConstant transitions between menus and elements, none of which are skippable. Constant irritating cutscenes showing you animated cars doing silly things, none of which are skippable. Nothing is straightforward to get to, invariably if you want to restart/reach a different menu you WILL have to sit through a transition. Heck, even before each race the game insists on doing a camera sweep down to the car just to look cool before it even shows the pre-race menu.\n\nAs for the racing, once you're actually on a rally track it's great. The problem is these are way, way too short. You have access to tons of cars to start with, so it doesn't feel like there's any progression.\n\nOnto the main element of the game, stupid tricks narrated by an incredibly awkward sounding Ken Block. These are frequent and unavoidable, throwing all pretence of realism, narrative or game progression out the window, resorting to Tony Hawk style trick competitions in order for you to continue in your rally career. Uh-huh, because that's how rally works in real life right?\n\nSuch a shame, it could've been a great rally game, if only it were one. Complete the first "season" and you've basically done and seen everything, making the game feel utterly pointless.\n\nOnly the minor plus side the racing, when you actually get to do some is great, and the level of handling adjustability is good, but this game is so up itself it's unbelieveable. Give me Forza any day over this childish, toy car crap.\n\nGlad I got this on sale for a fiver, I'd be asking for a refund if I paid full price!","April 8","false","8.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","11","18","3","1"

Disapointed with the gameplay as i prefer to have rally races as opposed to crowd pleasing stunts.\n\nI would also like to add that in 10 hours of playing, the game has crashed 7 times, always during a good run and with no reason.

I currently have all settings maxed out on a GTX 770 and I get a minimum of 100 FPS, which is great.\n\nFor anyone wondering, you can buy an older version of DiRT 3 online, enter the Steam key in Steam game activation section, and it will then give you the option to upgrade for free to the Complete Edition. This saved me £10 yesterday (I paid £8 inc. VAT).\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that is currently wondering what to play, waiting for GTA V to be released, or just has the urge to play a racing game since there is a lack of decent racing games on Steam.","April 2, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its sequel loses none of those things and also makes some great additions to the formula. Split-screen multiplayer with support for two controllers is now an option, there are more vehicle classes to choose from, gymkhana events and snowy conditions pose fresh challenges, and new multiplayer modes put interesting automotive spins on some first-person shooter favorites.

Fact - not opinion. The reasons for this are straight foward: Its EGO engine is the best racing engine out there, providing the best graphics and realistic physics that provide the best crashes.\n\nPros   One of the best, if not the best rally games (Includes the rest of the DiRT series)\nThe cars actually have weight shift unlike in DiRT 2, where you slide from side to side.\nGraphics are realistic - trees, road side fences, all the small details make the game so much better\nPhysics feel great\nSinglePlayer map is a lot easier to navigate and has a fresh look.\nSinglePlayer is full of challenges, from rally stages, time trial, gymkhana and duels.\nSPLIT SCREEN\nMehs   Tuning is very simple. For indepth tuners, it would be a let down.\nIf you're coming from games like Forza or Grand Turismo, the physics would be hard to get used to at first, but it's fun once you get used to it.\nCons  Multiplayer Servers are really lobby.\nLot's of Cheaters since it has no Anti-Cheat\nConclussion  ....................../´¯/)     NO\n....................,/¯../           MORE\n.................../..../                 GFWL\n............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸\n........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\    HATS\n........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')

Improves on Dirt 2 in a lot of ways, namely the car physics and weather conditions. There is also a wider variety of cars from various eras of rallying, which is cool.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this game is the gymkhana. It's too restricting and punishing to learn. I am a scrappy rally driver. I enjoy throwing my car around the rally tracks while trying to avoid collisions and getting the best times that I can, because that is what gives me an adrenaline rush and what I find fun. Gymkhana is far too restrictive in terms of driving style.\n\nI had the disk based version of this which came with GFWL, but it also required the disk to be in the drive to play it, which was a real pain.\nI was able to register my CD key with Steam and now have the complete edition of Dirt 3 which apparently includes all of the DLC (which was another thing that annoyed me about stock Dirt 3).\n\nIf you are looking for a fun driving game that is somewhere between arcade and a sim, you will likely have a lot of fun with this...Gonna go play a bit now actually! :)","April 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In case you are looking for an extremely fun offroad arcadey racing game, you should get this.\n\nIt has a lenghty campaign mode, even though it becomes boring when you are like halfway through it, has a great arrange of gamemodes (rally, rallycross, trailblazer, head2head, etc) and a nice feeling of progression and great diversity of vehicles.\n\nPlus the strongest thing in the game, awesome online. Really fun with friends, you can have a great time. Also now the game is steamworks, you dont have to worry about the cancer that was gfwl. Plus achievements and extra content comparing to the original Dirt 3.\n\nUnfortunately it has to have crappy stuff in the game, like gymkhana and other ken block related poop (cant use stronger words because of steam censuring lol).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taran_atwal/recommended/321040/","taran_atwal","Taran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taran_atwal/","94 products in account","This is a fantastically crafted visual rally racer that has some of the best graphics a race game can produced to date. On the highest difficulty settings the AI is competitive challenge which will leave you fighting neck and neck till the finish line. Online has mixed ability with many drivers having immense precision. Be sure to have given some time to master your chosen control scheme (keyboard, controller, steering wheel) before jumping online as the majority of players are highly skilful and tactical with steering and blocking techniques. In my opinion out of the few hard-core rally simulation games on Steam this has to be the best to date as the mix of immense graphics and visual effects that will blow your mind, along with great sound (5.1) will immerse you so much you will believe that you’re an actually rally driver. Along with other arcade style events that will bring countless hours of fun with friends in multiplayer you will be sure to have a wonderful time in this game. Another good thing now is that this game has gfwl (Games for Windows Live) removed allowing you to ensure your game is saved and the save is able to be loaded every time and also backed up on Steam Cloud. The removal of gfwl has also yielded major and minor fps improvements for some players. I highly recommend this game and it is worth the full retail price on steam. Having picked it up in the humble bundle myself, I will have to say its a real bargain. If you do manage to get this game cheap from a legitimate source thats a bonus, but in my opinion it’s well worth your hard earned cash no matter what price you pay.\n","April 1, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The GFWL was acceptable, I mean it wasn't as bad as some people made out; it had micro transactions on some cars (which I don't really use anyway) from what I can remember and the online was much worse but I still really enjoyed it.\n\nGood points\n-The actually driving is amazing, I wouldn't say it is semi-arcady because there is no boost, or power ups (like in DiRT Showdown which is pretty good actually) and there is a lot of momentum involved when turning.\n- Graphically it is very nice, lots of options and performs well.\n- The tracks are great as well, there is so many and there is loads of diversity.\n- Lots of racing types rally, rallycross, gymkana, trailblazer etc.\n\nBad points\n- The better you do in a race the more driver rep you will recieve but driver rep only unlocks more cars and you're most likely to already have a car with rwd or 4wd that weighs and has the same power. To be honest I don't care about getting a car I basically already have with different cosmetics.\n- Outside of the actual racing in DiRT 3 is were I feel the game has been let down because there is no customisation or upgrading, it's literally pick a car you've unlocked and race.\n\nDiRT 3 is certainly up there with the best racing games I've played.  The one thing that separates it from other racing games in the gymkana stuff where you bascially just do tricks. To be honest If you want balls to the wall fun I would play DiRT Showdown; it's just basically DiRT 3 but the game actually likes you wrecking other peoples cars, motorstorm is good even though it's not on pc and Flatout 2 is good if you want an arcade game with destrcution. Otherwise if you want a more sporty, more serious racing game play this.","October 24, 2015","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's mostly for the developer/publisher Codemasters.\n\nThe game first came out with GFWL which is effectively cancer, I'm sorry but it is, it's almost as bad as Origin, then Codemasters re-released the game without GFWL attached to it, they went through the effort of removing it and gave a free copy to owners of the old version.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment, how many other developers would have even bothered? Few I imagine.\n\nEven if they only re-released it without GFWL for sales or marketing purposes they didn't have to gift owners a free copy, but they did and they're awesome for that in my books.","October 24, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've historically hated racing games. Doesn't matter much to Dirt 3, the friendliest racing game I've probably ever come across. If you've ever just been playing a free-roam like GTA and feel like all you want is a good race, to drive fast, and get the the thrill of taking a corner and overtaking your opponent, this is your game -- and trust me, even if you don't know crap about racing, Dirt 3 will accomodate you, and leave you wanting more.\n\nYou know Top Gear? It's a great show, right? Dirt 3 is great for the same reason -- it's accessible. A person like me who drives a car for work and literally nothing else can feel like he understands by playing this game. The difficulty settings are super flexible. Whatever you're good at, you can account for it, and get assistance for the parts of driving you're maybe not so great at. The game itself is welcoming, you can get information on everything from the car you've picked, to the specific vehicle settings you've made. Once you've customized it all to your skill level, you can take to the track like a pro, and the replays (accompanied by this game's fantastic soundtrack) will make you look like you know what the hell you're doing.\n\nI'm a complete scrublord when it comes to racing, but Dirt 3 is a fantastic showcase of the genre. Give it a shot at least, it's definitely the most accomodating racing game I've yet to come across.","March 29","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took 250 races or so for me to finish the tooo long Tour (Career Mode) That would have been fine if every car didn't start feeling the same very quick into the game. If it's on sale I would suggest it. For a newer game made in 2015 it has some of the worst lighting ever. I run on ultra 1080p and adjustments won't help this game.

I enjoyed all of the small details and cars that was put into it. I played this game for around 17 hours before then getting bored of it launching in 800x600. I got this game for free of AMD with my CPU.\n\nLets cover the good things! This game is getting quite old now but the graphical detail is absolutley amazing! This game can run well on an AMD chipset well and that was the high poly Finland map. The whole game has realistic sounds and many cars with a full interior. The game has full steering wheel support which I used a couple of times. The game has its best moments but you have to make sure that you turn up the difficulty when playing. The game has a toggleable hud which is usefull for making screenshots. The scenery is amazing it looks realistic even when driving past it at 100+ Mph, the game has small houses and people around every corner. Thankfully the game doesnt have forward facing sprites like the new McRae rally mobile port, however it does produce lag on some slower video cards as I tested with another computer. The game is cheap and very easy to run on old hardware, it runs amazing on a simple setup with a GTX 960 and AMD Apu, you can have hours of fun driving different cars and it never gets repetetive.\n\nNow the negatives. There isnt that many but it does refer to the older version of the game from my expeirence. If you want just rally driving and no drifting career mode requires you to do some challenges that I don't like. The game was originally a Xbox port which makes all the buttons screw up. The game was a pile of crap before the complete edition, its resolution would never change but thats not the point, the complete edition has a frame rate cap and more graphical settings when the old version had none. So focus on the complete edition reviews. My 19+ hours of the game have been complete fun.

While I admit that I don't care a lot for racing games, DiRT 3 packs in enough different tracks and courses that it's enjoyable from start to finish. And this game is loaded with content. It took me 24 hours just to beat the game a single time.\n\nGraphics are very good and the audio is also well done.\n\nTo get the most out of the game, players should definitely remove all the AI Assisting in the options so you're free to tumble and crash. It makes the game more difficult, sure, but also improves immersion a ton.\n\nDifficulty is well balanced. The game offers 8 levels of opponent difficulty so casual racers (like myself) can enjoy a round and racing enthusiasts can also get their fix.\n\nMy only gripe is that at low speeds, the cars seem to turn like 3 trailer semi-trucks, so you're forced to drift at every-single-turn. And at those low speeds, when you start to accelerate again, the cars like to spin out easily.\n\nGood game overall, definite recommendation for both casual and hard core race gamers.","April 5","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yay and nay. It's fun with the gymkhana to buggy events but this game gets old real fast. The vehicles are very limited to tuning and driving in anything other than cockpit view seems real lose. The throttle response seems to be muffed by a tcs or something but all of my assist are off. It took 250 races or so for me to finish the tooo long Tour (Career Mode) That would have been fine if every car didn't start feeling the same very quick into the game. If it's on sale I would suggest it. For a newer game made in 2015 it has some of the worst lighting ever. I run on ultra 1080p and adjustments won't help this game. Solid engine w/o  hickups and I do get addicted to the cockpit views looking around. The scenery is great and nothing to complain about. However the road, snow and reflections are wayyyy to bright.

I've historically hated racing games. Doesn't matter much to Dirt 3, the friendliest racing game I've probably ever come across. If you've ever just been playing a free-roam like GTA and feel like all you want is a good race, to drive fast, and get the the thrill of taking a corner and overtaking your opponent, this is your game -- and trust me, even if you don't know crap about racing, Dirt 3 will accomodate you, and leave you wanting more.\n\nYou know Top Gear? It's a great show, right? Dirt 3 is great for the same reason -- it's accessible. A person like me who drives a car for work and literally nothing else can feel like he understands by playing this game. The difficulty settings are super flexible. Whatever you're good at, you can account for it, and get assistance for the parts of driving you're maybe not so great at. The game itself is welcoming, you can get information on everything from the car you've picked, to the specific vehicle settings you've made. Once you've customized it all to your skill level, you can take to the track like a pro, and the replays (accompanied by this game's fantastic soundtrack) will make you look like you know what the hell you're doing.\n\nI'm a complete scrublord when it comes to racing, but Dirt 3 is a fantastic showcase of the genre. Give it a shot at least, it's definitely the most accomodating racing game I've yet to come across.","March 29","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rally stages are short, pace notes are not the best, but then again it never claimed to be an accurate rally game. Exept rally there are also rallycross races, some gymkhana stuff with drifting and different tricks (not my thing but whatevs), races with buggies and trucks, ... so there is some diversity. It is fun and entertaining, and the cars are fairly easy to drive so the game is easy to get in to. The rallycross is particularly good for a LAN party or some online racing!

I've historically hated racing games. Doesn't matter much to Dirt 3, the friendliest racing game I've probably ever come across. If you've ever just been playing a free-roam like GTA and feel like all you want is a good race, to drive fast, and get the the thrill of taking a corner and overtaking your opponent, this is your game -- and trust me, even if you don't know crap about racing, Dirt 3 will accomodate you, and leave you wanting more.\n\nYou know Top Gear? It's a great show, right? Dirt 3 is great for the same reason -- it's accessible. A person like me who drives a car for work and literally nothing else can feel like he understands by playing this game. The difficulty settings are super flexible. Whatever you're good at, you can account for it, and get assistance for the parts of driving you're maybe not so great at. The game itself is welcoming, you can get information on everything from the car you've picked, to the specific vehicle settings you've made. Once you've customized it all to your skill level, you can take to the track like a pro, and the replays (accompanied by this game's fantastic soundtrack) will make you look like you know what the hell you're doing.\n\nI'm a complete scrublord when it comes to racing, but Dirt 3 is a fantastic showcase of the genre. Give it a shot at least, it's definitely the most accomodating racing game I've yet to come across.","March 29","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grid and Dirt are both great series but one issue that always crept up for me was the repatitiveness of using the same maps over and over or the same game modes or maps/modes being to similiar and ending up essentially the same.\n\nThis game seems to have stepped away from those issues and has alot of variety and I feel good. All the modes and maps are so diffrent that they don't feel the same at all. You have rally cars to super fast formula 1 style cars to trucks and snow maps to dessert maps and more in between.\n\nEverything about this from the graphics to the controls is really great and fun.\n\nThe only downside is some pacing issues where you have to wait for people to stop talking before you can select an item in the menu and stuff like that.\n\nBesides that this is a really good racing game.","May 22","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've always had a distinct love of cars, and always possessed the interest in pushing these amazing machines to their limits. That's where DiRT comes in.\n\nRally racing has been a staple source of entertainment for race fans for decades. The sport involves driving, of course, but the difference here is the location and the conditions. Rally cars are often designed for intense offroad courses and terrible driving conditions, including heavy snow, muddy terrain, and torrential downpours.\n\nDiRT has all of these. While it's not a racing simulator, the game is still an extremely enjoyable experience. It includes a variety of different events that will test your driving abilities. There's classic "Rally," where you individually run a pre-determined course in the fastest time possible. If you've ever watched the X-Games, you've seen "Rallycross," which is more like a classic circuit race, with multiple cars running at the same time. There's "Land Rush," which is similar to Rallycross, but instead involves the use of identical rally trucks or buggies rather than cars from different manufacturers. Finally, "Drift challenges" and "Head2Head" finish up what I've experienced thus far. Drift challenges, one of the most difficult gamemodes in the game, forces you to push your vehicle to the edge as you try to rack up points from drifting around corners. The latter, Head2Head, is a one-versus-one event where you race to complete a track before your opponent, who starts on the opposite end, does the same.\n\nEvery one of these modes makes the DiRT experience a thoroughly enjoyable game.\n\nFinal Word\nDiRT 3: Complete Edition is a slightly outdated game, but the experience is unlike any other game you've ever played. The game runs amazingly on my Core 2 Duo and GTX 660 build, and will probably run just as admirably on even lesser hardware. A word of warning, however, before I conclude my review: I use an Xbox 360 controller to play the game. The analog input is more reliable and beneficial for racing games, in my opinion, than digital keyboard input.\n\nDiRT 3 is probably one of my favorite racing games. If you think you're up to the rally challenge, you may just consider giving it a try!\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am playing my brother's Steam Family-Shared copy of the game. As far as I know, I am still receiving the full experience as it was originally intended by the developers, CodeMasters. If I am not, please let me know!\n\n","June 5","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This review is going to focus mainly on this version of the games performance with my Logitech G27. It takes some fiddling to make it work, I had to turn all the deadzones to 0, and saturation to 100%, as well as maximize all force feedback settings to get the wheels performance acceptable.\n\nThe sequential shifters work great, as they should, but the clutch pedal is utter rubbish. I missed roughly 80% of the shifts with the way it's set up, and I couldn't find a way to adjust deadzones or sensitivity. The H-pattern shifter still works great without the clutch though, so that's a plus.\n\nThe game does not support 900° rotation, which is a huge negative for me in any racing game.\n\nI still recommend the game though, it is great fun, and works exactly as you expect it to with a controller. With a wheel, just realize the games limitations. The 270° or so that you can get out of the wheel does work well about 95% of the time, ibut t's rather unacceptable on hairpin turns and makes correcting the car that much harder in certain situations.","May 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

He also really wants you to upload everything you do to YouTube. You may have a brain hemorrhage just from listening to that guy, so caveat emptor, amigo. Caveat emptor cowabunga extremus.\n\nHere's my novel idea - Throw whoever Ken Block is off a ♥♥♥♥ing mountain, burn whatever stupid focus group made you target a rally game at tweens, and try to make a racing game that's actually about racing cars.\n\nThe racing itself, is good. 60's rally and Group B cars are impeccably designed objects of sheer unadulterated delight. The replays are so pretty, they will kill the eyes in your head.\n\n.. But mostly Dirt 3 just tries to make you hate it for the grotesque bandwagoneering abomination, that it also happens to be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/recommended/321040/","WickedMouse","Wicked Mouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/","110 products in account","DIRT 3 Complete Edition is a "relaunch" (no joke, despite the launch date) of the original Dirt 3 (removed from the store) with a few added twists:\n\n- All DLC is included.\n- Got rid of Games For Windows Live (GFWL).\n- Added SteamWorks support.\n- Added Steam Achievements.\n- Added Trading Cards.\n\nHow is DIRT 3? It's a solid game in the DIRT series, one that goes back to its "roots" of Colin McRae Rally the most compared to its predecessors. Big chunk still includes show elements, like the inclusion of Ken Block's Gymkhana. His ways of taking stunt and drifting parcours with his rally car has earned him the reknown they (developers and publisher) wanted to include. So some part of the "career", called DIRT Tour, will have you do the same kind of stunting and drifting to progress. Other show elements are some small circuit racing, either against 1 or 7 other opponents. Hopefully Codemasters will have their developers go back to the Colin McRae Rally legacy and make a next game 100% rally stages, like old times. (EDIT: It's here now in the form of DiRT Rally! Go check it out!)\n\nControls feel good for keyboard, even on "Intermediate" difficulty settings. Haven't tried with a racing wheel yet and all assists turned off. But judging from the difficulty to control the car with the keyboard that feels like the way to go for the true real experience.\n\nGrahpically the game looks really good and feels well optimised. I run the game on a 1st generation i7 and a Radeon HD 5880 currently and I can run everything on highest settings.\n\nIf you really want to go for the ultimate rally experiences, try to get your hands on the old Colin McRae titles or maybe Richard Burns Rally, if you don't mind outdated graphics. If you don't mind the show elements and, despite being a few years old already, want a great rally experience, get DIRT 3! It's up to you if you want to have it with or without discount (every now and then it joins the steam sales).\nEDIT: As mentioned in the edit earlier: there's now DiRT Rally here on Steam! You GOT to check that out if you're into a pure rally experience!","April 2, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/recommended/321040/","WickedMouse","Wicked Mouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/","110 products in account","DIRT 3 Complete Edition is a "relaunch" (no joke, despite the launch date) of the original Dirt 3 (removed from the store) with a few added twists:\n\n- All DLC is included.\n- Got rid of Games For Windows Live (GFWL).\n- Added SteamWorks support.\n- Added Steam Achievements.\n- Added Trading Cards.\n\nHow is DIRT 3? It's a solid game in the DIRT series, one that goes back to its "roots" of Colin McRae Rally the most compared to its predecessors. Big chunk still includes show elements, like the inclusion of Ken Block's Gymkhana. His ways of taking stunt and drifting parcours with his rally car has earned him the reknown they (developers and publisher) wanted to include. So some part of the "career", called DIRT Tour, will have you do the same kind of stunting and drifting to progress. Other show elements are some small circuit racing, either against 1 or 7 other opponents. Hopefully Codemasters will have their developers go back to the Colin McRae Rally legacy and make a next game 100% rally stages, like old times. (EDIT: It's here now in the form of DiRT Rally! Go check it out!)\n\nControls feel good for keyboard, even on "Intermediate" difficulty settings. Haven't tried with a racing wheel yet and all assists turned off. But judging from the difficulty to control the car with the keyboard that feels like the way to go for the true real experience.\n\nGrahpically the game looks really good and feels well optimised. I run the game on a 1st generation i7 and a Radeon HD 5880 currently and I can run everything on highest settings.\n\nIf you really want to go for the ultimate rally experiences, try to get your hands on the old Colin McRae titles or maybe Richard Burns Rally, if you don't mind outdated graphics. If you don't mind the show elements and, despite being a few years old already, want a great rally experience, get DIRT 3! It's up to you if you want to have it with or without discount (every now and then it joins the steam sales).\nEDIT: As mentioned in the edit earlier: there's now DiRT Rally here on Steam! You GOT to check that out if you're into a pure rally experience!","April 2, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even if you can somehow overlook the laughably immature, dated machismo behind it all, it's just so jarringly out of place compared to the rest of the events that making it forced for tournament progress ruins the entire game before it even has a chance to really take off.\n\nLike, I know I'm not the first to say it, but... it really is that much of a deal-breaker. Stick with the original DiRT if you're fortunate enough to own it or make the jump to DiRT Rally instead; both are guaranteed to be more enjoyable at the end of the day.","January 9","false","2.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notmee/recommended/321040/","notmee","Chan-Tzu Ti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notmee/","302 products in account","Disclaimer: Not a review, more like a '20 seconds into the game impression'.\n\nI really must say that the difficulty settings are broken. It doesn't make sense that I can finish every single race 1st on 'casual' mode with zero effort (read: full throttle, only having to steer along the indicated path), yet consistently trash my car and finish last with the 'intermediate' setting.\n\nI'm playing with a keyboard, but I think the whole auto-braking stuff makes the game WAY too easy on 'casual', yet fairly inconsistent at 'intermediate'. It also seems this game simply wasn't tested properly with a keyboard setup.\n\nTo make things even more strange... the highest difficulty setting actually feels more responsive. This has to do with how it seems less prone to overshooting when steering. The game also really has some strange physics when playing on keyboard. Occassionally the entire input seems just plain gone and at other times it overshoots and can't be corrected. That's just insane. No real car drives like that, not even in a total spin.\n\nAll this aside the game looks and sounds great, with the only thing bothering me a bit is stuff you can't skip in terms of unnecessary voice overs introducing the super obvious.\n\nIt's still recommended, but don't expect a reasonable gameplay experience with keyboard. The dev ignored such a setup completely it seems.","November 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biggranny/recommended/321040/","biggranny","Biggranny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biggranny/","233 products in account","This game was amazing even before the Complete Edition of this, but yet Games for Windows Live was horrible, especially sense it was running alongside steam which made things more difficult, later Microsoft took dwon Windows Live, which partially broke the game and multiplayer. Dirt 3, along with Dirt 2 are one of the best racing games out there, especially if you like Rally or other types of racing.\n--------\nDirt 3 Gameplay: The game has very nice physics, the cars just have the right amount of understeer and oversteer, and each car handles completely differently, and they are all fun to drive. With this, there's a ton of disiplines and modes. The graphics and damage physics also make the game much mroe immersive. There is a decently long campaign in the game, and single races where you can customize them, and multiplayer and more!\n--------\nDirt 3 Graphics: This is a bit of an older game, but the graphics are still pretty good and satisfying, especially when it came out. The textures may be a bit blurry nowadays though. There are plenty of special effects especially on the cars, your car gets dirtier as you drive (depending on what you're driving on), and again car physics make it even better. There is also different weather systems in the game, such as snow, evening, morning, night, fog, etc (May vary with certain maps). The environments are also beautiful and are completely different from eachother.\n--------\nDLC: Well this is the complete package, you are getting the whole game. The DLC includes a few maps and cars, which are all pretty good.\n--------\nDirt 3 Physics (and Damage system): Going along with gameplay, the physics is really what brings people in. The cars are completely effected by the track, such as snow and ice being more slippy, and the damage physics are great, if you have full damaged turned on you can damage your tires, gradually popping them, and also damage your engine, and there's a few more minor things to be damaged, all damage is soft body, and a bunch of components on your car can fall off; such as bumpers, fenders, cracks and dents, exhaust, windows can break and crack, and more. All cars have different damage physics as well.\n--------\nApril Fools update (It was actually legit): Thanks codemasters for giving this out for free if we owned Dirt 3, removing Games for Windows Live, and including all DLC and making things free, so I'll be coming back to this game every now and then.\n--------\nI have over 300+ hours on the real game (not the complete package), both pretty much the same thing, and I enjoyed all moments of it. Once you complete the campaign move to multiplayer, maybe invite some friends, and have a blast, or you can do some of your own customized races and also challenge yourself and review cars, or just mess around overall. There's a lot of freedom in this game.     [ I give it a 9/10 ] It could use longer maps here and there and a few minor improvements.\n--------\nOverall a great game, even if you are just into racing and maybe not all of this rally, trailblazer, etc stuff, you will still like this game.\n--------\nI may add more to this later, let me know if I need to add anything else, and thanks for reading. Go ahead and leave comments if you wish as well.","April 3, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not Dirt Rally, and it doesn't need to be.\n\nThe brillaint thing about Dirt 3 is the factt what we have it. Because while Dirt Rally is focused on being "the ultimate rally simulator" (which it is). Dirt 3 is more fun and playful.\n\nLike the difference between Batman and Superman. You'd get Dirt Rally if all you wanted was a harcore Rally simulator, you'd get Dirt 3 if you wanted a fun, easy to learn Rally game.\n\n\nSo why is Dirt 3 so good, well it's down to a lot of things,\n\n1. Even after all these years it's still fun to play, and since they removed Windows Live, you can now save your progress and go online. Which is brilliant, because now we can my favorite game mode to do online.\n\n\nOUTBREAK. It's basically infection.

When I'm not playing splitscreen, I'm playing solo rallycross with my Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 wheel. Stage rally is also interesting, but the main singleplayer campaign is definitely all super-duper "dude bro, Ken Block rulez, yo!". The driving mechanics are much more newbie-friendly and playing with keyboard, controller, or wheel is all balanced well. The graphics have held up very well and there are plenty of mods to help increase immersion. It supports ultrawide 21:9 natively and works very well on MacOS X too.\n\nWhenever they finally port this to Linux (Dirt Showdown and GRID Autosport are already out on Linux) then I'll pretty much have no reason to ever go back to Windows. It's an addictive game with great driving mechanics and decent graphics. Buy this game, you won't regret it!","January 1","true","32.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My name is ninjaedman1, AKA Wubster B Dubson, and today I have here my review of DiRT 3 Complete Edition. Enjoy!\n\nIf you've ever gotten a raging... N-need to drive rally cars, whether they be the newest and greatest, the classics like the Austin-Mini Cooper and Renault Alpine and even the original Audi Quattro, or even Gymkhana (Jim-cawn-uh) cars and events, then this is the best f*ckin' game for you, and during some Steam sales, it's the greatest bargain at $7.49, which is great for what I (LOTS of emphasis on I) would consider a AAA (Triple A) titled racing game that's up and above Forza Horizon 1's Rally DLC, and Forza Horizon 2's Storm Island DLC as well. You don't have to listen to me per say, (Especially when I'm a hated person since I'm a brony. Oops, didn't mean to put opinion in this) but it's a fantastic game, you just have to have a pretty fast running computer so you don't get lag that throws you off and ruins your time, but that can't be helped from a game that'll require at least 12,000 MB (Mega-Bytes) of memory to download. (And I'd say that it's very much worth temporarily uninstalling CS:GO for a while) So to sum this review up, I adore this game, and it's certainly  a perfect game for anyone else who loves rally racing! (And if you're one of those people who prefer just slow off-roading in big trucks, then another game I would suggest is Spin Tires [I think that's what it's called]) Alrighty then, I'll see you later, and I hope you enjoy this wonderful game, no, better than that, how does experience sound?","January 6","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","1","2","0"

Its not a very rewarding game, you essentially complete races to unlocck more races.

From the 3 codemasters games I have played, this one is the worst. In Dirt 2 the driving was crisp, fast-paced, exciting, and rewarding. You could really feel the track - an essential element to any driving game. GRID is similar. These are all Codemasters games, yet somehow they totally fudged up the driving and vehicle handling in Dirt 3, Let me state why.\n\n- Insanely over-sensitive joystick response.\n- You cannot feel the road\n- Cars feel very slow and very heavy, unlike the agile ralley cars they truly are\n\nAnd my biggest gripe:\n\n- Dirt roads feel as if there is a fresh coat of paint on them. They feel slippery and slimey, not gravely.\n\nThis is a HUGE problem for a rally racing game. The roads need to feel like dirt! This results in the driving feeling sloppy and slow.\n\nHere are a few other negative factors:\n\n- annoying + constant reassurance that is given to me by some unknown "agent", and a sarcastic mechanic.\n- pointless sponsors\n- cannot buy cars\n- uncustomizable cars\n- no money\n\nThis game misses the mark in some critical places that make it unrewarding, frustrating, and boring. Overall, driving in Dirt 3 it feels mundane like a chore. I want to drive for cars, for fame and fortune, and for speed!

Its more like a really overly difficult retro 2D platformer, except 3D and with cars, difficult especially when it comes to "challenges" that makes Gran Turismo seem like Need For Speed (old/good not the crap criterion pumps out).\n\nRaces however adjust to your difficulty settings, which range from controlling a spastic wet noodle on crack cocaine while going through a fit of roid rage and auto drive (just hold the gas, it'll even steer some). Fine tuning it to your own preference can be time consuming.\n\nAs a sim game, they did a good job, except for the part of feeling the car or the road, which is lost somewhere so you have to control a realistic car by memory, luck and retries and guess if it has traction or not. I guess this is why they tossed in the rewind bullcrap along with settings that make the game easier.\n\nCould've sworn I reviewed this before, as a person who likes to complete things 100% this is a nightmare, but if you want to waste money on a pretty car sim with no real intentions past a couple hours go for it.","February 20","false","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

With everything set to Ultra, the game never dropped below 50 FPS. And I found myself watching the entirety of my replays, taking screenshots like a madman (I rarely take photos in real life).\n\nAside from the visuals, the game is great too. The vehicles handle realisticly (coming from someone who actually races 2/4 wheeled on/off road), and react to everything you see (no invisible/clippable objects). There are plenty of assists for non-hardcore racers, as well as difficulty settings, to adjust the challenge to your liking. Though racing expeirence is advised, since rally driving tends to be more technical and reflex heavy than circuit racing. You'll definitely notice a difference when you adjust the vehicle setup (which thankfully returned from DiRT 2), and your mechanic will explain each setting in an easy way for racing newcomers to understand.\n\nThe instant replay "undo" is back; a very handy tool for that one mistake that can ruin an event (also great for seeing which sneaky AI pit manouvered you, without using an "undo"). The menu is simple and elegant, and the game sports a great soundtrack, as well as a convining 3D sound "engine" as you race, surrounding you in the world.\n\nI'd only change two small things: 1. Music during the race (volume controllable too). And 2. An easier way to manually save (if Autosave is disabled), rather than navigating into options to do so.","December 7, 2015","true","47.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The graphics are still good enough for me and also the driving physics are ok. I mean I don't want a hardcore sim like Richard Burn's Rally.\n\nHowever I hugely dislike the fact that I can't choose one car at the beginning and drive the whole campaign with this one car. You basically choose a new car for every race. Even if you wanted to choose the same car every time you can't cause different race types require different types of cars. This makes it impossible to really get better at driving a specific car. You can't adapt to a certain car.\n\nNow for some people this might be no problem.

Upon beginning the very first "Tour" race, I started drifting around the first bend when the car uncontrollably started driving itself in circles, and wouldn't correct regardless of what key I pressed. This was just the start of my problems. Turning, braking, and e-braking didn't stop the car from endlessly going round and round in circles. The "escape" button didn't exit into the menu. Pushing Alt-Tab didn't minimize the game window. Pushing the Windows key wouldn't minimize the game window. Pushing control-alt-delete wouldn't minimize the game window and bring up the Windows Task Manager. See where I'm going with this? The game got stuck driving in circles, and there was NO WAY of pausing or closing out the game. I finally had to grit my teeth and do a hard shutdown of the operating system, which wound up corrupting my installation, forcing me to run the system recovery tool.\nDirt 3 is getting permanently uninstalled from my computer, because I refuse to play a game that not only gets stuck, but also makes it impossible to recover from a stuck state without damaging the operating system.","June 29, 2015","false","0.0"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","8","2","0"

I'll preface my review by saying that if you're a numbskull, you'll enjoy this game.\n\nI absolutely hate this game. I hated it when I realized GFWL was being shoved down my throat, and I hate it now with all the stupid banter and the something-for-the masses flavor that's prevalent in almost all content released in all media these days. I remember when rally games were treated as a niche, and developers catered to those people with the intent to satisfy them, and no one else. Remember Rallisport Challenge? In my mind, that was the last good rally game, and that one came out over 10 years ago. If all you devs don't want to make a good rally game, DON'T MAKE ONE! I have no desire to build a house. You know what I'm NOT going to do? Buy all the materials, build something crappy and sell it to someone in the hopes it doesn't cave in on them and kill them. I keep my damn hands out of any damn thing I don't plan on doing well!\n\n_______________________________\n\nBut maybe you're a film aficionado? By all means get this game. From the moment I started the game until my first race, I think 8 hours had passed with all the stuff like "Click 'race' to race, bro!" or "This is your car, dude! Get in it and see how the wheels spin, yo!" I feel that anyone who needs this kind of handholding to play a racing game should probably go back to school and finish their basic education. I'm serious. Tutorials are one of the major sore points of gaming these days. If someone needs to be led through the game from the first menu screen to the first greenlight, there's something wrong with your target audience. But hey, at least there's 8 hours of stuff you won't need to interact with; sit back and enjoy the dialogue, that's what you came for!\n\n_______________________________\n\nI can't seriously recommend this game. I think I bought it within the first month it was out, having paid too much for it, and spent probably over 100 hours when it was still a GFWL mess. I won't be making that same mistake now, seeing as how THE GAME SAVES WERE NOT TRANSFERED. So what does that mean? It means that this game will go unfinished and if I can actually pawn it off on anyone I will, though I'll probably lose sleep at night over subjecting someone to this disaster of a social-media-esque excuse for interactive entertainment.","April 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/recommended/321040/","Didymuss","Didymuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/","194 products in account","TL;DR - Dirt 2 amazing but was one of the sacrifices to bring down the evil Games for Windows Live. May we honour Dirt 2's memory. Also Dirt 3 is horrendous.\n\nAt one point roughly two years ago as of writing this review, I played Dirt 2, and I absolutely adored it. For the five hours I played the game, I can only remember one bad thing; the god-awful monster truck-ish sections where the vehicles handed like you were racing frigates. Despite this one collosal flaw, which could be avoided even in Career Mode by simply not playing the Monster Frigate races, Dirt 2 was a perfect racing game, easily one of the best I'd played in 5 years.\n\nFast forward a Steam sale and the atrocity that was GfWL being replaced by Steamworks, I was super hyped for Dirt 3, it looked amazing, like Dirt 3 but *bigger*, new tracks, new cars, more fun to be had. As it stands, Codemasters ♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over my hopes and dreams.\n\nSo after booting up and closing what appeared to be a ghost-process three times, it turned out that upon booting and showing the Dirt 3 logo, the game actually minimizes to an unselectable window with no taskbar button. Alright, ok, that's a bit meh but I can work around that with Task Manager, so that's fine.\n\nAt this point, I'd *really* like to go to the options menu and sort out the graphics since I'd rather not play a game with 800*600 resolution and deafining levels of volume, but instead, I get a young lady talking at me, and I'm not allowed to skip. In fact as it happens, you can't skip *anything*, which is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. I should never have to wait for someone who has absolutely no impact on the game talk at me for a good five minutes just so I can drive a car sideways in the snow. Ever. Seriously, Codemasters, this is one of the worst things you could ever do in anything. That shitey new Forza game does that and even the Top Gear presenters don't allow devs to get away with this ♥♥♥♥. Never do it again.\n\nI finally get around to actually playing the game, through the weird nonsensical triangular menus and find that all the brilliant game feel of Dirt 2 has not made it into it's sequel. Cars fly into the air at the slightest jump at the lowest of speeds, and yet they slide endlessly sideways as though they have infinite weight.\n\nCollosal physics issues aside, the biggest issue for me is part of the controls. When one drifts or powerslides (whatever you wish to name it), the idea is that the back end of the car swings out and the driver steers in the opposite direction, applying power to keep the drift going and to turn however tightly or for however long they desire whilst not spinning out. Dirt 3 does the opposite of this, once the back end of the car is swinging out, if one applies power, and thusly forward motion, what actually happens is the car slides off horizontally. Now I don't know about you, reader, but when forward motion is applied to something, that thing tends to begin moving fowards. Not only this, but four wheel drive cars all behave like rear-wheel drive cars, so all the force is applied at the rear of the car, so in the rare chance that the car does not endlessly travel sideways as though it were on sheet ice, it spins. Endlessly.\n\nIt occurs to me that I wrote "collosal physics issues aside" and then brought up more. Never mind, I'm actually going to talk about those control issues now, they're just a little hard to describe and are linked to what I've just written.\n\nTwo paragraphs ago, I wrote about drifting using opposite lock (I've found an article to help me with this so you can just read this if you like, and just assume that Dirt 3 does the opposite of it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_lock ). When a drift actually works in the game, the opposite lock must never be performed. Honestly I'm not entirely sure why. The game seems to want to do it by itself, but also not bother at the same time. If one performs opposite lock to counteract the drift and drive down the road in a straight line, they shall overlap with the game also trying to do it, and end up drifting in the opposite direction. So what the player must do to finish turning is to stop turning, and while this might sound obvious, it doesn't feel obvious in a rally game. Having soemthing be automated to the point of ruining all of the steering in a racing game is inexcusable. Sadly this is something that can only really be experienced rather than be told about.\n\nIt should be noted that I turned off all driver assists at the beginning of the game, as I played it in the same way in Dirt 2, so going into Dirt 3 and finding that both the physics engine and controls had been ruined surprised me somewhat.\n\nSadly I wish that Dirt 2 will get Steamworks, but I'd be kidding myself if I expect that to actually ever happen, as Dirt 3 is the most recent and naturally gains the most attention.\n\nDirt 3 ended up being one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming for me in recent years, especially in the racing genre, so I'm going to play more Hyperdimension Neptunia instead, since that's really rather fun.","April 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 23 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","2","23","0","6"

It's slightly more 'Americanised' than the earlier rally games, but less so than Dirt 2. This game features more realistic rally stages and is a bit less over the top. I'm sure people could pick faults at the realism, but as a rally game it's incredibly fun to play and features things like cockpit views, which are always a good thing in a racing sim.\n\nI bought WRC4 recently and was incredibly disappointed as this game is so much better.\n\nI owned this game for several years on Xbox 360 and after selling it to get a PC, decided I enjoyed this game so much that I would buy it again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/321040/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Rally Racing is the extreme variant of race car driving. It takes the concepts of making a car do laps and blows it up to it's logical intensity. As such, a lot of people are put off of the event from the sheer fact that it requires more concentration and skill to master.\n\nDirt 3 is for one type of fan; a fan that loves extreme sports. If you tire of seeing asphalt and tire marks, then jump into the Dirt! This game excels at its prime goal and doesn't do injustice to its name or legacy. With a staggering amount of game modes and an extensive career, Dirt 3 will keep you busy for a long time.\n\nWhile the menu is a bit combersome, the events are easy to understand. Different types get unlocked as you progress and they all have some variation on the standard point-to-point race type typically associated with rally racing. You get Trailer Blazer (basically Rally but with a muscle car), RallyX (an opponent based, head to head rally race), Head2Head (a unique variant of drag with simultaneous paths), Gymkhana (basically trick mode), and LandRush (Buggies and Trucks, oh my!).\n\nThe campaign might get long in the tooth towards the end, but each level is meticulously designed to be replayable until your eyes bleed. You will notice subtle details each time you make turns or blaze past your opponents. The Direct X 11 support is some of the best I've ever seen on PC (and this is coming from a console based port!).\n\nThe variation in settings does a lot to break up the length of the career mode. Even without the DLC accounted for, each area is distinct in atmosphere and climate. Only Kenya will have dirt roads and only the Netherlands has snow. Each weather variant adds a whole different strategy to how you approach turns or overtake opponents.\n\nFor that matter, the online component is flawless. There are a few additional game modes, too. They are basically new takes on classic shooter game modes with capture the flag and infection (deathmatch) making an appearance. You are also given access to the DC Compound online, which is essentially a free roaming area where you can bust tricks and search for hidden icons.\n\nThe DC Compound rounds out the single-player mode, as well. If you get bored with racing for a bit, you can jump over to the compound and complete an extensive list of bonus missions. They may not offer up much in terms of reward, but setting your sights on a different set of requirements allows one to hone their skills without the pressure of a timer or rivals.\n\nTo cap off everything, Dirt 3 has one of the best learning curves I've experienced in any racing game. While the DC Challenges will destroy your body, mind and soul upon first encountering them, the way in which each campaign event trains your basic skills is so organic that you will never even notice yourself getting better.\n\nYou might struggle with breaking a high score in Gymkhana or nailing a speed-run time, but if you just progress through the career and come back, you will almost certainly have subtlely learned how to perform the best tricks and maneuvers to cut seconds off of your time.\n\nThat the game doesn't prevent you from gaining new cars with arbitrary money limitations is just icing on the cake. By playing more and getting better, you eventually will have every vehicle at your disposal. Such an elegant system is wonderful to behold.\n\nAbout my only problem with this game comes from the inclusion of the DLC from the get-go. Extra events are added that aren't necessarily harder and some pretty high-level cars are given to you at the start. This allows you to blow past the career mode with ease, should you choose to go that route.\n\nIt is a little unfortunate as it undermines how well thought-out progression was in the base version of the game, but I suppose paying for that extra content (originally) would be pointless if it was locked out. I really think Codemasters should have rethought the reputation system for the PC release of "Complete".\n\nAnd to address the big elephant in the room, Steamworks is great. Dirt 3 is absent of any trapping from GfWL. This means that there are no infuriating crashes or unstable performance. Everything is flawless and friends can easily be joined from Steam. That it was given as a free upgrade to existing owners is amazing.\n\nThe only way I wouldn't recommend Dirt 3 is if you really just don't like rally racing games. If you fancy a more wild experience on wheels or just want something different, don't hesitate to grab this game.\n\n9/10","April 23, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rally sections are easily the best, no other game quite conveys the feeling of hurtling through rough terrain on the edge of what your car can do. The trailblazer events are also much fun, with the stadium events a little bit behind that. The gymkhana variations are the only standout parts I really don't like and I just get them of the way as quickly as possible with any medal. However, overall there's more than enough great racing to be had here. Maxed out it still looks very nice, and the replays are probably the best of any racing game. The voice acting, it being terrible acted, badly written, patronising and unskippabble, I could really live without. Any quibbles though, now that GFWL live is at long last gone, are minor.

Perfect physics, realistic graphics, and detailed environment create a massive amount of atmosphere.

No more FPS drops from GFWL clunky client and problems logging in. Even though this game does not show it's age, it's about 4-5 years old -- that fact, along with Codemaster's polished and optimized scripts, allow this game to run extremely well even on some of the most dated systems.

I do not consider myself being a seasoned driver or anything like that, however only the final 6th AI difficulty level poses any real challenge to me and I can grab 1st places rather easily even on the 5th level of difficulty.\n\nFor any Mac users that are considering grabbing this, the performance is great under Mac OSX Yosemite on my late 2012 iMac 3.4 Intel CPU and GTX 680MX 2048 MB graphics card. I play at 1440p with everything set on HIGH except post-processing which is set on MEDIUM. These are the default settings though, so maybe the latter can also be bumped up higher, but I was not too fussed trying as the game looked great and played smoothly. The Xbox360 conroller for PC is fully supported by this game on a Mac, which is a pleasant surprise.","April 7, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't say I've ever had too much trouble out of GFWL outside of rememberign the password to it. Still, it is less hassle to deal with and makes the overall experience that much nicer.  Personally, I do not care for the Gymkhana aspect at all... it would be one thing if it were optional, but to be a forced part of a supposed rally experience is absurd.  There many great aspects of actual rally racing to excite new fans into the genre.. no need for acarde flash.\n\nI hope there is a 4th iteration in the works, and a career mode where you can start your own team and improve the cars would be a welcome addition to me.\n\nWould recommend on sale, would not recommend at $30 for this 4 year old game.","April 4, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rally sections are easily the best, no other game quite conveys the feeling of hurtling through rough terrain on the edge of what your car can do. The trailblazer events are also much fun, with the stadium events a little bit behind that. The gymkhana variations are the only standout parts I really don't like and I just get them of the way as quickly as possible with any medal. However, overall there's more than enough great racing to be had here. Maxed out it still looks very nice, and the replays are probably the best of any racing game. The voice acting, it being terrible acted, badly written, patronising and unskippabble, I could really live without. Any quibbles though, now that GFWL live is at long last gone, are minor.

Really fantastic work. The game itself is the best rally game I have played. If you like racing games with both arcade and realism characteristics, I strongly suggest that you take a look at this game.

The selection of cars is amazing from the historical 60's to the legendary Group B to the open class of modern team cars like Redbull and Monster.\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is the inclusion of Gymkhana events.  I could care less of gymkhana and Ken Block's exploits.  The gymkhana events I feel tend to break the overall feel of the game.
