"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/271760/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","I own and have beaten both the Collector's Edition and remixed versions.\n---\nHave you ever sat cross-legged with your left hand on your cheek, searching for that hidden gem RPG among the crowd? Congratulations, you may have just found that. If you're a fan of Bioware's old RPGs and older games such as Summoner, Severance, Enclave, Deathtrap Dungeon, Die by the Sword and the Elder Scrolls games there is a high chance you're going to really enjoy this one. Dungeon Lords is an old, but obscure, aged yet playable third person CRPG. The game supports unlocked framerate and fps in-game (unfortunately the menus are 23fps locked), which already puts half of modern PC ports to shame. For a 2005 remastered port, this is impressive. Now, what differs this game from other RPGs even ones considered masterpieces is what the game offers and how it presents itself.\n\nThose games I listed? Combine them together, imagine they poly morphed as one game and grew up with just one parent. That's this game in a nutshell. The game offers real time combat with hotkeys, status screens, doll-like inventory, real-time changing portraits, and much more, which would take me beyond the word limit to list. Dungeon Lords also offers a point and click mode, which brings the cursor on-screen so you can play it like a traditional MMO, or you can just stick with the default action control system. The bog standard difficulty mode is there but in addition to a random encounter chance slider. No, that doesn't mean your world transitions into a "battle mode" ala Final Fantasy, it just means the chance of random mob spawns. There's options for view distance, individual audio sliders, camera smoothness, mouse sensitivity + inversion... it goes on.\n\nNow, the meat of the game. It's a 2005 game so it will lack modern polish and care, hence the single parent bad joke I made. Some animations, sound effects, the voice acting and the general ware and tare feel of the game is quirky and aged, HOWEVER, I actually think this compliments the vibrant art scheme of the graphics in a strange and twisted way. The graphic fidelity isn't high as you'd expect, but they remind me of Morrowind and Neverwinter Nights 2, to compare. Just don't expect lots of NPCs and text boxes on screen all at one time.\n\nThe game features a class system, m/f, different races and starting kits kind of like Dragon Age. If you're aware of Bethesda games they offer freedom, go anywhere, do what you want. Well... this game has that, too. You can completely ignore the main quest and go do your own thing and now with up to eight player co-op, this will be immensely fun. Yes, eight players with this Steam version. Modern RPGs struggle with just two. Cool isn't it?\n\nBack to gameplay, there's your typical cooldowns for spells and skills, you attack spam with clicks and opposite click for shield blocking. This is where it reminds me of the Summoner and even the Dark Souls games. It has that sort of "personalisation" feel to it, the roleplaying has emphasis and it feels like you're going on a medieval adventure. The game's atmosphere in certain dungeons really has that Dark Souls and Severance aesthetic and eeriness. Speaking of, since this is an old CRPG with some Dungeons and Dragons rulesets, the game feels traditional and does nothing more to innovate beyond that. Which can be seen as good or bad to you. The game has your main quest, side quests, towns to barter and learn rumours from, and dungeons to go explore for loot. There's orcs, skeletons, crows, atypical mythical beasts to fight, the sort of stuff that's commonplace in fantasy lore.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, this isn't the best CRPG out there and PERSONALLY I do think it can match Bioware's old material and hell even beat older CRPGs like those wave of DOS ones from the 90s. BUT. And I mean BUT. Dungeon Lords feels very unpolished, as said, mixed in with a lack of hand-holding and a truly investing story, you might find yourself becoming bored quickly if you're looking for that "different and unqiue" RPG experience. Although, the game does differentiate itself amongst other CRPGs of the same genre. However, Dungeon Lords is your traditional and tried-and-true from start to finish. There's no forced romance, no deep epic companions or dialogue and quotes that will eventually end up as memes, dialogue wheels that don't actually effect anything and a voiced protagonist. But what you're getting is a quirky yet enjoyable CRPG that is built around:\n-Customisation\n-Roleplaying\n-Freedom\n-Old school feel\n\nIf any, or all, of those concepts interest you I urge you to check this one out. I've beaten both versions of this game, alone, and I love it. However, I'm aware that it won't appeal to everybody DESPITE the game having tuns of options to mess with like a girl and her make-up. So please, if you enjoyed this review, check the game out and have fun! Give a friend a call, try the co-op and thanks for reading! Now, you may uncross your legs and place your left hand on the desk. :)","December 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 186 of 216 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","186","216","19","15"

Is the game good? Not at all! Is it fun? Yes. Yes it is.\n\nBrief history lesson: Heuristic Park released version 1.0 of Dungeon Lords in 2005. It received patches in the classic sense - update files that you download, execute, point toward your install folder and let it to the work. These patches, however, didn't do much as far as I'm aware.\n\nMy history with it was that I got the Collector's Edition, a special rerelease which fixed several bugs and had a new character class and a tonne of new content! I found it when I was rather young at a dollar store. I didn't know why an RPG of such scale was in a dollar store, but lo and behold! I get back home, pop it into my Windows XP computer and give it a launch. The game was buggy, with spells like Freezing Touch and Burning Hands not working, and all sorts of great stuff.\n\nI originally wrote off the acrobatics system as faulty, however it didn't tell me that you needed certain ranks in the Acrobatics skill to use certain dodge rolls and flips. This was pretty nice, albeit unexplained. Perhaps the Freezing Touch and Burning Hands problem was a matter of the skill system too? I don't know.\n\nThe matter at hand here is that the game was rereleased in 2012 in the form you see now. It was entirely reworked: An engine overhaul, new systems, fancy effects, a point-and-click mode, etc.\n\nThe original version of the game always had co-op, through LAN or internet play. Now, we have Steam for eight-player co-op.\n\nI'm going to highlight some of the main differences between the versions here:\n\nThe spell system: In the original, you could usually find spells out in the wilderness as loot, and depending on your starting class you may have started with one or two. As far as I know you may have been able to put ranks in any type of magic skill and use it, but I may be wrong. In this Steam Edition, you get one spell per level, and each class seems to have a certain type of magic they use, that they learn each level.\n\nThe skill system: In the original, there were many types of skills, and you could rank up in any one you pleased using a skill point. In this version of the game, your skills gain experience in a similar way to how you level up in The Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy II: You use something, it gains experience. You gain skill points every level, but if you use one on a skill, it just gives it an experience boost, and will not guarantee a level up. I'm personally not much a fan of this.\n\nThe graphics: The game now has fancy bloom and fog, and WORKING particle effects! The UI is a little less polished than it originally was, but I still find it enjoyable.\n\nThe multiplayer: Hoo boy, is this game a hoot to play online. The bugs or simple obscurity of practically EVERYTHING in this game makes this game a laugh to play with others. The Collector's Edition is absolutely riddled with bugs or quirks, while the netcode works well. Saves are confusing, but the bugs and problems make the game hilarious! I have yet to test the game in this Steam Edition, but various skills now apply to your allies as well as yourself. It creates a new dynamic that wasn't present in the original.\n\nThe verdict: Not mentioned above: The physics of this version aren't as... Tight, so to say, as the original/Collector's Edition, and the old spell system was quite nice. This version's difficulty seems much easier than the original's, and in the first dungeon alone I leveled up five times more than I usually did in the original! This isn't so much a problem, but it's interesting to say the least.\n\nIf you want a solid RPG and don't mind the price tag, get this version! If you want a laugh and a more solid system (WHEN it works) then play the original or the Collector's Edition. Either way, it's an RPG on the PC with cooperative multiplayer. A+ From me!","December 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","45","50","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nvshadow/recommended/271760/","nvshadow","#NV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nvshadow/","265 products in account","'Dungeon Lords Steam Edition' - maybe another way to call it would be:\n'Okay boys, Dungeon Lords Take #4: Let's try not to screw it up this time. Lights, camera, action!'\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n'Tl;dr'\nFirst the good part': This time it seems the developers care for the game as they released their first patch after the release. This one adressed several problems in MP - unfortunately the SP seems mostly untouched. So now it's important to see if they release more patches to fix bugs and glitches or if it was a one-time wonder.\n\n'Fans' of the old Dungeon Lords:\n\nThis version is better than 'MMXII' but if there was a bug or glitch in the original version it's quite possible that it is still there and wasn't fixed. However the game is more accessible (there are e.g. finally tool tips for skills and spells), a quest log gives you some hints where to go and the randomized loot is quite interesting - so there are several positive changes. However maybe it would be better to wait some more weeks and see if the developers now actually care for their game and support SP and MP it or if it will be abandonned once more.\n\n'Newcomers' who have never heard of or played the original game:\n\nIt's probably better to skip this game, there are better RPGs out there. It has its own charm (quite trashy and retro) but to find the positive things you have to dig deep in a game full of bulky and weird systems and design decisions.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOh Lord, that game is like an undead, It was a bit rotten the first time it was released in 2005 (and full of bugs), afterwards it came back in an 'improved' version (still a buggy mess) and some years after it returned from its grave with the 'MMXII' version (did I mention the bugs?) that had 'improved systems' (official claim) and some nice function additions - however at the same time they also screwed up the once good leveling and magic system and removed interesting features like identification, the whole exploring aspect or the penalty systems. I regretted buying this game quite fast.\n\nWell so now here's the Steam Edition that is based on an improved 'MMXII' version and should finally act as a 'complete and finished' version. So do all good things come in... fours?\n\nFirst there is to say that the original game was neither very good nor very polished but it had its own charm. 'Dungeon Lords' provided some very interesting concepts (e.g. the nice character and class system that I still remember in very good ways), challenging dungeons with good puzzles, interesting secrets (like the 'Demon Key' from 'Naga Temple') and had a great 'retro' feel. It wasn't very special but back then it entertained me quite good despite the many flaws.\nSeriously there was a ton of bugs, terrible game design decisions and glitches: awful animations, missing loading screens, absolutely empty cities and buildings, nearly everything was unfunctional, figuring out stuff was made in hell (tutorial or explanations of the items/spells/skills... what's that?) and it felt like a bulky mess overall.\nHowever I enjoyed it for quite some time back then and I still remember my badass Ninjutsu-Nethermagic character (Rogue + Mage class combination) in a good way.\n\nUnfortunately they changed the game a lot back in the 'MMXII' version: they e.g. swaped the skill system for a cookie-cutter version, the new magic system was 'boring' and much stuff was still not working as intended. Anyway the worst thing was that they abandoned the 'new' game very fast and didn't care for updates or fixes for the problems.\nTogether with some others I voluntereed as tester and translator for the german version and spent many hours with translating the tool tips and looking for glitches and bugs (trust me, that list was long) but in the end it didn't even matter (many hours were wasted back then).\n\nSo now there's this 'new' version and I've been looking at it with a lot of critical thoughts in mind. However I thought 'Can't be worse than the last version' and started another 'adventure'. That was some hours ago...\n\n... and I can say it's better. Way better than the MMXII version and in most parts better than the original version. I didn't encounter any huge bugs or crashes (the small ones they belong to the game like heat to fire), they finally added necessary options and higher difficulties, changing your weapon manually is possible once again and the map's hidden again.\nBesides there is also the good stuff from 'MMXII' like the way better interface, hotkeys for spells and items, randomized loot and tool tips. They improved the weird systems to make them kind of okay (I'd still kill for the old character and class system) and overall it's running quite smoothly (in comparison to the 'whole time stuttering' and the awful loading times of the earlier versions'...).\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo... can I recommend the game? Well that's a difficult question.\n\nThe 'Steam Edition' version is definitely 'okay' and way better than the last one but it's necessary to see what the developers will do with all the feedback and the information they are now able to get from the players. Will they fix stuff (e.g. the problem with the lines/voice of NPCs: if you click at a person several times he will repeat his whole dialogue that many times. That's absolutely awful ingame) or abandon the game like the last version? They released one patch that adressed the MP but I would prefer improvements to the SP.\n\nIn addition it's 'Dungeon Lords' - that game was a special kind of trashy RPG and will stay that way no matter what you'll do. The animations are awful, the world's empty, the story has more clichés than an 80's movie, the technical aspects are totally outdated, it feels horrible in so many ways...\n... but damned, I still kind of like it. It's such a special game. In a way somebody would say 'Oh he's such a special boy'. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 (maybe only because the original version was one of the first RPGs I've ever played and there are some good memories besides bugs and glitches...)\n\nI trend towards a recommendation, but mostly for players of the original 'Dungeon Lords' who didn't already hate it back then. However the recommendation depends totally on the question if the developers are willing to continue the support for the game. Else it will fail the same way as its 'parents'. There's much stuff to fix but deep down there's potential for a nice entertaining oldschool RPG. Maybe you should wait grabbing it until the developers show that they now care for their game and support it with fixes and patches...\n\nAnd for most of the others ones, who have never played or even heard of 'Dungeon Lords'  (probably 85%): Skip it, there's better stuff out there. Way better stuff. There are too many bad design decisions and bulky systems to bother with until you may see some positive aspects. However the RPG has definitely potential for some hilarious and funny times - and if it only be due to bugs, glitches or weird things happening and you raging about everything.","February 16","true","7.3"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","41","44","9","3"

Have you ever wanted to scrach that classic fantasy itch for some grand wizards with epic names pronouncing "Evil" in a silly way?  Or huge monsters smashing everything around them with wooden clubs? Or maybe giant red dragons spitting fireballs at you? Then this game is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nYou are either a Human, Elf, Dwarf, Lizard or one of the creatures of the forests called "demigoths" (Furry things), who is either a Warrior, Priest (of sorts), Mage or Rogue, each having various different abilities and mulitple ways to build his character. Like for example as a Rogue, you can either use a bow, axes, daggers or throwing weapons, and may only pick 2 at a time all while you get to level things like summoning power, lockingpicking skills, sneak skill, etc. making 1 class feel more like 3.  On top of that your character has the usual stats like Agility, Strenght, Intellect, etc. which you get to increase every level.\n\nOnce you know what you want to be, you just jump into the world. It's a visible 2005 game, the best way I could describe the graphics is that they look like Vanilla WoW but better in every way. I really doubt you will have any problems with them, for 2005, they look amazing. And some of the really well made models and enemy facial animations made it age well.\n\nThere are some other things that make the game look like an MMO. The action bar (where your abilities are placed) looks 1 to 1 like an MMO action bar, the way you level and gain experience and the way you get new loot and equip it are also identical to an MMO. The similarities really end there however. There aren't any quest markers, or tab-target combat or pointless mobs or grindy quests.\n\nInfact, the combat and the overall gameplay experience you will have really makes me love this game. There is just something about how the arrows fly, how the throwing weapons get stuck in the creature until it dies, how powerful spells feel really powerful. That something is something rare and amazing, something that you could play hundreds of really popular RPGs and never find, something that makes every hit you deal in this game feel great. KNOCKBACK! Yes, this game has knockback. You know how in Elder Scroll games like Skyrim, you just take up your sword and slash at the opponent while he is slashing at you, making it a dull cut or smash fight until one of you suddenly falls down? Or how shooting fire at them will cause them to just stand there until they fall down dead? There is none of that here.\n\nIf you have 2 daggers and you are stabbing someone your size with them, they will get knockbacked with every single hit, making it look like you are actually doing some damage, same goes with arrows, spells, axes, maces, whatever! Every single hit feels like it counts. I know it seems like a small thing, but it makes the combat much, much better. Combine that with crazy monster abilities, like Trolls killing you in one massive blow or goblins on huge stake launchers. And you will find that combat will often be great fun.\n\nThe quests include great puzzles, nice storylines, and they will never hold your hand. Most of the time you are given very little actual information and have to figure it out yourself. Like early on in the game where you told to find this Elven village, yet were never told where it is and just have to randomly walk off into the forest. Probably getting attacked by wolves and all kinds of beasts instead.\n\nThere are of course bad things, which, I might add, are often completely overblown by some people, bugs were common and would often prevent progression, I haven't run into any so far, and the hope is that they removed them all, but you can never be sure. On top of that, quests provide TOO little information in certain cases, like this Vampire who will tell you you should meet her behind a mansion on the south side of a town, I've been running around for hours and couldn't find anything, that is a case where a quest lacking information didn't lead to more attention or immersion, but just confusion and a waste of time. The quests can be very badly written sometimes and just feel awkward, but that might be likable to some. The game was unfinished when it was released, and you can certainly see it some areas.\n\nTL;DR Good:\n-Combat is really good because of knockback and aiming.\n-Classic fantasy theme\n-Plenty of ways to play and build your character\n-Great graphics for the time\n-Good quests that never hold your hand\n-65~ hours worth of gameplay\n-Large amounts of different enemies\n-Plenty of loot and abilities\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes badly written quests\n-The possibility of bugs remaining\n-Certain quests that provide TOO little information, leading to waste of time doing the wrong thing.\n-A few unfinished areas in certain places.\n\nMake of it what you want:\n-Mobs seem to endlessly respawn in certain dungeons\n-MMO-like action bar that you need to press\n\nOverall, buy it if you want an amazing old-school kind of Fantasy RPG experience. It could have been better, but by the end of the day it's a great game that is simply fun to play.","December 25, 2015","true","15.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

Also, the change to the class/skills means that alot of the freedom of the original game has been lost, as you are no longer free to spend your experience to increase your skills and attributes as you wish, instead having a much more limited pool of attribute and skill points gained each level.  And, you no longer have 2 Basic, 2 Advanced, and 1 Master class, but 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, and 1 Master, decreasing your options even more.\n\nStill, it's a decent enough RPG, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.","January 3","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

Save again and reload the other players into the game.\n- the lagg can be silly, simply unplayable.\n\nDungeon Lords Steam Edition is one of many tries to release a proper playable version of it. And against all odds I have to say they finally did it. You can play the game without any gamebreaking hickups if you dont bug yourself across borders you shouldnt be able to pass yet or to jump behind doors you activated and can only be activated by that lever and be stuck behind it.\n\nThe gameplay is fun even doe the challenge isnt really there, once you hit the highest levels every mob is laughably easy and if you have randomized loot that rolled a tad too high (yes iam looking at you pants with 500 armor) they dont even deal damage to you at all anymore. Except all the little flaws, like ranged combat being way to weak to have proper uses other than cheesing way to hard enemys early on, or Cataclysm oneshotting pretty much any mob, yes even bosses, the game has suprisingly interesting characters and riddles.\n\nSumming it all up Dungeon Lords Steam Edition is an interesting RPG but cant hold up with modern titles in terms of production quality and immersion. I still can recommend it to RPG fans who like action combat and to ppl whose pcs are too weak for the fancy tripple A titles of today.","May 3","true","52.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

I loved it.\n\nFor some reason there was a charm to the way that the game allowed you to stand there, shooting your bow for 20+ minutes to kill enemies that were never meant to be fought at your level, finally killing them and gaining hundreds of thousands of experience points. The game also rewarded you for playing on harder difficulties by rewarding more experience.\n\nI remember doing backflips in full plate armour over mountains to reach areas that were meant for the final hours of the game. The way I was able to increase my speed so my jump attacks would shred the enemies like a wood chipper was also hilarious.\n\nThe game's mechanics made it fun, giving you the ability to use whatever spells you find as long as you had the proper ingredients, equip whatever weapons and armour you wanted with penalties if you didn't have the required stats and of course the magical power to pause the game in any menu and wait for your stuns and debuffs to wear off while the myriad of enemies politely wait for you to check your stats or find that spellbook that you really need.\n\nIf I were to give it an honest rating, it'd likely be a 3/10. It wasn't a good game at all, though it was fun and hilarious despite all these shortcomings. I would compare it to movies like "The Room" or "Spiderman 3", as I don't think either of these movies are good, though they're hilarious fun.\n\nNow to describe my experience with the steam edition. The cool starting menu was taken out, which made me frown, though I can get past that. My character was a Zaur fighter, much like my previous playthroughs which eventually became deathlords by the end of the game. They give you starting rune spells which I found kind of strange, though they were useful. As I killed my first few groups of goblins, I noticed that I couldn't equip bows. "But... But why, though", I asked. Later I realized that the only spells I WAS allowed to use were the ones given to me by leveling up, making it seem like a bad singleplayer version of a tab-targetting MMORPG. When I finally got to a shopkeeper, I sold all my junk weapons and armour, ending up with over 10k gold (which for some reason is noted with a $ sign). I was able to buy everything I needed at any point because nothing costed enough to make a dent in my wallet. I remember in the old game there was a weapon called the giant battle axe, which required 35 strength to use without penalty. I ended up chopping through enemies like they were made of chocolate with it, despite my strength score of 20. The point at which I was no longer able to handle the changes was when I arrived at the council of ancient elders. You see, in the original game, you could stand there hacking away for minutes on end and take out these huge health boss ghosts and get loads of exp. Now they're level 80 and I can only hit them once every few minutes...\n\nIn short, the core game is still there. The issue is that the core game was the worst part of it and they changed all the charming bits of it that I liked. If you actually enjoyed the story and were annoyed by the bugs and glitches, this is for you. If you enjoyed the old game because of how stupid it was in spite of its serious tone, I'd recommend staying away from this one.\n\n\n"I MEAN YOU NO HARM!"\n- Messenger Simon, 2005","January 5","false","14.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's obvious what kind of a game this is, read the other reviews. If you jump at doorways prepare to get stuck, if you climb up underneath a platform that's too close prepare to get stuck, if you jump into a small hole prepare to get stuck, etc. (CURSE YOU HALL OF LORDS)\nI think the biggest thing for me was how disappointing this game actually was. I mean there's just so much here that screams "I can be good if you let me" but the devs clearly had no idea where to take the game. Much of the game is hidden away so you'll need to be prepared to read information online on which quests to take for which classes/guilds and heraldry but most of the guides are kind of outdated. One I read had stat requirements for the classes which I can only assume was for the classic as this version has no such requirements. The game won't tell you that you will pick a total of 5 classes. Two classes come from the original 4 (Fighter/Adept/Mage/Rogue), Two from Secondary Classes (either upgrades or hybrid classes, roughly 20), and then One final Third Tier class which is an upgrade of one of the secondaries you chose (excluding the Shadowlord Class). This is mind blowing to me and sounds like insane fun. The problem is that the classes past the original 4 ONLY GIVE NEW SKILLS. New skills are not new spells, new skills include the ability to use polearms, plate, dual wield, etc. The Third Tier classes give a passive buff and one diabolic skill which is specialized to that third tier class.\nThe problem that comes out of this is that getting a new tier 2 class is nothing. The fact you can choose two tier 2 classes is a joke because you'll be able to get the skills you want from a single tier 2 class and the second one you choose will likely just be for the tier 3 upgrade.\nSpells are only learned by the first two classes you pick Warrior-Rune, Adept-Celestial, Mage-Arcane, Rogue-Nether. However! Mage also has the Nether skill so you can already purchase Nether spells (or find them) making a Rogue rather useless. The Rogue starts with extra skills such as pickpocket, sneak, and dual wield. The former 2 are worthless and dual wielding is learned by most classes later on.\nSkills are things such as Athletics, Armor (Cloth, Leather) useability, Sword Fighting, Arcane Magic, etc. It's supposed to be used to increase these abilities and some of them (such as those you fight with, sword/arcane/rune/nether/celestial) can upgrade on their own. Some like Atheletics you have to spend skill points on.\nAt every level up you get 3 stat and 3 skill points. (It appears you also get skill points on quest completions but I'm not 100% on that)\n\nNow I get that this is won't be agreed upon by everyone, but to me the better way to have handled this would be to TAKE AWAY the stat points that players get. Skills should no longer passively level as you use them. This causes a change in the game. Stat points are allocated as you level up dependent on the race you picked. Classes should now offer stat bonuses to your character which makes it far more worthwhile to go get new classes. Now that skills have to be actively leveled on their own, it would need to be lowered to level them easier (or give more points per level).\n\nThe way the game is now with skills is that you'll end up level 20 and invest all your points in Arcane to only have it level 18 at best. Most of the game lies to you like with Honor, claiming to lower prices and increase EXP but does no such thing. Diminishing returns are pretty huge on this game imo, maxing one stat means jack all and I could hardly tell any of the stats even did anything. I had roughly 70 STR (increases Weapon Damage) and was hitting for next to nothing. I spent another playthrough maxing INT and found out the joys of how it doesn't help level skills any faster.\n\nI like that they removed the stat requirements, it made all the races viable. But females >>>> any other race simply due to the extra heraldry they get for the womens guild.\n\nIt's okay, I have a lot more problems with it (HALL OF LOOOORDS) like with the randomly spawning goons that swarm every inch of towns and rolling hills. But it'll entertain people for a few hours before you can't stand it anymore.\nLike certain parts of the story that require you to run back and forth across a huge godforsakenly empty map. Have fun.\n(And don't anyone tell me Moonstones. As it is even if you know the code you have to activate it manually once first, AND EVEN THEN you can't just TP from just anywhere.)\n\nFix this game so I can love it.","January 18","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had been messing around with the windows Icons for a while. Some games have problems with Win 7 and Win 10 due to the fact that the Operating Systems has changed the way the Mouse Device Context works and sometimes you have to reduce the game into windows mode to get the mouse cursor to work with the mouse. That happened with the game "Titan Quest." But, I could not find such feature on the Dungeon Lords icon on the startup bar. So I went directly to the DL Steam Edition application exe. file and right clicked and brought up the properties panel. Went to the Compatability tab and changed the compatability mode for Win XP Service Pack 3 and checked the boxes for Disable display scaling on high DPI settings and Run as Administrator. That fixed the problems. So far, the start of the game came out without a hitch.\nI actually like how the options and charater creation had been rearanged and looks alot better than the original set up UI. Now, hope the game plays as well, or even better, than the Collectors Edition was. Really loved playing this game.\n\nBTW, when you start with the messenger, before you move anywheres, save the game. Then go to the chest that is behind the ruins wall and open it. If you do not get the bow, keep reloading and going to the chest untill you finally recieved the bow. After that, get on the rock that is west of your area and get on it. Keep on shooting the enemies and building up your acrobatics as well as some other needed skills ... acrobatics, on the 4th level will let your character make a jump backwards\nflip so he can get on the rock much quicker before more enemies come. This can build your skills up as well as collect money and other items that will help you in your quest. Yea, it will take some time to get all that up to snuff, but it's worth it.","December 29, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Sure this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in its own way but some people like myself was drawn to it.. for some reason.\n\nseriously though\n\nthe main menu music was so good\n\nnow its lame","January 6","true","0.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I did just that and went back to talk to him again about what next to do in the story.  After a couple of sidequests, I go back to Fargrove and the guards started attacking me as expected, but I did what I did when I had the CE.  I ran past them and tried to get into Fargrove.  Upon pressing E on the door into Fargrove, the game stopped and went black with text in a red outlined box describing an error.  I decided to close the game and end the process manually, but when opening the game again and clicking Load, the game stops working completely.  I figured it may be the extensive amount of saved games that I had, so I deleted a lot of them and the game would still crash.  I started a new character to see if I could load that game after exiting, and the game would still continue crashing.\n\nI still plan on playing around with how to get it to start working again, but for now this excuse of a great game gets a negative review until this is fixed or I find a fix, which I will include in an edited review.    It's disappointing to me that I get a really good character going (Thrall, rogue/fighter/knight/hunter) compared to the one I had in the CE, only to see that I can't load a game without it crashing upon clicking Load Game.","January 17","false","28.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

I've even opened the corresponding port on my box, just to be sure that the problem doesn't come from here. But it simply can't work. My friend can see the game has been created, but when he tries to log in, it says "host not foud : index -1".\nThis interface really looks like a debug mode for a developer. It even ffuucckkiinngg shows the name of the methods called in their ffuucckkiinngg code !\nIt's insane, knowing that this is the THIRD release of this ffuucckkiinngg game. And they can't fix this kind of problems. It's a shame.\nJust as a reminder : back in 2005/2006 (when this "game") has been released for the first time, World of Warcraft was already live... Just pressing a button was enough to log to a server with THOUSANDS of people.\nBy the way, I'm a computer scientist, preparing a ffuucckkiinngg PhD, and I can't have it to work in an hour. Just what the ffuucckk !\nI'll immediately ask for a full refund of this piece of s_h_i_t. Be careful, YOU ONLY HAVE TWO HOURS TO ASK FOR IT !\nWhat the ffuucckk !

But, early on got to a spot that I have no hope of passing, and you can't continue without going though this part, and you can't go back.  It's the end of, "trial of the ancient elders."  Basically walk into a room and try and kill waves of ghosts while also getting bombarded from above, waiting for a bridge or ramp to drop.   But, I can't heal fast enough ( because for some stupid reason healing potions have a cooldown) and I can't kill the ghosts before they kill me because they do huge damage.

Bradleys RPGs: Having Finished Wizardry 6+7 and Wizards&Warriors I hope for another milestone in RPG-Gaming.\n\nBut having instantly bought it I was really dissappointed: The game was very bugged and unfinished. Now after all those years - i skipped the collectors Edition as well as the reissue as DLMMXII - I bought the steam version and finally could recognize the game in a state it should always have been: It IS a truly great RPG and the design of David W. Bradley is really visibile. During my playtrough I just encountered one bought: The Auto-Save-Function is not working properly because the autosaved games are not loadable (DL always crashes). But this was not a problem.\n\nIn short: I enjoyed playing and finishing the game a lot: Highly recommended for Retro-Computer-RPG-Fans.","December 24, 2015","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my case the biggest concern I have is that there were some interesting features of earlier versions of the game excluded, such as the ability to have a shield equipped with a polearm.  There are NPCs that are still able to do so however, one example being Ruenkava the Valkyrie, wielding that nasty winged destroyer in one hand while also having a Fathien War Shield equipped.  Unfortunate that I want to play the Valkyrie class but have to choose between a two-handed polearm, or a Sword and Shield since I got a really nice shield I'd like to use.","May 23","true","109.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
