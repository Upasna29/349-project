"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/19020/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","290 products in account","Puzzle Chronicles is a puzzle roleplaying game developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Konami Digital Entertainment Inc. This is yet another title in Infinite Interactives growing stable of puzzle games. You are a hero on a quest through the savage lands of the Ashurin Empire in search of your tribesman who have been taken by slavers. Your hero will combat fierce beasts and battle hardened warriors during your travels as you attempt to rescue your people, raise an army and topple the Empire. This being a R.P.G., you have the ability to customize your character but sadly this time there are no character classes to choose from. As you do battle your hero will accquire experience points which will allow you to upgrade a set of skills to suit your particular playstyle and liking. There is also an abundance of gear to collect or craft ranging from mighty weapons, enchanted armor, amulets, etc. to further enhance your character.\n\nOne nice thing about Puzzle Chronicles that sets it apart from Infinite Interactives other games is that this title is not a match 3 game. The closest title that I can liken this to is some sort of sideways Tetris game. Stacks of colored gems instead of blocks enter the battlefield from the left side falling towards a wall that divides your area from your opponent's area. You can rotate the gem stacks and place them any way you choose to. Destroying these gems builds power also called "rage" in this game for your weapons and companion warbeast's attacks. That's right...you can accquire a doge, known as a warbeast, to accompany you on your quest. As you battle, you and your opponent are in a constant tug of war over the wall dividing the battlefield between the two of you. The fight ends when one combatant has no more room to maneuver the gem stacks entering their area because the wall has been pushed too far across their part of the battlefield. The gameplay sounds simple enough but when that divider wall is steadily taking space from your half of the battlefield and the gem stacks just keep coming as your opponent attacks and attacks you really start to feel the intensity of this game. Did I forget to mention the cool little animated fight sequences of your character and your opponent that take place just above the gem battlefield? Besides the story driven battles there are also some mini-games that you can compete in to unlock items and provide even more enhanced abilities.\n\nGraphically I like this game. It has a really nice looking artstyle to it as far as the cutscenes for the story goes and the animated fight sequences that occur as you puzzle battle are impressive and fun to watch. The musical score, like the scores in all Infinite Interactive games, is brilliant and does it job amply but none of the tracks really stand out of the pack to me. Most of the score has a middle-eastern sound to it and is executed quite well though. The sound effects, however, are very well done. Gem explosions and battle sounds are loud and crisp as they should be. The voice-overs in the cutscenes are excellent and do a great job of enhancing the story.\n\nWhile not my favorite puzzle R.P.G., Puzzle Chronicles does have a nice story that I felt compelled to see through to the end and I also found the deviation from the typical match 3 gameplay to be quite refreshing as well. With that said, one thing about this game that really bothered me is something that I mentioned in another recent review for a match 3 puzzle title...the lack of a good tutorial. Puzzle Chronicles suffers horribly in this failing as you'll quickly find yourself lost after the "so-called" tutorial ends. You'll have to search the internet for some fan written guides or just play the game and learn things by trial and error which can be quite frustrating. However, once you do learn how to play and what everything means then you can finally start to enjoy the game. This title definitely won't be everyones cup of tea but if you're looking for something a little different in the puzzle game genre then I suggest that you give this title a try.","September 19, 2015","true","12.7"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","42","42","0","0"

The result is that the winner is determined pretty much early on, but you still have to go through the rest of the match.  As a result, battles feel tedious and highly random.","November 22, 2014","false","4.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xandemon/recommended/19020/","xandemon","xandemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xandemon/","946 products in account","A somewhat predictable RPG, Puzzle Chronicles suffers from some mildly bad voice acting and fairly repetitive battles - once you learn how to play it's Tetris-esque combat and mini-games, it's pretty much just rinse, repeat, get better gear. The story has some amusing moments, but do not be fooled: you need to disengage your brain to play this game. I think the Puzzle Quest series does a better job of engaging you with its story, and has similar mechanics to progress with.\n\nThat being said, it's nice to play a puzzle that isn't "match 3" and while the combat is repetitive (and despite what some think, you can make a comeback from some very bad looking situations), it's different and interesting enough that while you're progressing the story and facing off against different enemies, it doesn't get tedious. It's worth a play, and will keep you engaged if you're after something light.\n\nI think the only unfortunate thing for me is that there is little incentive to play and get the final achievement (it's just grinding), and not enough of a community to really get anything going for the multiplayer since it's a little older now.","December 6, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/19020/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","Puzzle Chronicles is nothing but a time-sink, but what more do you expect from a puzzle game? Well, it better not be good art direction or writing, because this game has neither. The gameplay could be compared to 'Battle Tetris' in the form of a tug-of-war, but more often than not comes down to pure luck as to how well you will do in a fight. One try you will be obliterated in a few drops, the next time you will obliterate them. After playing for a few hours (and it took me 14 to finish, doing all side-quests but nowhere near the amount they expect to get all the awards) you will lose a fight and find yourself thinking "I lost? But I already wasted so much time fighting, and now I have to do it again?", and that is ultimately that it is, a waste of time. You will fight your way through it for the sake of completing it, not because it is fun or challenging. Over 14 hours I got half my stats up to around 50, and the other two were still in their teens. For replayability the awards expect you to get them all to 75, with similar expectation for your dog compaion (which serves as your special attacks).\n\nOn the plus side, there is content. Lots of content. There are arenas to unlock, where you can sight certain enemies as many times as you like (ie. grind) and plenty of mini-games, which all take the form of a more traditional tetris-meets-bejewelled set-up, which can net you levels, your dog levels, crafting two items into a higher-tier item, or random loot. So if you're looking for some competative-ish tile-matching and want plenty to keep you going, this is for you, as long as you can look past the ugly art and insuferable main character. Certainly not something you would expect from Konami, and I would by FAR recommend Puzzle Quest over this, in all regards.","March 16, 2014","false","14.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Partly because I'm colorblind and got the green and red stars and stones mixed up, partly because the mechanics are really confusing.\n\nIt looks like tetris on it's side and you have to match stars with stones to make them dissappear. Throw some skulls in the mix and you are able to push a line towards your opponent, and if you do this good enough you win. This mechanic really stinks and is NOT FUN.\n\nGraphics are sub-par and cheesy, the sound and music is average.
