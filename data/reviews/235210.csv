But the effort gone into all the lighting effects really shows and adds a lot to the detail level imo. Love the scarf being used as a dynamic light source. Didn't skip a beat fps wise and overall it's just a joy to play. The entire world is lovely, as is the accompanying soundtrack. Supports 1440p+ and 120hz+ setups which I was impressed with given capcoms history.\n\nGame contains one giant world but it has reasonably intelligent level design, backtracking to unlock new areas with moves that were not accessible before and such. Guessing at the length it should last  around 6-10hrs. Maybe more if into collectables and higher difficulty modes. Tight controls with a decent combo system that should keep expanding for a while.\n\nIf you're a fan of Strider or metroidvania styled games in general, at this pricepoint it's a must buy imo. Immersive and enjoyable experience so far that fans should not be dissapointed with. Thanks for being faithful Double Helix. :)","February 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 176 of 220 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","176","220","0","0"

The game is fluid and fast.  The game plays like the Marvel vs Capcom series but with less emphasis on combos and a barrage of enemies to mutilate.  It is the type of game that makes you wonder why it took so long to come out.  It plays like Ninja Gaiden but with every game element taken to it's limit.\n\nYou can climb ANYWHERE, secrets are EVERYWHERE, and robotic thugs aim to punish you.  Enemies come in both the cloned and overly personalized varieties.  The bright flash of colors and the effects are as intense as a psychodelic experience at times.  It feel's like a playable anime and it never givse you a moment to rest those button mashing fingers.  Intense and hardcore as they get.\n\nBuy this now, you will not regret it,\nand thank you capcom for this wonderful experience!","February 20, 2014","true","49.1"," 96 of 112 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","96","112","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/235210/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Strider is a reinterpretation of Capcom’s 1989 arcade platformer classic of the same name. Reboots are always tricky, particularly reboots of a certain age. How much should a developer pander to the existing fanbase? And how should they entertain newcomers? Off the back of the largely successful Killer Instinct reimagining in 2013 for Xbox One, developer Double Helix Games had its work cut out for it when making 2014’s Strider.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear where game developers drew their inspiration from in the 1980s. Looking back at Capcom’s original Strider, it’s all somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Aldous Huxley’s darkly satiric A Brave New World, with its looming dictator state, pseudo futuristic flying machines, and lone protagonist forced into rebellion. Don’t get me wrong, it was great fun, but like many of its 80s peers - Space Harrier and Altered Beast, prime examples - it was also a bit mad: level progression was jarring, and it was never really clear what was actually going on. What’s clear now is that 2014’s reimagining of Strider adds a little more cohesion to the old story, whilst compromising very little of the good stuff.\n\nWith what appears to be a less than subtle point to prove, the new Strider hits the ground running, all guns blazing, firing on all cylinders, and whatever other relevant speed/capacity related cliche you can think of. It’s fast yet at the same time entirely cool, striking an almost perfect balance for the most part. Immediately following a familiar hand glider descent into Grandmaster Meio’s robot-policed Socialist republic Kazakh City, frontman Strider Hiryu wastes no time in relaying his reasons to player and enemy alike: he’s a cyber ninja and he’s here to kill. A flash of his Cypher sword immediately leaves a pair of automaton foes sprawled out on the concourse, but before their short-circuiting innards hit the floor, our hero has cartwheeled onto the next duo, executing the same lightening speed maneuver to devastating effect. And so Strider sets the pace which it manages to maintain almost from start to finish, doing so whilst retaining the vigor and swagger and red scarf-flailing of the protagonist’s quarter of a century-old predecessor. Best of all - it looks and feels brilliant.\n\nMuch similar to his older brother, Strider Hyru is capable of such enemy trouncing acrobatics in concert with a wide range of skills. The only difference this time round is that the ninja’s skill-set must be learned, each individual skill in turn, via the game’s freshly imposed Metroidvania structure; or “gear-gating,” a term which seems to be becoming increasingly popular. At first, Strider’s arsenal is limited, but this is matched by lesser-skilled baddies - largely generic foot soldiers in the opening stages - whereupon enjoying the velocity of the kill is more important than strategy, something which actually never gets old. Health orbs appear in abundance early on too, diminishing only slightly as the game progresses, but with a slew of evenly-spaced checkpoints throughout, back-tracking never really becomes an issue.\n\nAlthough reluctant to overuse the slightly lazy term ‘Metroidvania’ - Strider is a bloody good one. By adopting such a mechanic, not only can powerups like sword-charging be learned - used to cut through shield-bearing foes - but classic stunts such as Hyru’s signature double jump can also be accrued, adding not only a clever layer of depth to the game, but also a certain level of order - something distinctly lacking in the original. As expected in gear-gating games of this nature, each respective boss battle requires deft use of the previously learned skill - my favourites including the ability to deflect bullets ala Metal Gear Solid’s Grey Fox, and manipulating time portals in order to unlock otherwise inaccessible areas - with completion often unlocking the next in turn. This works well on the whole, however there are the odd occasions where confusing layouts, regardless of the HUD map and pointer icon’s input, lead to lengthy misadventures which terminate at superfluous collector’s items, as opposed to the ‘right way’ - ie the next boss. For a game that relies on - and largely operates in - its fast-action, high-octane sequences, this proves incredibly tedious, placing a needless obstacle between the player and what the game does best.\n\nAnother issue with Strider’s setting is its lack of variety. Although integral to the original, Kazakh City wasn’t the game's lone location, as an Amazonian-style jungle and Arctic-inspired snow land also featured. These zones were initially included in early screenshots of the 2014 edition, however were dropped from its final iteration. This leaves certain areas feeling slightly monotonous - particularly in the latter third of the six hour or so quest- only noticeably switching things up upon entering Meio’s headquarters towards the game’s end. This, however, is best portrayed here by a gravity switching sequence, which will more than satisfy those in search of nostalgia.\n\nBut what Strider lacks in landscape diversity, it makes up for with deft use of camera angles. Although fixed throughout, the way in which the game switches from close to long range with each scene serves to govern the pace of each battle. With interchangeable camerawork akin to the Oddworld series, bouts viewed from distance tend to be drawn-out, planned affairs, wherein the player is afforded the time to pick and choose which enemies to engage with, traversing walls and ceilings with the strider’s automatically activated grapple hooks; whereas closeups regularly become a mash of sweaty, quick-fire button-bashing until everything on screen has stopped moving.\n\nBoss battled are designed to steal center stage, and often do. Each showdown has a sequence which must be understood and then adhered to and followed in order to match each antagonist. That said, some foes can be outdone by simply seizing space and battering the attack button, racing your health bar against theirs. More often than not, following the correct process works best but can at times becomes frustrating, as the difficulty of each boss is less than predictable. How much of a problem this actually is depends on the player, however I saw this balance of challenge and luck more of an homage to the difficulty of the coin-operated games of yore, of which Strider hails from.\n\nStrider is unapologetic in its approach: it’s a Metroidvania that thrives on speed, slashing, and general carnage. It manages all four very well. Story-lite it may be, but it never tries to be otherwise, and a host of bosses and enemies such as mechanical crabs, robotic gorillas, and snaking mechanised Chinese dragons, not to mention an army of drones and Strider-sized soldiers all keep the entertainment flowing. Of course the aforementioned cyber mammals, reptiles and arthropods will likely resonate with existing fans; yet the ferocity of these battles will also appeal to newcomers. And that’s why this Strider works as a ‘remake’ - it clearly is a new game, built from the ground up, but is also laced with sentimentality.\n\nBear in mind the original Strider was introduced as a coin-op arcade game, predating the 90s and a fair whack of the modern market, therefore capturing a new audience is something Double Helix has clearly also set out to do. Match this with the Californian outfit’s reimagining of Killer Instinct last year, and it would appear they know what they’re doing when reinterpreting the classics. By adopting a Metroidvania-guise here, rather, gear-gating, Double Helix shows that it can in fact teach an old dog new tricks.","October 15, 2015","true","14.1"," 92 of 111 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","92","111","4","0"

His heavy launcher from UMVC3 is here, for instance.  Enemies can be juggled, certain projectiles can be parried and alot of the "outside the box" stuff from modern action games are also implemented. I really appreciated being able to pull off some combos utilizing the launcher attack and the directional light attacks in the air. Along with special moves such as a ground slam ability you obtain, there's some depth to the combat system.\n\nStrider's an assassin, he's not a tank. As the player, you'll be dodging attacks and avoiding bullets as opposed to blocking them. Hiryu's really mobile, so it's no problem. The lack of a block button might be off putting to those more comfortable with modern games, but I really liked figuring out patterns and dodging gunfire.\n\nBoss battles are frequent and all of them feel satisfying to defeat.\n\nThe only real issue I found with this game is that the PC port does not seem to be optimized pretty well. I have a decent machine and was experiencing some slow down in certain areas, and constant screen tearing. Especailly during cinematics.\n\n\nI would definitely give this a shot if you are a fan of Strider's previous games or just action platformers in general. It's a fantastic reboot, which often times feels like that'd be an oxymoron, but it works very well in Strider's case.\n","July 21, 2014","true","5.6"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","53","60","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/235210/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","Upon its release, Strider promised gameplay faithful to the original series and attacks as responsive as your button presses. Poor marketing if you ask me. They leave out the magic of the Charge Strike Meter, which fills up every time you hit an enemy without getting hit yourself. Charge Mode is best described as "Fry with 100 cups of coffee" mode and for my money, blows away its Sleeping Dogs equivalent in the dust. It transforms the gameplay entirely, turning your Strider from a vulnerable hoppy-avoidy ninja who has to manage his button presses into the ultimate human chainsaw able to finish off monstrous killer robots before they can fire off their next shot. You lose all of that power the moment you get hit, so there's actual tension in those hellish games of chicken.\n\nIt might seem wrong to enjoy a Strider game on the strength of playing a death-crazed berzerker rather than a nimble evasive ninja, but it's fun in its own right and that's what counts; right? Dare I call it an intelligent button-masher? Because you work to enter Charge Mode, you work to stay in Charge Mode and you work to take advantage of the 5 seconds of Charge Mode, I say yes. That's right: Strider is worth your money for the 5 seconds of Charge Mode it provides. The exploration aspect? You live in a bleak cacotopia where every enemy is a one dimensional evil baddy. Finding stuff is a chore, not a reward. The attacks most associated with Strider, to wit the Slide and the Down Strike, feel tacked on by the necessity of this being a Strider franchise. In practice, these attacks are mostly used for area unlocking rather than combat. I might've bought this game on the strength of its franchise but now I've discovered a much greater, far more exciting game that would exist outside of it...\n\nOther weapon mechanics are a mixed bag.Your Kunai and Options are powered by an energy bar which refills over time, encouraging you to use your specials at any time without taking undue importance from your Cypher attacks. Your Cypher Upgrades on the other hand seem oddly mismanaged. Your first upgrade is the Reflect Cypher and it's the coolest by far, turning you into some sort of Jedi and allowing you to reflect bolts with your sword if you time it just right, opening up synergy with the Charge Mode mechanic for its slowdown effect. Too bad enemies stop using reflectable bolts midway through the game. The second upgrade is the Burst Cypher and completely trivializes all other upgrades by simply making your enemy explode. It is, in fact, the best upgrade. Third upgrade is the Ultra-Cold Cypher, for turning enemies into ice platforms and better explore the game whle the fourth upgrade fires ranged boomerangs from your sword, somewhat defeating the whole "you have a sword, your enemies have guns" motif inherent to ninja-related games. It's the last upgrade though, and as such feels enough like an end-game mechanic that you forgive it for being dead simple.\n\nAlthough not as exciting as the combat, the platforming can be enjoyable on its own thanks to the Plasma Catapult, your 8-way short-ranged teleport dash device. The challenge comes from planning your trajectory, working the flexible nature of your jumps along with the linear nature of the Plasma Catapult to form elaborate mid-air travel paths. The Plasma Catapult also gains from the Cypher Upgrades to form some cool but essentially useless gimmicks. For example, the Magnetic Plasma Catapult turns the targets you pass through into living magnets for enemy fire! Too bad it's tied to the ranged Magnetic Upgrade, making it more convenient to just shoot them from a distance. In fact, every combat gimmick tied to the Plasma Catapult is nullified by the fact that the Plasma Catapult phases through your enemies, bypassing the very notion of combat!\n\nOn the topic of Challenge Mode, one important notice for the developers: you need a way to show the player his top score and rank in a stage BEFORE they clicks the mission, so the player knows which stage they aced and which stage still needs work. Otherwise, since Story Mode is rather short and offers rather little replay options, alternative modes of play become greatly appreciated. Thankfully, Challenge Mode missions are built around the best aspects of the game: races across the city, and combat!\n\nI gripe, but I had fun. The developers, Double Helix Games, have thrown a great deal of ideas at the wall and many of them stuck. You want a sequel and you want an editor, someone who will focus the game on the more thoughtful mechanics and axe all the overpowered ♥♥♥♥. No seriously, the first Option you unlock, the bird, turns each and every boss fight into easy mode.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/235210/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Strider stands as a reboot to an old Arcade series by the same name. The game stars Hiryu, the last remaining Strider to be sent on a suicide mission that involves taking down Grandmaster Meio, the iron fisted ruler of Kazakh City and the Earth and avenging the fallen Striders.\n\nThe game's mechanics are pretty simple, like an old school title should. It's structured very similarly to some older games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid and the such as it has a lot of backtracking as well as you gain new powers to unlock new doors and the such - which may lead to new powers, health upgrades, energy upgrades, kunai upgrades, etc. There's lots to find in the game.\n\nIt's a standard Action Platformer, Strider can jump and he can cling to walls to get to higher places. It's a very vertical oriented game and you will need to explore literally every nook and cranny if you want to find every collectible. As you gain new powers, such as the Double Jump, or the Blast Cannon later on in the game, you gain more mobility and ways to go about exploring.\n*~Some stages have Two planes, meaning it's a secondary map of the same stage that counts as one stage. You need a Power for it, which you get early on in the game.\n*~There's also a way to move about each stage quicker when later on in the game you get the Panther Upgrade. These are called "Panther Runs" and they serve as key hubs in a stage, you essentially transport from one to another.\n*~ The Kunai (which is an upgrade btw - you may see it on a Loading Screen tip but cannot use them until you obtain them later on), is used to open doors aswell. You target a door's recepticle (not on the door itself), the door unlocks and re locks after a certain time passes, so you have to be quick on these aswell.\n\nSome stages, like the "Black Market" stage, have all sorts of traps and environmental hazards that serve as puzzles as their own. Taking damage from some of these traps can issue a "Reset" where Strider teleports back to the nearest safe zone or they can cause knockback. In other instances, hazards, such as Acid or Lava, deal constant damage as you stand on them.\n\n*Note - There is NO Fast Travel options for those out there that need clarification on this. If you take your time out to explore, just like in those titles mentioned before, you HAVE to travel back by yourself through the stage. Also, I'm not pointing out every way you have to open doors, that's part of the challenge.\n\nCombat is pretty straightforward aswell, with a few twists. At the beginning, you'll have your basic Cypher (Identifiable by the colour scarf Strider has) which doesn't do anything right then and there. Strider will attack as fast as you press the button too   which can help deal additional damage to bosses and enemies as well as the standard slash attack being omnidirectional. Wherever you point the analog stick is where Strider will strike. Ex- If you hold top right, Strider will attack top right. You also get a slide, which can help avoid enemy attacks and help you set up moves aswell.\n\nUpgrades come in many different flavours. Your standard Cypher (Red Scarf - Also known later on as Reflective Cypher) gains the ability to deflect projectiles back at enemies and you also get a Charge attack very early on in the game which is needed to deal additional damage and break enemy shields. Cyphers also affect Kunais and Blast Cannon - but these upgrades need to be found separately. There are a total of 4 different Cyphers you'll be getting in the game additional to your standard one:\n*Reflective Cypher (Red Scarf) - Deals normal damage, adds the ability do deflect enemy projectiles. No special Kunai Upgrades, No Special Blast Cannon Upgrades.\n*Freeze Cypher (Blue Scarf) - Deals Normal damage, adds the ability to freeze enemies in place (enemies can be used as platforms). Kunai will freeze enemies on contact. Blast Cannon adds a wave where Strider is that will freeze enemies in place as you fly past them.\n*Fire Cypher (Orange Scarf) - Deals the most damage, adds the ability to damage enemies over time. Kunai will attach and explode over time on enemies or ground. Blast Cannon will damage and burn enemies.\n*Magnetic Cypher (Purple Scarf) - Turns Swipes into Boomerang (Cannot Mash button to attack faster - Have a max of 2 hits then must wait until blade comes back to you). Kunai bounces off surfaces, Blast Cannon deals additional damage.\n\nApart from these, obviously - Strider has 3 additional moves that expend energy, like the Kunais. Option-A (Eagle) appears above Strider and does a sweeping motion according from where it was summoned and hits for high damage, you'll be using this one a lot on bosses as it deals the most damage. Option-B (Panther) appears next to Strider, and moves forward until it hits a wall, then he runs the opposite direction (like a turtle shell in the Super Mario Bros games) and Option-C (Bots) summons two robots that appear around Strider that shoot spheres as you attack adding additional damage to your basic swipes.\n\nEnemy types, sadly where the game faulters, is not very varied. You have your basic grunts with different weapon types - one can carry a Sniper Shot that if it hits you can cause knockback, another can have a rifle, shotguns, RPG's or a Machine Gun (deals most damage but won't see much of it during the game). Some grunts can carry shields - the non color shield can be destroyed by Option-A, Option-B or a Charged Swipe, likewise a Blue shield can only be destroyed by Freeze Cypher moves, Orange shields by Fire Cypher and Purple Shields by Magnet Cypher. The color shield enemy grunts only appear as you obtain the upgrades and then later on in the game, but they aren't really adding any challenge, more adding to the nuisance of having to switch Cyphers - like the Magnet Cypher, which was nigh useless to me outside of opening doors with it. One thing that annoyed me was how they only recolor the grunts and drop em on different stages, it felt a bit lazy.\nAnother enemy type, are flying bots that use about the same weapons grunt use and are really annoying, especially those that can cause knockback with rockets or heavy fire. Some bots later on, can actually charge at you and cause knockback. Then there are the larger enemies, like the Heavy Trooper (Yellow and Red) that have an arm that extends to where you are if they are facing you, or have napalm shots that home on where you were standing, you can deal with these guys easy though - the enemy that REALLY annoyed me was the Brainwalker, most of his attacks can cause knockback, he can charge at you and can push you off him if you're close enough - his shots can also home in on where you are.\nBosses fare a LOT better though. They all have attack patterns very similar to bosses from games like MegaMan X and some are actually pretty tough like Solo.\n\nAll in all though, bar a few annoyances, like Strider not being able to slash downwards directly if you're not jumping, the knockback state, the nearly useless Magnet Cypher and of course the game being short - this was definately one of my top games for 2014 and my top one for 2014 at the time of writing. It harkens back to older games like Symphony of the Night/Super Metroid/MegaMan X. Plays like one, feels like one and is a very welcome return for one of my old school favourite heroes very easily worth the asking price.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Combat System\n+Fantastic Stage and Level designs\n+Amazing Soundtrack\n+Game looks amazing\n+Great Particle and Weather effects\n+Bosses can be challenging and tons of fun\n+Tons to Explore and see\n+Diverse Upgrade System\n+Challenge Modes\n+Tons of Collectibles\n\nCons\n-Limited Enemy Archetypes\n-Magnet Cypher is nigh useless in combat\n-Knockback state can be annoying\n-Game is short\n-Odd Checkpoint system\n\n","February 25, 2014","true","18.3"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","48","59","0","1"

It also allows you to check maps of the areas you already explored.\n\nI had troubles checking other areas using the map. It seems the coordinates of the map stick to you so other areas map's are not centered and you will need to zoom out and then try to find it, there are also cases when you can't see the whole map if you are not completely zoomed out. Since the scrolling limit is reached before you get to the edges.\n\nThen you have an equipment tab which only purpose is to tell you the skills and power ups you unlocked so far.\nIt kind of spoils the game since it tells you how many health, energy and kunai power ups are in the whole game and also the quantity of "locked" slots hints to the quantity swords and dashes you will get on the long run.\n\nAnd finally a suit tab, as you explore you will find different ninja suits which can used as soon as you get them. These suits have a small lore and are purely cosmetic (they're just palette swaps).\n\nMovement:\nIt's quite fluid. The controls are very responsive and easy to use. Hiryu moves really fast and can jump into walls and ceilings, moving between them is relatively easy and this allows to explore the map to find hidden bonuses and power ups.\n\nAttack:\nHiryu can run/jump/climb and attack with his sword at the same time giving him a lot of fluidity while attacking. You can also change the angles of your slashes. Depending on the situation, charge your attack and deal a high damage slash or deal quick slashes at the speed of your button mashing skills.\n\nYou also unlock different elements for your sword, and kunais which allow you to reflect projectiles, burn, blow up, freeze and stun enemies and different kind of skills, adding lots of variety to your attacks.\n\nWorld:\nEach area is interesting in its own way, the first areas are quite basic, letting you learn the ropes and the limits of your starting abilities and each area increases the platforming difficulty taking into account the mobility skills you have acquired, forcing you to use them to its maximum potential. ex:  as you acquire double jump, the next area will ask you to jump an electric barriers which would have been impossible if you lacked that skill.\nThis also happens when you unlock air dash.\n\nAs you go further into the game, you unlock different types of "swords" and skills which, in a really metroid-esque style, allow you to gain access to previously inaccessible parts of the map or warp between areas. The map is indeed big so these fast travel devices really help at moving around the areas (which you will do a lot if you want to find all the hidden power up and extras which are almost always behind a door that can be unlocked with one of your newly acquired skill).\n\nOne thing I noticed is that these "warp" devices, while they always take you to the same place, it is never previously told to you to where you're being sent. So if you don't memorize where each one will take you, you could end up wasting some time.\n\nThe enemy variety is quite lacking tho, it relies on upgraded version of the same enemies to up the difficulty as you keep advancing.\n\nDifficulty:You have infinite lives, there are a few checkpoints in each area, if you die. You get a fision mailed screen and then spawn in one of them so you can try again.\n\nThe enemy variety is like this: mech-soldier, turret, big dudes and stationary cannons.\nMech-soldiers: They're pretty much the same. Their variety relies on what weapons they use (rifle,shotgun,machine guns, small rocket launchers or shields), most need from 1charged slash and/or 3 slashes to die since they grow a bit more durable as you progress.\nFlying turrets: They're pretty much the same as mech-soldiers, except airborne.\nBig dudes: Durable and slow, they telephone their attacks and can be easily kill-able by just jumping from their left to their right (they prioritize turning and they do it really slow).\nStationary Cannons: Placed on walls or ceilings, they shoot at you rapidly, recharge and shoot at you again.\nOutside of bosses, the game is relatively easy even on hard difficulty. The charged attack has a wide range, deals high damage which allows you to take care of many enemies in a row and just needs approx. 2sec. to charge. Your normal attacks interrupts most enemies so as long as you keep hitting them they wont retaliate. As you get more power ups and new skills, you keep getting stronger to the point where most enemies won't really pose a threat to you.\n\nPlatforming is also quite forgiving. Stepping on the acid/lava deals low damage as long as you jump out of it asap (which is pretty easy since the pools are shallow, they reach Hiryu's thighs at most) and anything that should one-shot you just does some chip damage and then returns you to the closest safe place you landed before so you can try again. So save for some exceptions, it's almost impossible to die from failed platforming,\n\nThe bosses difficulty is harder compared to the normal enemies. They follow attack patterns as you lower their hp and enter "phases". this can be learned mid-fight, so as long as you learn it, the easiest ones should be doable on the first try.\n\nYou're most feared enemies will be the popup messages by npcs which take space near the bottom of the screen, hiding enemies, traps and projectiles which you could have seen otherwise.\n\nMusic:There really isn't any memorable soundtrack here, nor there are area specific music, so you will end up hearing around 5 different musics as you play.\n\nExtrasThere are a few extras that are unlocked by discovering them in hidden parts of the world areas.\nArtwork: Developers drawings and drafts\nEnemy data: Description of enemies and lore followed by their respectives 3D model.\nChallenges: Gauntlets and Speed runs. Clearing them would provide of an extra hour of gameplay but this doesn't really unlock anything additional.\n\nConclusion:\nStrider is a decent game, It takes around 10hrs to clear the game if you backtrack to get all the power ups and most extras(I got around 78% of the extras when I cleared the game) I did backtrack on my own to get them earlier as soon as I unlocked a new skill, thinking I would never go back if I hadn't... The game had me go back anyways. So knowing this, one a new run it would take me 1 hour less or so to clear the game.\n\nThe controls are nice and each new skills adds a lot to your mobility and damage but they don't really offer enough to provide the possibility of multiple playstyles until very late game. the platforming is quite challenging but also very forgiving in deadly areas via re-spawn. The difficulty is intermediate even in its highest difficulty with not much enemy variety.\n\nI would recommend it as long as you buy it on a 50%+sale.","May 13","true","12.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

You know, they're great classic games, uplifted with polished graphics and sound, but honestly the whole point is to get that dose of retro nostalgia. If you didn't care, you might as well download the rom image and play the old version on an emulator for free, right? For a long time that's what I assumed Strider would be like.\n\nOH WOW WAS I WRONG.\n\nIt's so much better than that. This game isn't about nostalgia at all, it was made out of a genuine love of old platformer games and strives to bring something fresh and exciting into that genre. It's like what kids back then thought future videogames would be like, a supercharged progression of what they already have, and now it's come true.\n\nAlso, I'm convinced it's THE best "metroidvania" since Super Metroid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/corrosivefrost/recommended/235210/","corrosivefrost","corrosivefrost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/corrosivefrost/","4016 products in account","As a Strider fan, this game was a disappointment.\nCompared to other "metroidvania" games, this game is a disappointment.\n\nNew and improved review with impressions I wrote up when asked for specifics about why I disliked the game so much.\n\nFor the record, I spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 9-10 hours with Strider. It was just enough to get 100% and then delete it from my hard drive immediately.\n\nI can honestly say I will NEVER play that game again. EVER. And here's a list of reasons why:\n(1) There is no variety, in anything. There's two main types of levels -- futuristic cityscape and sewer. Maybe you could count the temple area... maybe... but it reminds me a lot of a blend between the sewer and the city. This makes it feel like you're never going anywhere.\n(2) Continuing the no variety, there's maybe about 6 enemy types throughout the whole game, not including bosses, and that MAY be including the stupid-♥♥♥ color coded enemies.\n(3) Speaking of, it has color coded enemies, enough said.\n(4) There is no challenge. At all, except for the first boss on hard if you haven't played before, the expected cyber gorilla fight because he does ridiculous damage, and one random encounter in the elevator on the ride up to the boss which is a difficulty spike of epic proportions on hard (I had 100% of the upgrades and only was able to manage it once I started using the gravity/purple slingshot for the special ability).\n(5) The game is short. Ridiculously short -- and there's nothing to make you really go back because the combat is just mashing x for the most part. My first run, collecting everything, on hard (first time playing) clocked in around 6.5 hours, give or take. My speed run to get the final achievement would've clocked in at under 2.25 hours easily, but I decided to go out of my way to get a few extra upgrades just to make sure I wouldn't have a problem with that poorly designed encounter in the final area.\n(6) The gameplay, at it's core, is extremely simple and ultimately boring. There is a practically useless upward attack mapped to Y, which was only ever useful for some of the reflecting projectiles from the wall cannons, so for the most part, combat is a total snoozefest. I was bored of the combat (and traversal mechanics) within the first 45 minutes or so and the only ability/upgrade that gave me any sort of repreive was the slingshot catapult which you get kind of late.\n(7) The "cutscenes" are some C-level voice acting. You would think this is some fan made Strider game that failed out of kickstarter and was made anyway judging by this stuff. Add in the ridiculous "portraits" that don't match and sprinkle in the non-existent story and that side of the game makes it so that gameplay (as usual) should be the reason to love the game if there was one. But based on the above points, there's nothing good about the gameplay, as far as I'm concerned. It's mediocre and boring, at it's best.\n(8) The lack of attention to detail really bothered me... I had a bunch of examples, but the one that always gets me is that from the very moment you take control of Hiryu, he has a pouch/pack on his shoulder containing kunai -- you get a very good look at it during one of the first parts of gameplay. And yet you don't actually get the kunai ability til 50% of the game is over. There wer other examples, I'm sure, but this is the one that just stood out for me about all others.\n(9) The lack of NG+ kills any potential hope of replay value. Did you miss collectibles? Did you want to get every single retro "collectible" they hid in places (which are kinda lame themselves)? Oh, you already went to take on the final boss? Tough, start over from scratch. And I don't think they ever patched it in.\n(10) Beyond all this, the game had technical issues like crazy. While I never really encountered many, I have a pretty good graphics card and it's more than capable of handling the game as intended with DX11. But for those without such niceties? Good ♥♥♥♥in' luck.\n\nI could probably spout more reasons I did not like the game, but for me it was the most boring and disappointing way that Strider could have returned in his own game and I'd honestly rather have the PSX game via emulator or play the arcade rom in the Capcom collections on my Vita. My nostalgia hyped me up and the promo trailers they put together gave me hope for the game when I originally thought it would be bad since announce because I didn't like the 2.5D or the Metroidvania direction it was going in. I gave in, I got it for about $9 and made a bunch of that back via playfire rewards for 100%'ing the game. But I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, ever, and I highly advise anyone interested make sure they check out one of the demos for the game on consoles if possible. If you own a PS4 and have PS+, get it that way, maybe you like it, maybe you have fun with it because your expectations were non-existant due to not knowing or caring about the Strider franchise. But as a die-hard Strider fan? This is not the game we deserved, not even close.\n\nSo to be fair, my hatred of Strider comes from the intense disappointment I felt for the game. If you're not like me, you could probably play the game, maybe enjoy it for what it is, and it would be like a 7/10 max, but probably more like a 5.5-6.5. But for me? It's the most disappointment I've felt in gaming since January of 2002 -- where after 15-20 hours invested into FFX, I found that I did not like the game and thought it was terrible. And I kept pushing forward hoping that the next few hours would change my opinion... but it never happened. This is the same thing that occurred for me with Strider 2014. I kept pushing forward hoping it would get better and I would like it... and I never did. In fact, if I'm talking Capcom reboots, I would put DmC leagues above Strider... but that's another story.\n\nI know I talk like Strider came to my house, beat my dogs, and then ♥♥♥♥ in my microwave... and that's a bit of hyperbole... it happens because of the disappointment I had with it after letting my hopes and expectations rise the week before it's release.","February 23, 2014","false","15.3"," 51 of 79 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","51","79","0","0"

While buying I was worried that this game may not deliver its promises. Luckily for me, most of those dark predictions were proven untrue.\n\nThe biggest problem of this game is that it could use a tad bigger budget. Some areas like voice acting, textures and level variety could use some more polish and work. This is most noticeable while navigating the main menu which in contrast to action packed game, is pretty dull. Not very Capcom-like. There are just some aspects of this game that contrast to the great ideas and design decisions in gameplay department. I also lamented the lack of interesting story that could frame the adventure in broader context. In this situation only the gameplay pushes us to finish the game. This complements mechanics, but plot-less game still feels a bit empty.\n\nThat said, Strider delivers... This is a button-mash-through-your-enemies gameplay at its finest. Press attack button as fast as you can and see how those Techno Commies are sliced into pieces. Yes, I said Techno Commies. There are also some robotic dragons, panthers, eagles, mad scientists, weird martial-arts sisters and bounty hunters as bosses and all other cool characteristic Capcom-esque stuff. Action is explosive and it rarely slows down. I like it. Otherwise, this is a solid made metroidvania game which spoils you with upgrades every time you explore a bit. Feels rewarding.\n\nIn conclusion, while production values and the plot disappoint in places, the gameplay drives this game nicely to its home destination.

The game takes the formula from the old Strider games and only expands the map size a bit. There’s hardly any dialogue or cutscenes at all. It’s no-nonsense ninja sidescroller action. I can’t remember the last time I played something that felt this stripped down and focused. Even the logos when you start the game go past faster than other games. This is the game for everyone who’s ever complained about modern game trends, and that they “just want to play the game”. It does this without wallowing in nostalgia. This isn’t a retro sidescroller, this is better than them.\n\nI had a good feeling about Strider after I saw a clip of it, but even so I was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. It does basic things right, such as putting the coolest stuff at the end, and the second coolest stuff right before that, and so on. The controls are as responsive as the Itagaki Ninja Gaiden games, and details like the sound design augment how good it feels just to move around and do things. I only have minor quibbles with it like how mouths don’t animate in cutscenes, and that you can’t skip some of them when you retry bosses. On the whole it’s one of the best sidescrollers I’ve ever played. Sections of the game had me thinking of Turrican 2, which is always a good thing.

Every time you die to a boss you get to watch the same cutscene(s) again before getting another shot, including the one where you're told its name and title. You can skip some of the cutscenes with ESC but not the introduction ones. Writing is bland.\n\nFootsoldiers are palette swaps of eachother and sometimes carry shields or guns that inflict different status effects. With the exception of shield enemies none of them pose any challenge. Shield enemies require a charged attack which also doesn't pose any problems as long as you don't face a guantlet of them.\n\nHeavy enemies are also palette swaps of eachother and more powerful versions just mean they get an additional attack. They're damage sponges too, not much skill required just lots of jumping.\n\nPlayers have a meter which fills by damaging enemies and avoiding getting hit. Next to impossible to fill during normal gameplay until you get the deflection power up, bullet hell guantlets force you to use it if you want to fill the meter. Unfortunately enemies in later areas have increased health and the deflection power up doesn't do nearly as much damage as the flaming one. The flaming one of course doesn't deflect bullets so the Charge meter doesn't see much use.\n\nReally aggravating to get hit by electricity, you can often get stunlocked. Level design is decent but not overly complex. The ease with which you travel was clearly put ahead of complicated or intricate designs. Some hazards instantly kill you (sending you back to a checkpoint) and some do not, its unclear which is which until you find out the hard way.\n\nSometimes fails to load an area if you move too fast (such as by using the dash rings) allowing you to get outside the level boundaries, freqently locking you out of the level proper when it occurs.\n\nLooks nice but looses frame rate during certain areas such as obstacle courses or areas with lots of electricity giving you a slow motion effect.\n\ntl;dr: Running and slashing is fun, bosses and cutscenes suck.","September 26, 2015","false","5.6"," 43 of 75 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","43","75","7","1"

Very fast, high paced, no compromise, 360 degree platforming action. An effective cross-breed between free-running and a metroidvania style map makes this a modern day halmark for the genre and the series.\n\nSo the original strider was a platformer with some sick hack 'n' slash elements. It had cool moves and a whickedly long sword that was fast to boot. You'd make your way from one end of the level to the next while slashing everything to bits; including the Soviet parliament. Good times.\n\nThe new version is not a remake; more like an emulation and update. With the finesse of today's hardware Strider has been made more agile, and faster. Everything about him is smooth and flexible. You can attacks in eight directions, while in motion, on any surface. Ok, not while hanging from a ceiling, but it is still more than you're getting from Simon Belmont. The flexibility of Strider's movement options is so amazing you'd wish you could play other games with them.\n\nAlong with the fluid movement options you also acquire a number of powers. Like shield drones, energy panthers and power hawks, along with elemental powers and kunai. All these tools are needed to fend off the never ending tide of conscripted enemies and bosses. You can clear a room on the fly, but sometimes you need to stop and think and moderate your approach before being gunned down by a crossfire of machinegun bullets. It is awesome and fun to deal with obstacles in such a fast and agile way. It helps keep the pace up and the fun coming.\n\nYou make your way through an open world, with indicators telling you where to go. Certain abilities unlock new areas, just like in the classic Metroid games (I'm calling them classic now; I have little faith in Nintendo at this time). This sends you round the world with the option to go back for more powerups or to plow on ahead, straight for the boss' head. Three ways the game offers you a level of freedom. In movement, in combat, and in exploration.\n\nThe game takes a step back from it's Soviet roots and propells you into a Soviet controlled neo-industrialist nation that is being opressed by a powerhungry madman.

Unfortunately, Strider 2014 doesn't accomplish any of this and stays mediocre all the way.\n\nAs something based on a arcade game, I don't like the slow action. Even when running it's quite "relaxed" in terms of speed and I wanted to abuse the "dash"-move so badly as soon as I unlocked it (which didn't work due to a stupid delay after each activation and as far as I know no way of canceling into it again). It feels limiting to say the least.\n\nIt doesn't help that the game has no real high-speed segments either (like a chase or something). In a way everything from the layout of the world to enemy placement and obstacles is actually trying to break your flow and slow you down even further. It is far from the "rushdown" I was hoping for.\n\nStrider is reasonably agile though, combinations of wall jump / double jump and air dash allow for some simple platforming every now and then. With the exception of the "iceblock passages" (you dash through enemies and freeze them in the process, turning them into platforms in mid-air if they are flying enemies) there wasn't anything clever or exciting that would make you go to work with the movement possibilities.\n\nFailing the platforming part, the combat is even worse.\nStriders basic slash does too little damage for my taste. Back in the late 80ies he faced off against a ton of "popcorn"-enemies that would die by one or two quick slashes, allowing you to mow down hordes of enemies quickly.\n\nIt is not like that in Strider 2014 - most enemies take a lot of punishment but you keep wondering why the designers decided to make them so tanky. It doesn't really make sense as the soldiers barely do anything but shooting their lame guns. At the same time, you can't do much but eat a few shots (often fired off-screen at you!) every now and then because you are not in control of the situation.\n\nSure, you can charge your cipher-attack or you can airdash through them later on for significant damage but I can't help but feel that Strider seems very weak in this release compared to the original game and Strider 2 on the Playstation. He was pretty badass then but had a lot of weaksauce since then.\n\nLater on you get some upgrades that add some strength to your cipher, killing the lesser enemies from the starting areas in 2 or 3 blows BUT in the late game-zones enemies have more HP, negating the effect of upgraded weapony and not making you feel like you have actually grown stronger - which is, in my opinion, an integral part of a working "Metroidvania"-design.\n\nFunny enough, the Kunai seem incredibly strong in comparison to the sword. I have bested many a boss by just (ab)using them. They allow you to just concentrate on dodging while still getting in more hits than with regular swordattacks. As you progress through the game, the throwing knives become homing kunais, essentially making you not even care about aiming the damn things.\n\nAfter a few upgrades a good "broadside" of Kunais loads up your "hitmeter" crazy-fast, allowing you to get into your "super"-mode very quickly. I feel like this mechanic isn't working out like it should be -  or wasn't properly balanced. Also, I want the cipher to be the main attraction, but as it turns out Kunai or simply avoiding/stun-dashing through enemies is the more effective way of doing things rendering Striders mainweapon almost obsolete.\n\nAnother thing I am particularly annoyed by are the (color-coded) riotshield-guys that wander the areas - combat isn't already the fastest but these guys bring it to a full stop. They force you to charge (the right colored) cipher to break through their shields. This means flipping through ciphers all the time and just adds unnecessary clutter without any fun-gain. There was a reason Samus Aran could combine the various beams in Super Metroid - nobody likes to switch back and forth between stuff every other room. I get what they were trying to do with the Riotshields, but I am not feeling them at all.\n\nGenerally, combat gets old way fast - I kept avoiding battles because they would take far longer than just skipping them entirely. You don't level up or anything, so fights become entirely pointless - especially if you are only passing through because you need to get to another area.\n\nBosses are for the most part rather simple (especially once you get the Kunai) with easy patterns to avoid and learn. Due to the nature of the game (getting upgrades and all) you can basically bruteforce a lot of the big guys without even trying. Unfortunately, some have wonky hitboxes/hitdetection too (Ouroboros Mk. III's icebreath or the flame-ring from Solo II come to mind).\n\nOverall, that's 50% of the game that didn't convince me. Sadly, the "Metroidvania"-part is just as mediocre. My biggest issues here are the lack of interesting upgrades (a lot of them simply act as door-"keys") and the map-layout itself.\n\nLet us start with the upgrades; once you unlock the magnetic cipher that turns your catapult into a stun-machine of death there is rarely any need to go back to the other types if it wasn't for those blasted riotshields. I would have liked some more fancy stuff, like the X-ray vision from Super Metroid or different weapons like the ones the fallen Striders used.\n\nAs soon as you unlocked your basic moveset  (knife-throw, slideattack, dash) it's only upgrades for health, energy and the Kunai. With the exception of the rarely used Ice-Cipher that allows for making iceblock-passages in mid-air you don't use your upgrades for anything fancy or fresh. The game stays samey from start to finish.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is the map layout in combination with the lackluster automap-functionality. One would imagine that by the time you got all your gear together, traversing the map should be a matter of going from left to right if you want to end up in the next eastern "sector" located to the right of the sector you are currently in on the worldmap.\n\nWell, think again - because that is not the case in Strider 2014. In order to get to places you need to figure out from which "plane" of a sector you can access certain areas. The world never really opens up as you progress - you go the same "parallel" routes that you did when you started the game. This makes exploring and going for the 100% completion tiresome and even frustrating if you realize two sectors too late that you took a wrong turn. The map doesn't help you by telling you where each sector exit leads to - making it a bothersome trial and error affair. Now add the ever respawning enemies, lacking combat and you might understand where I am coming from - Strider 2014 is a bit of mess. Navigating the map isn't fun - thanks to the stupid layout.\n\nApart from all that, the visuals are pretty sweet (that DX11! those particles!) and the stylized look to the world is pretty fantastic. The music, while somewhat understated, does fit the world rather nicely and the story is fun in that 80ies anime schlock kind of way. As a bonus, there is a ton of hommages packed into this, the Duke Schlange from Strider 2 makes a comeback as a crazed scientist, the Wind-girls are back, so is the flying airship Balrog battle with platforming segments against strong wind-currents.\n\nI am kind of sad that the game itself just didn't turn out that great. It's pretty mediocre and has some big flaws that may or may not break the experience for you. Unfortunately, I have played better; better Strider games AND better Metroidvanias - chances are that you have too and if that is the case you are not missing out if you skip Strider 2014.","February 23, 2014","false","10.5"," 66 of 125 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","66","125","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/235210/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","Strider is the sort of man who flies a hang glider into a warzone. He doesn’t get bogged down in the details, preferring instead to slice first and ask questions later. His latest hack-and-slash action game is the same way. Without preamble or pretext, you’re dropped straight into the action, cleaving through one hapless guard after another. Strider’s capacity for carnage is boundless, and the acrobatic precision with which he dispatches his foes makes him a delight to control. Right away, you have everything at your disposal to feel like a one man army, and as your arsenal grows, so too will your enjoyment of this well-crafted game.\n\nSimply being Strider feels great. The way he moves from running to sliding to climbing a wall to bisecting a robot is so seamless that you feel like a tempest on the battlefield. From the arc of his jump to the range of his slide, all of Strider’s movements are perfectly measured to give you complete command of the action. In the beginning you can do little more than jump and slash, but by exploring the world and defeating powerful bosses, Strider unlocks new techniques for his arsenal. Reflecting bullets, throwing knives, and summoning a eagle made of pure energy are just some of the powers you earn, and those powers expand your fighting repertoire in new and interesting ways. Instead of mindlessly cutting down the competition, you could send your eagle to intercept airborne foes while you take out those on the ground. Alternatively, you could employ a long-range strategy using the throwing knives and reflection cypher to dispatch foes from afar.\n\nWhichever you choose, juggling these powers together is a real delight, and cartwheeling through the air while dispensing death at 360 degrees is extremely empowering. There are plenty of locked doors to be found early in your quest with no means of entry--this is the game’s way of teasing you with the promise of new powers--and they grant you no choice but to pass them by. As you unlock new powers, referred to as cyphers, you are able to return to these spots and open the doors associated with your new cypher. This can help you advance along the main storyline or reward you with hidden unlockables such as concept art and new costumes.\nAs you acquire new cyphers, Strider's scarf color will change to indicate which cypher you currently have active.\n\nWhile Strider’s world is filled with surprises, the backdrop itself is disappointingly drab. The game looks slick and clean, with a subtle scanline effect that harkens back to the ninja’s arcade roots. However, the moment you touch down you’re greeted with a futuristic, industrial aesthetic that rarely relents as you progress. Gloomy pipes and heavy machinery follow you wherever you go, splashed with all the browns, greys, and whites you can handle. Admittedly, this style has the benefit of making Strider--in all his crimson-scarfed glory--pop against the background, but even so, more variety in the different arenas would have been welcome.\n\nCertain enemies also sport a splash of color to indicate a weakness to a particular cypher. Against such a foe, Strider must switch to the appropriate cypher and use it to disable the enemy’s defenses--most often a color-coded shield--before dispatching him. These enemies help keep fights feeling dynamic as they force you to mix up your tactics and utilize Strider to his fullest. One cypher, the cold cypher, does rise above the rest with its incredibly powerful ability to quickly freeze enemies. Frozen enemies can take no action, and are locked in place for several seconds. Other cyphers add to the enjoyable chaos of Strider's combat, but the cold cypher does the opposite. It simplifies encounters and feels more like a crutch than a compliment to your other abilities.\n\nUnlike most rank-and-file grunts, Strider's bosses maneuver around the arena making them very different--and enjoyable--encounters.\n\nOnce you finish Strider’s main adventure, you can try your hand at the game’s challenge modes. These challenges come in two varieties: survival and beacon run. Survival challenges are all about testing your combat prowess. You’re granted a pre-selected loadout of cyphers and turned loose against wave after wave of enemies. Beacon runs, on the other hand, are all about speed and agility. Your goal is to pass through each of the beacons on your way to the goal, all the while navigating a trap-and-enemy-infested environment. This mode is especially welcome since Strider is so fun to control and the main game rarely tests your platforming capabilities. When a challenge is completed, you are graded on your performance and can compare your stats against others on challenge-specific leaderboards.\n\nFrom the moment you embark on your journey right up until the final deathblow, Strider is a blast to play. Controlling this agile ninja feels empowering right out of the gate, and each new upgrade brings with it an enjoyable new way to engage your foes. While his world is a little drab there’s still plenty to explore even after the job is done. Strider is fun, pure and simple, and serves as a fitting revival of a classic video game hero.\n\nStrider / PlayStation 4 & Xbox One / PC\n\nThe Good\nStrider himself is wonderfully fun to control\nSteady stream of new powers and enemies keeps combat fresh\nBeacon run challenges let you flex your platforming muscles\n\nThe Bad\nStrider’s world is rather dull and repetitive\nThe cold cypher is too powerful\n\n8\nGreat\n\n","June 5","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game helps you so you can't have perfect accuracy with anything. Some areas and bosses have cheap things meant to kill you the first time facing them. Combat variety consists of unlocking a new color (red main, yellow fire, blue ice, purple boomerang) and switching between them (which isn't very smooth and only the boomerang has new animations) for the enemy types.  Map/World is connected, so lots of backtracking to get to your next destination.\n\nSound: Generally good for the gameplay and music. Voices are atrociously bad. Some bosses (notably the dragons) have 16 bit sound effects for some moves for whatever reasons.\n\nGraphics: Looks very cool. No moving lips during dialogues though. That and animated/comic cutscenes weren't in the budget.\n\nSummary: Not as good as it could have been, but not as bad either. I was expecting something deeper gameplay-wise and Strider is a modern team's attempt to create an older experience. But they make too many artificial decisions rather than let the game flow like it should. Despite that I'm still inclined to recommend it, but just as okay and with caution towards its many flaws/"design choices".

Grandmaster Meio is the main villain so no worries for arcade purists. This is a true reboot and does not segway in to Strider 2 on the PSX or have any connection to any other Strider games previously released. The lore has been changed from Strider Hien's backstory to prove this.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty decent, the newer songs aren't so great, they're more like ambient noises, however the old school remixed tracks are amazingly well done. The remixed tunes span across nearly every re-imaging of the game from the coin-op version, the turbo CD, NES and even a track from Strider 2. ;)\n\nThe gameplay is fast and frantic and once all of your abilities are unlocked you feel as if you can handle any situation and truly feel like an A-Class Strider. It can become a bit cumbersome while climbing around on ceilings but wall climbing is pretty solid.\n\nBoss battles are fairly frequent and require some heavy memorization and skill if you plan to make it through on the Hard setting. Plenty of stuff to do and numerous reasons to re-play the game, speed running, 100% completion and of course becoming an A-Class Strider by conquering hard mode.\n\nDefinitely worth the price for any Strider fan, new or old.","July 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

There were several versions, the original taking the form of a difficult but innovative action platformer with excellent animation for its time. The version I played many times was the NES version, which was one of the earliest examples of the famous "Metroidvania" style of gameplay where gaining levels and abilities unlocked new opportunities in levels you had already visited previously.\n\nThis new version of Strider boldly sports both playstyles. It pays homage to the NES version with its sprawling levels filled with hidden secrets and upgrades, but it stays true to its arcade roots with lightning fast action and fast, fun boss encounters (you'll recognize all of them if you were a fan of the original). It's basically a retelling of the original story too (what little there was) so you don't need to be a fan to get into this EXCELLENT game.\n\nDid I mention it's only $15?","February 23, 2014","true","8.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

You were my favorite genesis game, my number one pick for any Marvel vs. Capcom game (HUR DUR LETS PUT HIM IN MVC3: VERSION 25 1/2 A FEW MONTHS LATER).  You had style, you had soul.  You also didn't have Double Helix producing you and Capcom wasn't what it is today, but let's just chose to ignore that for now.  Hopefully this review will clear anything up for you if you are a Strider fan, but are worried about making this purchase. I took the nostalgia goggles off, and gave it a shot.\n\nYou are Strider Hiryu, a ninja in the distant future that has a blade that slices through metals in a way that you and I would cut through a wet paper bag.  Top of your class and supposedly last of your clan, you set off to fight Meio, the mysterious overlord of Eurasia (who are we kidding, it’s just Russia).  That's what the Strider game was originally based off (I think) and that's what I'm sticking to.\n\nYour gameplay includes slashing things at all times.  If there's a platform section in this game, keep slashing anyway.  Just a heads up if you are looking for something that requires a little more in-depth combat.  You aren't going to find it here, at least not a very deep level anyway.  What do you want?  Try playing the Gen and Arcade Strider game before you even think about getting this one and try that out.  That is what a Strider does.\n\nDid you play it yet?  Whatever you learned from the Gen/Arcade game, you can forget, except the slashing bit.  No longer do you get health bar increases, or blade extensions pick-ups; you must play the *metroidvania* game and hunt them down, piece by piece.  If there is an area that you can't get to, don't worry about it.  You'll probably fight a boss and get a power up to be able to explore that area in a bit.  Can't find out where you are going?  That's fine.  We'll hold your hand with our waypoint system so you can find your way there with little to no back tracking or challenge.  We'll lead you to all the important things in the game, but if you want collectibles, we're going to only show them as markers on the mini map.  No help after that!\n\nIf you can't tell, this is a serious gripe for me.  If you are going to turn this game into a Metroidvania, then just do it.  Take the dive, remove all the safety gear, and give the players a decent challenge.  <------  If you are an original Strider fan, this is what you come to expect.  I understand there needs to be some types of flow in this game, but at least take away the hand holding.   Fine, give us the objective, but don't point us in the right direction.  It's a slap to the face.  You don't increase our play time or our enjoyment by doing this.  Strider games from the Gen and PSX were based off a linear path, and guess what?  It was a big enough challenge that it kept us coming for more.  That's what we like.\n\nPower ups and items come in two flavors; Health bar/energy bar and abilities.  I hope you didn't expect stats in this game (being a metroidvania and all), because there aren't any.  You can refill energy/health at "Safety points", off your enemies’ deaths, or through hovering capsules.  The blade mechanics don't change much (except for a charge swipe), and if you can slap people around enough without getting hit, you'll go into "RED HULK CYPHER MODE" for a few seconds.  It's not really that great, and trying to achieve this during regular combat doesn't really impact gameplay.  It’s a nice benchmark to know that you are moving quickly and not getting hit though.\n\nThat's not to say that Strider doesn't pose some challenge in fights.  Certain areas can get frustratingly overwhelming if you let it.  The problem is that after a few power ups, such as option a or b, this problem is eliminated.  Boss fights are.... disappointing, for a Strider game.  I expect more thought put into this area other than sound clips from the bosses while I ignore them and slash away.  "NOT SO TOUGH NOW HUH STRIDER?"  I guess it would be cool if I could taunt back, but sadly, Double Helix cuts more corners than an Indy driver.  Boss patterns are predictable and easy.\n\nKeyboard and mouse controls were okay.  If you are going to attempt to play this on a keyboard, be forewarned; stopping or changing directions at times was awkward, but I believe this was more of a design flaw in the game than it was for the keyboard.  I found it easier to spam on a keyboard for slashing, but a bit more comfortable on a controller for extended play.   If you have a controller and going to make this a marathon, I'd suggest the controller.  Whatever floats your boat?\n\nStrider is a multiplatform game, so we get a ported version.  I didn't check the system specifications on this one, but when I did, I laughed.  Recommended 4 gigs of ram, a dual core processor, win 7 64 bit, DX11, and 4 gigs of hard drive space,  and a lower grade graphics card (GTS 720), which isn't terrible, but I have to wonder where the 4 GB came from to place on my hard drive.  I've noticed scaling issues attempting to go full screen at 1080p, and it does not seem to give the option for higher resolutions.  Keep this in mind; they did not port this well.  Expect to see some glitches and bugs.\n\nSound is there.  We won't get to enjoy a decent soundtrack, but I suppose that’s what to expect when the company wastes most of the budget on getting voice actors for a Strider game.  Bad ones, at that, and a poor script to boot.  You'll hear the Strider theme every time you find something.  Expect nothing else.  You won't be surprised.\n\nThere are collectibles to find, and challenge missions to unlock.  There's some replay here, but I won't waste my time.  I do not see a point system yet, but if there's a total grade at the end of the game, I will of course update it.  Right now I'll just plod through this mediocrity, reminiscing of the Strider of old.  This game got too stale too fast.\n\nI'll give it a 5.7, which hurts my own feelings.  Decent grab, but get it on sale.  Some may enjoy it, but Strider fans of old games, you’ll finish it with a sense of disappointment.  The quality isn't there.\n\n*Those who aren't familiar with this term, it refers to Metroid  and Castlevania games that enjoy free roaming in a 2D setting, that progresses through different areas through the acquistion of items.*","February 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've played through almost every previous Strider game from the past many times. This includes the original Arcade (as well as the Genesis version), NES version (which I love), and Strider 2 arcade version (via PSX). The only one I haven't finished is Strider Returns on Genesis because that game was horrible.\n\nMany of the original elements of the game can be found here, but it's not a remake of any previous game. While the original arcade version was just 5 stages to blast through, this one is total Metroid-vania style with a complete new layout. Right from the beginning, you find places you know you will have to trek back to later.\n\nI think the music could have been a bit better. It's there and at times it can enhance the game play experience (i.e. remade NES Kazakh level), but it seems like it's more ambient at other times. It's definitely more of a modern style gaming music. This is probably just wishful thinking on my part. I totally did not like that Meio's song from the original Strider was not remade for this game. He also doesn't say "All sons of old gods, die!" while you're fighting him... His laugh isn't anywhere to be found either. I felt that was key to the original.\n\nThe original familiars are there: eagle, panther, drones, but they're used differently than the original game. Once you achieve the ability to call them, they're only around for a short time. Instead of having 1-2 drones follow you around until you get hit, they're just like when you activate your super on Marvel vs Capcom. They spin around you and fire when you use your sword.\n\nThe panther "spirit" appears and just runs back forth across the ground once, then disappears. The eagle just swoops through in front of you destroying almost everything in your path (I think it's more useful in this game than the original arcade).\n\nThere are new power-ups not found in previous Strider games, and they're what separates/makes this game.\n\nThere are new cypher powers not found in previous games. The only time you get a longsword power-up is when your meter is powered up enough after killing enough enemies consecutively. This meter also goes down over time or when you get hit, so it's not easy to build up. It would've been nice to get a longsword power up that lasts longer like the original arcade game.\n\nWould I recommend this game to Strider fans? Yes\nWould I recommend this game to Metroid-vania fans? Yes\n\nI give it an 8 out of 10.","April 20, 2014","true","32.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Strider lets you know it's no B.S. from the instant you start playing, showcasing the addition of more refined controls and level design to the breakneck action of Strider 2. The result is hectic, satisfying combat, smooth controls, and a big map full of hidden goodies. Nailing those essential elemets would have sufficed, but gorgeous visuals and a fleshed-out story (complete with voice acting for all the dialogue) really ice the cake. Still, it's not so perfect a game that you can expect it to go down as a modern classic in its genre. It's hampered just slightly by the addition of too many combat mechanics that do little more than overcomplicate what should have been more straightforward hacking and slashing. And while there's a large world to explore, this game has the most convoluted map I've seen in a very long time, which makes exploration and secret hunting a massive headache. Nonetheless, Strider's a great addition to a great series, and the developer's proficiency in all areas of its design make it an overall success.","October 19, 2015","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In my view it looked so generic on those trailers, so I thought "great, another generic looking 2.5D game to cash in on an old franchise". I must now eat my words. Thoughts. Whatever.\n\nI only played two strider games, this and the one on Mega Drive. I never knew there were more until I recently googled it. So my review will occasionally compare this with the 'original' (well, it was a port of the original anyway so every time I say "original" I mean the Mega Drive port) and occasionally talk about the game as its own thing.\n\nI loved the original game. Never finished it, as it was usually the case back then. But what really stuck with me was how different everything in the game felt from every other game. The east european backgrounds, the level where you could only see silhouettes behind lightning strikes, the crazy gravity sections. The game never ceased to throw new things at me as I made my way through the levels. Today is common place for a game to have movie-like soundtrack, with those orchestral arrangements that follow no specific tempo (in movies they follow the whatever-is-happening-on-screen-tempo) but, to my memory, Strider seems to be one of the first games that did it, and I loved it.\n\nWhy am I saying all this? because I think that feeling of playing a game filled with things I have never seen before was one of the defining features of the original and is the only thing missing from this reincarnation. Strider (now we are talking about the current game) doesn't take risks. It looks great but does nothing I haven't seen before. The few things that stand out it brings from the original, like the gravity mechanics, but not everything came and nothing ground-breaking was introduced. Granted, most of those features on the original are now commonplace and new Strider is in a tough position of showing newer things. But my point is that it doesn't take any risks in any aspect.\n\nHowever, while Strider sits in its own comfortable zone, it does everything extremely well. The game plays much like the original, your attack is as fast as you can mash the button without so much as slowing you down and you can climb walls and ceiling. Only a million times better than the original and with much more depth. There are so many maneuvers, different attacks, different enemies, that make battles extremely deep and incredibly satisfying. At first you just run through the enemies mashing the button, but as the game progresses you will find this strategy lacking. Shielded enemies will start appearing, flying enemies, enemies with different attack modules and so on. So each combination requires different strategies and fast thinking. By the end of the game I was jumping, dashing, changing weapon type in mid-air, activating powers, all within a second. The combat is, without question, the star of the game.\n\nThe linear progression of levels was abandoned in favor of a metroidvania structure. And it definitely works. Metroidvania, open world, or any other kind of structure that has you backtracking all the time, works very well with action gameplay. It's also a well made map to explore and improve your character stats by finding upgrades. I think it was a nice addition, but the fact the combat is so good is determinant.\n\nOne last thing. I thought the difficulty curve was ideal. I mention that because I read people complaining it's too easy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972734792/recommended/235210/","76561197972734792","Grampire","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972734792/","272 products in account","The last time we saw a full release Strider game was the good but frustratingly short Strider 2 for the Playstation 13 years ago. Most of us remember the NES version or the Genesis title very fondly, and interestingly this game is an amalgamation of the ideas presented in those two titles. With no small amount of modesty and admitted bias I have to say (and hope to describe why) it's absolutely brilliant and has completely surpassed my expecatations.  This is the way you welcome back the most bad ♥♥♥♥♥ ninja in history!\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Metroid-in-a-tunnel sort of progression (until you unlock certain powerups that let you properly backtrack) while staying true to the arcade & genesis sort of fast action platforming gameplay.  You're encouraged to explore in a forward direction and there's always action to keep you engaged, and it's a really nice mix unique to this style of game.  You'll also encounter areas you can't access that you'll have to come back for (or not).  Anecdotally, I love these types of games, and it's nice to have another solid title in the catalog.\n\n-Controls are solid This assumes you're using an XBox 360 or XINPUT controller; I wouldn't recommend playing this game with a keyboard.  Hiryu is fast, easy to control, and very responsive with a nice selection of gadgets and moves. Gameplay, even combat, focuses heavily on skill and movement which are Hiryu's greatest characteristics, and the focus controls place on these aspects add a big layer of immersion to the game.\n\n- Level design is very well done, and progression feels natural.  You're given plenty of opportunity to leap, dive, and smash your way through levels that are as much vertical as they are horizontal.  Platforming is enhanced by the upgrade system.  You have a marker and a map that points you in the right direction, but hidden upgrades absolutely encourage you to explore every inch of the map.\n\n-Combat is visceral, flashy and satisfying.  As with previous versions, Hiryu attacks as quickly as you can press the button.  Normally you'd think a character that can literally move to any part of the screen almost instantly and attack as frequently as you want would feel broken, and while Hiryu feels insanely powerful, there are appreciably challenging portions of combat throughout the game.  Some of the bosses have some interesting mechanics and can catch you offguard if you get too nonchalant. It's a nice balance of feeling powerful while being challenging.\n\n-The overall aesthetic of the game feels genuine, and  I feel like this is the most important pro on this list.  Almost all of the game's music consists of remixes of songs used in previous games.  Many of Hiryu's signature moves, including the hard slash "gram" and launcher from Capcom vs. Marvel along with his robotic options and companions return and are incorporated well.  Hiryu and really all  character design looks great; bosses are interesting.  The art style is well done and fits the IP; all of the levels have a futuristic tech-look to them which fits well with our 2000+ year old ninja's style.\n\n-The upgrade system is great.  Upgrades come frequently and they do a respectable job at making you feel more powerful.  This includes cypher upgrades all the way to health increases (think energy tanks from Metroid).  It makes you want to keep hunting to find out what you'll get next, though you don't have to find them all if you don't want to.  I think this game would be heaven for a speedrunner.\n\n-Game seems solid technically and looks beautiful.  I'm playing this on a mid range i5 3570k with an HD 6800; a very mid-range setup, and I've got the game maxed out at a constant 60 frames with no stutter.  I haven't encountered any bugs or crashes during my first playthrough (at last boss now).  The art direction really shines; the game looks striking.  Backgrounds are well done, effects look good with attacks lighting up the screen and defeated robots raining debris.  Again, this enhances the fast gameplay.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-A few annoying technical details including characters who speak without moving their lips and pixelated textures when you're shown certain characters close-up are mildly distracting and look a bit silly.  You'll likely notice them right away and it will nag at you a bit, but it's not a huge deal for most of the game.\n\n-Story is barebones.  I'm not taking marks off for this at all honestly, but if someone actually reads this it's quite possible this will matter.  I haven't really gone over much of the extra content but in-game you aren't really given much to go on as far as why Hiryu's fighting, who he's fighting, or given much of a sense of urgency at all.  I think even Super Metroid set the stage a little better than this game did, and it was even more bereft of characterization.  Honestly though, if you're like me and you just want to destroy robots as the best ninja around, you shouldn't notice too much.\n\n-Unlocks aren't as exciting as you want them to be.  When I say "unlocks," I'm talking specifically about concept art collections and new costumes for Hiryu, NOT the upgrades you get in game that affect gameplay.  The costumes are nothing more than pallet swaps, which is terribly lame in my opinion considering Hiryu actually has had some different threads in the past.  It would've been cool to have something like Strider Hien's (from Strider 2) costume as well.  A small bit of a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n\n-Controlls aren't apparently great if you aren't using an XINPUT control.  I would go ahead and discourage anyone from playing this if you don't have a controller you can use.  I'm using the wired Logitech F310 and it's perfect; I can imagine it would not be so great without one.\n\n-Gameplay does have it's nuances.  Hiryu can attack in 8 directions, and sometimes this will make it hard to hit certain enemies.  Some fights encourage you to spam attacks which can make it hard to focus on what's going on.  Certain fights have ambiguous mechanics that can be frustrating while others may feel too straightforward and uninteresting.  Some powerups (I'm looking at you option A) when combined with Hunter mode are pretty broken.  Things like this may turn off certain players.  Personally I feel like these sorts of things come with the territory in a game like this and add to the character.\n\nOther things I didn't touch on are the survival and beacon run modes you unlock through playing.  The main story on Normal difficulty should take you 7-9 hours of gametime, which in my opinion is a good length for this type of game.\n\nTo wrap up this review (which is much longer than I intended), I just want to reinforce how surprised and pleased I was with this game.  I grew up playing the NES Strider to death (still love it) and I have to say that if I were going to make an update of that game it would very closely resemble what this is.\n\nFor my money, this is easily the most value packed $15.00 you can spend on Steam right now.  Worth every penny and very strongly recommended.","February 20, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhaxor/recommended/235210/","shadowhaxor","Shadowhaxor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhaxor/","202 products in account","Strider was always a favorite of mine, dating back from the Nintendo Entertainment System, Arcade, Sega Genesis days and PlayStation 2, with the exception of Strider 2. No, not this Strider 2, this Strider 2 aka Strider Returns, a non-Capcom Strider…. man that game was so bad, but anyway. So I was pretty excited when Capcom and Double Helix announced that they were going to create a new game in the Strider series.\n\nSystems: PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One\nRelease Date: February 18, 2014 for PS3 & PS4. February 18, 2014 for PC, Xbox 360 & Xbox One.\nDeveloper: Double Helix\nPublisher: Capcom\nPrice: $14.99\n\n*Reviewed on the PC version of the game and final code*\n\nFirst and foremost this is not a remake of the original Strider but a completely new adventure that infuses elements from games such as Castlevania and Metriod (Hence the game being labeled as a Metroidvania game) and as such certain areas will require some back tracking if you want to find and explore every bit of the game. The combat is fast paced and fun with plenty of enemies and bosses to slay, all which have their own charm though their attack patterns are very easy to pick out.\n\nThankfully the game adds more control freedom to the character this time around as you are able to aim your attacks in multiple directions using the analog pad, useful for snagging that out of place health kit or enemy. They’ve even given Hiryu several additional attack moves such as a down-ward thrust that allows you to take out both enemies and floors below you, a charged up Cypher which is handy for breaking down shielded enemies and adds  an attack bonus to your normal attacks. Even Strider Hiryu’s trademarked jump makes a return intact with no changes what so ever. I will add however that there is an issue on the PC side of things and while the game does support gamepads, it only natively supports either PC controllers (Logitech, Matcatz) or Xbox 360 controllers. If  you plan on using either a Playstation 3 or 4 controler with an emulation app like Xbox360ce or Motionjoy then be warned it may not work as there have been numerous reports of it not working with the title.\n\nGraphically the game looks beautiful, the art direction gives of a futurist vibe while the game moves along at a smooth 60 frames per second on the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, however only at 30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. While the game is bright and has a cartoon-ish look to it, it doesn’t take away anything from the game and I’m sure that you’ll stop from time to time to notice the detail that was put into the game.  Luckily I purchased the game on PC and got to enjoy the 60 FPS along side my 2560×1440 resolution and damn does it look good (Not that I’m bragging).\n\nOn the music front those who have played the Strider games of old’e will be right at home as there are plenty of remixes of classic Strider tracks as well as new ones. As an added bonus those who preordered the game on Steam were treated to a digital release of the soundtrack which contains 20 tracks  that includes 7 remixed versions of music from the past. Sadly the only other way to access the Strider soundtrack was to purchase the Limited Edition of Strider dubbed the “Strider Hiryu Special-A Class Limited Edition”  which is only for the PlayStation 3 and a Japanese only release but does include a 3 disc release of the soundtrack among other things. So if that sounds like something you may want, you better get to importing.\n\nWhile many fans of the series were unsure if Double Helix could do the Strider name justice, it’s reassuring to see that not only did they do the game justice but this is perhaps the best version of Strider to date, easily trumping it’s past iterations. If there are any negative things to say about the game is that it’s too short. Many gamers will finish the game well within 3-4 hours if they’re going for a straight finish, though if you’re one to unlock every secret and achievement then you can easily double that. Sadly once the game is beaten there is no new game+ mode, which isn’t a huge issue but it’s one of those nice to have things. Currently there isn’t any news about any upcoming DLC and with the acquisition of Double Helix by Amazon not much is known about the status of anything going.\n\nEven still for $14.99 you can’t go wrong especially in an age where even $60 dollar games are just as short,  Strider heralds back to the hey days of the side scrolling platformers and makes for an enjoyable experience for both new-comers and veterans alike. You can’t go wrong either way.\n\nTo those looking forward to getting the PC version of the game, there are two issues to be aware of other than the controller emulation issue that I mentioned above. The first is there is no way to map the buttons in-game which is totally unacceptable but at the same time we need to realize that this is a port of the PlayStation 4 & Xbox One versions. Though it is possible to bind the controls by editing the binds_pc.cfg file. The other is that this is a DirectX 11 title, meaning if you want this for the PC and you are either running a 32-bit OS and / or your video card doesn’t support DirectX 11 then you’re better off getting this for the consoles as this won’t run for you. Please keep this in mind since trying to get your money back on a digital only release isn’t going to be easy or fun.\n\nHopefully this isn’t the last that we’ll see of Strider Hiryu and we’ll get another update of the classical Capcom ninja and sooner than later.","February 20, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Strider is a fine game that knows perfectly well how the Metroidvania system works. As you may have guessed Strider does this with success. If you're unfamiliar with the term, please look it up.\n\nExcept for a few difficulty spikes Strider is well balanced. Battles hardly become frustrating (one of the boss fights made me furious, though). Checkpoints aren't always set up in the best of ways, however. Restarting certain checkpoints may trigger an unskippable cutscene. Which is fine if you died a first time, but if you're having one of those difficulty spikes it quickly becomes infuriating. I'm referring to one of my boss fights later in the game here.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, with plenty of detail and color. The environments aren't always the most interesting, but thankfully there are plenty of secrets and upgrades to be found, making them a bit more interesting than if there weren't any.\n\nThe voice acting is solid, even if the main character has a higher voice than expected. I expected him to have a deeper voice. But that's nitpicking. It's something most of us gamers won't notice.\nI have nothing but good things to say about the music and sounds otherwise, even if the music isn't always my main priority if we're talking about sounds.\n\nStrider isn't particularly long, only 5-6 hours. But if you want to collect all the upgrades you can add a few hours here. Despite the game not being extremely long it's enjoyable all the way through and I think anyone can finish it.\n\nI had a good time with it at least and I would certainly recommend this game to others.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","February 27, 2014","true","9.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It's basically how International Relations would go if the participants were  futuristic ninja assassins, robots, and god-like evil entities. The game turned out to be a success, paving the way for a couple of sequels, fighting game cameos, and so on.\n\nHowever, along the way something was lost. Kouichi Yotsui aka "Isuke" was the visionary behind the original Strider. After leaving Capcom he designed a similar arcade game by the name of Osman / Cannon Dancer, and most recently Moon Dancer (XBLA/PSN). He left behind a blueprint for all subsequent Strider games, and Capcom hasn't done much to deviate from it.\n\nStrider (Arcade/Genesis/various ports) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups\n\nStrider 2 (Arcade/PSX) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.\n\nStrider 2014 (Current-gen platforms) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.\n\nNote that I'm being exceedingly unfair in these descriptions. There are numerous differences between the three games, ranging from mechanics to level-designs to bosses. The story never changes though, and each itineration feels safer than the last.\n\nUnlike the previous games, Strider 2014 is an action-adventure game. Progress is tied to exploration, and Strider comes across abilities that help him reach new areas. Also unlike the previous games, Strider's cypher (sword-thingie) has multiple modes. For example, he can deflect bullets, or cause explosions, and even freeze enemies. Most of the time players will stick to the one mode that fits their play-style, only switching to others when it's absolutely necessary (color-coded shield enemies....ugh).\n\nThe most common enemy in this game is the overly-standard grunt with a gun. It seems that Strider brought a cypher to a gun-fight, but his maneuverability allows him to close gaps in a hurry. Battles tend to be exceedingly one-sided, with Strider easily cutting through everyone. Larger foes make rare appearances, and you can't have an action-adventure-platformer without flying enemies. Still, this game doesn't have any style. The military's lack of imagination is painfully apparent, when every room is filled with GWGs, big mechs, turrets, FEs, and zombies. Early on there's a fight with an elite who uses a double-bladed staff, he doesn't show up again until the end of the game. Nobody ever gets the bright idea to try anything original. Strider is killing everyone and finding kickass abilities, and the military can't come up with anything more than more guys with guns? More guns with guys? Guns guns and guns that gun? Give me a break. At least the bosses try to be different, and for the most part they're pretty good.\n\nWhen not slicing through foes more generic than the last, Strider is exploring each area for upgrades, costumes, and art unlocks. Acquiring some of these treasures requires the usage of different abilities, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before. At least getting around is fluid, and the mid-air dash is very handy. The environments never seem to graduate from cold & sterile though. I guess this is to be expected in Neo-Russia, and I can't imagine that Strider would suddenly run through an Amazon forest, but it leads to every area being too similar to one another.\n\nThe mechanics of this game are solid enough, but nothing stands out. There was a level of finesse to the first game, and you really had to be on-point with your movements and jumps. Here, it doesn't seem all that necessary. In a way it's nice, because the original Strider has a punishing level of difficulty. However, I tend to get lulled into a state of complacency. The damage I take is largely irrelevant due to large number of health-replenishing capsules, and whatever traps I run into take a mere sliver of life. Granted, I played on the normal difficulty, and I died a few times, but the idea of replaying on the hard difficulty, just doesn't sound appealing.\n\nEnemies in this game also tend to be sword-sponges. By that I mean they take a lot of hits until their vitals give way and they're split into pieces. There is a charged attack for dealing with everyone quickly, but the kunai tend to be more effective after a few upgrades. Also, while the first game had "blink and you'll miss it" amounts of violence when Strider killed someone, it still looked really cool. Here? It just isn't the same. Since practically no blood is spilled, the combat isn't as satisfying. It's fun weaving in-between the bullets, but the pay-off isn't there.\n\nAll that said, Strider 2014 isn't a bad game. My review might make it sound that way, but I believe it functions properly enough. The controls are suitable, the bosses are solid, i's are dotted and t's are crossed where it matters. It is a perfectly safe product for consumption. I just don't think it's exciting. The original Strider was rare, almost alien in quality, and every moment feels weird and interesting. Strider 2 is more standardized, but still works as an enjoyable arcade game. Strider 2014 checks all of the boxes for what can be considered an ok or even a good game, but it's so safe and bland I'll probably forget I even played through it a month from now. Moon Dancer? It's a piece of crap, but at least it played around with new ideas.\n\nIn short, this is a decent game but I don't recommend it.","December 28, 2014","false","6.3"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

Did I mention that the controls are ridiculously smooth? Although Strider is not a particularly difficult game, combat is rewarding and satisfying.\n\nThe game is visually stunning, especially for a game as cheap as this. I found myself often just staring at the cityscape background, just soaking in the details. However, it can be a little jarring watching NPC's talk, however; their mouths don't exactly move...\n\nThe soundtrack is great and fun to listen to while you slash robots and other minions to pieces. The voice acting can be a little cheesy, however; one particular character's voice--Professor Schlange--will make you want to dig your eardrums out.\n\nRegardless, I'm merely nitpicking.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/235210/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick summary: Strider is a side scrolling hack/slash platformer game, like playing Mega Man with a sword. The game uses modern particle graphics and is overall a fun (but challenging) way to spend about 9 hours.\n\nYou play Strider Hiryuu, a kind of futuristic ninja fighting against the forces of Grandmaster Meio, who rules the city with an iron fist (+ magic powers). Your fellow striders have fallen in battle, and you can find their remains occasionally as you wander the areas of the game. Finding a fallen strider gives you a new skin (just a different color suit). Grandmaster Meio isn’t your only problem though, he has an army of henchmen, cyber troops, and bosses for you to battle before you even see him.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is a two dimensional side scroller and you will spend most of your time double jumping, climbing walls, and boosting around with your plasma catapult (a kind of air dash). Since there is no money or exp to pick up, you can actually run or jump past most of the enemies in the game. That’s why the game has an achievement for completion in under 4 hours. I took 10 hours my first run through since I tried to grab all the upgrades around the game world. Strider has a world map similar to Super Metroid, where you can see most of the upgrades on the map as soon as you get close enough, and you’ll constantly be encountering doors that you can’t open until later in the game with the appropriate weapon. Almost all of the fighting is done with your trusty sword “cypher” that can be upgraded with special effects like fire, ice, and bullet reflection later in the game. You also have special attacks like throwing kunai, and “summoning” support, but your sword will deal with 95% of your enemies.\n\nPros:\n+The game is challenging (especially some bosses) but there’s no penalty for dying so you can try out a bunch of different ways to tackle enemies. Be aware though, that some bosses have an unskippable dialogue scenes so if you keep dying and restarting boss fights you’ll get annoyed with their long-windedness.\n+You can cling to almost any surface and with double jump + plasma catapult there’s all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore in the city. A lot of upgrades can be found this way.\n\nCons:\n-Not much of a story, but the game is pretty casual (not the difficulty) so it’s not that big a deal. You’re probably playing for the ninja action anyway.\n-Some of the gameplay elements aren’t explained very well.  I didn’t understand until about halfway through the game how the energy system worked or what the “combo meter” did. Neither of these things are critical to winning (at first), but a short tutorial would have been helpful.\n\nOverall, Strider is fun and just challenging enough that you’ll find yourself respawning a few times at the bosses.  If the regular enemies become too repetitive, you can just run and jump past them. You should probably play this game with a controller though I used keyboard (no mouse input). The reason I used the keyboard is that you mash on the attack button a lot, which I don’t like to do on my controller.\n","February 22","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is my first Metroidvania game (if you don't count Terraria - sort of), and I guess I was expecting a bit more. The curve of mobility upgrades could have been a bit more developed, and the combat seems to take up more of the focus. That's not really bad, but I feel like I was expecting something different. Also, back on the subject of saves, they're way too far apart here. Iteration time is NOT a hard concept. Even better, put in quicksaves, which no one ever has ever objected to.\n\nFor what it is, the game is very good. The animations are nice, I love the art style, and the combat is entertaining, and can bear being repeated several billion times as you try to defeat the boss fight right after the current room because there's no save between room and boss (seriously, this is elementary stuff). I was just expecting something different. On the bright side, however, this has made me even more excited for such games as Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I think this is a genre I can really get into.\n\nP.S. I bought this game purely on Yahtzee's recommendation.

And then, aside from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockoff and a single mediocre sequel in 2000, everyone forgot about it. Until Hiryu, the protagonist, was included in UMvC3. Riding on the resurgence of popularity, this game (2014 Strider) is released. Disclaimer: I have never played any previous Strider games, but this one is very fun. The combat is not very complex but it is enjoyable all the same. It definitely feels satisfying to cut through the hordes of enemies you come across, and the ability to control your slash direction gives you options to engage them. 2014 Strider is a BEAUTIFUL game, and the colors and flashiness add to the exciting experience. Many of the animations are homages to the original game. The exploration is also well done. Due to the fact that Hiryu can climb on 99% of the surfaces in the game, secrets can often be found in unexpected places. The levels are built, however, so that searching for said secrets never feels too tedious. Similar to games like Metroid, the entire game takes place in a single world  and so backtracking is essential to unlock everything.\n\nOverall 9/10, even though I've never played the original it's very obvious the developer is fond of the metroidvania games of the 80s and this reboot is very well executed.","July 15, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Beautiful visuals, heart-pumping soundtrack, simplistic storyline but a richly detailed world, can be completed in 6-10 hours. I recommend you play this with a controller, and that you have the specs to run it well. Buy it.\n\nLong version: I had never heard of the Strider series until recently. I watched a series of YouTube videos explaining its origins, its evolution, and the clones it inspired. I then became quite interested in Strider, and decided to buy this reboot by Double Helix (makers of Killer Instinct). I have not regretted my purchase after a 12 hour playthrough, and I plan to 100% it in another playthrough.\n\nIn Strider, you play as Strider Hiryu, the last and best S-class Strider (ninja assassin). He is tasked with eliminating Grandmaster Meio, the ruler of a dystopian future Earth. That's the plot.\n\nAs stated before, Strider is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania elements. Your primary weapon is Hiryu's signature cypher, which he can swing as fast as you can mash the attack button. Throughout the game, you upgrade what your cypher can do, navigational movements for Hiryu, and "Options", magic abilities. As well as assist in defeating enemies, these abilities can open pathways previously inaccessible, leading to secrets such as concept art and background information about the story and characters. Strider is riddled with challenging boss fights, each one is satisfying. All the bosses have complex attacks, but they're easy to learn and once you learn them, you feel great. (Can't speak for everyone)\n\nStrider is a great game for both old-school fans of the series and newcomers that want a badass experience. I strongly recommend dropping the $15 on this gem of a game.","March 23, 2014","true","26.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Control is fluid, the music remixes are great, and the power-ups varied. Sure, you got your staples like the double-jump, but you also get some interesting ones beyond that, like a knife-throw attack that can be endowed with elemental attributes. My only real gripe is that the boss battles manage the rare feat of being too easy, but also feeling very cheap - you will take damage from some apparently unavoidable attacks, but they do so little damage there's no real incentive to try to learn to avoid them. I also wish the objectives were presented a little more creatively than having your AI computer thing just tell you where to go. Finally, it's lacking some of the zaniness of the original Strider - sure its got a mecha-gorilla callback, but where's the stuff like the Politburo transforming into an armored dragon? Or a dinosaur popping out of nowhere? Or some even crazier original ideas?\nIf you enjoy Metroidvanias, you owe it to yourself to play this.","May 29","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Later you get Kunai's (Throwable Daggers), Double-Jump Boots, different Plasma Upgrades (Normal/Reflective, Fire, Ice and Magnet) for your Sword (The Upgrade Names heavily implies on the same Upgrades from Metroid Prime for those who know it ;) ), Robo-Equipment (Panther, Eagle and Flying Saucer), etc.\n\nThe Stages are mostly 2 Layer based which means, that you can later switch from one side of the stage to the other.\nThey are based in the Kasach Region where you will explore the City, Military HQ, Research Lab, Underground Facilities, etc.\n\nLike in the Original, you will fight against Bosses at specific Times where at the End you get rewarded with an Upgrade most of the Time which enables you to explore new Areas or track back for earlier Stages to get Upgrades which was before impossible to get without the right Equipment.\n\nThe Graphics are good and the Effects aren't overly used on the Display to avoid losing Orientation in Combat. Also good BGM during Exploration and Combat.\n\nHere are some of my + / o / - Points:\n\nPositive:\n-Good fastpaced Remake in the Style of the Original Strider\n-Character can climb on almost any Surfaces which makes for a good fastpaced Running in the Stages (especially later with Character based Upgrades)\n-Many Upgrades and Extra Collectibles (Skins, Concept Arts and Enemy Infos)\n-Challenging Boss Fights\n-Some Boss Fights returns also from the Original aside of Grandmaster Meio (Mecha-Pon, Solo, Ouroboros and the Chinese Sisters)\n-Mostly Easy Achievements for those who likes to collect them\n-All of the 4 Sword Upgrades are important and balanced for different Enemies/Obstacles\n-Kunai's can also be upgraded (More Range, More Kunai's in one Throw)\n-Kunai's and Plasma Catapult can be upgraded like the Sword with the 4 Elements and have different Effects while changing the Plasma Type (Example: With Fire Plasma you can throw Explosive Kunai's which explodes after sticking to an Object, etc.)\n-3 different Robo Equipments which can aid you in Combat\n\nNeutral:\n-BGM gets later a bit repetetive while the earlier BGM's where more remarkable in my Opinion\n-Heavy Attack not so much usable (I rarely used it, since Light Attacks are faster and can deal more Damage over Time)\n-The Kunai Weapon is gained as Upgrade much later in the Game, while i personally preferred it that they should be made earlier available, since they are very useful as Anti-Air Weapons\n\nNegative:\n-Not much of a Story (Kill Grandmaster Meio) or especially a short Explanation at the Beginning. You get thrown right on the 1st Stage withough knowing what's going on if you didn't read some Infos beforehand.\n-Short Duration of the Game with ca. 5-7 hours depending on your Skill (It took me 5 and half an Hour for completing the Game while collecting all of the Upgrades, but not all of the Collectibles)\n-Not much Variety of Enemies (Mostly you will fight against Light/Heavy Soldiers and Drones with different Weapons)\n-Stages are also lacking of Variety (Mostly Military Complexes and Facilities) while Original had also Jungle/Tundra based Levels\n-The Lack of a General Map to orientate makes it later difficult to navigate for collecting Upgrades/Collectibles\n\nFazit:\nThe Game is fast and the Movement is amazing. Good and fair Boss Fights.\nFor Fans who like Metroidvania like Games, i can recommend it.\n\nDue to the short Duration of the Game it is up to you if you want to wait for a Sale or get it now.\nI also really recommend playing it with a Gamepad since using a Keyboard gets to be troublesome in some Stages.","May 28","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

They paid respect to the gameplay qualities that made the original fun, while carefully modernizing it with new elements which really elevate experience.\n\nThe gameplay starts off *very* simple, letting you learn the basics, and then slowly adds new moves, attacks and special powers as the game progresses. The difference between the complexity of the combat in the beginning and in the end is REALLY dramatic. That's a double edged sword, because on one hand it helps keep things fresh and  interesting, but I can see how it could make someone toss the game aside after 20 minutes because he/she felt the gameplay lacked depth.\n\nThe control scheme is really excellent using an xbox 360 controller, but in the midst of heavy action I sometimes experienced some problems getting the dpad to select the desired plasma type. Probably just my overworked, uncoordinated old fingers, but it did annoy somewhat.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much perfect. They nailed the whole sci-fi ninja theme, and the 2.5d rendering dynamically zooms in/out depending on the area you're in, so that it feels confined and in-your-face when fighting in narrow corridors, and vast and open when you're outside in big areas.\n\nThe sound effects are also excellent, but I found the voice acting (there isn't much) and music just a tad above mediocre.\n\nThe game lasted me around 10 hours on "normal". 90% of it was an absolute joy, but the last 10% was sadly tainted with frustration due to a combination of high difficulty, my low skill level and some stupid game design decisions:\n\n- Checkpoints aren't save games! You have to reach a "save pod" to save your progress to disk. It blows my mind that someone felt the need to punish the user for having to turn off the computer!\n\n- Some checkpoints are placed too far before boss fights (of which most are great btw), making you replay a dull, unchallenging part of the map over and over.\n\n- No "retry from checkpoint" option.\n\n- Unskippable cutscenes before boss fights (well, you CAN after watching the first 15 seconds or so, but when boiling with rage after dying 15 times this feels like half an hour).\n\nAt it's best, Strider 2014 brought me stellar gameplay moments, and while I do reckon this is in my top 3 action platformer games, there's no denying that the above complaints poisoned my overall enthusiasm somewhat.\n\n82%","June 17, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Then here you go, a new Metroid game. Buy it now.\n\nTo those who don't know: A typical Metroid game typically boils down to exploring a semi-open world, defeating bosses in each area. As you progress through the game you'll obtain upgrades and powerups allowing you to access more areas of the world as well as approach combat in different ways. It's a simple progressive formula that almost any action/adventure game uses now days, but few have pulled off as masterfully as the Metroid series has.\n\nThe main difference between Strider and Metroid is the combat. While Metroid tends to have combat here and there, combat in Strider is plentiful, yet easy to avoid if you don't want to bother with it. Basic combat boils down to mash attack until the enemy dies, maybe use a robot companion if you want extra damage. The tricky part is that you die VERY quickly, particularly on higher difficulties. Meaning you can't just stand there and mash attack, you need to be evasive. This creates a scene where you're flipping through the air, bouncing off walls, sliding past enemies; all while attacking. As a result, despite how basic the combat is, it turns out to be pretty fun. This is taken to the extreme late game when you're thrown into rooms with 10+ guys with different weapons and set ups; where standing still for just one moment means you're dead.","February 19, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/235210/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","The map is horrible when it comes to navigating your way around the inter-connected levels.\n\nExplosive Kunai can cheese 99% of the bosses and enemies with no problems at all.\n\nStrider is totally amazing, and well worth the full fifteen dollars. If it's on sale, you'd be an idiot not to pick it up if you enjoy this style of game.\n\nIt's a Metroidvania-Lite, if that makes sense. Combat is melee heavy, and lightning fast, while keeping tight and responsive controls. While you can do some exploring and back tracking to find hidden POW symbols (which unlock concept art, lore, or bonus modes such as survival challenges), or upgrades to add to your health and such, doing so is rather tedious given the horrible game map. The map is split up into sections that it wants to send you down in a linear fashion. Rather than showing you the full thing at once such as in Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night. You can unlock a type of fast travel, but the fast travel points don't tell you what they connect to, or show you a logical route around the city.\n\nAside from that complaint, I really don't have anything bad to say. The music is amazing, and is a perfect mix of new and retro, blending in some of the classic tracks from the NES version of the game, while not over powering the soundtrack with chiptune nonsense. The voice acting is over the top, to play to the B-Movie vibe the story and world has, and fits great.\n\nThe boss fights are the main attraction, and there are many of them. Each one is memorable, and unique. Often your reward for defeating a boss is an upgrade, such as a new ability, or a new beam type... I mean, a new plasma type for your blade.\n\nThe game shouldn't take more than five hours or so if you just go through it without much exploring, and veteran action gamers will want to play on hard mode. The game is generous with checkpoints and stations that refill your life, so you won't be set back very far if you die.\n\nI should note that I have managed to climb into the walls of the map at one point. At first I thought I had found a hidden area, but that wasn't the case. I was stuck, and had to reload my game.\n\nOn that note, it can only have one single player game saved at once, which is a big problem if you share your computer or want to have a run going on normal and hard at the same time.\n\nWhile I hope some patches address the minor issues it has, I really can't recommend this game enough if you enjoy things like Super Metroid, Guacamelee, and Symphony of the Night.\n\nedit:\n\nI thought of a few more complaints I had but it's nothing big. It's annoying that once you get a new plasma type for your sword, which act as keys for certain types of doors, that you have to switch the blade type to open the door. I wish I could just attack it and have it open. It's a tedious step that doesn't really need to be there. Granted, it's super fast and easy to change types (D-pad) but if I'm fighting guys and using the ice sword, I don't want to have to change to gravity sword just to open a door.\n\nAlso, the sword swings as fast as you hit the button, except for the gravity sword. That shoots out a little projectile that loops around when you attack, and you can only have two out at once. If you have two out, you can't attack at all. It should let me swing my sword, just not shoot out another thing. It makes using it feel like a liability rather than something I would want to do.\n\nThat being said, I feel like I have been exploring my ♥♥♥ off, and the maps still show my item collection at like 80% or so for most of them. That's pretty cool.","February 22, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

This game is boring.  It looks nice, the controls are mostly good (except when you want to jump off a wall then it gets a bit mind bendy), the sound is ok but everything is dull, really dull.\n\nFirst, the story.  What frigging story?  I have no idea what is going on, nothing is explained about who I am why I dropped into the "eastern-european-psuedo-stalinist-but-really-it's-japanesey" city of can't remember the name.  What is my purpose?  The game tells me to go to A then B then C but why?  You get these bizarre cut scenes that tell you nothing and make things more confusing, who are "the winds", when did I ♥♥♥♥ on their birthday cake because I don't remember why they are desperate to slice me up.\n\nBut I think this is supposed to be an arcadey type game so let's move onto... combat.  Again this is so dull it's difficult to know where to start.  Enemies fall into 3 main camps that I've seen so far.  Aerial and annoying, on the ground and annoying and on the ground and sometimes annoying.  Strider, for reasons not adequately explained, decided to bring a short sword to a gun fight and so you spend all your time trying to get to the enemies which are usually dispatched in one or two hits.  Most of the enemies you just literally slice in half, sometimes you get one with a shield which means you have to use the charge attack and then slice them in half.  That's some innovation folks.  You then get the bosses or mini-bosses or whatever they are.  These are just enemies with limited attacks with more health.  Learn/dodge the attack and they are defeated.  No challenge or skill required.\n\nThe final point of desperate boredom is the exploration.  Remember how in Super Metroid you had a feeling of achievement when you worked out how to get up the wall and into the small hole to get the new weapon?  Or how you remembered you could now go back to an area and explore beyond the unpassable door or wall?  There is none of that here.  You just feel like a rat being led through a maze.  The collectibles are pointless, yay I got new intel on something and yay I got more health that I didn't really need because enemies drop health and there seems to be a giant health rat wandering around pooping out endless health packs (seriously there are hundreds of the things all over the place).\n\nOverall the problem with Strider is that it's trying to be lots of things and failing at all of them.  It's trying to a fast moving hack-n-slash platformer but the enemies are like marshmallows and the platforming is dull.  It's trying to be a Metroidvania but the exploration is pointless and without real rewards and you are led around on a leash (there is a "how far you have to go to your destination distance ticker under the mini map).  It's trying to be an old school arcade game with next generation gameplay with a veneer of seriousness but there is no skill challenge, you don't have to be creative when fighting enemies or be skillful in the platforming, at times it tries to evoke Super Meat Boy but you can cling to walls so where's the challenge?  Trouble is having never played the original Strider I don't have any nostalgia goggles available to help me brush over what is a rather boring game.","February 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","20","39","0","0"

The story is fine, jump puzzles and enemy swarms get interesting.\n•	Expected some great Strider 8bit music, nope, it’s awful. Personal preference, open music and play some Anamanaguchi or Rymdreglage. Anything is better than the OST.\n•	Could not play on a 60 hz 720 TV without blackout patches, needed to play it on a monitor & it looks great. Wanted to sit on the couch with a gamepad but the desk and pad are fine.\n•	The voice acting is attempted but nothing spectacular.\n•	There are dialogue popups that make tracking enemies, projectiles and landing spots tough at times.\n•	If you’re a completionist, the replayability  is very high, lots of unlocks artwork, side challenges and so on. I’m just over 5 hours in and at the 30% mark so there is a solid amount of game for the $, just don’t pay full price and don’t bother with the OST.\n\n\n","May 22, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is, hands down, one of my favorite games of the month, the year, and hell, it beat Dark Souls as my most enjoyed game I bought from Steam. I'm just gonna copypaste my opinion I told to a friend the moment I beat it:\n\nI had a ton of fun with Strider. It's almost one of my most favorite games of all time, but I don't know what makes it not quite up there with favorites like Metroid Prime and Super Mario World. It's got some of the tightest design I've seen in years and the action is fast paced and fun. Looking around all over the map provided hours of entertainment in itself, and the story leading you a linear trek before that was hilariously bad. The game almost praises me as well, with some enemies sounding like they said 'Mayo is god'. There's a lot of freedom even when the game is at its most linear, you can climb anything if you put your mind to it, Metroid-style enemy freezing allows you to use them as platforms and the warp dash maneuver is one of the coolest powerups I've ever seen. I guess my only complaint is the weapon switching can ♥♥♥♥ you over if you're using a 360 controller and it's abysmal D-pad and you can't turn the hint system off. I've been plenty challenged and I've only beat it in Easy Mode. There's still a lot to learn too, as I've seen a speedrun of it that took advantage of clipping glitches and half way through there were so many glitches stacked up I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Sadly, I don't see any chance of Strider returning anytime soon, as the marketing for the game is basically non-existant, and even then, Metroidvanias of this quality are very rare and precious. It's still my GOTY.\n\nSo yeah, buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game if you love 2D action titles of any kind. It doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around with needless story and exposition, you don't need to care about anything except that you're a ninja who kills cyborg Russians. It's part maniac hack 'n slash and a metroidvania if you spend more time into it, and if any of this raised your eyebrows, you wasted too much time not playing Strider.","December 14, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This alone adds a huge amount of creativity to combat, with the player being able to jump around and slide under enemies and slash at leisure. The combat has also becomes more Metroid-like with the addition of Plasma types, which function in very different ways in combat. Gameplay upgrades don't feel superflous like a lot of other games in this style *cough30grenadepackswheeze*, the kunai upgrades are well worth seeking out, catapault upgrades not so much. Options have pretty much the same function as in the Marvel vs Capom series, it feels so great using Ouroboros for the first time. Strider has a dedicated launcher, which is great for creating fun combos, but it only works on the normal mook enemies which is a shame because it'd be really fun to launch other enemies or even small bosses. Lots of bosses with a lot of work put into each of them, you likely won't see all of their attacks unless you play on hard mode.\n\nDifficulties are pretty diverse, Easy and Normal aren't too difficult, lots of health pickups and save points should you trip up when you aren't shredding through enemies. Hard mode however brings the difficulty more in line with the arcade titles by increasing the amount of damage done to Strider, increasing boss health, and lowering the amount of health you get from pickups, even the canisters. Speaking of health pickups, you don't automatically get health and energy back when you hit them, instead they burst into little particles which fly to your hud, then you get restored, can be an issue at times. When Strider's on low health there's this annoying red flicker effect that appears on the top and bottom of the screen, which you know what, not the worst trend that Strider could have picked up from modern games at the time, could be worse.\n\nThere is one new gameplay feature that I really have a problem with and that is Burst Mode, which activates whenever Strider does enough damage in a period of time. This to me feels more like a crutch against bosses and doesn't add a lot to the game. Strider's a very mashy genre, but even this is ridiculous.\n\nThe novelty of Strider becoming a metroidvania pays off in spades when you realize that running, climbing, and ninja jumping around a level is exactly the kind of stuff that lends itself well to running around a big map collecting upgrades. The map is fairly big too, thankfully no elevators are used to get from place to place, instead performed by the Eagle and Panther Options. Some routes throughout the map are one-way though, which can be a little troublesome if you're looking to collect everything. Doesn't seem to be much room for sequence breaking outside of glitches and the Solo Skip. The enviornments are also varied as well though obviously not as much as previous games, just like Shadow Complex there's a lot of work into contextualizing locations.\n\nMuch of the soundtrack is remixes of past Strider themes. However because of the multitude of sfx in the game a lot of tracks can often sound like ambience ingame, with only a few tracks that really stand out such as Coup. Coup is awesome, always listen to Coup, otherwise keep the music level high and the sfx level at half or so. Voice acting's eh, most of the original characters you won't pay attention to but the usual Strider characters do fine, Strider Hiryu and Solo in particular sound awesome. Artstyle holds up, character designs not as iconic as the MvC era ANIME Strider. 3D models do present an issue where they look fine from a distance but up close in cutscenes not so much, Strider Hiryu's hair especially. Enviornments look great, lots of weather and bloom surface effects in the background.\n\nHOW-EV-ER, the graphics were the source of my discontent with my first playthrough. Double Helix it is nice to know that between this and Killer Instinct you clearly love adding on lots of fancy effects to the game, but having to pay the price by my framerate literally being cut in half is not a great thing. For whatever reason this also carried over to cutscenes where audio will clearly finish faster than the cutscene itself and you'll just have 5 seconds of a character gesturing silently. Double Helix in the future please consider putting more extensive graphics editing options into future releases.\n\nDouble-check your computer's graphics capabilities before getting this on steam, else you seriously risk your enjoyment by having the game slow down to the point where it will take you 10 real world hours to progress 4 in game hours.\n\nPlayed on a MadCatz SF4 SE Arcade Stick. Only issues were due to plasma switching being mapped to DPAD. Camera in gallery mode is mapped to right joystick.\n\nThe Strider series has been through a lot of troubles but hopefully Strider's UMvC3 appearance and this game mean the series still has a future. Not sure if DoubleHelix will be making another, maybe Iron Galaxy? They seem to be handling Killer Instinct pretty okay.\nI just want a Strider with the artstyle of 2 and the gameplay of 2014. Is that too much to ask?\n\nNow if we could only get a Cannon-Dancer reboot...","April 6, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is rare to see a core design executed so well.\n\nI only had two minor problems:\n\n1. Traversing the levels can be problematic if you are trying to collect every collectible because levels have different entry and exit points. The game would have benefited from a teleport system, or at least, labels on the map that clearly say where these exits lead to.\n\n2. Some of the enemy's attacks can knock Hiryu down which I understand to some degree but it also can be flow-breaking and frustrating as well. Who knows, maybe I wasn't playing too well, because often I wouldn't be able to dodge these attacks. :)\n\nOverall, if you want frenetic and responsive action that lasts for 6-8 hours, then look no further.

Fantastic controls, high-speed hacking and slashing, and some satisfying boss fights. Unfortunately, it never quite lives up to the promise or standards set by those first couple of hours.\n\nAction quickly becomes bland and not very engaging, and enemy variety is severely limited, save for the tiny smattering of larger robotic enemies that are thrown in from time to time. Hiryu's power-ups never really feel all that vital or add much to the mechanics, and largely function to open doors that inhibit progress or hide some shiny baubles scattered about. The exploration part of the game feels largely like an afterthought, and the only things that really feel worth hunting down are the health and special weapon power-related upgrades. Everything else feels fairly inconsequential, which is due mostly to the game's unfortunate and boring combat.\n\nIf you really NEED to play another one of these kinds of games, by all means, Strider will probably be your cup of tea, but if you want something that's a little more engaging, it's best to look elsewhere.","February 25, 2014","false","12.1"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","3"

As of the release date which is today (Feb 19th 2014) the game has an issue with studdering and crashes for some people, as well as enemies hitting you when they really shouldn't have and not registering moves. Not sure if most of the stuff is unlocked later in the game or what, but I can't use anything like kunais... only jump, primary attack, and secondary attack and stuff gained later after a "boss battle" (bosses become regular enemies after you beat the first one.) so the degree of difficulty is very high. Controls feel very clunky for most of the time.\n\nAt the moment, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone not looking for extreme difficulty and platforming like crazy. If you need a game to hold your hand, look some place else. If you love challenging yourself, metroidvania titles, or speedrunning (which looks like it will be great for) then you should pick it up now, otherwise avoid at all costs or wait for a great deal. Some of these issues might be fixed in the next couple of days, so keep an eye out for that. Recommend a controller over a keyboard, but you can use the keyboard without issue; stablity really cripples this game severely.\n\nGraphic: 6.5/10\nSFX: 4/10\nMusic: 8/10\nStability: 1.5/10\nGlitchiness: 3/10\nKeyboard Controls: 4/10\nController Controls: 7/10\nOverall: 4.9/10\nLength: You can beat the game in <4 hours, but I doubt you will on your first run unless you are great at this genre.\nDifficulty: Very High.\n\nI'd recommend this once the stability and glitches are fixed, which are understandable in a new release, but shouldn't remain for too long.","February 19, 2014","false","5.5"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","7"

Fantastic controls, high-speed hacking and slashing, and some satisfying boss fights. Unfortunately, it never quite lives up to the promise or standards set by those first couple of hours.\n\nAction quickly becomes bland and not very engaging, and enemy variety is severely limited, save for the tiny smattering of larger robotic enemies that are thrown in from time to time. Hiryu's power-ups never really feel all that vital or add much to the mechanics, and largely function to open doors that inhibit progress or hide some shiny baubles scattered about. The exploration part of the game feels largely like an afterthought, and the only things that really feel worth hunting down are the health and special weapon power-related upgrades. Everything else feels fairly inconsequential, which is due mostly to the game's unfortunate and boring combat.\n\nIf you really NEED to play another one of these kinds of games, by all means, Strider will probably be your cup of tea, but if you want something that's a little more engaging, it's best to look elsewhere.","February 25, 2014","false","12.1"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","3"

Fluid movements, great graphics, LOTS of bosses and plenty of hidden weapon upgrades and collectibles throughout this adventure.  There's over 10 bosses to take on, but most of them are push-overs.  While there's always plenty to do while exploring the game doesn't really pick up until the last 30% of the game.  The game is a little slow at the beginning, but that's to be expected for a Metroidvania.  By the time you reach the end the game's set at a fast pace and you're not ready to hang it up.\n\nThe map system sucks though.  Trying to find out where you need to go to find that missing health upgrade, large hp canister or other weapon upgrades is near impossible.  If  you select a different part of the map other than where you currently are it gets cut off and you can't see it.  Another nuisance is when the bosses are talking to you (for the Story) and you're fighting the dialog is in the way of the gameplay.  You'll simply take damage due to the fact you can't see it coming.  There's not a lot of enemies either.  Yes, there are tons of bosses, but the random enemy gets recycled throughout the game and the only differences are colors.\n\nThe game is very good though and very much worth it for anyone that likes a good Metroidvania.

I'm struggling to think of a single complaint... It's not an earth-shatteringly innovative game, but that's ok. Strider is a exceptionally well crafted metroidvania-style game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Didn't take itself too seriously, which is always appreciated. Extremely fast, fluid and reponsive character movement and combat. Backtracking never felt like much of a chore, it's fun just running around. Combat is reasonably challenging (and there's always Hard mode for the masochists out there). The addition of new abilities was well paced, and mixed things up just enough to keep it fresh.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakadasnake/recommended/235210/","Jakadasnake","Jakadasnake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakadasnake/","169 products in account","TL;DR Play it for the exploration and platforming.\n\nStrider is a metroidvania style game. For the uninitiated, this means it's a platformer with vast explorable levels and tons of little nooks and crannies to find unlockables and hidden items. It's also got an emphasis on combat and by the end of the game you'll find you have a lot of tools at your disposal to be able to take care of the various enemies that get thrown your way. That said, I'm going to break this review down into the various components that are considered essential in the execution of a good metroidvania and see how Strider measures up.\n\nControls: 9/10Strider is an excellent protagonist. He's extremely capable and exists as an extention of your fingertips. From the moment you start the game, you'll notice how fluidly and accurate the control scheme is and this allows you to truly take ownership of the game. For the most part, if you get hit, it's because you failed to react in time and not because the controls failed you.\n\nStrider sticks to any wall or ceiling and is able to climb every surface from the start. Sword attacks are directional and instantaneous so you're easily able to parkour your way through the levels, slicing and dicing as you go. This feeling is unique to the game, and I think what makes it a lot of fun.\n\nCombat: 6/10Combat is somewhat lacking. The majority of your experience will have you mashing the attack button repeatedly to take down enemies, and the only true variation on your regular attack is the charged form. Shielded enemies provide incentive to use your charged slash, but end up feeling like more of a nuisance that breaks up the button-mashing than a variable challenge. Additionally, you have special abilities you unlock as the game goes on, all of which better enable you to steamroll your way through the game. But you will likely rely on your sword slash for the majority of the game as it retains its strength throughout.\n\nNot only is the typical combat somewhat repetitive, but there is absolutely no incentive to kill anything. I realized this about a half-hour into my playthrough and just started skipping all nonessential enemies. There is no kill score to rack up, no experience points or customizable character additions to get. You kill red shirts for being annoying and that's about it. So yes, it's still fun, but I think it's a huge missed opportunity not to reward a player for killscore. Add to that that it largely lacks challenge, and you find it fall short here.\n\nLevel Design: 5/10I have mixed feelings on this. At some points the level design is brilliant and rewarding, and at others it's equally dull and infuriating. Games in this style commonly emplace artificial barriers to progress. Think of The Legend of Zelda, where you need to get that next gadget (such as the boomerang) before you're able to reach certain areas of the game. The way strider uses this mechanic, however, can be infuriating. You'll find yourself skipping so much content because it's behind a door that you can't unlock yet or you haven't gotten the kunai. It's not fun. By the time I was able to access everything, I no longer cared to backtrack through the entire game to find the stuff. Compare this to a game like Shadow Complex, where part of the game actually has you backtracking through previous areas for actual progression after you've unlocked all the gadgets and you'll see that Strider falls short here.\n\nWhere the game shines, however, is the platforming. This is something that I can confidently say the game did well. The game gives you a lot of tools to navigate its levels and you'll find yourself using all of them simultaneously before you even realize it. This ninja-feel is something the game achieves well, and is extremely rewarding.\n\nBoss Fights: 7/10One of the things I'd read about going into the game is that the boss fights were repetitive and recycled. I actually couldn't disagree more. Even though you see some bosses more than once, they are not at all the same fights in most of those cases. Now, one of my qualms is that they are sometimes unfair in that some attacks are impossible to react to on your first attempt. Unfortunately this is typically the only challenge to overcome as they generally are very easy to best. Overall, boss fights are fun if not a little frustrating at times.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\nI have mixed feelings for the game overall. Up front, I'll say that I played it on Normal difficulty and don't intend to play it again. It lacked challenge for the most part, and I saw a lot of missed opportunity in a somewhat decent game. My biggest problem with it is the abysmal level design. Still, it was a fun game to play once and I think a lot of players will have found enough reason to go back for all the extras once they've unlocked all the gadgets. I do recommend waiting until the game is on sale, but it's definitely worth your time to play once you own it.","December 25, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics and art style are generally amazing and i really enjoy how the plasma sword and scarf effects are rendered. The story in this game is quite literally non-existant. The story can be summarized in 1 sentence and that is "Strider must kill the evil dictator" and thats it. Now dont get me wrong Im all for the assassination mission style of story, but after that 1 sentence is told to you at the beginning of the game there is no more of it afterwards. The CastleVania genre has never been one of my favorites, but this game does a good job of scattering health and weapon upgrades consistently across the map. Now here are my problems with the game: First of all its is way too short. I got an achivement for beating it in under 4 hours ON ACCIDENT. I even got most of the upgrades and all the weapon mods. The final boss is also disappointingly easy and saying the ending is rushed is an understatement. You beat the final boss then BAM credits! overall id give this game a 5/10.

You are a futuristic ninja battling against evildoers in a dystopian society.\n\nThis game is very comparable to other modern side-scrollers including the brilliant Mark of the Ninja and 360 Arcade exclusive, Shadow Complex. However, unlike Mark of the Ninja, the ninja in Strider does not rely on stealth. He relies on speed and using various abilities gained throughout the game.\n\nBoasting excellent graphics and sound, Strider is a very smart and very fun game that I've been enjoying since I started playing. Like games of yore, Strider takes boss battles seriously and you will find a challenge early on in the game when you come across a boss. You must use strategy and learning their rhythm to defeat them. A few of the earliest bosses are relatively easy button bashers, but you will soon run into others that will give you fits.\n\nThis is a very strong effort and backed by Capcom, I hope to see more of these classic titles remade modern. I highly suggest a controller to enjoy this game to its fullest potential.\n\nIf I had any criticism of it, it would be that I wish the controls were a little tighter when evasion is important. However, that could be more down to my lack of precision than the game itself.\n\nIf you enjoy side-scrolling action games that remind you of the great games of yesterday or even if you're too young to remember and just enjoy an action challenge, Strider could be your ticket to fun. I'm 3 hours in and only 10% complete, so I'm hopeful that there's plenty more hours to come in this very fun game.","July 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It is remarkably mediocre.\n\nLong Review:\n\nStrider is boringly forgettable as a platformer, as a Metroidvania, and as an action combat game. There is really nothing compelling about it, and its strongest point is that the experience is nice and short (~5 hours on normal difficulty). My major complaints,\n\n- The map: This is the worst map I've seen in a Metroidvania, and I've played a lot of them. It has two major problems that are compounded by the lack of useful fast-travel mechanics. The map is basically linear, sprawling from right to left, and the environments are barely distinguishable (basically, sheet metal factory is all you'll see throughout). Because of this, there are few shortcuts to unlock and I never had a moment that made me say "wait what, this connects to THIS!" I never really had any idea where I was unless I was constantly checking the world map. You do unlock a couple of powers that let you jump between points, but these warp points are so disjointed (with little indication of where you'll actually end up) that they don't provide a satisfying or quick way to get from one point to another, even at end-game. It just kills any desire to explore or backtrack. It also seems like the designers realized this, because they actually mark all of the important power-ups on your map (only cosmetic and alternate game mode unlocks are truly hidden).\n\n- Enemies: this goes hand-in-hand with the uniform environments, but the enemy variety is just not there. There are basically 5-6 enemies that are palette-swapped throughout the game (human soldier, flying drone, ape robot, spider robot, turret, acid-spitting bugs). Even though the game does give you a nice set of powers to mess around with, the combat feels very one-note because you just seem to be fighting the same battles over and over again. This does not go for the boss fights though, which are pretty fun.","December 10, 2014","false","7.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There's gonna have to be a lot more order if they intend the OS & Machines will have any hope in the market compared to consoles.  Things like this make it hard for me to continue recommending friends to pc gaming.  I will eventually play this game when I want to go thru the inconvenience of (apparently non-official or sanctioned from Steam or Capcom) guides.  At a glance of the guide,  it seems I've had more ease setting up emulators than the steps the guide seems to indicate.  The game apparently doesn't recognize (at least for me) 2 separate usb controllers (Sabrent 12 btn usb pad & playstation pad w/adaptor) that work with Street Fighter IV just fine.  The title screen alone looks cheaply done & not impressive as seeing the first Strider game many years ago.  I hope the game is more entertaining than this initial impression I have.\n\nupdate 1/30/15: the game crashes randomly upon booting many times for no apparent reason;   looked online for fix & basically found nothing solid.  used xbox360ce to emulate 360 / xinput pads since this is the only type of pad the developers apparently bothered to allow.  this app alone causes the game to crash as well and the app hasn't been updated in a while afaict.  I only really get the app to work by luck it seems due to it being a factor of the game crashes.  i refuse to drink the "buy a 360 pad" kool-aid for any game esp if my pads work 100% for every other game if i can avoid it.  The game is good but not w/o its complaints.  First, it's buggy--random sound effects occur when they are not supposed to (ie level change sound while just running around); i had to reset the game many times while exploring & climbing b/c he'd get stuck in walls but wasn't that big of a deal to me; maps would show an item as not collected (therefore preventing full 100% achievements for a section from being obtained) even though it was obvious it had been; set to play on hardest setting (b/c found the game too easy on lesser difficulties) but didn't get hardest setting achievement--not a big deal but just a little annoying.  The game also doesn't provide quite the impact of the original (the ape boss was too easy & not very large or imposing--he was kinda easy in the original too but more imposing.  There wasn't much variety in the landscapes (was hoping for a dinosaur stage & weird end boss it had from original; no amazon/jungle stage.  There is no save file, if u want to start from beginning, all your previous progress is lost and once u beat the game, you can't use anything u acquired--this is just lazy on their part.  The only thing that remains is the challenge levels which is better than nothing but still not a sign of thoroughness.  Seems like the game was cut in development probably b/c DH knew they were gonna be purchased by Amazon so they just put some polish on console versions first, then whatever time was left--if any--for the pc version.  The game just feels like they rushed it & didn't give it its due.  A concept like Strider is very cool & should be given the full treatment.  Would love to see future versions include blocking or a combo system like ninja gaiden's but uniquelly Strider.  Perhaps the 3d treatement mixed w/some 2d stages if done cohesively.  Also starting the game off w/o the cypher for a level or two if storyline is more epic / movie caliber.  I prefer the original robotic panther but the eagle in this version may be better.  Also preferred the orbs which were more dynamic in movement in the original.  Would've liked to see more & bigger closeups of Strider & his enemies but understand the panoramic & scale of the environments may have been lessened to a degree.  The last tower stage & meio fights; the shiny effects; the sound effects & the music; the different costumes were also cool.","December 30, 2014","false","48.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A short yet fast 2D action-platformer with metroidvania-like exploration where you'll be required to backtrack a bit and open up new places in the world with the new things you get as you play the game. The game takes a lot from the previous Strider games including the enemies/bosses and power-ups/upgrades included in it along with its own new features.\n\nDifficulties range from Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only difference with these is the damage differences; the higher the difficulty the more hits you need to dish out and the fewer hits you can take, though I'm finding Normal to still be a bit easy and Hard actually causing me to die quite a lot which kind of forces me to actually pay attention to how I should be avoiding taking damage while still hacking and slashing.\nThe hacking and slashing is as fast as you press the attack button which can be very tiring. You can attack at almost anytime you do anything and the direction as to where you slash can also be manipulated to be pointed almost anywhere around you as you please.\n\nI didn't find the exploration part to be very rewarding since a lot of the optional things you go back for can only be attained somewhat late in the game and there's no sort of New Game + to keep at least some of the upgrades. Plus there's a lot of strenuous backtracking to get these optional items.\nI found it to be a lot of fun though to sort of speed run through the game and mostly follow the indication of where I should run to next. Because it's a 2D platformer a controller is best suited.","April 24, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/235210/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Strider is a remake of a 1989 arcade classic starring Strider Hiryu, a ninja with a quick swinging sword capable of slashing a group of troopers in an instant. He is incredibly acrobatic. It felt weird to me that there was no mouse needed to play Strider, just a keyboard. The keyboard is tolerable, although I was wondering if a gamepad is more appropriate for the PC version of this game considering all the different moves you will learn as you progress through the game making Strider a more powerful protagonist.\n\nThe story is very simple as it takes place in Kazakh in the Soviet era. Once you understand the setting you will slice various enemies while you rely on your map to reach your next objective. The gameplay is very fast paced and this is a good attribute for this game. The action is also impressive and gets more impressive as you progress. You will learn new moves such as the double jump. The double jump will be crucial to jumping over obstacles such as electrical fields and moving buzz saws. Other moves include the kunai, which is a plasma weapon used to shoot enemies and becomes crucial during boss fights.\n\nThere is plenty climbing up walls and ceilings and Strider has sickle that can be called a climbsickle. This is a very useful tool for navigating the different levels in an action platformer that is basically about moving horizontally and up and down. There are many collectibles in this game, some for upgrading Strider, others for cosmetic effect. The collectibles Strider can be in well hidden areas, so Strider must use his double jumps and catapults to good use in order to find these collectibles. The most important collectibles are health and energy upgrades that increase Strider’s max health and energy.\n\nThe enemies consist of troopers of different variations, some very basic, others carry shields that require more advanced moves to eliminate them. The enemies do become repetitive since they look the same and can respawn as you backtrack to some levels. The boss fights can be downright annoying, especially if you don’t learn each boss’ patterns. Every boss has a pattern of fighting, so you will have to go through several tries of button mashing to finally defeat a boss.  One boss fight includes 3 sexy females after fighting two of them in previous encounters.  Another includes a boss who uses water to attack you and you must learn how the pattern of water based attacks is used. Defense is very important in each boss fight. Too much offense and too little defense will get you killed without a doubt. The defense requires a number of keys to be pressed in order to avoid a boss’ attacks. These boss fights made me think that a gamepad might be better suited to fighting these bosses than the keyboard.\n\nThe graphics are never bland and are always bright. Every level of Kazakh City is vibrant. Levels include an abandoned train station, a research facility, a military prison, and other diverse locales. Strider can eventually travel using an eagle perch, which looks beautiful when using it as a travel point. There’s also a panther statue that can be used to travel from one destination to another.\nOverall, I think Strider is a decent game that is a reminder of the arcade era of the 1980s. It can be frustrating to mash buttons in order to defeat tough bosses. I felt a sense of accomplishment when defeating these bosses, but I didn’t feel like I would like to fight them again for fun or replayability. The replay value I find in this game is the collectibles that are scattered throughout each level. It can be enjoyable if you’re looking for 1980s arcade fun and fast paced action platforming, but you should be aware of the frustration of pressing different buttons so quickly, so many times with the keyboard.","November 30, 2014","true","33.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

No, I wouldn't. Why? Because, unlike what most people claim, the game just isn't fun. Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like the complete lack of context and the INCREDIBLY weak excuse for a "story" in the game deals a rather harsh blow to it. Adding to that, the fact that the metroidvania tag applied is VASTLY misleading, I just couldn't find anything fun about it.\n\nNow, just to be clear, the game isn't bad (extremely annoying flashing lights during "boss intros" notwithstanding), but I honestly couldn't find any enjoyment in playing it. I suppose if I have to praise it for something, it would be that it wastes no time in letting you get to the action and start kicking äss, but the fact of the matter is that it feels like that's ALL you do. Yeah, combat is pretty centrical for ALL metroidvania games, but there's SUPPOSED to be exploration as well!\n\nStrider has essentially no exploration whatsoever. This, in case you're not aware, is a direct violation of the entire metroidvania formula. It'd be like a Super Mario game WITHOUT MARIO.\n\nAll in all, between the completely hollow "story" and the utter lack of exploration, I can't recommend this game. It's not bad, it's just boring.

For instance, if there's a boss fight, the checkpoint is not right before the boss, but 5 minutes ago\n- Boss fights are extremely repetitive (as are fights with the common enemies, but bosses don't die so quickly)\n- As noted in the other negative review, all bosses are pretty similar\n- Enemies respawn when you get back to a previously visited location\n\nOverall, this feels like a 20 year old arcade game with modern visuals.

You just mash against the enemies until they die for years. I pursued the campaign in hopes that the enemies become more challenging and creative. They don't become anymore than punching (or, rather, slashing) bags until very far into the game. And even then, it barely takes much effort at all to shove them aside and continue towards the objective point.\n\nThe world aspect itself is in the style of Metroid or Iga-related Castelvania games. Much simpler than the likes of those games, though. Finding extras doesn't take much effort, you either find them by going through unexplored areas, or simply go back to it later when you have an ability to overcome the 'obstacle. (read: Funny-looking Door)' Everything felt like the beginning of Super Metroid, where they're easy to attain. And it just seemed to stay that way for this title.\n\nBosses are not challenging in the slightest. There isn't anything more to them, for the most part, besides avoiding their attacks. Once they're not attacking, mash against them like your life depends on it.\n\nI really don't understand why there's much praise for this game. Just like when this team took a crack at Silent Hill, it feels unimaginative and bland. Almost soulless. But I will give credit where it's due, Strider himself controls excellently, it makes it an even bigger shame that they put a character that functions as well as this in a game that has almost nothing new or exciting to offer.","March 8","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For instance, if there's a boss fight, the checkpoint is not right before the boss, but 5 minutes ago\n- Boss fights are extremely repetitive (as are fights with the common enemies, but bosses don't die so quickly)\n- As noted in the other negative review, all bosses are pretty similar\n- Enemies respawn when you get back to a previously visited location\n\nOverall, this feels like a 20 year old arcade game with modern visuals.

I felt it was built with hard mode in mind as the main difficulty, as the risk vs reward dynamic is lacking in normal, and nonexistent in easy.\n\nThe only bad thing that really stands out to me is the lackluster&generic soundtrack - after beating each difficulty once, I still can't remember any song from the game. Regardless, it's a great 2.5d platformer that knows how to communicate the rules and pacing of its action-centric world to the player.","February 22, 2014","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A steady stream of unlockable abilities, power-ups, and hidden collectibles keeps the gameplay fresh while encouraging, and often demanding, exploration. While Hiryu begins with only his standard cartwheel jump and Climbsickle, you'll soon be Sliding, Double Jumping, and Plasma Catapulting yourself all over the map.\n\nCombat has been improved in several ways, perhaps one of the most notable being the addition of aimable Cypher attacks. A seemingly simple change, but one which adds a great deal of depth and enjoyment to the formula. Other additions include throwable kunai, a launcher which juggles enemies into the air, a strong ground-slamming dive (Downstrike), and the Charge Attack, which deals greater damage.\n\nExploration and combat is further deepened by the return of Hiryu's robotic Option companions and the introduction of four Plasma Types (Reflect, Burst, Ultra-Cold, and Magnetic), which can be used to alter the properties of your Cypher, Kunai, and Plasma Catapult. In addition to their obvious combat applications, these power-ups can all be used to help traverse the map.\n\nThe art direction, helmed by Strider 2's character designer, is strong and substantive, providing a familiar look to the characters while updating them in new and visually interesting ways. Though dark and drab at times, the scenery is beautifully rendered and constantly sells the scope of Kazakh City, with vistas that stretch off into the distance, overflow with life and activity, and often become their own distinct sections of the map.\n\nThe soundtrack is incidental and moody with just a hint of dubstep, and contains a mixture of new tracks and remixed tunes from all three previous Strider games. The distinct "shing" of Hiryu's Cypher and his ceaseless "ha!" have been mercifully toned done, and the various bits of dialogue spoken by the countless grunts just before Hiryu murders them are a nice addition. Occasional announcements broadcast by a couple of the bosses can get a bit annoying, but are thankfully silenced after they are defeated.\n\nThe game is just long enough; a speedrun will likely take 2 to 4 hours to complete, but a full clear with 100% completion could take anywhere from 8 to 16. There are also a few unlockable modes, including speed-oriented time trials and combant-oriented survival missions.\n\nAll in all, Strider is a strong showing from Double Helix, and a particularily solid budget title. At the low price of $15, it's hard to think of a reason not to pick this game up -- just keep in mind that the system requirements for the PC version are fairly high.","February 23, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Loved the soundtrack; reminded me of long nights playing the original Strider when I was a teen. I don't suggest playing this with a keyboard - some of the gravity battles seem like they'd be excruciatingly frustrating to play without a gamepad of some kind.

If you didn't play that you may not appreciate it so much, although you'll still feel awesome as you stylishly decimate the run of the mill troops with a variety of skills.  You can expect some tough old school boss fights though that you'll need to be prepared to lose to a few times before you get the hang of their attack patterns.  Expect to swear a bit, but mostly at yourself because once they click it's fine.  It isn't a particularly long game, but then it isn't as pricey as most, and is enjoyable while it lasts.\n\nTechnical issues wise the only bug I hit was having to play in a window rather then fullscreen, but didn't really matter.  Also don't think the controls can be re-mapped that I could see (though the default Xbox 360 controller bindings are good enough I wouldn't have bothered anyway).  One thing that might annoy some people is that the save points between sessions aren't as generous as those while playing, so you may find you have to restart a level where you were happily continuing from a later point earlier.","February 24, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll try and write a bit more on it when I finish, and I will finish, so that should tell you something at least. I currently give this game an "Eh, its alright for the price. Not bad." Its a very faithful recreation, and I'd even go so far as to call it a platformer adaptation gone right. That said the main thing it lacks that I've found prevalent in most platformers is challenge. Strider is absurdly easy. The whole game is in a sort of bullet time, fall damage is not a threat unless there is a floor threat and most enemies including bosses telegraph really hard. There is furthermore no hard time limit, though you can make leaderboards for finishing quickly (I think). Pretty much, if you want a game about feeling really cool and badass its great, but if you wanted a challenge look elsewhere. I'm playing on hard and have yet to break a sweat (figuratively speaking) and I'm not even an exceptional player at platformers or brawlers.\n\nBut again, it looks really cool.

The new Metroid-vania elements to the game do nothing to stifle its appeal, charm or pace; and the game never feels like it is slowing down or letting up.\n\nEverything that long-time series fans love is here, the memorable characters, the lightning fast and tight-as-can-be controls and that good ol' *SCHING* that the Cypher makes while it is swung at mach speeds. If you are a fan of 2D Action, the good old days of arcades or a main-stay fan of the original series, this game will not disappoint.\n\nThat being said, it won't surprise you, and is not entirely innovative with its design - So if you think Strider 2014 will re-write the wheel, dial back your expectations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SharkFanFTW/recommended/235210/","SharkFanFTW","SharkFanFTW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SharkFanFTW/","210 products in account","Strider Hiryu is a character that I was first introduced to by watching the DEATH BATTLE! between him and Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden. Hiryu was a badass, and (spoiler alert) defeated Ryu. So when I saw this game that I hadn't heard about before on sale and recognized it's main character, I decided to try it out, and boy, does this game have a lot to offer besides just a ball-busting protagonist! The story is set in the dystopian future of 2048 in the Russian city of Kazakh which is ruled by the oppresive Meio, a godly being who plans to wipe out humanity so that he can re-build the world in his own vision. You play as the previously mentioned Strider Hiryu, an extremly skilled ninja who must defeat Meio and restore peace to Kazakh and prevent apocalypse. The game is a Metroidvania-style hack-and-slash action-adventure platformer (wow that's a long genre name), where you use your plasma cypher to slay enemies, and as you progress in the game, you collect upgrades to your weapons, your health and energy and even new weapons and techniques. As one would expect from a Metroidvania game, these abilities and weapons are equally as useful in defeating enemies AND overcoming obstacles. The gameplay is flawless, which is mandatory for a game with such gameplay principles, and it is unbeliavebly satisfying and fun. The graphics look really nice during gameplay. When the charactermodels are zoomed in on during cutscenes, they don't look as good, but it is of little concern. All design choices are very good and everything really possesses the grim science-fiction feel the developers went for. The music, while not very memorable, is atmospheric and fitting, and it warmed my heart to hear some wobbles among the ambient noises and musical tones. Voice-acting, story, characters etc. is good, but again, not very memorable. Even on medium difficulty, the game presented quite a challenge, but it is forgiving, which I think is important in a game like this. All in all, if you like platform games, hack-and-slash games, or Metroidvania style games and play for the gameplay more than anything else, I recommend Strider with all my heart. And I also recommend playing with a controller. I haven't tried to play without one, but the thought is frightening.\n9/10","August 15, 2015","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/235210/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","6.5/10.\nI was greatly disappointed by this game. A game by my favorite studio and gotten good critic and user reviews. But this game is the definition of mediocrity and blandness. Most of the game is spent running around the same looking futuristic drab landscape, where every level feels the same. You fight the same 3-4 guys the entire game (they try fooling you by changing color of the soldier’s uniform to make you think it is a different enemy…..I wasn’t fooled), minus the occasional mini-boss. There are many boss fights, which is a nice change of pace, unfortunately the game uses the unfortunate trope of repeating multiple bosses. The levels are big open levels, although they are mostly empty and boring, and involve much backtracking. Most of what you will find by searching around is boring concept art nobody every cares about.\nThe other thing you will find is upgrades. In order to gain any health or energy upgrades you need to scour every single level all over the place. You start with the smallest health bar I have ever seen in a game. Don’t play the game on hard because guys shoot multiple shots are once that are impossible to dodge, as you are the least elusive acrobatic ninja ever. All you can do is do a slow jump in the air where you spread out, or just run at people. There is a slide but it is slow, you do a spin first to do it, and you can still get easily hit while doing it. In hard guys do tons of damage, the health pickups give you almost no amount, and bosses take tons of retries. The terrible checkpoints mean you will have to start in areas before the boss and you will have to watch the crappy cutscene again. There is literally no story, and the small amount of dialogue/cutscenes involve terrible voice acting and models that (no joke) don’t open or move their lips when they talk.\nThen there’s the combat. It is the most boring ever. You literally just spam x (basic attack) as fast as you can while running at guys. The same is for the bosses. You have a charge-up attack that takes too long, and an upward slash that is completely useless. You never learn combos or anything special. By the time you learn a teleportation, or using other elements in your attack, its 2/3 done with the game already. The first 2/3 is just doing the same slash move over and over with every guy as fast as you can while you run straight at them. It became so boring and monotonous that I just tried jumping past guys to get to the next area. You can also be continuously juggled and killed with certain enemy combinations, as happened to me a few times.\nThe platforming can be fun and inventive sometimes. You can climb and stick to walls, which is not common in many platforms. Unfortunately, more than not, it frustrates. It is very finicky and hard to control. There is a way to move fast up a wall, but not horizontally move across the wall, meaning it’s super slow. For some reason on platforms you can’t swing around from above to under it. If you try to jump from hanging below something you must drop first, then try to jump. Many times I would try to jump off the side of a wall and it wouldn’t let me detach. Other times I would try to jump over something and it would make me grab onto the side of it.\nThe worst problem I faced, above all else, was the checkpoints. On multiple occasions I would exit to a new level, and see a “checkpoint” icon in the top right. I would then quit the game, and upon coming back see that the game didn’t save my progress and I was back at a previous level. In one occurrence I had to redo an entire boss fight, and go to the next level again, because the same hadn’t saved my progress. What game in 2015 doesn’t save progress AFTER A BOSS FIGHT AND THEN A LEVEL SWITCH?”!!?! This meant that I would never want to exit the game, because I never knew what it would save and what I would have to repeat. I couldn’t even count on beating a boss or starting a new level to mean it had saved, as those normal staples were apparently not part of the game’s save function.\nThe game does have decent length, and I still BARELY recommend it because there are a few times where the game shines and the platforming is and inventive, or a boss fight is enjoyable, or some of the new powers you get later on, including throwing stars, teleportation, etc, are fun. I just don’t get why they have you get them so late in the game. The backtracking definitely frustrates as well.\n\nThere are MANY other better options in the action/platformer genre, and use this only as a last resort if you've run out of other good ones to play. Wait for a sale, as 15 dollars is definitely too much to ask.\n","August 26, 2015","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved Strider in the arcades, I knew it inside and out, and could clear it with one life.  I feared the remake, but I needn't have.\n\nThis is not the original Strider, it's more Strider meets Metroidvania, and it works.  It works so hard.  The first thing I did after completing the game (and it's not a short game) is immediately start a second game on hard.\n\nIt does so many things right.  The graphics are excellent just about everywhere, and never less than really good when it stumbles.  The game occasionally opens up to really big views giving everything an immense scale, and there's a real feeling of height when you jump blindly off some platforms.  Strider's movements are perfect, from running to climbing to slashing with his sword.  Sometimes you want to screenshot your game just because it looks so fun.\n\nStrider makes frequent nods toward its history, sometimes the player will hear a sound effect taken from the original arcade game, and some levels are eerily familiar.\n\nCannot recommend highly enough.  It's among the best.","September 20, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Mechanics are rather boring...there is no tutorial. You start off with only 2 attacks...normal and heavy and you literally just run into enemies and recover lost health later. That is a core mechanic of the game. You are apparently expected to take damage. Bad game design imho. The first mini boss simply teleports after you and locks you down with a double attack. Check points are weirdly placed and you're never 100% sure where you will start off after a death or - god forbid - quitting the game, which is supremely annoying. For example: I defeated the first "boss", a giant snake...the game does not save after beating it...you actually have to continue playing after beating a boss and reach the next check point...\n\nOh, and somewhere in there, there's a story...apparently.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/235210/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Strider is freakin' awesome!\nI'm pretty convinced that this is one of the best 2d sidescrolling action game to come out in the last few years.\nThis game isn't really innovative in any way, but what it does, it does almost perfectly. Well, yeah, I enjoyed the game a whole lot.\n\nStrider is like a Metroid-vania, with its focus on combat and movement rather than exploration. Don't get me, wrong, the exploration is definitely there, but mostly if you're looking out for all the extras. If you don't really care about exploration and extras, you can still play it for the action without it being a subpar experience.\n\nIt took me 10 hours (I assume excluding deaths and down time) to 100% the game on Hard Mode.\nI will eventually go back to it for the challenges and even a Normal Speedrun under 4hours. I've seen someone do a 37minute run, so there's that.\nLength feel pretty go to me, but that all depends on wether or not you're one to explore the levels or simply rush through.\nThere are Speed and Combat challenges you can unlock, so there is something more to do besides the Campaign.\n\n\nStarting with the presentation.\nA lot has been invested into making the game look really shiny, and also into its lighting effects. Well, it looks really great, and, despite having heard of a few performance issues, it ran very smooth for me all the time.\nThroughout the game you will visit several diferent areas, although they all look very industrial and that's my only criticism about the graphics. Due the whole industrial look it feels too same-y at times. But it still looks great, and every background is highly detailed. One can clearly see the work DoubleHelix put into making Strider a more than worthwhile experience.\nAll the lighting effects from the weapons and special attacks look very polished as well and make combat a treat to look at while you cut enemies in half!\n\nAnimation quality is top notch as well, everything is really fluid, making the combat and the platforming very responsive and satisfying as a result!\nEven jumping around is fun with the signature star jump!\n\nRegarding graphics, the other criticism I can think of is that the character models can look a little blurry and low quality in the cutscenes, since they're much closer to the screen.\nDuring the game sequences however, they definitely look awesome and it's understandable why they wouldn't use higher res textures for that.\n\nNow, regarding the music. This was a bit of a disappointment for me.\nI haven't played the previous Strider games, but at least from the other old-school sidescrollers I've played, music has been a real focus and often a spotlight for the games. In Strider however, the music never really gave me the kick while fighting or anything. It wasn't bad, on the contrary, but it didn't really seem to drive gameplay in anyway and seemed to be there for the sake of it.\nIt doesn't detract from the experience, but I did expect something more from it. Ah well...\n\n\nNow, the real meat of the game.\n\nCombat in Strider is really fast, and gets progressively more complex as you progress through the story. You have simple attacks, an Uppercut, and Slide, and you then unlock Kunai throwing, and Downstrike, a Teleport charge attack and several 3 other Special Attacks.\nThen, you have 4 weapon types (Explosive, Frozen, Reflective and Boomerang), with different purposes and secondary effects, which affect both the Kunai and the Teleport.\nIt's all fast and furious and it's surprisingly responsive!\n\nCertain enemies require the player to use a certain weapon type to break their shield before going all in against them, and it creates some more challenging sections. Some people don't like this type of combat, but it doesn't really bother me, and adds something to the combat, so I'm fine with it.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the combat is the lack of combos. Since you don't have a big variety of moves, you can't really get enemies into the air for 5 minutes and feel like a badass. Well, you still feel like a badass (!), but there's none of those long combos.\n\n\nLevel Design was really good, despite some big flaws (for me). You have a bunch of different areas which you can travel to, each with a ton of secrets for the player to explore at will (Extras, Upgrades and Costumes) and generally a Boss Fight.\nSome of the Extras are really well hidden, and will require a decent amount of skill from the player in using every tool available.\nEach area is fairily long, and labyrinthic at times, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The difficulty comes mostly from the Extras exploration, and none of it will hinder your game progress if you're not actively looking for those.\n\nNow, here are my flaws with the Level Design. First one if the Checkpoint System. This is a really incoherent aspect of the game, sometimes saving after Boss Fights, sometimes not really. Besides, some checkpoint are very close to one another, and others are pretty far apart, or have a particularly challenging section between them... This leads to very frustrating deaths at times. Besides, if you die, everything you did after the checkpoint is gone, including all the Extras. That's even more infuriating when you quit the game after beating a Boss and realizing that a bunch of your progress has been ignored.\n\nAnother huge problem I had with it, is that you can't really get back to the game after you finish it. And if you want to 100% the game, you need to do it before the last area. They do give you a warning not to go there before collecting everything you want, so that's good.\nBUT, it completely breaks to pace of the game. Right before the ending climax, you'll have to stop everything and go through some sometimes laborious exploration.\n\nMore on that here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/235210/discussions/0/558752449340022157/\n\nNow, regarding difficulty.\nThe game had a few challenging sections and Boss Fights, but it was mainly way too easy for an old-school inspired game. I've managed to beat most Boss Fights on my first try, maybe second.\nThe beginning was the hardest part of it, as you had no upgrades and there were bullets flying from all over. And that felt great!\nThe main problem is that, since the checkpoint system is very unforgiving and incoherent, making the game hard would probably be too frustrating.\n\n\nNow, regarding the Extras.\nYou can explore to collect Concept Art, Character Models with descriptions, and also Story Intel, with a bit of info about Strider's Universe. I find that pretty great, although it would have been nice to be able to listen to those texts while playing, instead of having to pause and read them. But, voice acting would be costly, so that's enough, I guess.\nAside from those, there are Costumes.\nThese are purely cosmetic, and only change your colour, and give you a little information about whose Strider that suit did belong to. If you collect all of them, you can change each piece of gear and customize it to your taste.\n\n\nOverall, Strider is one very good Metroidvania game with more focus on combat rather than exploration, despite having and doing both equally well!\nIt makes you feel like a badass throughout the whole experience, and mixes some of the best old-school and modern design choices into one game. One thing I didn't mention were the Boss Fights. For me, those were a mixed bag, but mostly great. Some patterns seemed to random to avoid, but they were mostly accessible, and pretty straightforward once toy learned each Boss (and a similar thought goes into every enemy).\n\nIf you like this genre, or are simply interested in Strider, go ahead and buy it. It's awesome!","April 3, 2014","true","18.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Plays very similar to Strider 2 but with a metroidvania twist. I suppose this is because it wasn't planned as an arcade game like the other titles. It still feels like a Strider game though. You can tell they wanted to please the fans and also make something different.\n\nBosses are very good, they don't have a weak point, or limited vunerability time or any other modern boss bullcrap. Just dodge their attacks and hit them.\n\nCombat with the grunts can get pretty annoying by the endgame when you're backtracking for upgrades. Also the enemies could have been more varied other than just colour coded shields.\n\nStory is very minimal and dialouge is very cliche (which is just right for this game surprisingly, it really worked for me). But if you're playing this sort of game you shouldn't care.\n\nThe visuals are simply outstandigly beutiful, and the design is just perfect. They really nailed it!\n\nOverall I feel this is more of a spinoff than a reboot, but maybe this is what the series needs to make a comeback after all these years. It's too bad they went with just "STRIDER" as a title, if they had added a subtitle they might have kept a few doors open.\n\nI would recommend this game, especially if you are a newcomer.

I loved Strider 2 for the original playstation but lack of replayability killed my interest in it. Lucky for me this new Strider game has everything I've loved about the old ones and new features seen in other games that are familiar and incredibly enjoyable in this one.\nThis game delivers everything described plus it gives you a solid incentive to explore the seamless world you're in (in glorious metroidvania fashion) with collectable concept art work, enemy info (with viewable enemy 3d model), color schemes for your character and PLENTY of upgrades (even ones that aren't essential to story progression). Even if all I had was Strider Hiryu and the ability to run, jump and climb wherever I wanted in this giant world (which has very little loading between levels) I would still love this game.\n\nMy only complaint? The music in this game is awesome (most if not all are remixes of the original Nes and Genesis soundtrack) and you can barely hear it even if you lower every other sound in the game.\n9 Billowing red scarves out of 10!","February 27, 2014","true","13.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That being said the controller works absolutely great, with good uses of rumble if your controller supports it.\n\nGameplay wise this game feels and plays amazingly. The combat is fast, quick and most importantly liquid. The only gripe I have is the charge cypher, it feels like you need to be charging it constantly with the ammount of baddies with shields that you need to break, but its somehow different than say, running with a charge beam in any Metroid. Almost all items and jumps are places in all the perfect places, places where it might be natural to jump and the items are just within reach of a charge cypher slash. IMHO Metroidvania styled Strider is probably the best way this series could've gone, and so far its held up pretty well, but it doesn't hold the mysterious charm that Super Metroid, Zero Mission and Fusion hold when exploring a New Area.\n\nSound design just might be my favourite part of this, I haven't even played Killer Instinct but I know that Double Helixs' sound designers are absolutely amazing, jumping, climbing, music and voice acting this game has it ALL, if there is a soundtrack and you like the music from other games like Michael McCann Deus Ex Human Revolution and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragons Powerglove, I would totally recommend getting this soundtrack (Will not question the means of how you get the soundtrack)\n\nThe art and animations of this game look amazing, the jump animation looks like its been just taken from the PS1 game, as well as several other animations that I cannot remember at the moment. The stages look like they've been heavily inspired from Bionic Commando: Rearmed, which is hardly a bad thing. Explosions, etc have a more cell shaded look to them and it fits really well and doesn't really distract (Unless you're looking at it to admire how pretty the smoke looks).\n\nThe price point of 15$ made this an instant buy for me, so far it feels like a 30$ game, totally worth it. If/when it goes on sale for say, $7.49 and you like Metroid games or  Beat-em-ups; I'd say you have no excuse not to buy this game.\n\nI GIVE STRIDER 2014 A FUN/10","February 22, 2014","true","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Playing as him feels as good as any iteration of his character on MvC and all your favorite moves are there.\n\nFrom the intro (that will give you goosebumps) beckoning the original game till the very bad-♥♥♥ ending, it feels and plays like a love letter to the underplayed character that Strider is.\n\nThe game is a metroidvania type and you will waste away hour trying to make Strider the most over powerered you can. I felt some Bionic Commando memories emerging playing this, the platforming will test your mettle and mess with your mind sometimes but never feeling unfair or too convoluted, it's smartly designed.\n\nEvery upgrade you get feels unique and encourages different playstyles, the game designers did this right never holding your hand but giving you queues instead.\n\nThere are some negatives to this game that I really would like to see fixed in a next iteration:\n-Subtitles are huge and rendered right on top of the player sometimes, so you can't really see what you are doing on some bosses.\n-There is no way to manually mark objectives on the map.\n-Sometimes background objects seem like they are on the foreground.\n-The difficulty is uneven, I suggest playing it on Hard right away as you will breeze through most enemies, but the bosses will really make you dispair. I was stunlocked for 50% of my health on occasions.\n-Enemy iteration is too low, they are mostly reskined throughout the the game ( there are no fast melee enemies and they are sorely lacking as a foil).\n-No secondary main weapon though the primary sees alot of uses.\n\nDon't let me come across with the wrong message, this game is worth every buck on base price.\n\n8/10 WILL STRIED AGAIN !!11","February 23, 2014","true","11.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have never played any of the other Strider games. This was my introduction to the classic capcom series, and I have to say that I am pleased! This game is sidescrolling action at it's finest, and I am glad to see such a good sidescroller in this generation. This game is fast and action packed and it is wrapped in a beautiful, colorful and unique sci-fi package. You truly feel like a skilled warrior while slashing through countless enemies and some challenging bosses. This game is great and it has inspired me to take a look at the previous Strider games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilentGodot/recommended/235210/","SilentGodot","Godot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilentGodot/","129 products in account","This is an interesting reebot. Plays very similar to Strider 2 but with a metroidvania twist. I suppose this is because it wasn't planned as an arcade game like the other titles. It still feels like a Strider game though. You can tell they wanted to please the fans and also make something different.\n\nBosses are very good, they don't have a weak point, or limited vunerability time or any other modern boss bullcrap. Just dodge their attacks and hit them.\n\nCombat with the grunts can get pretty annoying by the endgame when you're backtracking for upgrades. Also the enemies could have been more varied other than just colour coded shields.\n\nStory is very minimal and dialouge is very cliche (which is just right for this game surprisingly, it really worked for me). But if you're playing this sort of game you shouldn't care.\n\nThe visuals are simply outstandigly beutiful, and the design is just perfect. They really nailed it!\n\nOverall I feel this is more of a spinoff than a reboot, but maybe this is what the series needs to make a comeback after all these years. It's too bad they went with just "STRIDER" as a title, if they had added a subtitle they might have kept a few doors open.\n\nI would recommend this game, especially if you are a newcomer. It is easier than previous titles most of the time, but you can still have fun with it, and you probably won't breeze through.","February 22, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Awesome boss fights and cool enemies.\n\nSome things I disliked was that there were very few enemey varieties, The game is also fairly short at 4-6 hours if you play at a normal pace.

It is a true metroid vania game - there are A LOT of doors you can't open until later in the game EVERYWHERE. The combat feels very good. And when you play it on hard, it can be EXTREMELY difficult. Platforming is great. Everything is pretty good, really.\n\nBut, it really does feel like a bullet hell at times, and there are moments that just suck. For example: I'm around 35%-ish complete, and there is a very small and enclosed and locked room in which you have to fight 2 really big things that throw fire around everywhere and hit you extremely hard. It's not the only example, but you get the idea. Thankfully, these are few and far between, so you shouldn't have much of a problem with it.\n\nOverall, it's a great game, and for $15, it would be stupid not to try it.","February 21, 2014","true","19.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What I don't have much time put into the game on Steam so how can I make a review? Yes it is true but the fps wasn't so good on my laptop so I got it on my PS3 and beat it on there. This game is great and a large amount of fun! Let me go over what they brought back from the past.\n\nSoundtrack:\nRaid (The theme was great and you only hear it in the beginning but it is just so perfect and fits the stuff going on!)\nCoup (The music during the fight with Mecha Pon in the original Strider which was my goodness amazing)\nGrandmaster Meio (Surprisingly this wasn't a remix of his theme, instead it's more like electronic type piece of music nothing like his old theme)\nSiberian Tunnel (The theme to level in Siberia which was spot on and added a creepy mood the game. Fits perfectly)\n\n+The soundtrack is just amazing and makes the experience so much more enjoyable. The Kazakh theme is just so great as well. You'll hear it a lot and it is just perfect for the action.\n\nGameplay:\n-The faster you mash the attack button for Cypher, the faster you attack just like the original Striders\n-His Famous Slide is still in the game.\n-Combat is a lot of fun and there are plenty of enemies to face. Though you might have trouble in the first run of the game but second run and you can mow through them.\n-Mini bosses add on to the game's experience which are fun and great.\n-Enemy Introductions\n-The game plays very well and the new cypher types and abilities make combat more dynamic.\n\n+Combines old and new elements to the game for an incredible experience.\n+Game plays like the Original\n+Brings back iconic enemies and bosses.\n+The Voice actor for Strider was spot on! You don't hear him talk much but it is a lot better than his UMVC3 voice which was like a black dude or something. He has more of a believable voice.\n-No Japanese voice setting. (Still fun anyways!)\n-Can get frustrating but it's okay.\n\nAs a True Strider fan I highly recommend this to anyone who played Strider in the past!

Some of the designs/choices are frustrating, like putting a save point then a loading screening & no rebindable keys, but thats minor. Strider is very reponsive, the attacks are as fast as your clicking speed, this is a very button mashy game, the boss fights are fun and it brings back the classic game cheese while being modern.","March 1, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epochawol/recommended/235210/","epochawol","EpochAWOL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epochawol/","343 products in account","I'm playing through the game on Normal, and am at the final zone.  I really like the game.\n\nI like the fact that you have a full range of movement at the beginning of the game.  You start off bounding over rooftops and once I entered the first building and accidentally grabbed the ceiling, it was an "AWESOME!" moment for me.  And every new movement ability you get is just icing on that cake.\nAnd every enemy you kill restores a little bit of health, so in the beginning of the game, you are pretty much encouraged to run face first into gunfire, because killing the enemy will give you more health than the damage you take.  Eventually, that disparity closes, but the game does an amazing job of making you feel badass.\n\nI like the fact that the game eschews levels.  It feels like every game since SotN has made a point to shoehorn levels into this style of game, and so you can just grind levels to make bosses easier.  This game forces you to skill up instead.  Which leads to:\n\nBosses.  There is a lot of discussion in the forums and reviews about how challenging the bosses are, and honestly, I think they are just about right.  For the first half of the game, I died at least twice to almost every boss, but the final time I beat them, I did it while losing hardly any health, meaning that I had learned the patterns and applied the correct countermeasures.  The bosses are challenging, but not cheap.  For the second half of the game, I was mostly able to beat bosses on the first try, but I think that's mostly because I was both more skilled, and also had a vastly more effective loadout because of upgrades.  The only boss that is really broken is Solo, where I figured out how to dodge his attacks, but couldn't see where I was going because the camera kept zooming in and out.  It even glitched at one point and got stuck, making it worse.\n\nThe upgrades are pretty simplistic, and I like the way the plasmas sort of mimic Metroid Prime's elemental attacks, and are also used to open matching doors.  And similarly, no plasma feels more powerful than any other, so your character and enemies never really get power creep, you just get better at learning patterns and attacking from range.  Each new plasma has its specific use against certain enemies.  And the plasma somersault is ridiculous fun.  Going back for collectibles and upgrades stays pretty interesting because of the few new move abilities and the way they let you bounce all over the place.  The downside is that the game does make you slog through the same levels and enemies every time you backtrack, without any shortcuts.  The map is also a bit confusing or at least unclear on some things, while at the same time it will lead you by the nose to the goals, which was a bit too much Metroid Fusion like.","February 27, 2014","true","11.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Much like Strider 2, this version is also a sign of the times graphically when aesthetics tend to take a backseat on many platformers. For anyone who is a fan of the Castlevania games post-Dracula X, and the Metroid games (see tag Metroidvania), this version also uses a huge interconnected world that can be fully explored upon acquiring upgrades that allow travel through once inaccessable areas. Controls are as responsive as one would expect if they've played past Striders, with a few differences (for example, he has a launcher attack ala his Marvel vs. Capcom appearances).\n\nMy main issue with the game is in its lack of optimization. I own quite a few games on Steam that are quite demanding graphically (Crysis 2, for example), but I've never had to scale them lower than 720p just to get a playable framerate. I haven't had it crash on me like other people have noted, but there's a weird rendering bug that happens after leaving the pause menu: certain pieces of terrain or the environment itself won't get filled, making it appear as though nothing's there.\n\nIf they could just fix these problems, I might think of it as a solid addition to the Strider brand. For now it seems like a lazy port banking on the pre-existing hype to turn out a quick buck.","February 19, 2014","false","2.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/recommended/235210/","WskOsc","WskOsc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/","1276 products in account","At last a new Strider game!\n\nYou'd think that would be a good thing but currently the situation isn't so clear. On one hand we have a great looking game, with a classic sounding musical score that manages to build on the excitement without getting in the way but on the other hand we have shoddy gameplay and repetitive, grating sound effects.\n\nGraphics first; the game looks good, kind of a mix of smoothly shaded 3D and comic book  style colourings and clean lines. However the graphics are often a source of frustration as doorways are obscured and background objects look like foreground objects and you go plummeting to your death even early in the game. Additionally the camera appears quite zoomed in, providing a very narrow field of view during normal gameplay to presumably show off the lovely model of Strider himself and the fantastic animation attached to every one of his movements but it's also frustrating because the camera angle is constantly shifting in and out as you enter and leave combat or jump around, causing missed jumps, mid-air uncertainty and worst of all - attacks that come from off-screen and are unavoidable.\n\nThe audio is a similarly double-edged sword. While the music is perfectly complimentary to a Strider game and is comprised largely of easy to enjoy, exciting synthetic music that manages to stay in the background it's also party to the horrendously repetitive attack sounds and flat, unexciting gunfire sound that's spammed at you almost constantly by rooms of enemies (more on those later). Voice-overs are adequate if a bit cheesy, though the source material doesn't lend itself well to seriousness but the large neon orange box surrounding the portrait and subtitles of in-game announcements is an unforgivable screen-space hog especially when the camera is at its normal resting position where these subtitles can take up a full quarter of the screen and obscure what you're doing entirely - even worse is the fact that they happen in gameplay, hiding parts of breakable floor or vents and sometimes even enemies entering from the lower portion of the screen.\n\nThe enemies are your typical Strider fare, robot soldiers by the dozen with assorted drones, turrets and traps mixed in. While the design is uninspired and bland the enemies themselves prove a challenge but not one that feels fair nor enjoyable half the time. A prime example of this is the fact that you cannot duck under enemy bullets as crouching causes them to aim slightly lower and still hit you with the final portion of their burst (standard enemies fire about 5 rounds per attack) and jumping over the shots often results in you getting another enemy on screen and getting hit by them, or caught in a crossfire and losing half your health before you can do anything about them.\nDrones commit one of the action game genres cardinal sins of being able to charge their attacks as they're entering from the foreground or background, meaning that they can fire a volley of shots on you as soon as they enter the gameplay plane, making it impossible to take them down before they get a chance to attack you and often extremely difficult to not get hit while trying to evade them.\nTurrets too are often mixed in with the drones and enemies, often in completely unfair numbers considering the amount of hits it takes to bring them down. Often when turrets are present amongst other groups the patterns of fire are a complete unnavigable mess, making the best tactic in some of these situations to just say "screw it" and charge the enemies head on with no care for your own health.\nThen we have the snipers who use the tried and true method of announcing their appearance with a red line (laser sight) between you and them, with their aim pausing just before they fire to give you time to dodge the coming attack. Sadly these attacks often come while you're flying through the air and end up being undodgable by everyone but those with sub-10 millisecond reflexes.\nWhile on the topic of enemies and unavoidable damage it's worth pointing out that almost every single room, rooftop and monkey-bar like girder is lined with little floating health boxes with a smattering of larger health packs usually floating higher up where a couple of jumps are required to break them but they feel like a crutch to the gameplay, rather than making the enemies fair, predicable and counterable they've just plastered the map with hundreds of healthpacks so you can (even on hard difficulty) ignore getting shot most of the time.\nIt's also worth mentioning that, so far, I have found no way to counter or block enemy shots either.\nThen there's the heavy troopers, early in the game they come in two varieties, yellow and red. The red ones shoot napalm mortars while the yellow ones can launch their fists for a ranged attack. Both these mech-like enemies flash red and drop to a vulnerable state when heavily damaged but sometimes you can wail on them as much as you want (I actually took to using two fingers to tap the attack button as fast as possible during one of these encounters) and the enemy will just get back up, hitting you in the process. Reaction times are also an issue against these soldiers as they have one attack that's seemingly  telegraphed by only a couple of frames of animation before it triggers, giving you about a quarter-to-half a second to get out of the way which is almost impossible to dodge - at least it doesn't do much damage.\n\nAnother peeve of mine is that while Strider is fast, agile and very responsive to control inputs there are a few flaws in the controls that are, again, frustrating. A missed jump that sees you latch onto a wall right below an electrified portion will often see you electrecuted for no apparent reason, even if you press away from the electric trap and Strider does a little knee-slide move when you crouch after running but the distance you have to move to trigger this small (about 2-3 feet distance) slide is seemingly arbitrary as I couldn't always get it to work.\nAnother redundant control is the secondary attack (Y on the 360 pad) which sees Strider do a kind of feeble uppercut that's so delayed and lacking damage that it may as well just not be included as getting in close enough and pressing the button to use it will just prompt the standard soldiers to jab you with their bayonets every single time.\nThat said, the primary attack has a generous range and a charge-up ability that doubles the range and damage and can be fired in 8 different directions even when clinging to walls and ceilings. The charge attack's increased range also allows it to pass through thin floors and ceilings, allowing you to strike at some enemies from complete safety.\n\nStrider is undeniably a Strider game, despite the new "metroidvania" style but where the originals were supremely difficult but fair this one feels artificially difficult and needlessly frustrating from multiple angles at once. The developers haven't got a lot wrong but what they did get wrong is the parts that should be polished to perfection (barring the repetitive sound effects, that's a whole other fine-line that's often sheer chance of whether you land on the right side or not). These small flaws sadly don't make Strider a slightly cloudy gem but instead feel like the turds in an otherwise excellent punchbowl.\nFurther detracting from the appeal are throwbacks to the older games, such as scalable minarets and the Ouroboros boss at the end of the opening area which feel less like a fun homage and more like a tired rehash from developers too lazy, or cowardly to strike out on their own and design something new and awesome for the Strider-verse (is that even a thing?).\n\nSo can I recommend Strider? Absolutely not. The PS2 versions remain the definitive home Strider experience for both new and old fans. Go play any of the older ones on NES, Genesis, TurboGrafx CD, Playstation or Playstation 2.\n\nScore: 5/10 mistakes were made.","February 19, 2014","false","11.0"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","0"

Strider's controls are intuitive and fun to use as you rip your way through enemies as the unstoppable force you are.\n\nMy only complaint so far is that the characters do not move their mouths or have almost any sort of facial expression when they talk - unsure if this was done intentionally - however, it does dampen the experience slightly.\n\nNo matter, as the cut scenes are quick to pass and you're back into the action.\n\nI rate it 9/10. Should you buy at full price or wait for it to go on sale?

The combat is actually fun and really interactive. Unlike most metroidvania games I see, this games combat is actually on point and its not a chore to do. There is a problem, with how the game runs in general-graphics quality are okay and the anti-aliasing isn't that great, but the game will still tank some random frame drops down to even 10FPS. My computer is high end, I can run most games at highest quality graphics and still run at 60FPS. I can tell you that this game is actually on the easy side (strider facerolls everything) but try it on hard difficulty and it can be a lot of fun.\nOverall- If you like games like Castlevania symphony of the night (I didn't play much metroid so I can't refference it) and like flowing combat you will like this game, however even if you don't, I encourage you to give this game a try and see for yourself, there is actualy a dedicated minimap that indicates where you are supposed to go next-it's still up to you to find out how to get there though, so there is still a lot of exploration and finding upgrades.

I was hoping Double Helix wouldn't screw this game up and I wasn't disappointed at all. I loved Strider 2 on PS1 back in the day and this reboot does the series justice! It feels like a mix between Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Mega Man X but still has the feel of Strider. This game for being only $15 packs a whole lot of collectables and content which is a huge plus. It's fun, fast paced arcade style action at it's best and anyone who wants a game to kill a few hours, get this one, you won't regret it.\n\nFans of Strider will feel right at home, and even newcomers will have a great time playing through this game, you can beat this game in about 4 hours but with all the collectables you'll probably get at least 7, well worth it for a $15 dollar game! Honestly if you want this game, if the trailer looks good to you, if the things I'm saying in this review convinced you....BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the bosses are challenging but fun, and the soundtrack is great! :)\n\n-On a side note- There's a few glitches they need to iron out, for example; I fell through the floor and was able to traverse through part of the map on inside the walls and was able to skip a chunk of obstacles getting to my next destination but that's all trivial stuff that can be fixed, so I won't fault the developers for it.\n\nAll in all I thought the game was damn near perfect in every way, if you haven't already, buy this game especially if you played Strider before, this reboot does the series justice and I'm hoping there's more of this series to come in the future.

I got maybe 8 hours out of it playing on the normal difficulty and had a blast the whole time. For the most part, it does a great job of making you feel like a total badass ninja relentlessly slicing through foe after foe. The platforming is pretty easy as long as you're not going for a 100% completion; once you try to go for everything, you'll have to do some sections where you must freeze enemies in order to make stepping stones. Even then controlling HIryu is a breeze. The running and jumping make for some of the most entertaining movement controls I've seen since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and it smartly alternates between blistering action and platforming in gracious tandem.\n\nStrider Hiryu's latest game is a load of fun while being a great homage to the original.

The best way I can explain my experience is Shadow Complex meets Ninja Gaiden.  The controls are insanely tight.   The sword swings as fast as you can press the attack button.... no waiting on animations. The graphics are vibrant and clean, with lots of pretty flashes of colors that would make any toddler drool in amazement.   The game makes you genuinely feel like you are far more skilled than you really are, mostly because you can move through most of the game without stopping.  Strider is extremely overpowered, but never to the point of feeling invincible.\n\nI loved this game for the most part, though I have to admit that I was disappointed with the lack of weapon choice or any sort of rpg elements.  I understand that they weren't aiming for that, so I don't really hold it against it.   While it's not my favorite metroidvania, it definetly satiates my craving for a new SotN or Super Metroid.","July 19, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The backgrounds can become somewhat same-y. It's THAT place. You know, the grey, futuristic city-dystopia with vaguely (not so vague) eastern motifs, hosted by a crew of saturday morning cartoon badguys who are all pretty cool looking, from the colour-coded grunts to the hulking bi-ped tanks, and who all blow up real good.

The manic pace, rapid fire slashing and cartwheeling acrobatics are all intact from the arcade original.  References to that game abound, and I couldn't help but smile to see a nod to the strange NES  version many of us without access to a Genesis endured.  Boss fights are plentiful and well-designed, relying on classic pattern memorization skills to get through.\n\nThat being said, Strider has a few issues.  Instead of a linear action game, we're instead greeted by a lite Metroidvania affair.  This is fine, but unfortunately many of the "rooms" are massive and sparesely populated with enemies, making it extremely easy to blast through them with little effort from the player.  The music is also weirdly subdued and sounds as though composer Michael Mollo was trying to remix the original soundtrack in a similar way to Simon Viklund's work on Bionic Commando Rearmed.  What little I could hear of it under the chaos of battle failed to evoke a similar response; a real shame considering the original game's strange and bombastic score.\n\nA solid effort from Double Helix.

When the game finally was out, I had high expectations for the game, and boy it sure did deliver. The game is a more fluid version of strider 2, combat wise. You have lots of mid air controls and plenty of things to use as your disposal, such as your options, kunai, and multiple cypher plasmas. Combat is fast, and enemies get tougher as you go along, however I never had much issue slicing through countless cyborgs, however I never got bored once while doing so. It was just so fun slicing through each and every enemy, one after the next, as the music is pumping you up, everything is goes by so fast that its just a joy to play. The game itself follows a metroidvania map, with secret areas, hidden items, costumes, and even extra things, such as challenges, intel, and concept art. Each map is vast and has its own setting, along with it's own type of enemies. You will be backtracking for items, and for some main objectives, but strider moves so quick that it never felt like a chore. The puzzles are simple, and not really worth talking about, but that's fine, the game is more about its action then it's puzzles, you need to go into this game with the mindset of a old arcade style beatem' up, like the other strider games. The game is a little on the easy side, bosses should give you a run for your money, and can be taken out on your first try, if not on your second. As mentioned earlier the music pumps you up and gets you hyped, especially if you played any of the older strider games, with old songs being remixed to fit the cyber-distopia setting of the game. My major complant is that the game felt short, much like all the other strider games, however upon completion my final item completion was only 79%, meaning the game still had plenty of things for me to run around and collect before beating the game. With fast flowing action, a wonder soundtrack, and just playing as a badass cyber ninja, cutting anyone in his path, I would reccomend this to anyone who just wants to jump in and play a good action game. It's great to have Strider back, I just hope he does not vanish again.","March 16, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Genesis/arcade and NES games, while very different, were tons of fun and hold a special place in my memory.  This entry in the series however, is more of an attempt at remaking Super Metroid more than anything.  Not that that's a bad thing, since Super Metroid is arguably one of the greatest games ever made, but it doesn't quite cut it as far as that goes.  That notwithstanding, it's still one hell of a game that harkens back to the old days of side scrolling fun.  Nothing quite compares to running down corridors just cleaving through enemies.

Also, a short-ish manga series that got obscured by it's video game counterpart. Starring Strider Hiryu - one of the best-known Capcom characters despite having only 4 games of it's own in more than 25 years time. One of those was an unofficial sequel, and one is the one I'm reviewing here.\n\nThis is a story about cybernetically enhanced ninjas iniltrating a futuristic Kazhak Soviet Socialist Republic (apparently the end of the cold war and the fall of the USSR never happened in this setting) filled with bizarre opponents to beat.\nWhy did it manage to stick around for so long ?\nSimple: Because running, sliding and cartwheel jumping at breakneck speed, while chopping up enemies with a plasma blade it is as awesome as it's weird. (Unless you're playing the unofficial sequel, in which case it's fun but nothing that special)\n\nBut how does a quarter-munching arcade game translate to a console-oriented downloadable title ?\nPretty well actually, unless you're looking for something that throws a handful of linear levels with disconnected visuals at you.\n\nInstead, you get a Metroid style map, and you'll be travelling to and fro to complete your arsenal, opening up new paths based on that, and finally tracking down and beating the final boss. There's also exploration on the side to find powerups and bonus collectibles. (Collectibles also include levels for the challenge mode, but as far as I've kept track those are the ones that are placed in plain sight along the main route - you need to make an effort to miss those).\nIn keeping with it's arcade heritage, the focus is more on the platforming action than adventuring around though, and it more than delivers on that front.\n\nThe map is mostly well designed and the movement and fighting is all as fast and as furious as it ever was, including some subtle tricks to be had - certain enemies are much easier to defeat when you figure out which weapon to use against them.\nThrow in a good number of boss fights with a few nice twists, and overall you get a good action platformer.\nOh, and it looks and sounds appropriately cartoony.\n\nIt's not without it's flaws:\n- The plot is rather thin, and is barely enough to help build the sense of progression, let alone getting you really involved in the setting.\n- The cutscenes lose points thanks to people's faces not being animated. It stands out really bad, especially since the rest of the animation is well done and fluid.\n- Outside of the boss fights, the variety in enemy types is a bit low.\n- And the game is on the easy side if you know what you're doing.\n\nBut none of those are dealbreakers, and the end result is a game that's easy to recommend to fans of 2D action games.","October 29, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the game finally was out, I had high expectations for the game, and boy it sure did deliver. The game is a more fluid version of strider 2, combat wise. You have lots of mid air controls and plenty of things to use as your disposal, such as your options, kunai, and multiple cypher plasmas. Combat is fast, and enemies get tougher as you go along, however I never had much issue slicing through countless cyborgs, however I never got bored once while doing so. It was just so fun slicing through each and every enemy, one after the next, as the music is pumping you up, everything is goes by so fast that its just a joy to play. The game itself follows a metroidvania map, with secret areas, hidden items, costumes, and even extra things, such as challenges, intel, and concept art. Each map is vast and has its own setting, along with it's own type of enemies. You will be backtracking for items, and for some main objectives, but strider moves so quick that it never felt like a chore. The puzzles are simple, and not really worth talking about, but that's fine, the game is more about its action then it's puzzles, you need to go into this game with the mindset of a old arcade style beatem' up, like the other strider games. The game is a little on the easy side, bosses should give you a run for your money, and can be taken out on your first try, if not on your second. As mentioned earlier the music pumps you up and gets you hyped, especially if you played any of the older strider games, with old songs being remixed to fit the cyber-distopia setting of the game. My major complant is that the game felt short, much like all the other strider games, however upon completion my final item completion was only 79%, meaning the game still had plenty of things for me to run around and collect before beating the game. With fast flowing action, a wonder soundtrack, and just playing as a badass cyber ninja, cutting anyone in his path, I would reccomend this to anyone who just wants to jump in and play a good action game. It's great to have Strider back, I just hope he does not vanish again.","March 16, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Genesis/arcade and NES games, while very different, were tons of fun and hold a special place in my memory.  This entry in the series however, is more of an attempt at remaking Super Metroid more than anything.  Not that that's a bad thing, since Super Metroid is arguably one of the greatest games ever made, but it doesn't quite cut it as far as that goes.  That notwithstanding, it's still one hell of a game that harkens back to the old days of side scrolling fun.  Nothing quite compares to running down corridors just cleaving through enemies.

Strider plays like a smoother, quicker modern version of how Zero played in Mega Man X4 and X5. The best thing about this game is that very feel; your character can slash enemies 1:1 with how fast you can mash the attack button and it's very satisfying to plow through enemies at a full sprint.\n\nThe game is somewhat of a free form metroidvania, but only somewhat. Your objectives are given to you marked on a map and you only need to backtrack through one area in order to fight a particular boss. You can find secrets and upgrades by exploring more once you've powered up, but all of the crucial stuff you'll find just by letting the game hold your hand. The fact that the city is technically open to exploration is nice though, and it doesn't slow the pace of the game if you don't let it. Surely going back to grab stuff often serves as a nice break between difficult boss fights.\n\nSo the gameplay is really solid all around and that's what's important- however you may find that things are lacking in art direction and story. There are a handful of environments to traverse as the city is separated into districts, but each one is blander than the last. Visually, the game doesn't have much personality especially when you consider that the character's mouths don't move during voice acted cutscenes. I'm not a visual designer, but what I think what this game needed was a darker, more dystopian tone rather than the spitshined anime one we got.\n\nThe story can't be called a disaster because it isn't really there, but what is there feels dissapointing in light of the fact that they actually bothered to animate a few cutscenes and record dialogue. Especially after defeating the final boss, you might find that the complete lack of meaningful exposition or resolution brings down the experience.\n\nOverall, an 8/10 with one point deducted for the each of the two paragraphs above. The gamplay style is timeless and I disagree with the majority of people who found this game frustrating. At about 7 hours for my first normal playthrough, it may be most worth it to buy during a 50% sale but it is generally worth it anyway.

As someone who beat the genesis strider 1 and strider returns, NES Strider, Playstation Strider 2 (Japanese version), and who has been slaying people on MVC1, 2, and 3 ultimate, this is a wonderful game.  It's like the creators looked at the game Moon Diver which was supposed to be the successor to the Strider franchise, and learned from all the mistakes that were made in that title.  Even without ANY powerups, from the get go, Strider feels just as sleek and fine tuned in his handling and controls as he did on any of his previous incarnations including MVC.  Add in all the cool power ups, the button combinations that are needed to traverse levels, and the multitude of secrets waiting for the gamer with an eye for exploration, and you have a wonderful romp in a revamped Strider universe that  pays many nods to the previous games.\n\nThere are only a few things for which I fault this game.  Firstly, the music is awesome, especially the nod to the NES Egypt Rail Carrier track.  The track is slower and there are trains in the background capturing some of the feel of the original NES content. However, it drops the ball in that there is no level that takes place on a high speed train.  This was an effect that was supremely brought to life on the NES.  With the current technology, it would have been awesome to see how an idea such as this could have been illustrated and also the game mechanics that would have been involved.  Secondly, we are given different color palattes for Strider as mementos from fallen Striders.  This is a cop-out as it would have been much better to actually RESCUE said Striders and have them join Strider's team either as a type of limited subweapon or as an AI controlled ally or as a completely different character that can be swapped out at any save station.\nWith that said, if there were other playable characters, the idea of Co-op would easily be implementable.  And, considering that Co-op was already a part of Moon Diver, there is really no excuse for there to be a lack of couch Co-op for Strider.\n\nStill, that only amounts to a 0.5 point deduction on an awesome game.","April 7, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strider plays like a smoother, quicker modern version of how Zero played in Mega Man X4 and X5. The best thing about this game is that very feel; your character can slash enemies 1:1 with how fast you can mash the attack button and it's very satisfying to plow through enemies at a full sprint.\n\nThe game is somewhat of a free form metroidvania, but only somewhat. Your objectives are given to you marked on a map and you only need to backtrack through one area in order to fight a particular boss. You can find secrets and upgrades by exploring more once you've powered up, but all of the crucial stuff you'll find just by letting the game hold your hand. The fact that the city is technically open to exploration is nice though, and it doesn't slow the pace of the game if you don't let it. Surely going back to grab stuff often serves as a nice break between difficult boss fights.\n\nSo the gameplay is really solid all around and that's what's important- however you may find that things are lacking in art direction and story. There are a handful of environments to traverse as the city is separated into districts, but each one is blander than the last. Visually, the game doesn't have much personality especially when you consider that the character's mouths don't move during voice acted cutscenes. I'm not a visual designer, but what I think what this game needed was a darker, more dystopian tone rather than the spitshined anime one we got.\n\nThe story can't be called a disaster because it isn't really there, but what is there feels dissapointing in light of the fact that they actually bothered to animate a few cutscenes and record dialogue. Especially after defeating the final boss, you might find that the complete lack of meaningful exposition or resolution brings down the experience.\n\nOverall, an 8/10 with one point deducted for the each of the two paragraphs above. The gamplay style is timeless and I disagree with the majority of people who found this game frustrating. At about 7 hours for my first normal playthrough, it may be most worth it to buy during a 50% sale but it is generally worth it anyway. It's a fun time.","February 7, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nBut there are some details though that keep this game from being one of the best in the genre.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the map. It doesn't say to where a certain passage leads to. So you end up going in circles or being slingshot into another section by accident. Having to make your way back to where you were. You're left having to look up for a map online. Which kinda defeats the purpose of playing a Metroidvania game.\n\nThe voice acting is kinda bad. I sometimes prefer to play Japanese games with Japanese audio and I would've liked if this game had this option. But the acting is not bad enough to ruin the experience.\n\nThe enemies kinda get repetitive. Except for a few, you see the same generic enemy throughout the game. The only difference being what colour the enemy is and what colour his shield is…\n\nBut all this doesn't stop how fun it is to slice through all the enemies. The boss fights are pretty solid and the Metroidvania element is a welcomed addition to the series.\n\nThis game will be plenty of fun for anyone who grew up playing console games in the 90s.","June 27, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What's interesting is the fact that you need to adapt to different enemies on the fly, use dashing, kunais and your special ability to get rid of enemies or just do super cool stuff in general and most of that in one fight, kind of my style especially that you can attack as fast as you can push dat button (which can result, more often than not, in boss fights not even lasting 10 seconds)\n\nThat's pretty much everything i have to say here as it's a solid game and i liked it very much, definitely worth the bucks (of course it feels kinda short if you rush through in under 4 hours for the achievement but still) and i recommend it.","July 13, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A solid and attractive platformer built around a rather nonsensical plot, the game runs the player through a variety of environments as they slowly unlock new abilities for the main character, allowing them to access more and more of the world in a fairly linear fashion.\n\nThis game takes the design of Metroidvania games and does it much better. Backtracking? There isn’t much of it here; the game is designed to take the player on a linear route through the world, and while it feels nice and convoluted, the overall amount of backtracking is very minimal. This is an excellent piece of game design that many other Metroidvanias could learn from; the only real backtracking required is a few areas which have to be unlocked by later abilities.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable. The platforming feels good, you can climb along the walls and ceilings, there aren’t too many bottomless pits, the enemies are reasonably varied, there are tons and tons of bosses (about one every half hour or so), with new enemies introduced like clockwork in the meanwhile. The game is always kept feeling fresh, and at the end, you get to put all your skills to work taking down the big bad.\n\nThe game has decent voice acting, but the plot itself is pretty much nonsense; it isn’t really clear what is going on beyond “There is a bad guy who is in charge and you need to kill him.” Who sent Strider? Who are all these people? Why is the big bad doing what he is doing? Who knows? Who cares? It doesn’t matter!\n\nYour goal is to cut your way through his minions, and the game employs you admirably in this.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great game. The graphics ae solid, the game is the right length for what it is and doesn’t feel stretched at about 9 hours to 100% it, the protagonist has a reasonably diverse set of skills which can be employed in a few different ways to make your way through the levels and beat down the bad guys – if I had a complaint, it would be that the standard game difficulty might have been a touch on the easy side at times, but overall, it wasn’t really an issue. Checkpoints were pretty generous and never really felt like they set you back too far even if you did fail.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But I had fun playing it, and the game had excellent pacing which kept me interested and kept me wanting to play after I got rolling through to the very end, even though it gave me many, many possible break points to choose from.\n\nAll in all, this is a great reboot, and the game was really quite fun and was worth the 9 hours I invested. It isn’t something with a great story, but the core gameplay was pretty much exactly what I was hoping for from a game like this.\n","March 14","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to know much about this game, here are the points I have written in details, and I have avoided spoilers.:\n\n1/ Story: The game story is nice, albeit a little bit too simple, but sufficient enough.\n\n2/ Platforming: The puzzles, obstacles in the game are well-designed. You will need to acquire the skills in the game to get past a lot of obstacles. The Devs really have thoroughly put their thoughts and mind into designing these obstacles.\n\n3/ Exploration: As you play in a huge city, Strider is full of places to visit if you decide not to stick to the guide and instruction from the game. Try wandering around the city on your own, you will discover a huge lot of fun things to do.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that this is merely a little open-world type of game. There won't be side-quests. And sometimes if you happen to be in somewhere you haven't been before, or re-visited randomly, there may be boss battles, so prepare yourself well. But don't worry, the game won't put you into a random boss battle if it doesn't know you have the skills required to enter that battle.\n\nBut after you get some skills, you could go around and try visiting the old places to get more power-ups. If you are afraid that you might get lost, use the Maps.\n\n4/ Maps: However, sometimes, you will need to do some zoom-in and out for the Maps. I did had a problem with the Map when trying to switch from one area to another, since the Map of another area might disappear from the screen, and you could not see anything. In this case, I would recommend trying move the arrow keys around, try zoom-in and zoom-out, you will get over this problem easily.\n\n5/ Power-ups, upgrades: Strider offers a good variety of power-ups you will need to win the combat. From Ice, Flame, to Magnetic, Kunai, Option A-B-C (you will figure it out what they are) or skills such as Projectile Reflecting with your sword... and much more, it's definitely great to play such as a game with so many things you can use to deal with the enemies. These upgrades will also help you in exploring the city. And using them to get to strange places you have never been to before.\n\n6/ Combat + Boss: Definitely the best points to talk about. If there's anything I would recommend, it would be going for the Hard mode when you start playing the game.\n\nTrust me, it's gonna be one huge fun to do. That's what I did when I first played this game. Going for the Hard mode in Strider not only makes you realize how much important it is to explore the city to get more power-ups, costumes (did I mention there are 11 awesome costumes in this game?), concept art.. but also to make you prepare yourself harshly for go into the battle with the Bosses.\n\nFor 1 or 2 first bosses of the game, you will feel like the game is pretty harsh on your Health, since the Bosses at Hard mode are no joke, they mean serious business if you don't master your dodging and sword slicing skill well enough. But after getting your hands on some Energy and Health upgrades, you will realize the Boss battles are much gonna be easier. They will only have one or two fatal strikes at you. So try Hard mode, it's totally encouraging. Even the damage of normal minions, enemies are gonna be a lot strong, so try to get a lot of upgrades. By the time you reach the Final Boss, believe me, the Final Boss would not be hard to finish.\n\nAs for the Combat: I would state it in two words "Button Mashing". I can spoil you on this one, but it means, in the boss battle, if you want to win (Well, I'm still talking about Hard mode) without letting yourself getting killed fast by the Bosses' damage, you would do well to hit those guys as fast as you could. Since the number of consecutive hits on them do matters in this game, hit them fast will help you increase your own damage. Therefore, you will have pressed a button, like , 200-300 times after this game, and that's ok :D\n\n\nWell, that's about everything I can tell you. I totally would play this game all over again. Because Strider is a great game. And it's gonna be totally worthy of your own money.\n\nScore: 9.5/10. -0.5 because of the Maps >.>","January 23","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last time I had played "Strider" was on the Sega Genesis. It was good fun back then and I remember my times with the game fondly.  - This new Strider game absolutely nails it. It is exactly what I would have hope for from a modern remake of the game.\n\n- Graphics / artstyle absolutely beautiful in motion.

Nothing groundbreaking but completely in line with what you'd expect from Strider.\nOn top of that the devs have innovated just enough to make the game feel fresh.  Awesome, awesome game.

My only issue is with the play controls - I was expecting a loose control scheme, but was given a reactive-type instead.\n\nFor example:\nWhen Strider gets close to a wall in midair, he reacts by grabbing onto the wall with his ninja tools.\nWhen Strider attacks an enemy with a shield, the game reacts by slowing the game for effect while his weapon bounces off the shield and stuns him.\nWhen Strider is struck in midair with practially anything, he reacts by falling to the ground and won't react until you've tried to jump several times.\nWhen Strider stands on a gravity globe, the controls react depending on which side of the globe you're on and you have to change which direction to hold on the control stick in order to keep moving.  This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight in which not only are you jumping from gravity globe to gravity globe but you're dodging seemingly random attacks that all stun on impact whether you're airborne or not.\n\nThe game is great for what it is, but don't pick it up expecting a Metroidvania game - it's more a ninja-action game, which is really quite fitting the character and series.","November 26, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I agree it's drab but no because of art direction. Strider really needed better world building behind it to be masterpiece.\n\nCons\n-Weak story/world building\n\n\nStrider was great fun. The pace of the game makes you feel like an expert warrior. The action is just at the right speed where I have enough time to react while not being a cake walk either.  Another aspect I loved about Strider was the way skills progressed in the game. Each tool had its distinct strength and wasn't overshadowed by new additions to Strider's arsenal.\n\nThe enemy variety just was right in that non-boss combat did not feel monotonous meaning each enemy required its unique approach for the most part. The boss battles were really the highlight of this game for me. Some boss patterns were easy and others were hard but none of the fights felt gimmicky. I couldn't just stay in one spot and win the battle. Dodging and moving in to attack were the general patterns but each boss fight requires its own approach in executing those actions.\n\nThe only aspect that I felt Strider lacked was story. I never gained strong sense of connection with Strider. Nobody in the story cared for Strider leaving me with nothing to identify with. I felt like a random guy who did all these awesome things in a world where the Why was never explained. Maybe these feeling are a result of me having never played a Strider game before? I mean it's alright if you don't give the main character a lot of depth because it's a game but if you take that course your world needs to have the depth to support the story your trying to tell.\n\nThe story was decent though and game play was more than enough to make up for the story's failings. This game is really great and you shouldn't pass it up if you enjoy action games. At least for me, Strider sets the standard for the modern Metroidvania title.","May 25, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only issue is with the play controls - I was expecting a loose control scheme, but was given a reactive-type instead.\n\nFor example:\nWhen Strider gets close to a wall in midair, he reacts by grabbing onto the wall with his ninja tools.\nWhen Strider attacks an enemy with a shield, the game reacts by slowing the game for effect while his weapon bounces off the shield and stuns him.\nWhen Strider is struck in midair with practially anything, he reacts by falling to the ground and won't react until you've tried to jump several times.\nWhen Strider stands on a gravity globe, the controls react depending on which side of the globe you're on and you have to change which direction to hold on the control stick in order to keep moving.  This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight in which not only are you jumping from gravity globe to gravity globe but you're dodging seemingly random attacks that all stun on impact whether you're airborne or not.\n\nThe game is great for what it is, but don't pick it up expecting a Metroidvania game - it's more a ninja-action game, which is really quite fitting the character and series.","November 26, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has very satisfying feedback and feel when attacking and moving. Hiryu will attack as fast as you mash the button and mechanics like fast falling when pressing down in the air plus a brisk pace makes this feel great. The combat also feels solid with flashy and satisfying visual feedback when attacking enemies with sparks and bright colors flying everywhere.\n\n+ Fast progression\n~ You never feel like a segment is dragged out as you will constantly be unlocking power-ups. You also feel like a powered up badass if you decide to backtrack for collectibles with your upgrades in places you got your ♥♥♥ handed to before.\n\n+ Tons of bosses and unlockables\n~ If you like Metroidvania/Metroid-like games with a tons of bosses and unlockables, then this game will satisfy that desire. The actual upgrade collectibles are a small amount but you can unlock stuff like concept art, story info, and alternate skins/costumes.\n\n+ Heavily inspired by Super Metroid in game design and progression, while keeping the feeling of being a badass ninja\n\n+ Excellent mix of platforming and action\n~ If you like platforming segments ontop of your action, this game has it in spades. Thankfully they aren't too tedious or challenging minus maybe one or two segments.\n\n+ Old school game with shiny graphics\n\nCons:- Difficulty all over the place in boss battles\n~ I played on hard, and playing the game and getting around areas never felt too difficult minus a few areas. The boss battles aren't very difficult until the latter half of the game, where the order of their patterns gets faster, more intense, and randomized. However, they do the same attack patterns even if they are out of order, so that helps a lot I guess\n\n- Backtracking for upgrades and collectibles is time consuming due to lack of good overworld design/fast travel points\n~ it's not too bad as there are fast travel points but it could be way better in terms of placement and where they take you\n\n- Unbalanced sound design\nThe music isn't bad and actually fits the game pretty well, but it's nothing you'll be humming to any time soon. It is the lack of sound balance when fast traveling and attacking that puts this as a con. I put the volume up on my headphones because the base game was kind of quiet, but when you fast travel and attack it's like you're getting stabbed in your eardrums with sudden intense loud sound.\n\nTL;DRThis game is an old school action/platformer made in the vein of Super Metroid/Metroidvanias. You feel like a badass ninja with tight mechanics and feedback. If you're one of those "muh story and presentation" people when it comes to games, look elsewhere. If you want a good action sidescroller Metroid like game, play this right now; it's definitely one of the better options available.","December 9, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It follows the formula pretty straight: platforming, distinct zones, collectables, and mobility and weapon upgrades that unlock new areas.\n\nStrider's main strength is the feeling of speed and power that was clearly a core design consideration. This is a game about movement, first and foremost, much like the original Capcom arcade title. There's no XP or leveling system, making much of the combat completely optional if you'd rather just blow right past everything instead. But the fact that you can blow through enemies instead is part of the appeal, part of the sense of power that the player experiences.\n\nThis would be irrelevant if the controls weren't good; luckily, Strider controls beautifully. Environments are easy to understand, boss fights are (mostly) about player performance and not trying to figure out what to do, and everything just feels very tuned and well-tested.\n\nThere’s no story to speak of. There’s a collection of enemies who are clearly made in the 90’s arcade game mold -- they exist to taunt the player, attack, and eventually explode.The voice acting is largely awful but one gets the idea that this was deliberate.\n\nThe problem, really, is that Strider 2014 is short and shallow. It’s the sort of title that was designed for a $10 - $20 price point, to be downloaded over online services. Once you’ve found all the collectables and upgrades, there is nothing else to do in the world except go fight the final boss. There are challenge levels but they feel tacked-on and don't have any rewards for completion. It’s not like some Metroidvania titles where there’s radically different sorts of play styles depending on enemy drops and equipment choices, where each trip through the game can be very different. The replay value of Strider is in higher difficulty levels and speedrunning, and if you’re not interested in those, you’ll be done with the game in one relatively short playthrough.\n\nIt’s a short ride, but it’s a fun one.","December 12, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The manic pace, rapid fire slashing and cartwheeling acrobatics are all intact from the arcade original.  References to that game abound, and I couldn't help but smile to see a nod to the strange NES  version many of us without access to a Genesis endured.  Boss fights are plentiful and well-designed, relying on classic pattern memorization skills to get through.\n\nThat being said, Strider has a few issues.  Instead of a linear action game, we're instead greeted by a lite Metroidvania affair.  This is fine, but unfortunately many of the "rooms" are massive and sparesely populated with enemies, making it extremely easy to blast through them with little effort from the player.  The music is also weirdly subdued and sounds as though composer Michael Mollo was trying to remix the original soundtrack in a similar way to Simon Viklund's work on Bionic Commando Rearmed.  What little I could hear of it under the chaos of battle failed to evoke a similar response; a real shame considering the original game's strange and bombastic score.\n\nA solid effort from Double Helix.

Not that that's a bad thing, since Super Metroid is arguably one of the greatest games ever made, but it doesn't quite cut it as far as that goes.  That notwithstanding, it's still one hell of a game that harkens back to the old days of side scrolling fun.  Nothing quite compares to running down corridors just cleaving through enemies.

The sounds!! The bosses!!!) It was like a magnet for my Alladdin's Castle Tokens...Fast forward to the announcement of an NES version of the game...I was super psyched (hmm...these screenshots aren't quite what I'm expecting...). Now fast forward again to the release of the NES game (What is this...it's nothing like the Arcade?!), then suddenly (Wait a minute, this is pretty cool...), and finally (This is one of the greatest NES games ever!!!)\n\nSeveral years later I became the unfortunate owner of the Turd known as "Strider 2" by US GOLD for the Amiga. I couldn't resist when I saw the box at the store (Strider 2, are you kidding me!). The excitement only lasted a few short seconds...(Looks kind of like Strider, Sounds kind of like Strider...wait...did I just morph into a robot with tank treads for feet?!?! What the hell is this garbage!). It was so bad I had repressed the memory, only to have it crawl from the stinky depths while writing this review. US GOLD were The Masters of Dissapointment...Sh@tting all over some of my favorite franchises.\n\nStrider 2 on PS1 (alright, now we're back in business!) was pretty solid, and although didn't quite have that magic that I had found in the original Arcade or NES game, it was another good Strider game (nothing wrong with that!).\n\nOver the last 14 years, Hiryu would occasionally appear in Capcom games as an extra or playable charachter and this gave me some hope that they hadn't forgotten about one of my favorites.There was also Moon Diver on XBLA that was very "Stider-esque" and I believe was made by some former capcom employees, and that was decent...\n\nThen came the announcement of this game...Initially I was excited, but apprehensive (what if it's not good...) so for some reason I held off. After hearing a friend mention how much he liked the new game, I decided it was time to give it a shot.\n\nIn short, I love this game! It's like a delicious combo platter of the Original 2 (arcade & NES) Strider games, with chunky bits of strider 2 mixed in, all served up on a tasty Metroidvania platter. The graphics are great, the Sound is great, the controls are great (xb360 controller), there's lots to see and do, plenty of abilities and secrets to find, and there are some epic boss battles.  What more could I ask for? Not much...\n\nIf you like a good MetroidVania game, you'll like this. If you like a good Metroidvania game, and you like Strider, chances are you'll love this as much as I do.","November 22, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/235210/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","As far as metroidvanias go, this really barely is one. The game will always let you know exactly where to go, and while you do revisit "areas", you tend to only ever go to new parts of the same areas. The map's not too massive but it's big enough, the areas are diverse enough too.\n\nThe controls are really pretty good, attacking and movement are both lightning-fast, and most of the powerups make Strider more fun to control. The dash is great, the double jump is fine enough, and chaining the two can lead to some fun platforming usage, though rarely is this required. The kunai and its powerups are also a fun projectile weapon and rather powerful to boot. The four different plasma types are mostly positive; the reflect plasma makes for some interesting puzzles, the exploding plasma has the highest attack and the exploding kunai are great, the ice plasma is actually a bit annoying but is used fairly interestingly in a few puzzles, and the fourth one is just completely useless and, worst of all, slow. There's also two summons; the bird is fairly useful and strong but the panther is just... bleh. Also a shield thing I never used.\n\nStory-wise... I didn't understand the story at all until like 60% of the way through, and it's mostly inconsequential. Music's decent, not very memorable. Graphically it looks pretty good for a 2.5D game, lots of lush backgrounds and the visuals rarely get confusing.\n\nAs far as exploration, there's a little bit, but most of the puzzles are simple and very few of the secrets and collectibles are too hidden at all. A lot of them require backtracking, too, a door you can't open or a puzzle you need the dash to solve or whatever not, but there's not really much mandatory backtracking or aimless wandering involved.\n\nBoss fights range from "that happened" to "one really annoying attack but otherwise simple"; mostly, not really providing any sense of challenge. Honestly the only challenges this game presented were instances with a lot of stunlocking, which is... not a good thing, at all. I'm replaying on hard and while enemies seem to do a little more damage, the amount of health upgrades you can eventually get effectively nulls this effect.\n\nBut it's a fun enough game to play. I'm not sure I'd recommend it for $15, it's not too big and not too long, nor does it have high replay value, but on sale, sure, check it out if you want something pretty fun for that metroidvania fix.","November 14, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this isn't the biggest oversight in the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy, I don't know what is. In a game that is built around speed and getting from one place to another quickly, getting hit by bullets you can't even ♥♥♥♥ing dodge and getting stunned for what seems like years is SO FRUSTRATING. This game is so fast paced, which is really good, but when you are losing your momentum every two seconds, you don't even want to play anymore. The first half of the game is good, but when freezing and plasma gets introduced, it's all ♥♥♥♥ing down hill. Also the music isn't good, and the story is 100% non-existent.\n\nTHE GOOD: On the other hand, the game feel is some of the best I've ever seen. Strider actually feels like a ninja, the way smoke comes off the ground when he jumps or runs, the way it actually feels how you're ripping through enemies with your swords, the teleportation thing is great and is so much fun to use with the double jump, etc. The graphics are very unique and sexy as ♥♥♥♥. The pacing in the game is really good and Strider gets new abilities every fifteen minutes of play which is enough time to master the last ability and use it in tandem with the new ability. Lastly, it's a quick play, but lots of things for completionists.\n\nTLDR: Getting stunned literally ruins the game, but if you want a fast-paced game and want to feel like a ninja, Strider will do the job easily.\n\n4/5\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 17, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played the original NES Strider and the Genesis Strider, I have to say this game is an absolutely fantastic reboot. It has the open-world feel of the original NES classic but with much better level (and graphic) design, and has the quality of color and atmospheric charm of the Genesis version but with far better view instead of the absurdly close-up shots of Strider Hiryu at the benefit of graphical fidelity. Besides that the game is clean and crisp. It's a joy to play and although at first it may seem too easy (there are difficulty options), that's just a nice way to lull you into the fact that this game requires a lot of strategy. While you start with these clunky combos and button-mashing slaying of any of the Kazakh guards you see, their tactics and yours have to evolve to suit the multi-levelled terrain, the new equipment and abilities both you and the enemies get, and your general skill. The better you get, the more the game begins to feel like a brutal ballet where Strider vaults over enemies and cuts everything in his path with effortless grace. The story is far better than that of its originals since now there's not only voice acting but it's actually got a cohesive and tangible plot this time that isn't arbitrarily sending you across the world in a weirdly specific set of locations with little backstory.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game. I really recommend it.","October 15, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's even worse around gravity globes you can run on, which are their own irritating issue that just becomes more annoying.\n\nNo invincibility frames - A few normal enemies and a few boss attacks have their entire gimmick around this and squeezing as much damage as possible in one volley or chain stuns.  Easily a quarter or more of a fully upgraded health from one of those, or just getting pinballed between 2-4 enemies for a few seconds while you wait for the chance to have control again.\n\nOther smaller issues involve the final tower level being a boring difficulty spike and that wall climbing has you suddenly mantle up and over from a bit too generous of a distance.  Also there's an entire level where you run against the wind meaning you walk slow and jump short distances; meh.\n\n\nThe Good:\nMovement is amazing.  Running, dashing, jumping, and sliding around while slashing everything in sight is solid and the best part of the game.  Worth a playthrough alone just to hop around and hit stuff really.\n\n\nThe Metroidvaia aspect feels tacked on with four flavors (ice, fire, reflect, magnetic/ranged) to the dash, slash, and kunais, but overall is fun while you do a little backtracking here and there and have a dramatic pose animation that plays each time you pick up an upgrade.  Also ignore the story.  Not because the story is really bad, but because it's just in the way of the fun and makes deaths to bosses involve watching another boring taunt speech.\n\nFor all of the negatives, I do still recommend this game oddly.  It's that much fun to play when the quirks aren't getting in your face.","August 11, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Remember the Striders running, jumping, doing the usual platformer mischief?  You're in luck!  From arcade to consoles, it's been a fun ride for Strider, and in Strider HD/Strider 2014, you get a quite-faithful modernization of the classic.  Upgrades and backtracking a bit for other unlockables, aren't too out of the way, but some require navigating with precise timing against hazards.  Others need prerequisite skills to reach.  Hey, like bosses that present at least a bit of challenge?  The boss fights aren't boring, and run from signle foes, multiple bosses at once, giant whirring mechanations, dazzling explosions, lasers, and mysticism which isn't terribly predictable, and will give you a feeling of accomplishment, in their death throes.  You'll be looking at your map to track down some unlockables, but despite the game having clearly defined locations to reach, you'll find yourself diverting to a far corner, to see if there's a bit of exploring to be had.  Controls at later levels, with skill unlocks, becomes very wide-open, and you'll be slashing through rows of baddies!\nNow, regarding the bad.  This game is known to be unstable on integrated/discrete video chips, but seems quite reliable with dedicated video cards.  Then, there's input; you may need a DirectX-XInput wrapper, like x360ce or others, so the game can "see" your gamepad.  After this quick bit is tended to, you'll be enjoying the variety of enemies and tactics!

My only issue is with the play controls - I was expecting a loose control scheme, but was given a reactive-type instead.\n\nFor example:\nWhen Strider gets close to a wall in midair, he reacts by grabbing onto the wall with his ninja tools.\nWhen Strider attacks an enemy with a shield, the game reacts by slowing the game for effect while his weapon bounces off the shield and stuns him.\nWhen Strider is struck in midair with practially anything, he reacts by falling to the ground and won't react until you've tried to jump several times.\nWhen Strider stands on a gravity globe, the controls react depending on which side of the globe you're on and you have to change which direction to hold on the control stick in order to keep moving.  This is especially frustrating during the final boss fight in which not only are you jumping from gravity globe to gravity globe but you're dodging seemingly random attacks that all stun on impact whether you're airborne or not.\n\nThe game is great for what it is, but don't pick it up expecting a Metroidvania game - it's more a ninja-action game, which is really quite fitting the character and series.","November 26, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has very satisfying feedback and feel when attacking and moving. Hiryu will attack as fast as you mash the button and mechanics like fast falling when pressing down in the air plus a brisk pace makes this feel great. The combat also feels solid with flashy and satisfying visual feedback when attacking enemies with sparks and bright colors flying everywhere.\n\n+ Fast progression\n~ You never feel like a segment is dragged out as you will constantly be unlocking power-ups. You also feel like a powered up badass if you decide to backtrack for collectibles with your upgrades in places you got your ♥♥♥ handed to before.\n\n+ Tons of bosses and unlockables\n~ If you like Metroidvania/Metroid-like games with a tons of bosses and unlockables, then this game will satisfy that desire. The actual upgrade collectibles are a small amount but you can unlock stuff like concept art, story info, and alternate skins/costumes.\n\n+ Heavily inspired by Super Metroid in game design and progression, while keeping the feeling of being a badass ninja\n\n+ Excellent mix of platforming and action\n~ If you like platforming segments ontop of your action, this game has it in spades. Thankfully they aren't too tedious or challenging minus maybe one or two segments.\n\n+ Old school game with shiny graphics\n\nCons:- Difficulty all over the place in boss battles\n~ I played on hard, and playing the game and getting around areas never felt too difficult minus a few areas. The boss battles aren't very difficult until the latter half of the game, where the order of their patterns gets faster, more intense, and randomized. However, they do the same attack patterns even if they are out of order, so that helps a lot I guess\n\n- Backtracking for upgrades and collectibles is time consuming due to lack of good overworld design/fast travel points\n~ it's not too bad as there are fast travel points but it could be way better in terms of placement and where they take you\n\n- Unbalanced sound design\nThe music isn't bad and actually fits the game pretty well, but it's nothing you'll be humming to any time soon. It is the lack of sound balance when fast traveling and attacking that puts this as a con. I put the volume up on my headphones because the base game was kind of quiet, but when you fast travel and attack it's like you're getting stabbed in your eardrums with sudden intense loud sound.\n\nTL;DRThis game is an old school action/platformer made in the vein of Super Metroid/Metroidvanias. You feel like a badass ninja with tight mechanics and feedback. If you're one of those "muh story and presentation" people when it comes to games, look elsewhere. If you want a good action sidescroller Metroid like game, play this right now; it's definitely one of the better options available.","December 9, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a neat marriage of the fast-paced slashy gameplay of the original and a Metroid-esque structure. Really good game with great, fluid and fun controls. The only real complaint I have is that the bosses kind of suck. If you try to learn their patterns they'll often blow you away with powerful attacks, but if you just go right up to them and mash buttons you'll almost always win. It's also sort of easy but not insultingly so. Those points aside it's highly recommended, it's a quick, frenetic and thoughtful platformer that doesn't wear out its welcome.","November 1, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Capcom is. A pretty decent Metroidvania. Smooth graphics. Awesome upgrades. NIce aesthetic. The story is so awful I wonder if it was intentional. The problems I have with the game stem mostly from the progression (it felt somewhat open worldly, but it couldn't quite commit) and there are times where I feel like some bosses, stages, enemies, and parts were put in the game purely for padding to make it longer. That said, I quite enjoyed my experience and if anything, the combat in this game is really.♥♥♥♥ing.awesome!","October 25, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great boss fights and progression system. Could not put it down for 5h40 minutes until I finished it on Normal. Tomorrow I start new on Hard mode.\nYou play as a ninja and start with a basic attack then you can acquire more moves by finding collectibles and defeating bosses. There is a sort of "elemental" mechanic to the weapon where you can channel a different form of energy through the sword or kunais (throwing weapon) and that changes their attack and each enemy is vunelrable to either a special move or a certain element or a combination of the two. The game also plays around with gravity making for very nice platforming unlike anything else.\nThe maps are huge and you can get almost anywhere on the map. I really mean everywhere, you can walk on walls, on the ceilings, you can go through floors or through the ceilings. You get a double jump and an additional boost attack getting in the end a sort of triple jump. The boost can also be used through a sort of gates transforming it superjumps that can be chained through multiple gates. Very fun.\nThe graphics are nice and animations look great.\nThe movement is fluid and so is the combat... with the exceptions of some moments in the end levels where enemies can chain freeze you and kill you without recourse (even on normal).\nAll in all a great game worth the price... I bought it for 1 dollar in a Humble Bundle :) but it certainly is worth far more.","October 25, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
