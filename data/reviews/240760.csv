Right from the start you have to create 4 characters and strike a difficult balance between 8 attributes which all are decisive factors in combat (though some arguably less so than others). Add to that 30 different skills and very few points to allocate. There is no obvious build for you characters, and you will likely question the validity of your choices for most of the early part of the game. If you expect to be able to uncover every nook and cranny in one playthrough you will be bitterly disappointed. You probably won't be able to open more than half the containers that are scattered through the early to mid part of the game, or to solve quests in a satisfactory manner, so if you can't handle that kind of frustration this game isn't for you.\n\nAt its core the game is about choices and consequences, but like in real life, the nature of the choices aren't always clearly defined, nor do these choices wait for you to be made. At various points in the game you will be confronted to situations with timers, if you don't act decisively and fast enough you will have to face terrible and unfair consequences. Don't except a smooth ride from zero to hero, in Wasteland 2 nobody is going to pat you on the back.  You will be treated harshly by the NPCs, who are both unreliable and often ungrateful. Everybody is just as victim to their circumstances as you are as a player, the game doesn't treat you like a child.\n\nWhich is where the game shines most. While the main intrigue is rather dim and hardly original, the factions and situations (both entertaining and thought provoking) you will encounter along the way all build around that core of finding purpose to your actions, to your survival in a bleak and brutish world. As Desert Rangers you will roam the wastes, explore areas as they pop on your map, and deliver justice one bullet at a time, as this game's central feature is combat. While not particularly deep, it is tactical enough to be entertaining without requiring you to ponder forever before passing your turn.\n\nLast but not least, for those with limited time and attention, you want to take into account the considerable length of the game (~70h) and its slow pace. While there is quite a lot of content in the game it takes a lot of time to unfold. You might take hours to uncover areas, scavenge and solve quests, areas that you could cross in less than 30s if you went straight forward. It's not an adrenaline packed experience, full to the brim with action and excitements. A lot of efforts are asked from the player, and the rewards might not always be what you expect these days when it comes to gaming. Because sometimes the challenge is the reward.","August 29, 2015","true","96.5"," 363 of 381 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","363","381","6","12"

The game starts you in the desert wastes of Arizona as you attend the funeral of Ace, a desert ranger who was recently killed. As the funeral ends the desert rangers leader General Vargas throws you into the deep end and sends you off to track down Ace's killer.\n\nLet's start with character creation, in the game you start with four characters. You have the option of either creating your own characters or choose from pre existing builds, you can even have a combination of both. In terms of aesthetics the character models are not pleasant to look like and there isn't a large variety of faces to choose from. That being said the statistical side makes the appearance’s short comings up in spades. Your characters have both attributes which are things like strength and skills. There is a large range of skills available including things like lockpicking, safecracking and more. It's often best to create a diverse group after all the more skills your party has collectively, the more options you'll have throughout the game. I myself opted first for a assault rife bearing squad leader, a sniper with lockpicking and computer skills, a melee focused demolitions expert and a shotgun wielding medic, aptly named Doc.\n\nWhen your not actually in a location, you'll be traversing the wastes on the world map. There are lots of locations to discover in the world and you can find hidden cache's of loot so its worth spending time to explore. On the world map you have to take several factors in to account when travelling. First is your water supply, your group has water canteens, each mile you travel will use up water and if you run out your party will take damage from dehydration. You can however stop of at any oasis you find in your travels to fill your canteens. Another factor is radiation, after all nukes do tend to leave some nasty after effects in the environment. Safe travel through irratiated zones can only be done by having the appropriate radiation suits, if you don't your party will die of radiation sickness very quickly. The world map also has random encounters not all of which are combat focused. Many will be raiders or animals that you must combat or run away from. Some will be travelling merchants or on the occasion something much more interesting.\n\nGraphically Wasteland 2 isn't the prettiest of spectacles, However its art direction does bring a certain harsh, grittiness to the affair which is very appropriate for the post apocalyptic setting. I think the character models could have been done better as some of the models and animations have a blocky look to them which looks out of place. While it is not the prettiest of games, the effect animations such as explosions look well done. On top of that the things like NPC character art is fantastically done. On thing that does shine in the game is sound which is no surprise when\nMark Morgan who was responsible for the soundtracks to fallout and fallout 2 is your composer. Everything from music, sound effects and surprisingly voice acting is done superbly and brings a real atmosphere to the whole affair.\n\n\n\nLet's move on to one of, if not the main part of the game, combat, after all theres plenty of dangers lurking in the wasteland and you can't avoid all of them. Those familiar with the recent X-com or the even more recent Divinity Original Sin will be right at home with Wasteland 2's tactical turn based system. Combat is straight forward and works from an action point system. Your characters attributes determines the amount of AP you have at the start of each turn as well as the order of which characters take their turns in. The combat is fairly fast paced similar to X-com enemy unknown, there is both cover and crouch mechanics too. The cover system is simplistic and being in cover gives you defensive bonuses. Crouching on the other hand improves your chance to hit as well as raising your chance to evade attacks.\n\nDepending on the difficulty combat can become fairly challenging. Particularly later in the game when you meet tougher enemies and enemies with both unique mechanics and better weaponry. As you go through the game you can gain followers to your squad, these followers if you don't have the leadership skill can have a chance to lose control and they will do as they please in combat. Your weapons can also jam, usually at most inconvenient times, plus you will have to regularly reload your mags and watch your available ammo.\n\nOverall the combat is solid, challenging and fun. It can throw you a few curve balls along the way too which is always good for keeping you on your toes. It's something that InXile had to get right and thankfully in my opinion they have executed it very well.\n\nWasteland 2 boasts a large number of quests to embark on. The great thing about the game is that you often have the freedom of choice in how to deal with the situations you encounter. Depending on who you have in your party and your skills, there are often multiple outcomes to any given scenario. An example of this is when I went to a graveyard and dug some graves, all was fine with me looting form the dead however upon reloading an earlier save I gained a different follower on the path and when I went to dig the graves my ally took offence to disturbing the dead and turn on my group. Things like this can happen all the time in the game and its great to see all the different possibilities there are. Not only does it ensure a good amount of re-playability but it also ensures that while two people can play the same game, different things will happen to each.\n\nIn conclusion wasteland 2 lives up to its namesake and not only provides a great post apocalyptic rpg experience but it provides a memorable one too. You will spend hours laughing at the video game culture references throughout the game as well as enjoying the well written characters. One thing I love is that the game doesn't hold your hand and lets you solve problems as you see fit, if there’s a wall in your way you could use the brute force skill or just throw a grenade, the choice is yours but the game won't tell you to do either, its up to you to come up with a solution if at all. The games story is strong and with its multiple choice system, there’s plenty to see and do. It's a solid title from InXile and something that you certainly felt after having such a successful crowd funding campaign, one that had to get right. While its release date has been pushed back several times, in all it seems it was worth it and Brain Fargo and the team have created a fitting sequel. While it does have its occasional issues and minor bugs, its a game that I would highly recommend adding to your collection. Whether your an avid RPG player or not, the majority of gamers will find hours worth of enjoyment in Wasteland 2.","September 19, 2014","true","27.9"," 901 of 1,075 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","901","1","3","13"

LOOK AT IT!  And tremble before the fearful countenance that is my Desert Dweller portrait!\n\nYes...I'm an old Wasteland 1 fan.  Loved it then back on the old C=64.  Loved Fallout 1, 2, Tactics and Fallout 3, all of which were inspired and modeled after Wasteland.  So I am admittedly a little biassed in this brief review.\n\n\nSome things I like about it so far:\n\n- Depth of choice\n- Consequences and world alteration based on those choices\n- Deep character customization\n- The atmosphere created by the visuals and audio\n- There is 'enough' eye candy and ear candy without going overboard\n- Multiple approaches/solutions to many problems\n- Challenge and reward levels feel apropriate\n- There is 'enough' realism to add in planning and tactics that help immersion without being burdensome\n- Lots of nods and references to the original that actually fit into the story and make sense\n- There is 'enough' voice acting with apropriate emotion that isn't too cold/dry or too flowery/dramatic\n- The written story is deep, interesting, concise and easy to follow so you can move on quickly\n\n\nSome things I would like to see improved:\n\n- Character creation needs more detailed notes for newcomers.\n- It is not clear HOW or even IF most of the C.L.A.S.S.I.C. attributes alter your skills.  Derived stats, yes.  Skills, I can only see one stat that will impact some of them.\n- Screen edge scrolling/panning of the area map is a little slow.\n- Would like a little more freeness in the camera controls.  Rotation, zoom and angle.  I don't care if I see map edge.\n- Sometimes hard to tell what is and is not cover in combat.\n\n\nOverall though, it is great fun and stays very true to the original.  Even with the few lumps it has, it is very polished, rock solid stable, and seems optimized well for multicore CPUs and multi-GPU setups.  Characters and quests make sense and are well scripted and laid out to be intuitive and challenging.  There is some fun exploring little nooks in the areas to find hidden loot and bonuses.  And while it is fairly linear, the branches you can take are divrese and plentiful.  I see a lot of replay value just from the choices you can make.  And your choices will have impact, sometimes in unexpected and even unplesant ways.\n\nSo, grab your Proton Axe and Meson cannon...and don your best suit of Pseudo-Chitin armor.  It's time to go out adventuring among the muties.  Just be careful, so you can come back to camp and share your stories around the fire over a bottle of Snake Squeezins.  Radioactive glow and 3rd arm optional, of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Disclaimer - read before you comment ***\n\nThis review is my personal opinion.\nI'm not interested in debate or discussion.\nArgumentative, hijacking and/or trolling comments will simply be deleted.\n\nTo me, hijacking my positive review to push your negative review is the epitome of laziness.  If you want to be heard, put the effort into writing your own review. You can discuss it there.\n\nAnd even if I was interested in discussion...which I am not...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlStolls/recommended/240760/","KarlStolls","KarlStolls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlStolls/","409 products in account","Did they pull it off?\n\nI don't quite know what I was expecting when I first backed the Kickstarter. Wasteland was a beloved classic, my first proper PC game, and it showed me just what games were really capable of. Problems with more than one solution, missions that could be failed without forcing a game over, the player's responsibility to build a balanced team, the combination of descriptive paragraphs with the limited graphics to paint a more vivid picture; the experience blew my fragile little mind at the time. A contemporary title can do many or even all of those things, but whether they can match that feeling - the impression that I'm playing something truly groundbreaking - is a much more loaded question.\n\nMany positive reviews of Wasteland 2 frontload the criticism, ending with some variant of "but I liked the game anyway because etc." It's easy to see why: bugs still being ironed out, a rather clunky interface, widespread locks and traps with long skill use animations, overuse of a limited pool of music, some weak story elements, large chunks of wasted space... you don't have to look too hard to see some serious flaws. The enjoyable aspects are likely to be subjective: how well the combat clicks for the player, whether they like the setting and overall fiction, the extent to which building a proper team is enjoyable, and so on. Indeed, in their bid to create a classic-sized PC RPG, it seems inXile could have made the game play better without sacrificing its hardcore appeal.\n\nFor instance, the locks and traps thing: consider the Baldur's Gate games, which also made use of frequent locks and traps on obstacles. Where BG has the advantage is that skill usage is practically instantaneous; the character moves to the trapped item and, if successful, the trap field simply disappears. WL2 added some needless visual flair to the process - your ranger rubbing their hands before working on the object, or kicking it repeatedly as a meter fills, or whatever - which adds a few seconds to each skillcheck. In a game with hundreds of them, those seconds start to add up. Little changes to things like that could have smoothed out a lot of reviewer complaints, with few if any adjustments to the core mechanics.  No doubt patches will address this and other issues over time, but the impression has set in nonetheless.\n\nI'll be blunt: I put a fair chunk of change into the Kickstarter, and I can feel the little nagging doubts in the back of my head. Would I be fair if I saw something that bugged me, or read criticism? Would I go easy on the game, knowing that some of my own money was somewhere inside? Would my opinion be more biased than others? It's a reasonable question, and I never did come up with a good answer. Even putting that aside, I'm not gonna deny I was a little nervous when this came out. It's been a long time since the Infinity engine was king of the hill. Did I still have the stomach for a big PC game? What if my appetites had simply moved on? Doubts upon doubts upon doubts.\n\nDid they pull it off?\n\nLike putting up with the wizard fight at the Friendly Arm Inn while you're still level 1, the appeal persists: a game that won't pull its punches, that will try its best to bring me down. WL2 definitely has the spark of those classic RPGs, that hard-to-define something that makes them hard to put down once I start. Fights were tactical, kinetic affairs: cover got destroyed, enemies repositioned, backup weapons were handy, well-timed explosives turned the tide, and even a difficult encounter could be mitigated with the right preparation. Environments presented their own challenges, and with several ways through a given obstacle I was more often than not encouraged to work around a failed skillcheck rather than savescum. Uncooperative plot elements or even bugged out triggers could be answered by force-firing, and there was no problem that the right size bomb could not solve.\n\nArizona did drag and suffer from design problems - the Prison being chief among them - but it held its own curious charms, and it presents a neat contrast with California. At the start, you control a bunch of customizable scrubs whose mission rapidly spirals out of control. Echo Team starts in known territory and gradually pushes the boundaries, earning their stripes in the process. Water is precious, communities are scarce, and civilization is on the knife's edge atop a pile of late 80s-early 90s rubble. By the time I did get to California, Echo felt every bit the veteran ranger squad, doing what rangers do best: venture into wild territory and bring order to chaos. There, the script is flipped: water is everywhere, settlements are common, and it's on us to put our best foot forward. Every arrival the base, every interaction with the public, every time we stepped in to right some wrong felt like it mattered somehow, like it could have gone differently - and like everything we'd done before had shaped us for that encounter.\n\nThat's a key spice to those old titles: variety. What happens if I do this instead of that? What does this guy say or do if I mention this? What if I didn't have that skill, item, or party member? What are the consequences if we just kill everyone? Is there a way to get what I want peacefully, and if so how bad do I want it? I was constantly asking myself those questions during Wasteland 2, and it's for those reasons that I know I'll be back. There's more to see, even if I think I've seen it all; there's more to try, even if I've already sunk some 80 hours into the campaign. Old PC RPGs sometimes get a shot of life from modding communities, but even before I had heard thing one about mods, there were some games where I knew - just knew - that I'd be back, just to see what happened this time.\n\nAnd god help me if I didn't get drawn in at times, just a little. I searched frantically during a hostage situation, wondering if there even was a third option between 'take down the enemy' and 'save the hostage.' I debated whether to intervene in a loophole-ridden religious dispute, and if so how. I paid attention to the radio broadcasts in LA, making mental notes of who's who in the neighborhood.  The villain was something of a one-note antagonist - there were moments of good writing, but his was a stock grand scheme - but there was a respectable sense that something was tracking Echo and the Rangers. There's a strange appeal to being stuck in uncharted territory, surrounded by potential enemies, with friends well out of reach and one hell of a longshot goal ahead of us. It's predictable in the end, but not without its highs; the trick of bringing back everyone you've made friends with for the final battle is an old one, but no less effective.\n\nSometimes it's not the game I'm after, but the adventure, the challenge. Sometimes it's the sense that I am probably going to lose if I play this game like I play every other game. So it was with games like Arcanum: flawed to hell and back, difficult to recommend, but special in a way that most games simply aren't for me. So it is with Wasteland 2.\n\nDid they pull it off?\n\nIn my humble, flawed, biased opinion: yeah, I think they pulled it off.","November 21, 2014","true","165.0"," 277 of 317 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","277","317","5","5"

To see my original post, read below.\n\nI originally didn't recommend the EARLY ACCESS version of Wasteland 2 for several reasons but the main point was it being nearly unplayable.  The argument against this was that it's in "beta."  I don't disagree with that statement, but to ask $60 to test a product that can barely be tested makes me not want to recommend it.  I felt there were features missing and a general lack of polish that shouldn't exist in a product that was in development for over a year and then released for PUBLIC testing.  "That's the point of a beta" some say, and I don't disagree.  But when you sell a product, you must justify why the customer should buy it.\n\nI Kickstarted the game so my money was already spent but I didn't recommend someone with no personal connection to the game suddenly drop money just for beta access. Some people thought this meant I hated the game which is far from the truth.  I like Wasteland 2.  I like how it's shaping up.  NOT RECOMMENDED doesn't necessarily mean "bad game" it means "hold your money for now."\n\nSo why did I change my opinion?  Because a recent glut of updates has brought the game to a pretty polished state.  The UI, which was once a buggy mess that often refused to work, is now workable.  Combat no longer favors fast, strong blitzing attackers.  Some tweaks to the beginning of the game help lessen the impact of practically going out naked.  Your party will now do stuff as a group such as reloading.  There's a huge list of updates and changes I could go into but bottom line is that Wasteland 2 is now looking like a commercial product whereas the original beta release was somehow less playable than the leaked Van Buren alpha from a decade ago.\n\nI still have a hard time recommend dropping $60 simply because you're paying as much as a Kickstarter backer while recieving fewer rewards.  And that's just an unfortunate side effect of how Kickstarter works but if you really want to get into the game and seriously test it out, now's a good time.  Better yet, as of typing this there's a limited window for Kickstarter backers who didn't buy into the beta to get it for a flat $10.  I can recommend that.\n\nWasteland 2 is looking like the Fallout 3/Van Buren we were promised years ago and I'm excited to see the finished product.\n\n--ORIGINAL POST--\nBefore you drop 60 bones to get early access, understand something: This is a beta.  An ACTUAL beta, not the feature-complete-a-week-from-going-gold betas that most big companies sling around.  The game is unoptimized, a quarter of the skills are either not implemented or don't work correctly, there are bugs galore, the UI is a wreck, and it's only a small chunk of the final game.  I have a mid-range PC and get 18-40 frames at max but people with beefier rigs get maybe half that.\n\nThat's not to say I don't enjoy the game or the testing process, because I do.  I backed this game and was looking forward to testing it and I'm not disappointed.  I love the game's aesthetic and design.  I see there's a good game buried here.  I'm not warning you away from the game itself, I'm warning you that unlike 90% of the games on Steam early access you are actually buying into a beta that's being actively worked on by the community, not a near finished stable product.","December 15, 2013","true","16.9"," 2,558 of 3,316 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","558","3","0","98"

That said, I am sure you have read that multiple times now through the various posts. So, where to start?\n\nPROS:\n\n--Character customization and looks in game.\n\n--Story is great thus far.\n\n--Combat will be great once game is complete.\n\n--Graphics / audio / and interface thus far are all great.\n\n--Gameplay is sweet. I said it may not be for everyone because combat is tactical / turn. So, think back old school with X-Com. I love that part of it, personal opinion.\n\n--Combat animations / effects are sweet.\n\n--Choice and consequence are a part of this game. You save someone from drowning, his parents offer him to you as an added party member if you want. Plenty of characters to change up the party.\n\n--Different skills are used for different things. Obviously, ha ha. Those chances to use the skills on a frequent basis are not persistent in other games. There are a lot of opportunity to use each skill you have in your party. I like that.\n\n--A TON of interactions within the world. Be it digging stuff up, repairing gadgets, even down to repairing toasters, ha ha! (definitely have someone in your party that can repair them, because you never know what's stored in one!)\n\n--Completed game will hands down be great.\n\nCONS:\n\n--Loading a save will often change the portrait of your character(s) if they are created from scratch. A minor annoyance, unless you get into combat, then you have to go by name. Or, if you made a guy and your portrait is now a gal.\n\n--Combat, sometimes, can be a bit.. Interesting. You have a sniper, that has 0.0% chance of hitting a target. That same target now moves behind cover, and you now have an 80.00% chance to hit.\n\n--Combat again, some enemies have ridiculous move / attacks. They will move across the screen, attack you twice, then move again... BETA, remember. It will frustrate / annoy you though, ha ha.\n\n--Make sure you get a dedicated surgeon / healer. I roamed around for a bit trying to find someone that could heal my wounds, to no avail.\n\n--There are times when walking around on the world map you are accosted by bandits, raiders, whatever, only to enter combat (if you choose) and find everything dead. Good for the free loot, bad because you never know what will really happen!\n\n--The game crashes from time to time AFTER combat is completed.\n\n--Some game choices have to be made on the spot, you do not have a lot of time to fart around and trying to figure the puzzle out. You take your time, (drowning boy for example,) he will die. Some people may not like that part.\n\n--With no tutorial yet, character creation can be.. difficult.\n\n--Finally; some characters you may spec for conversation bonus dialogues, sale prices, et-cetera. Once you enter dialogue, there is no way to change who is talking, so in cities, towns, you want to lead the party with the talker if that is your thing.\n\nFans of Fallout 1 and 2 need to play this game, awesome on so many levels! There's real consequences for your actions, believable dialogue, survival based resource alocation (water), and toasters!\n\nWhat to say about this game, there really is nothing else to say but for you the reader to choose do you want that really nice mouse or keyboard or do you want a peice of history...

Pistols and submachine guns aren't worth bothering with period. Shotguns are alright, but you only really need one party member proficient in it for when you're in close quarters with a lot of enemies bunched together. Energy wepons are only useful against enemies with high armor ratings, so they really only come into play mid to late game. The only three weapon classes worth focusing on are Heavy Weapons, Assault Rifles, and Sniper Rifles. Even then, Heavy Weapons guzzle ammo like there's no tomorrow, which isn't terrible late-game when you have a ton or resources saved up, but they aren't practical early on. The only melee skill worth taking is Blunt Weapons because its high armor penetration keeps it relevent through to the end-game.\n\n-On normal difficulty, the combat is very challenging until mid-way through. You really feel like you have to conserve ammo and resources, and every move counts. But unless you intentially build your party to suck, everything gets pretty easy by end-game. I had more money and supplies than I knew what to do with.\n\n-I experienced huge performance issues in certain areas even on my 970. It was smooth sailing for the most part, but it's pretty clear the game isn't terribly well optimized. Being a turn-based game, FPS drops aren't a huge concern, but it shouldn't be a problem on a rig that far exceeds the recommended specs.\n\nNow onto the good:\n\n- The story is good and the writing is solid. The mains story, while not mind-blowingly amazing, is good enough to keep you ineterested, though it is suprisingly linear. The side quests are far more interesting, I think, and they offer much more freedom to approach it how you want. Almost every encounter has multiple outcomes depending on what choices you make, and the game does a good job of giving you the sense that these chioces actually matter. Many of the characters have rich backstories and opinions to offer. You will run into a lot of messy situations that you can choose to help resolve through diplomacy or violance or ignore altogether. At the end of the game, you are rewarded with a little slide show (à la Fallout) that goes into detail about all the characters and situations you ran into throughout your travels, which is a nice touch.\n\n- Inventory management. It took me around 55 hours to complete this game. I reckon I spend at least 10 of those hours in my inventory screen. If you're a freak like me, and you actually enjoy inventory management, this game is a treat. It is extremely easy to move items between party members, quickly see all their stats, and compare equipment to what you have equipped. It even tells you the average damage output per action point a given weapon will deal, which I think is pretty sweet.\n\n-Combat. No, it isn't a diverse and interesting as something like XCOM, but it does a good job of scrating that turn-based strategy itch. A lot of people have complained that the combat essentially boils down to "shoot stuff until it dies," and, that's pretty much true. Unlike XCOM, there aren't any speicial abilities, and you won't find nearly as much cover to hide behind. Wasteland does offer a greater host of enemies and weapons, though, which keeps things interesting enough, espeially late game when your enemies start using energy weapons and suddenly your heavily armored super-soldier who could normally tank round after round of enemy fire suddenly loses half his health from a single hit.\n\n\nAll-in-all, Wasteland 2 is a great turn-based roleplaying game that isn't without its flaws. If the forthcoming Director's editions addresses some of these, I think Wasteland 2 could be a truly fantastic RPG.\n\n7.5/10","October 4, 2015","true","55.4"," 158 of 182 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","158","182","7","0"

In case you never heard of this, it's a turn based roleplaying game set in a post apocalyptic world, extremely similiar to Fallout (the original Wasteland 1 is the spirtiual predecessor to Fallout). It offers a very good amount of content and great athmosphere. The world is well built and interesting. The story is ok (you pretty much just help local folks, the big bad only rears its ugly head every few hours for a line or two) - it's a game that is living more off the lore than off the plot, which is totally fine (see for an excellent example: Morrowind). The disappointing part is everything else. The attribute and skill system is just bad. There are only 3 viable character builds attribute wise. Attributes are completely detached from skills, so the only thing attributes concern is combat. So there are strong guys who can walk fast (melee) and guys who can shoot well and often (sniper) and intelligence chars who suck at combat but get more skills (skill donkey).\n\nThere are a ton of skills, for example lockpicking, animal whispering or mechanical repair, as you'd expect from a RPG. But the difficulty scaling of skill checks is made in such a way that you need expert characters to keep up with the skill checks. So every character just gets 2 skills you'll dump all your skill points in every few levels. There is no customization or thinking involved in building a character after it is created and you start the game. Every level is just new skill points you have to spend in the same skills every time. Terribly boring. The skill checks themselves also ultimately become boring as hell, because every single chest in the game is locked AND trapped. It just becomes an annoying chore to disarm and open it. The reward is usually just 3 bullets of ammo and a bit of junk to vendor off. You'll also constantly come across containers with only 10-30% success chance. Prepare for the exciting meta gameplay of quicksaving and then trying and reloading as long as it takes to finally open the junk. Or simply ignoring it. But at least early on, the game is balanced around you really going after every scrap. Later on it becomes irrelevant instead.\n\nAnd the biggest problem, the combat system is very very bad. It looks like another take on the tried and true Jagged Alliance/XCOM formular. Only it's the blandest iteration I've seen so far. There are no skills, no classes. There is just one type of cover. At the end of the day there is nothing to do but just sit down all your chars behind a wall and keep firing at the nearest enemy until the fight is over. By the end I didn't even bother with cover anymore. I just left my guys standing in a big blob where the combat started and kept shooting. That's how dumb the combat here is. The maps also only very rarely offer interesting tactical opportunities. Most maps seem to have been made with aesthetics in mind and not tactics. Blackguards for example was WAY more inventive here, where you could clearly tell that the designers hand crafted every encounter and tried to get a unique twist out of every battle. In Wasteland it's just cannon fodder fights with a random fence you can use as cover if you want, or not, it won't make much of a difference.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a terrible game. What kept me going was exploring the world and seeing how the small surviving communities in this world worked. Still, I can't help but feel terribly disappointed over the massively wasted potential on display here.","September 24, 2014","false","45.7"," 515 of 671 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","515","671","8","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/recommended/240760/","archy18","Archy Senpai [RTOZ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/","1440 products in account","While I really enjoy Wasteland 2, my recommendation would have to come with a huge dose of "your mileage may vary". It's a long, slow, burn, and if you like to jump straight into things, or find yourself easily losing concentration or focus, you may find yourself giving up on Wasteland 2 before it really begins to shine. But some patience will pay off, if the genre interests you. Of course, if you don't like turn-based strategy games, then you should be giving this a pass. The writing is really top-notch in this game, and I found it both enjoyable and rewarding to play through.\n\nFocused on a team of 4 rangers (which you can create yourself, or use several pre-built characters), and using very detailed attributes and skills - the CLASSIC system (Coordination, Luck, Awareness, Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Charisma), it took me a while before I realised that some attributes and stats were extremely important, while others... could be passed over, especially depending on the followers (NPCs) you decided to acquire. Unfortunately, it can take some trial and error before you realise what you should be doing with your characters and what is important for them to have. Or... you could just forge ahead anyway! I quite liked that there were no classes, giving you the freedom to do whatever you wanted with your characters. You could have a guy carrying heavy weapons, while being a melee tank and also healing... for example. Though this can also be a negative, if you wanted to see class specialisation, perks, and so on.\n\nAnd so, I was introduced to the fun (???) of character creation. And uhh... naming my characters, which proved to be a disaster... after an embarrassingly long time, I settled on "One", "Two", "Three", and "Four". Original, right. The vast array of skills can be intimidating at first, and leveling them up (especially at later levels) can become quite frustrating and very grindy, but it does add a lot of depth to the game. One thing I did not like as much though... how much time it took, and the animation, whenever you wanted to use a skill. Using a skill meant that your Ranger (or follower) would have to move to the location (clumping up your Rangers if you moved them all as a group makes this an exhausting chore), before an animation begins. With the vast amount of skill checks in this game, the checks do add up and can become very time consuming and therefore annoying.\n\nAdditionally, there is quite a lot of travel involved in this game, both in the larger world map, and also within smaller exploreable areas. Even if you're not in a rush, the travel can quickly become aggravating. I wished for quicker travel myself, despite the fact I don't mind slower paced games.\n\nWhile you are limited to Arizona and California, one after the other, the world map is still pretty expansive, with secret areas to discover dotted around the place. Travelling isn't worry free though - not only are there standard enemy encounters (which can become annoying quite quickly), but also some more welcome encounters, which is a bit different and somewhat refreshing in comparison to the usual fare where encounters in the wild just end up being endless fights. There are also two unique mechanics: water and radiation. Your team carries canteens, which can, and should be refilled at any well and oasis you find. Once you run out of water, your team starts to dehydrate and can die. Similarly, in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, nukes have left lingering radiation in various areas - so you also have to watch out for contamination... or again, you'll find your team dropping like flies.\n\nThe musical score, sound effects, and even the voice acting is all done quite well, and combines well with the graphics to provide a smooth and enjoyable spectacle. The graphics are not the best in the world, but they do set the tone of the game well, and are very appropriate to the game's setting - harsh, gritty, and unforgiving.\n\nCombat is generally quite straight forward, with the standard turn-based combat fare reappearing here, though more in-depth compared to some other games due to the more extensive attribute and skill system. Your attributes and skills will determine in what order your characters go, and how much they can do in their turn. There are also crouch and cover mechanics, though some weapons can destroy cover. However... there is not much else. There are no real special combat moves, or combat specific skills - they increase your damage and hit percentage, and that's it. No executes, no cloak, etc. While there is headshot and ambush... they are honestly not that great. It's just point, click, hope to hit (the RNG seems to be a bit odd, with a lot of misses even on shots with a high hit percentage), rinse and repeat. There is no cover, no flush, no interesting and genuinely unique abilities.\n\nAdditionally, RNG can always turn around and give you a hard time. Or... adversely affect the enemies. Critical hits, critical misses, weapon effects, and weapon jams can all have a surprisingly large affect on the outcome of an encounter. I also like the emphasis on scarcity and the need for careful management of your resources, which is quite fitting for a game like this, especially the ammo. If you just blaze away, you'll be out of ammo before you know it, so you do need to think before you act. Vendors are limited too... The combat is decent, and I enjoyed it, but I will admit there could have been more to it.\n\nWhile your team revolves around 4 characters, you are able to recruit a number of NPCs to join your team (3 followers for a maximum team size of 7). While you are nominally in control of them, leadership is important here as there is the chance your "follower" (only if they are in a good mood) will just decide to do their own thing in combat - running into cover, shooting something you didn't want shot, etc. Overall, the combat is fun and challenging, with a variety of enemies to conquer - both man and animal.\n\nDespite there only being two areas to explore, Wasteland 2 boasts a wide variety of quests, many of which have a variety of ways to finish - but be careful, your choices do have serious and lasting consequences. Which is something else I really enjoy about the game - your choices DO matter. And have a ripple effect. This is not just limited to quests, there are some actions while just generally playing and moving around which could have an affect, especially based on which followers are with you. Do you dig up some graves? Do you disarm the alarm? Do you deliberately trip it off? Do you use strength or a grenade to break a wall? Do you help this faction, or the other faction? Mediate a ceasefire or shoot everybody up? The variety of ways to overcome things in your way is definitely a highlight of the game. I really enjoyed the varying options available, and weighing them up, based on what you want your team to do. Your decisions may cause followers to leave your party, or even turn on you. Not only does this create an interesting in-game dynamic where what you do will affect how other in-game characters interact with your party, but this also allows for extensive replayability, if you so choose. "What if" questions are plentiful in this game.\n\nFinally, I particularly loved the odd references and humour. The Wasteland 1 disc was a particular highlight. While not particularly game-making, or breaking, it was something that I enjoyed. The grand adventure that plays out, in addition to the continued support and patching by inXile, make me give this game two thumbs up.","December 20, 2014","true","67.8"," 122 of 146 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","122","146","5","5"

For the most part it avoids having any single attribute as a dump stat, although charisma and luck come close. The skill system could use some work. Three dialogue skills is two too many, and a lot of non-combat skills are just various ways to open loot crates, although there are several cases where high repair or demolitions are needed to progress in a quest. Strangely, your attributes only affect your derived stats - the majority of which are sadly hidden from you - but have no effect on your skills.\n\nCombat is a huge part of this game, and while it is fun it's also rather simple. It uses a turn based system similar to Fallout, but you get control of each member of your party. There's an ambush attack similar to overwatch from XCOM which is pretty useful, but there aren't any aimed shots except for headshots, which are pretty boring. The weapons are seriously imbalanced, with assault rifles becoming really good about 1/3 of the way through, and godlike in the end-game.\n\nThe quest design is decent; there are a handful of major quests in both areas of the game that are pretty complex and fulfilling to solve but the majority of them are short and combat focused. The quests in the first half are more polished while the back half feels rushed and incomplete.\n\nWasteland 2 is worth playing especially if you loved the old Fallout games and wish Van Buren was real. A word of warning: the game can still have some pretty poor performance even if you meet recommended specs.","July 8, 2015","true","90.1"," 126 of 154 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","126","154","2","2"

I played and heavily enjoyed the original, and have played all Fallouts.  I enjoy most turn-based tactics titles like X-COM (original and new), Fire Emblem, Silent Storm, what have you, and Wasteland 2 is not worth your time.  It's mechanically shallow, the skill system is a joke, and weapon types are ludicrously imbalanced.  It's a completely bare-bones system, skills are absurdly redundant (somethign like 6 different skills to open boxes for six different kinds of boxes), the loot system is has zero appeal, and you'll quickly find that the only weapons worth using are your assault rifles, with maybe one sniper specialist.  Ah, and explosives, which all have 100% perfect aim regardless of your demolitions skill and can trivialize most encounters.\n\nDue to clunky armor systems, you'll find yourself taking off your armor to fight some of the game's toughest monsters because they actually do less damage to you without your armor.\n\nMines are annoying.  You'll find your characters disarming hundreds of these through the game just to walk through, and they do enough damage that even one can cripple your party - which means that either you're going to walk really carefullly all the time, or most likely, you'll just reload when you run into a mine - something I'd normally feel guilty about doing, but let's face it, the only reason this happens is because there's no formation system to speak of.\n\nA further consequence is that there's really no good way to position your characters before a battle.  Sensibly, you'd like to put all your guys behind cover, maybe leave your sniper further away.  Except in Wasteland, you're almost bound to trip their detection, giving them the first shot.  After awhile, you don't bother with setting up with the clunky system, you just switch all your guys to long range weapons and have them alpha strike, or maybe have your snipers shoot simultaneously at a target, because anything else is likely to give them first shot, and get you killed.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about, and the writing is okay, but it gets wearing after awhile the sheer amount of pop culture thrown in.    Honey badgers were cute the first time you ran into them, but after awhile they're an annoyance, especially since they are essentially zero threat unless you screw up and let them get in melee range, after which they're deadlier than anything short of a robot-death-machine, but also have ridiculous number of hit points, meaning that early on you're going to be kiting them.\n\nSpeaking of which, at higher difficulty levels, hit points become ludicrous, which I've always felt is the sign of a lazy difficulty system.\n\nAnyway, not recommend.   Mediocrity.\n\nEdit:  Due to the multiple ridiculous comments saying that I had played the game "too much" and thus can't comment on how mediocre it is, I must mention that I did not actually play ~130 hrs of the game, I use the magical ability to run games and do other things at the same time without closing them down through the magic of alt-tab.  Realistically, I probably put in ~30-40 hrs into the game, which was far too much because the game is not very good.\n\nAnd seriously, the game is super easy on anything but the hardest difficulty, which difficult primarily in terms of annoyance rather than tactical difficulty from things like large hp pools, forced kiting, high armor making already generally inferior weapons like SMGs lack any utility in the game whatsoever, and any trap, mine, or explosive being able to OHKO or at least cripple you.  The game is much easier than playing X-Com on the easiest difficulty level, the Fallouts on normal difficulty, or Wasteland 1.\n\nBut regardless of difficulty, the game is simply a very shallow experience, in terms of either tactical combat or story.","December 25, 2014","false","137.7"," 376 of 515 people (73%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","73","376","515","16","24"

The second half opens up a lot more, giving you less directed main quests and giving you a good amount of freedom to solve your way through side quests at your own pace.\n\nThe roleplaying aspect of Wasteland 2 is great. Designing your specialized characters and seeing how they make their way through a story with real consequences offers a good deal of replay value.\n\nIf you are patient and give Wasteland 2 the time it needs to show its potential, it will be a tremendously enjoyable experience.

As a result, I didn't dive too deep into the latest update but I poked around enough to confirm one thing: this game is easily one of the most solid Early Access titles available (in my humblest of opinions).\n\nThe positives from my original review still stand and some of the negatives have been resolved. Ammo no longer needs to be equipped to be used; simply have it on your character and you are good to go. I didn't have nearly as many instances where my characters got stuck (in fact I don't recall sticking a single time). There were few instances out in the wastes where a click wouldn't register but I think this was more due to me moving my mouse at the same time as I clicked so this could be user error.\n\nIn my short playthrough I encountered one oddity that was so minor it's barely worth mentioning. It doesn't appear all of the item names are in use when making a trade. I found when trading items such as bullets, the log would read "Bojangles traded <blank> with Gidget" where blank was obviously missing the item name. Otherwise, this new update has definitely improved upon an already soild looking title. It faster, smoother, and slightly more violent (I shot a guy and his head and arms came off. I mean, c'mon, what's not to like?).\n\nWhile I still recommend the game even in its current state, I would suggest holding off for now simply because it is (I have heard) releasing soon. That said, if you don't mind restarting when updates come out and not being able to progress past a certain point due to missing content, I can't really give you any reason to not dive in. It's really shaping up to be something awesome and I can't wait to get my hands on the full thing.\n\nAdditional thoughts: There were two instances that sort of threw me off and I'm not sure if this is due to my not paying attention or just a need for tutorial/paying more attention. I wanted to mention them here to potentially help new players or perhaps confirm what others may have felt.\n\n- When leveling, I expected there to be arrows to add or subtract skill points. Instead there were simply light blue boxes with no real indication that you were meant to click the boxes to add points. This may have been the way it was previously but it threw me off at first. Easily solved by slight investigation. It just wasn't obvious how I was meant to allocate points.\n- I didn't realize I had completed the first couple of objectives in the beginning and the journal didn't really seem to indicate I had either. I ran around aimlessly for a bit before I thought to radio in my progress at which point I was able to move forward. I'm not sure if this is just a lack of me paying attention when completing some of those objectives or if the game just wants to put an emphasis on the radio as a communication device at all times (they do say in the beginning to radio in often to report progress and while I took this as an indication I needed to radio in to level, it could have had other implications).\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nDo I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if you're just looking for something new to play? No.\nDo I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if this has been on your radar and you just can't wait to get your hands on it? Maybe.\nDo I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if you want to see this game evolve, have a hand in seeing HOW this game evolves, and want a taste of what is to come? Definitely.\n\nI was hesitant to spend the asking price on this Beta (Deluxe Edition goodies included but let's be honest, I wanted to play the game). I spent days watching videos on YouTube, reading impressions, looking at Steam reviews, trying to convince myself not to buy it yet. I caved. But I'm glad I did.\n\nThe current state of the game is buggy. Sometimes buttons don't seem to activate when clicked, sometimes characters get stuck. Sometimes the game seems to hang while loading. Some thing aren't explained very well (Protip: make sure ammo is EQUIPPED or else you will not be able to reload). But all of this is to be expected in a development build. Have I experienced anything in the game yet that made me ragequit? No. In fact, I had to pull myself away from the game after I bought just to eat.\n\nCombat is your basic turn based affair ala XCOM or Fallout Tactics. All actions use Action Points and can be saved up between turns (to a max) so there is definitely some call for strategy prior to moving yoru characters. Cover can be used and even destroyed to get the upper hand on your opponents which I always find to be a nice touch. There are plenty of opportunities for loot and this is made even more possible by allowing players to lockpick, break doors open with brute force, or blow things up with explosives. The choice is yours. The maps I have played so far have had nice secret areas to explore, mounds of dirt to dig to find goodies, and branching paths that, while the end goal is the same, allow for additional exploration on the players part.\n\nThe character creation is also quite well done at the moment. You can choose a group of four based on premade characters ranging from a demolitions expert, melee specialist, sniper, or even a jack of all trades. You can also create your entire team from scratch, putting points into attributes and points into three categories of skills: Combat (assault rifle, energy weapon, pistol, etc), Knowledge (brute force, lockpicking, safecracking, toaster repair (no I'm not joking), etc), and General (surgeon, barter, evasion, field medic, etc). There are a multitude of group dyanmics to play around with here. You can also pick up additional NPCs for your group that you then gain control over in battle and exploration (they sometimes "lose control" and go rogue during combat. I'm not sure what dictates this but it never seems to detract from the action).\n\nAll in all, I have actually been extremely impressed with the current state of the game. I went in expecting, to be honest, not much and I was pleasantly surprised. While I agree with many people out there that 60 may be a bit steep, I have absolutely no regrets with my purchase. I am looking forward to playing more and seeing what is offered and I truly believe the end result will be a phenomenal experience and worthy of the price of entry.","March 4, 2014","true","25.7"," 157 of 203 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","157","203","0","0"

If don't know about this game, save yourself some time and money and just boot up Fallout Tactics. For me, this game doesn't live up to it's reputation. It struck me as an unpolished and uninteresting product.\n\nI kickstarted this game, and was excited to play it partly because of its purportedly stellar writing. Unfortunately, the basic format of tactics rpgs colludes with the lack of mechanical depth to severely limit the relevance of the writing. So while descriptions of areas that appear in a small text box are indeed well-executed and occasionally evocative, the lack of any meaningful interaction between your party members (or, indeed, any character or NPC) means that whatever that shows up in that little text box feels like window dressing. The lack of complexity in the gameplay means that what's contained in the textbox is also largely irrelevant to the experience of playing. The end result is pretty hollow. I suspect you could complete the entire game without ever glancing at the writing. This feeds into a more insidious problem, where the game's overall and immediate plots start to feel like a procession of meaningless skirmishes connected by an ephemeral charade of narrative, the kind you see in any MMO questline.\n\n"But hey, this is a tactics RPG! Who cares about characters or writing or any of that crap?" Valid point. But unfortunately the game's shortfalls here are many, and worse. Where the writing was well-executed but irrelevant, the gameplay is unpolished and shallow. A problem for a game who's central focus is something like tactical combat. Combat in WL2 is a linear shootout, a numbers game where there are no meaningful tactical decision to be made once you're outside of a merchant's screen. I could make a really long list of gripes here, and cite the basically equidistant ranges of weapons, how gear is the single most important character element, aggressively incorrect "Hit %" in the UI, lack of any enemy AI outside of "rush up to face and use gun/crowbar", zero terrain relevance, and a hundred others. But the takeaway is that lack of polish I mentioned. The combat dies from a thousand of these tiny cuts, each of them trivial by themselves but fatally boring taken together.\n\nAnd honestly, it could maybe have survived all those problems if the game had interesting choices to make. But. Remember that lack of mechanical depth I mentioned? In WL2, your only meaningful interaction with the world happens through skills. Skills have basically two purposes in the game: Opening Boxes and Murder. Social skills are a member of the former category. Maybe that doesn't seem like a problem, as hey, Fallout 1 and 2 come dreadfully close to doing the same thing. But compare this tactical rpg-elements game to other tactics classics like XCOM, Icewind Dale or Final Fantasy Tactics. Different Classes or Abilities on the battlefield dramatically change the landscape of any individual battle. "Should I Suppress or Flush?" is a question you have in XCOM only after you've acquired those abilities. Should I tank that group or kite them? Lightning Bolt or Fireball? No skill or weapon or indeed, any element in WL2 is going to approach altering your game choices, because all skills do is open boxes and give slight bonuses to hit chance.\n\nWasteland 2 relies on ancient game ideas with no new spin on them, and worse, seems to forget many lessons that've been learned about these systems in the last fifteen years. Which alone, would be acceptable, even enjoyably "retro". But the lack of polish or depth to these systems made playing the game aggressively monotonous. If this game had come out in 1999 it would have been a reasonable but ultimately forgettable companion to the then-game-market. But honestly, there are better places for your time and money, and if you're expecting a post-apocalyptic XCOM or Fallout experience then you're looking in the wrong place.","October 30, 2014","false","34.4"," 509 of 746 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","509","746","4","17"

Im not even done yet. Coming from a fallout fan id say is spot on what i wanted, Game is about tactics and smarts not reaction times (Check), Game is full of lore (Check), The maker of it took 1 million of his own personal money and used it to make the game better (Check), No dlc (Check!). Now past that theres more. The lore is so intense i spend lots of my time just reading lore. If you like lore then you could buy this game just for that. There is no "reaction time wins" here. That means no, if you call "skill" seeing who can shoot the fastest then you wont find that "skill" here. Skill here is about whos the smartest. And how you positioned your people. If you bring even the best weapon to an easy fight you can still loose if your stupid.\n\nThis game is by one of the best game designers you can trust. Brian Fargo. He has never let me down on a game. Be it Fallout 1, Fallout 2, any game. And even when he did sell fallout to bethesda he made sure it was a good company. He could of sold it to EA im sure but he picked another good company. Fallout 3 may be diffrent from the old fallouts but its certainly not a bad game. Same with vegas.\n\nSo in short its a great game with acutal skill good lore made by a REALLY good game designer and company and NO DLC. None. Also you can trust this from me. Im practicly an expert on old and new fallouts. Just check how much time ive played fallout 1, fallout 2, fallout 3, fallout nv. Also i even got more time on consoles. So again im not just some random guy i know whats a good game and a bad game.\n\nAlso there is msny little things in the game that make you think lots. For example a woman wanted me to put her out of her misery i did so, then a kid told me he was gonna tell the authorites and i shouldnt of done it, i had to kill the kid. I think about that scenario alot. Theres many more like it so that when your done it makes you think long and hard about all youve had to do. There really isnt winning in this game because if your human you will find a way to do something horrible that has to be done. Even if you dont do side quests you could still end up having to fight a kid. So this game is one not like cod where you blindly shoot, it makes you think about each person you meet or kill.","September 21, 2014","true","162.1"," 166 of 230 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","166","230","0","9"

It builds upon the original's style, writing, skill systems and combat in a completely logical way, without getting "too modern". It's also chock-full to the brim with references to the original, both in dialog and in the locations you visit (the whole first half of the game is basically a love-letter to the fans, as a matter of fact). So if you're coming into it from the same nostalgia-fueled background as me, you'll probably enjoy the game.\n\nAs for everyone else, I am really not so sure. The game is good, but far from perfect. The biggest issue is probably that the combat can get to be a bit simplistic and tedious after a while. Although there are elements of strategy to it, you almost never need to do anything "outside of the box" to successfully win a battle. The story is OK, but nothing you haven't seen before - a post-apocalyptic wasteland threatened by a megalomaniacal antagonist... yadda, yadda, yadda. The writing is good overall, striking a nice balance between serious and playful, though some of the dialogue ends up being a bit cheesy (especially towards the end). Two other big issues are the pace and length of the game. It really takes a while to get rolling. This is partly due to the aforementioned tedium in combat, but mostly because of the sheer size of the game. It becomes pretty obvious after a while that the developers just decided "screw it, this is our one chance to do this, and by god, let's go all out"... and "all out" they most certainly did. They threw everything they thought of in there, plus an extra kitchen sink. On one hand, that's admirable and I completely understand it. But I also just ended up feeling that maybe they should have scaled back their ambition just a tad, which would have allowed more time to tighten up and polish the experience overall. There are quite a few bugs in the game, at least as it initially launched. Thankfully, there was nothing completely game-breaking that I found, but there were definitely some bugs in various quests and dialogue options, and a few other glitches that popped up here and there. Finally, I also felt that the skill and weapon systems weren't quite balanced properly. After completing the game, it became kind of obvious that some of my skill, attribute and weapon investments were more or less useless. Again, not the end of the world, but the game could definitely use some additional balance in its systems.\n\nOverall though, none of these minor issues greatly affected my personal appreciation and enjoyment of the game. I backed this Kickstarter project on day one, and don't regret it for a second. That said, I am also pretty forgiving when it comes to these sorts of things, especially when I know what a labor of love the project was for Brian Fargo and his team. So while I do recommend it overall, I would suggest it primarily for fans of old-school turn-based RPG/tactical-type games. Casual players, or those on the fence should probably check out some gameplay videos of the combat, in particular, to see if it's up your alley. If so, and if you are willing to look past a few minor flaws, definitely give Wasteland 2 a shot.","October 28, 2014","true","95.9"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","98","128","2","0"

There is no advanced tactics, there is not even a simple stealth mode, were you can use a sneaky char to surprise your enemies.\n\nWith no Special moves and a very linear environment, the battles are very repetitive and purelly luck based.\n\nThe developers didn't keept their project promisses,just like the special skills, early videos featured a lot of armors models showing in the characters, but they simply chose to change this, so now, does not matter the armor you have equiped, your ranger will just change their clothes, so you can have a power armor equiped and your ranger may still show a ragged shirt.\n\nCharacter customization is minimal and the models are so ugly that you could easily mistake it for a game of the 90's.\n\nThe game offers a false sense of open world but actually is very linear, the base missions are very boring "go to place, click something, come all the way back", the roleplay is also very shallow even with the very good story.\n\nThe story is very good and the game isn't that bad, but i can't say that i'm satisfied, both the hight price and hype didn't help with it. After 25 years the wait is finally over, and i wasn't worth it.\nWait for a 75% sale to try this.","September 20, 2014","false","71.8"," 474 of 709 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","474","709","4","30"

The characters that I recruited throughout the game only one of them made the ending credits and her future was forgettable.\n\nRegarding the AI for a tactical turn based strategic game for the npc AI to do exactly the same thing for 80 hrs is unforgiveable. All enemies without fail bum rush you from off the screen moving further in one turn than your sniper can shoot. Worse valueable player npcs without fail do there best to commit suicide every single round.\n\nI found a couple of quests that can be turned in infinitely for xp and rewards. Not a huge deal for single player game but considering how linear the progression is I don't understand how it was missed.\n\nArmor is so broken currently. Buying the most expensive armor in the game will result in you being one shot by anything with an energy weapon whereas running around naked will have that plasma just tickle your exposed fleshy bits.\n\nSome quests particularly in the second half of the game dont conclude appropriately. Free slaves, woot freedom, they stand outside the cages with a bland thank you interaction.\n\nIts not that this couldn't have been a great game its just that everything has been dumbed down so much that the depth and complexity has been gutted from offering leaving a grindy on rails choose a or b limited experience.\n\nPlenty of the skills are absolutely worthless which really makes me wonder why they included them at all.\n\nAnyway I hope they do the right thing over the next year and patch or turn it over to the community; for me the ending was mass effect 3 cringe worthy and I hope they have better ideas for Torment.","September 25, 2014","false","73.0"," 147 of 206 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","147","206","3","0"

I am officially stuck in the second area, unable to complete the mission to bring peace between two waring factions (names left vague to avoid spoilers for readers) but because I put one guy on one side in charge first, I am unable to complete the quest. It is not a main story quest, but half the fun of games such as this are the side quests.\n\nSecond, prepare to spend a lot of time... watching your team do the same thing 20 times. See that toaster you want to repair? Save first, you're going to have to try five times and if you critically fail you will have to reload. Almost more annoying, you have to sit there and fail over and over just waiting for the one lucky chance that you will succeed. You really do spend a good portion of the game either randomly moving around the wastes (which just takes a long time) or attempting to unlock / hack / disarm things.\n- It would be profoundly helpful if the developers had figured out either a more engaging way to do these things or just made them instant pass / fail tests so you could sit and spam attempts until they work.\n\nThird, there really is a 'winning party', you will have to have one person with essentially every skill to be successful in this game. Which is fine, except that there are more skills than you end up with characters able to have them. It is nearly impossible to do a good chunk of the game if no one has lock picking / demolitions / field medic, and at the point where they are essentially required skills to win, why not at least tell people when they start building their party?\n\nGoing past that, I really do question the effectiveness of their random number generator. It can be really strange watching someone with a 95% in a skill fail 20 times in a row. I realize that is in fact the nature of an RNG, but it leaves me questioning how they did their seeding.\n\nThat all said and done, the game is strangely graphics intensive for how simplistic the graphics are. They really do need to do some optimization to help the game either run more smoothly or look better, a game with graphics this old should not be struggling on most modern PC's.\n\nAll in all, the game had a ton of potential, but the execution leaves a lot lacking and other games of the same approach (Shadowrun for example) have done a better job at engaging players and keeping them involved with minimal bugs.","September 4, 2015","false","54.4"," 149 of 218 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","149","218","5","2"

FINALLY!!  FINALLY!!1!1!eleven!1!!\n\nAnd that isn't a crack against how long it was in development, I've been looking for an INTELLIGENT thinking mans game since the orginal Fallout 1 and 2, we had touches of it with Baulders gate and games like it were great, but I've been in freaking LOVE with post apocyptic games since the fallout series (pre 'DERP LETS TURN IT INTO A FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!, hey, we only have like 11,237,423,423,523 FPS's, lets compete in THAT market some more.  What do you mean there aren't even enough TACTICAL squad based games that you can count on a single hand, that means that genre is DEAD obviously! every big developer for the last 20+ years)\n\nThe problem, many of us apparently, have had with most games these days, they are set in one of three settings, 1.  Fanasty setting  2.  Current setting (lets shoot ethnic minorities in sandy countries with modern weapons!.... pass) or 3.  Lets kill Zombie Hilter controlled clones for the millionith time.    All of which CAN and ARE sometimes great games, but how many games do we have set in Post apocalyptic worlds.   A world where yes, there are guns, gernades, rifles, and melee weapons, but also more exotic stuff like plasma and laser weapons.\n\nAlso, where combat IS a major part of the game, each and almost EVERY mission has a VARITETY of ways to solve it.   EXAMPLE (BUT NOT FROM THE GAME, MAKING THIS ONE UP MYSELF no spoilers!)\nSmall town is being harassed by a two local gangs, how do you solve it as a ranger?\n\nPossible ways to solve it![/u]\n1.  Guns blazing - lets BLOW EM ALL UP AND KILL EM!\n2.  Dialog/Diplomacy - Infiltrate both gangs, and give them clues that the OTHER gang is out to slaughter em, make them fight it out via planted evidence, then finish off the survivors so the small town can be free!\n3.  Use mechanic skill to turn off water/power to bandits bases - unable to support themselves the bandits move on\n4.  Use Animial Whisper skill and turn wild life against bandits - a combination of patience and timing makes the bandits a 3 course meal for local wildlift and saves the local town\nETC. ETC. ETC.\n\nTHESE are the kinds of ways I like to see a game able to be played, not where the only option is 'aim at ONLY moving targets on screen EVER, and pull trigger until enemy is no longer moving.  It lets you not only have different ways to get things done, but you ALSO have almost unlimited replayability, even with knowing how things can generally go, you want to try new things BECAUSE there are so many possible ways to GET TO THE SAME RESULT.\n\nLike I said, a little more intelligence and/or patience is required, and for an industry that is chock full of FPS's, and 'Who can twitch fastest is the best' games it's been long, LONG overdue where we can have a top down game where I can use terrain, combat skills, and different weaponary to beat superior forces.\n\nOh and lets not forget the morale parts of the game, instead of the typical 'become a boyscout or SATANS RIGHT HAND MAN' there are just dozens of shades of gray all through this game, and people will treat you differently in one location over the next, almost as if they were part of isolated communities that had a hard time talking to each other.... .......  ...............    Eventually things WILL filter down, and where you might end someones suffering from pain, another person could see you and say you killed them in cold blood.   Almost NOTHING is clear cut, and you'll find yourself actually having to think of different outcomes rather than the typical game.\n\nI really hope the ADHD that has infested the gaming industry the last 10+ years can be put aside for a few mintues for WL2, it's not MEANT to be the 'run of the mill' crap we've been force fed over and over.  It says it gives you 80+ hours of game play, I spent all weekend playing it and I'm not ashamed to say I took a sick day tomorrow so I can play it all day without interuption in an empty house.   It's THAT good, at least to me anyway.\n\nNow, there are a few things that will work against it.  It's NOT perfect, it's a little rough in a few areas and sometimes you WILL be angry that you can't find a particular item, NPC or easy solution.  Other times the game will surprise you with it's richness and attention to detail.\n\nOh and that's another thing, HUMOR is big in this game, there are tons and TONS of refferences to all sorts of things from the last 25+ years all through it.  I won't ruin them so hopefully you can get them yourself, but lets say some characters from other games, movies and books do make apperances through out the game.  Some might be as simple as walking past another Ranger team and closely looking at their names and saying to yourself  'wait a second, .. oh damn, that's !!!!!!!!  son of a B!  That's AWESOME!'\n\nOther times you'll notice little pieces of inventory 'junk' that make you just grin, I've found everything from a Chia pet to old gaming consoles from the 80's and 90's.  Each and everything I've also read the description on, mostly because it just makes you laugh at some of the crap they threw into the descriptions since many people just skip by them in most games.  In WL2 I'll say it's worth the reading the items at least the 1st time you see em, after that np, see it again just skip it, but up the Devs got more then a little creative with some of this stuff.\n\nOh and while this IS a tactical combat game mostly, I will say that you should probably make a play through where you focus at least one character with high intelligence, charisma and a hard path of the dialog skills.  There are simply SO many times in conversations where I wish I was able to choose some of the other options but I couldn't because I was too combat focused.\n\nSo there is a great chance to have multiple play throughs on this, I'll give it that as well.  Something with most single player games just hasn't been the case these last years.\n\nAnd yes, I'm obviously dating myself with some of what I've said, but I've been a gamer for almost 25 years now.  And a really good tactical squad based thinking game has been lacking since the late 90's.   Wasteland Two has made me feel all of those good feelings I got when I played the orginal fallout games.  I'm just hoping that by writing this, obivously long as all hell review, that it will make a few people on the fence about getting it swing to the 'let me give it a shot' option.  Then if you like it and you are one of those people that do 'Let's plays' please do one for this, I'm not technical, I don't know how to stream or record, but I'd love to see this game get the attention it deserves and, HOPEFULLY, will reawaken developers to the fact that we need more then clones of the same 4 genre's invented, reinvented, re-hashed and regurgitated over and over to a market that does have more then a few of us that have more then the 'push button - recieve result x 10,000 = YOU WIN!' mentality.\n\nYes, I've been a bit harsh in parts here to certain kinds of gamers, I aplogize for that, but we need MORE details in games, no dumbed down crap over and over, Wasteland two has me just grinning like a madman the entire weekend.  To the point where my wife just looked at me and said 'go... play that nuclear death game all you want, you'll be useless to me all weekend anyway.'\n\nThat's rare and I can't stop smiling about it.\n\nThanks to the Dev's for making it and I really hope I've brought a good case to a few of you that will take the time to read, and hopefully find this (early) review useful.\n\n-Banlish","September 22, 2014","true","45.0"," 291 of 445 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","291","445","0","12"

Did you know that people violently defend something they cant possibly understand or judge something based on very little information provided? Fanboys would rather say this poo doesnt stink because of what they think the end result of the product might be. Something impossible to determine.\n\nThis last update helps a lot of these folks save face. While the game is still a buggy mess, its still probably better than half the games out there now. I've been actively involved in bug testing, aka playing, this game since november when it first came out. It has made large strides to this still unfinished game and thankfully the community and developers are pulling through.\n\nFor any of you who played the original fallouts, this is what fallout 3 should have been. Regardless of the bugs (fallouts were REALLY BUGGY even in release) you need to save often. Because either the game will crash or you will die. Its not hard to be roaming the wastelands and be mobbed by a bunch of methed out raiders with giant axes.\n\nPros:\nThe gameplay and UI is really shaping up. Still not perfect but the bits and pieces that have changed would seem that the rest will fall in line soon enough.\nThere is enough new content and changes that make replaying the first 3 levels over and over not seem so repetitive.\nIts fallout 3. Sick twisted humor with gore, unavoidable consequences and quick decisions make this game thrive.\n\nCons: Its still pretty darn buggy and has its fair share of holes and such that arent gamebreakers but are easily noticed.\nUI still needs some work.\n\nStill worried about dropping 60 bones on it? I'd still hold off. Check back in a few months. This isnt a game for people that want to play a game. Not yet. You will lose your saves and everything often as it updates. Its still a heck of a lot of fun and I've burned through 40 hours in the last two weeks.\n\nSincerely,\nhttp://www.thecomic-community.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Review:\nIt looks like it will be good, and i'll update this when I can actively play it for more than 15 minutes at a time. Definitely a good mix of fallout with that text based game flair. Before you say, OH well this is what fallout is based off of, well its not. Go play wasteland 1 and tell me how its like fallout again? Maybe a theme and designers, but not much more, fallout stands on its own and this is what fallout 3 should have been even though I love fallout 3 as it is.\n\nCant wait for it to be finished, but unless you want to 'support the devs' until the game is finished, I'd steer clear of this guy for a bit. It has a very hard time loading maps and transitioning and its mostly memory access errors. 32 bit quad core with 4 gig of ram and higher end nvidia card just isnt cutting it right now. performance is great on any level of resolution or graphic quality so not sure what going on.\n\nCons:\nUI needs a bit of work, its not intuitive sometimes and breaks a decent amount of the time.\nLoading areas crashes 80% of the time. Save often.\n\nPros:\nEverything that isnt a con, this will be a great game, from what i can experience at quick intervals, there is a lot here to see and has that great quirky feeling from the original fallout games.\n\nI know this is a beta, and i'm waiting on getting bug reporting credentials from them so we can shore all of this up, so if you still take the plunge maybe you'll have better luck than me. I'm really looking forward to a truely playable build and the end product.\n\n\n\nUpdate: I'll be installing this game on a different pc and even a laptop soon to help me shun the non-believers.\nUpdate 2: Still not ready to change. Other computer doesnt seem to matter, perhaps you need a much bigger and powerful rig.\nUpdate 3: Still not playable. Shucks.\nUpdate 4: Playable! Oh my. Played it a lot, still not ready to change my mind. Even upgraded my pc to a nice new 64 bit with more memory and fun stuff. Its still super buggy! Like, I joined the bug thing and submitted 11 bugs in 60 minutes of playtime. Not all gamekiller bugs but theres not much more to do than just test out the game engine.","December 14, 2013","true","253.8"," 467 of 729 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","467","729","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpwrussell/recommended/240760/","dpwrussell","dpwrussell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpwrussell/","8 products in account","I had been looking forward to this game's release for a long time. A lot of things were done quite well. I liked the general setting and story outline and the fact it used turn based combat, but there are a huge number of letdowns in this game.\n\nPlot. I think it's supposed to feel immersive, but I just didn't feel like it was. Other than radio messages and a couple of places overrun by end-boss henchmen, nothing connects the end of the game to the start or middle. There is no feeling of building to an epic conclusion. The side-quests are fine.\n\nSkills. There is hardly any synergy between stats.Your Computer Science skill character for example, his intelligence level is irrelevant on skill checks... that makes no sense. I think it would have been much better to keep skills more closely linked with stats. Partly I think this has happened because of the ludicrous number of skills/stats. There is just no point in having safecracking, lock-picking and alarm disabling as separate skills. Less skills, less stats, less skill points and this problem would have gone away. Also, especially the stats feel very ineffectual, each char might get 2 or 3 points to allocate throughout the game. What can you get for them? Not a lot.\n\nSkill-checks. I'm guessing there are 2 kinds of players, ones who try and fail to open lockboxes/doors/safes and accept that and move on (potentially to lobbing grenades at it) or ones who will save/reload until it opens. The system in place does not really handle it that well for either. The randomness is just a complete waste of time. If the former type of player got to a box and the tooltip says the skillcheck is too low, that would be fine, they could move on. If the latter type of player did the same, ditto. It's just making busy work for people who want to explore event inch of the game and open all the chests. Later in the game there are chests that will be 20% chance to open with maximum Lockpicking + Luck... what is the point in that? If it's supposed to be because sometimes in lfe you can't overcome a challenge... then just make it that you find lockboxes which can't be opened at all.\n\nUsing skills. There is no reason for it to take several seconds to try and fail/succeed to perform some action, especially if you have to do it several times in succession. Mine fields are a prime example... Quicksave, right-click, disarm, wait, wait, wait, repeat. How tedious. Combine near instant usage with some absolute (i.e. not random) skill-check like I describe in (3) and it would have made the game a lot less annoying.\n\nCombat - Tactics. This is perhaps the biggest letdown. There is no excuse for this at all, the combat is incredibly dull and you inevitably start to feel like your trying to trick the game's AI instead of trying to waste some raiders.\n\nCombat - Positioning. This could have had a big effect on most battles, making them more tactical and thus more interesting, but in the majority of cases (especially in the end-game battles) the bad guys are entrenched and you come in the door and the battle (or cut scene leading to battle) begins. It would have been a lot better if there was some kind of stealth skills that you could have used to get into better positions. Also, it would have been great if there was a way to tell whether you were in an NPCs line of sight so trying to position your squad cleverly wasn't an annoying save-reload procedure.\n\nCombat - Cover. I like cover, it's a fun mechanic, however, because of the positioning, often by the time you reach it you could have already won. The last few battles I felt were pretty crap tactically because it was almost impossible to make decent use of cover. Also, if you have any melee characters, obviously they can't really make use of cover so should be appropriately armoured...\n\nCombat - Melee/Brawl. ... which they aren't. My blunt weapons dude was maxxed out on strength with all the armor and constitution and crit dmg reduction perks... he was still a ridiculously easy target. In the end game, if he got into melee range before being killed that was a surprise. Massively disappointing. Made worse by...\n\nCombat - Armor. ... the fact that heavy armor makes you slower. Ok, that makes some sense, however it makes melee chars slow (especially as they'd have to have taken high strength to be useful at the cost of other stats, like speed) and thus less able to get into position to pummel the enemy. I get that having the whole squad in (enclave) power armor (FO2 stylee!!) doesn't make a lot of sense, but combat speed was the stupidest thing to reduce when wearing it. Much better would have been a loss of coordination or evasion. You can make it RP by saying that it's like mech armor, giving them more speed to make up for the heavy armor. In the end-game, melee is almost completely useless as there are snipers who can take them out in a couple of shots. Conductive armor... this is a stupid idea, if you are struck by lightning/energy weapons, the best thing you could be wearing was a huge suit of power armor as the faraday cage effect would ensure the wearer remain unscathed, it's basic physics. This all basically means you have to carry 2 sets of armor around per person to ensure you can change when a battle will be energy weapon heavy. This is a massive hassle and adds very little to the game. I think it would have been better if the novel use of energy weapons was that they were less applicable to precision strikes (for obvious reasons), but overall a little more powerful than regular weapons to compensate. Make them a little better against robots and a little less against biological targets, by all means. Having your energy weapons guy be almost entirely useless for the first half of the game... great!\n\nCombat - Followers. Maybe these guys aren't meant to last long in combat? When they 'bum-rush' the enemy in every fight you either do a lot of save/reloading to keep them alive, or just let them die and get on with it. Kind of a pity.\n\nCombat - Healing. Given that in any tough fight, unless your party is 100% snipers and assault rifles, people will have to move in closer, and will get incapacitated... Having the surgeon get to them is nearly always impossible in combat as it takes more than 1 round to get them back on their feet, in which time the surgeon will almost certainly be out in the open and gunned down. Also, you use surgeon to get people back on their feet after a fight, great... but now they have a real-time (some are 600 seconds!!), unremovable debuff reducing their stats. What is that for? Mandatory bathroom breaks? All it does is introduce an annoying time delay before you can go into combat again.\n\nWeapon types - Nobody wanted to use weapons other than sniper/assault rifles right? Oh, you did? Well, that's too bad because they are pretty crap.\n\nCar - One of the best ideas in Fallout 2. It allowed you to move around the map a lot faster (not a huge Wasteland 2 problem), but more importantly, you had your 'bank' nearby, so when you get to a place you can go and grab that heavy quest item or 'white' item when you find someone who wants it without having to go all the way back to base, then inside the base to the chest, then all the way back again. Definitely should have existed here.\nIn summary. The game wasn't terrible, but particularly the combat was a big let down. While there are some new things from where Fallout 2 was (oh Marcus... did you just kill 2 of your own party members with your minigun...again!?), this game did not get them right. Given that we're 17 years down the road in terms of game design, it should have been much, much better.","November 29, 2015","false","50.2"," 180 of 269 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","180","269","9","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeku/recommended/240760/","eeku","Eeku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeku/","64 products in account","Wasteland 2 is finally here, courtesy of Kickstater, and for all the good it does to the genre, it's still a mixed bag.\n\n//Contains spoilers//\n\nIt opens up really nice, with a live-action intro, thrusting you into the unforgiving, post-apocaliptic setting as you bury a fellow ranger. A scene later and you notice a unique shotgun straped to the hip of a nearby guard, all thanks to your perception skill, and with a little bit of convincing (another skill) you can make it yours. Across the bridge you can charm yourself a butt-kicking goat companion, which raises one of your ability scores by 1. And all that's in the very first, small area.\n\nIt's a great start, I found myself thinking, and if this reflects the rest of the game, I'm sold. Love me some world that actually reacts to my character build.\n\nUnfortunately it isn't so. Perception soon becomes mainly a mine/trap finding tool, and truth be told, at some point it's simply better to detonate the explosives and accept the blast directly, then to try disarming any of them. There goes role-playing. Try watching the same disarming animation over and over and over again, and you will know what I mean. You are better off using a healing skill every once in a while. You can still find some buried junk using it, but it gets somewhat underwhelming after the initial shotgun surprize.\n\nTaking about junk, You will easily find yourself at weight capacity carrying around all the junk you just found, hoping that someone somewhere may want it. And they do, but the game gives no hints as to just who may be interested in baby wipes. You may just as well gather all you can before you leave Arizona, and re-visit every single npc in the world looking for dialogue cues. And did I mention there are regular junk tems, and shiny junk items? Yeah. And when you use the Sell All Junk button at stores, the UI is hell-bent on selling the shiny ones too, even after you specifically flag them as not junk.\n\nItem management in Wasteland 2 is a game on its own. You can't see your character's weight capacity on the merchant screen, you can't compare weapons with the ones you have in second hand slot, and you can't compare trinkets. All the clothing items look the same in the inventory screen, so unless you want to spend additional time trying them on and seeing what they actually look like, you will just sell them, like me. Armor does nothing to change the way you look, and the merchants screen gets really laggy when there are a lot of items.\n\nThe game has its moments, but they seem very few and far between. There is one giant robot fight, well three if you count fighting the same robot model again, and then its flame-throwing cousin. Yep, no huge mutant creatures, and no big ♥♥♥ bosses for you. The combat works at the bare minimum, and may get stale pretty quick. There is little excitement to be had on that front, and 95% percent of enemies can be taken out by a single shot from an RPG-7 if you get the enemies to clump together. Imagine my dissapointment when I finally got to fight Dugan, one of the few uniques bosses, and he went down in a single rocket blast. True, you can tune up difficulty, but as far as I know it only decreases your damage and incresases enemy's. And the last thing I wanted was to have weapons which don't do the damage they have in their description. How about more enemies? Or more hp for them at the very least. Ehh.\n\nRandom encounters have all the same flavour. Fight enemies, fight enemies. I got some barbecuing cannibals once, which seemed like a unique encounter, but the excitement was gone as soon as they attacked. In the end I just raised my outdoorsman skill, and tried to skip them alltogether. Had enough of the simplistic combat in other areas.\n\nI found two different merchants braving the wastes, but they didn't even seem to re-stock. Curiously enough, one of them actually attacked me when I refused to buy anything, and it was a nice little way to spice things up. But still – Fallout 2 had it in spades and done better.\n\nThen there are...bugs. Visual bugs, dialogue bugs, and of course quest-breaking bugs. Take your pick. There are whole forum threads on how to complete the Hollywood questline. There are people who spent hours on end, saving and reloading, trying to finish up quests in the correct order just to get the quest log cleaned up. Hats off to them. Personally, I could not get to finish the quest where Heidi asks my rangers to help her take over the Bastion of Faith. Hell, I could not even talk to her anymore. Her dialogue screen went blank. No “Hello”, no nothing. At this point I just said ♥♥♥♥ it and rushed to the ending. I don't know perhaps I talked to someone I should not have.\n\nIf that's all that could be achieved with nearly 3 million dollars, I shiver to think what the game would feel like if the devs got only what they asked for - a mere 900k. The games gets patches regularly, so there's hope. But for any potential buyer, I would suggest to wait a few months (and I thought I did that...) and try it then. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine.\n\nDo I regret buying it? No. Am I planning on re-playing it? No.\n\nThe game's a good effort, and has some heart, but the brain is just not there yet. And just because it's a long-awaited sequel, it should not get a free pass.\n\nNot recommended at this patch stage.\n\n6/10","November 26, 2014","false","129.3"," 255 of 392 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","255","392","7","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nascentes/recommended/240760/","nascentes","Nascentes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nascentes/","572 products in account","Take this review with a grain of salt. If there was an option in between 'Yes' and 'No', that's what I would have chosen. Also bear in mind, at the time of writing this, I have *not* completed the game. I'm not sure I'm going to just yet until they do some serious work on it. I'm about halfway through the main story. With that said, here goes... (warning: minor spoilers throughout)\n\n-----------------------\nConclusion: 6/10 - The game feels like a beta. I'm glad it was released, but it needs some serious work. I'd hold out on buying for patches/mods. If you are really looking for something to play, the game is fun, it just lacks a large amount of polish that is necessary to make this game go from "okay" to "fantastic". Also, I hit the word limit. Definitely missed some things.\n-----------------------\n\nThe Good\n+ Storyline is interesting and easy to get caught up in.\n+ Voice acting is great. Not everything is voice acted, but where it is, it's done well.\n+ Character Customization is great. You can create your party of 4 from scratch, or use pre-made characters if you so choose. There is a large amount of build variety. However: [See associated con.]\n+ Random skill-use events. While venturing out into the Wasteland, you'll often come across various obstacles that can be passed by one of your party member skills. Ie. "My wife is sick! Please help her and I'll let you loot this stash I left in my house!", in this case, a party member with the 'Field Medic' or 'Surgeon' skill would be able to heal his wife and get access to some loot.\n+ Recruitable party members! From your starting party of 4, you can have up to I believe 3 more members of your party that are recruitable as you progress through the story. The first of which is available almost immediately when starting the game. These guys can help fill a lot of the gaps in your skill selection and provide some alleviation on skill-events and some flexibility in combat.\n+ The game is huge. A lot of content and a lot of story. Developers suggest it'll take 60-70 hours to beat. That is awesome.\n+ Random radio chatter. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. You'll be wandering around and randomly hear radio chatter about other rangers in another part of the world checking in about taking down this fugitive or saving this town, etc... There is also random radio chatter from radio stations in major towns, from psychopaths from various factions, etc... Awesome addition to the game.\n\nThe Bad\n- WEAPON JAMMING. This is absolutely my biggest complaint. I'll get weapons with a 1 or 2% chance to jam, yet they jam almost every-other encounter and cost almost an entire turn's worth of AP to unjam. Absolutely infuriating. This also goes for hit chances & skill succeed chances.\n- Weapon variation. Weapon variation in this game is pretty obnoxious. I've been using a crowbar on my melee toon since about 30min into the game and I've yet to find anything better. Going through Arizona, you find the same weapons over and over again. Even at the vendors! Protip: Make sure you level weaponsmithing on one of your toons! Or you'll find yourself making the long trek to a vendor more often than you'd like.\n- The travel system. The travel system in WL2 is just plain bad. I understand what the intent was, but it largely just made the experience frustrting. Areas are very large and in order to travel to the world-map, you need to find an exit on the map to "The Wasteland". Once in the wasteland, you have to travel across the map to your destination, regardless if you've visited it before or not. It's slow, tedious, and takes away from the immersion. I constantly find myself needing to travel to some distant point on the world map and thinking "Eh... Maybe I'll take a break and go play something else for a bit."\n- Character customization limits. If you create your custom party when you first try out this game, chances are, you'll miss a skill that limits things your party can do. There are skills associated with opening different kinds of safes, accessing a large amount of loot, getting through various doors, remaining undetected in hostile areas, you name it. There are also quest elements requiring you have specific skills. These skills are not necessary to have, but not having them when you find a vendor that will only sell to you if you can use x skill to help him out, is upsetting to say the least. Especially to those, like myself, who enjoy doing *everything*.  [See associated pro] ALSO, be sure to level perception on at least one character. If you don't, you'll end up with your whole party perma-dying due to land-mines.\n- Factions and choices are very opaque. Early on in the game you visit an area where you are assisting in getting their water system & power fixed. Afterwards, you are supposed to back a certain candidate for mayor since the previous mayor had been killed during a raider attack which you helped stop. After fixing the power/water, you exit the tunnels to find the election already underway and the "bad" candidate being elected by a landslide without you being able to do anything about it. You are treated like scum by the town & going back to your HQ everyone makes smartass comments about what a "great job" you did. Turns out, you had to do ALL of the sidequests *before* the main quests in that area, as well as a couple other arbitrary things. I was fairly frustred with this, especially seeing as how the "good" candidate was extremely happy with me for helping her out, then after the election, I was suddenly dirt. The questlines here were not very well articulated.\n- Assocated with the previous con, choices are fairly hard to differentiate. You may decide you want to go for a "good guy" playthrough as you may have done in similar games. Good luck keeping that up. There's one point where you have 3 different factions all approaching you and all giving you quests to screw the others. You have no idea which one gives decent rewards, no idea which one is actually the good guy. No idea which one you should be following so you don't get in trouble with Ranger HQ. So, you guess, you end up screwing them ALL over because of this or that reason that you were unable to control. It all gets very unorganized and tedious.\n- Random items you pick up that you aren't sure if you should hold onto or sell. No descriptions, just random. Protip: Hold onto ANYTHING white. Safe to sell gray stuff except for one type of item that you'll find out about shortly into the story.\n\n\nThe Maybe\n+/- The combat system I'd say is a maybe. I personally enjoyed it, but there are a few things that made it incredibly frustrating.\n+/- The grahpics aren't great. This isn't a complaint for me, but I am aware that this is a big thing for many people. This will likely be improved with future mods.\n+/- Honey badgers. Honey badgers everywhere. You encounter honey badgers so often in this game, it should be renamed to "Wasteland 2: Revenge of the Honey Badger". While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it breaks immersion for me. You look at the combat log and it's *filled* with stupid honey badger jokes and references that just repeat themselves over and over again for the duration of the encounter. Upon looting the corpses, you get a bunch of junk including "badger's nutsack". While this was humorous as first, the honey badgers quickly got old for me.\n+/- Upon leveling up you are required to call into central command for a "field promotion" before being able to allocate your gained skill/attribute points. While this isn't a huge deal, it gets fairly annoying after awhile. Especially with your party all leveling at different rates. You'll end up with 2 party members having leveled, calling in, then 10 minutes later another party member, then 10 minutes later, your remaining party members. I often find myself holding out until my entire party is ready to level before calling in. Not a bad thing, just a minor annoyance.","September 24, 2014","false","23.2"," 221 of 340 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","221","340","2","8"

The world itself is suitably detailed and the animations are great and more than adequate for the job. Although there are games with better graphics, Wastelands 2 is all about the gameplay which I’ll cover later in more detail.\n\nSound/Music\n\nVoice acting is great and the music fits nicely with the theme. Sound effects including weapon effects, enemies during encounters and items are again more than suitable.\n\n\n\nSo far so good but this game is £39.99 in Early Access and it seems to be okay so far .... so why would anyone pay such a large amount of money for a game that’s not yet complete?\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is where Wasteland 2 more than earns the right for such a high retail price. When you first start the game you have the choice to create your team (highly recommended) and the list of abilities that your character can develop in are great,\n\nBarter, Pistol, Shotgun, First-Aid, Heavy Weapons, Surgeon, Weapon Smithing, Toaster Repair, Melee, Blunt Weapons, Safe Cracking, Alarm Disarming and more. All of which require skill points to master that are awarded upon levelling up.\n\nCharacters can be equipped with 2 weapons, primary and a secondary (Sniper Rifle and a Pistol side arm  for example) and be fitted it with various Armour and Trinkets (Literally thousands of combinations). There are over 150 Weapons in the game and the fire-arms can also be modified with the use of weapon smithing to increase accuracy or decrease the chances of stoppages.\n\nThe Wasteland world has lots to interact with too (Objects highlighted in Green), even more points of interest to add to the immersion (Objects highlighted in Brown) and how you interact is up to you, use a lock pick to open the door or a rocket launcher the choice is always yours.\n\nThe desolate world is also filled with NPC’s and some are offering lots of information via an interesting chat system (certain words will be highlighted and added to your vocabulary to enquire about as the conversation proceeds).\n\nWasteland 2 is also full of decisions and consequences, some are small like attempting to pick a lock early on with low skill level can destroy the lock forever to much bigger decisions that will decide the fate of entire towns and NPC’s, who you decide to  save or let die is up to you but you’ll inevitably have to face the consequences later on.\n\nNow onto Enemy encounters, this is probably my favourite part as I’m a big fan of tactical combat. Once you encounter Enemies the game will switch from free roaming to turn-based where you’ll have a set number of AP (Action Points ) to use on movement, crouching, reloading, unjamming weapons, single round shots and burst fire.\n\nDifferent weapons have a different effects too, Shotguns have a wider spread to hit multiple enemies whilst Sniper Rifles will have the ability to penetrate and hit another enemy  in depth, killing two with one round and let’s not forget the animations, lots of gore and I was able to blow one guy clean in half with a Shotgun and watch him crawl around on his hands.\n\nI’ll be honest in saying that I’m only about 7/8 hours into the game so far but it’s got me hooked which is a rarity as I tend to bounce back and forth from game to game (I even annoy myself sometimes), the game is also not without bugs (the odd graphical glitch) and some of  the voice acting is still to be added but that’s Early Access for you.\n\nPros so far\n\n1 True successor to fallout 2\n\n2 Character customization\n\n3 Game altering decisions\n\n4 Great turn based combat\n\nCons so far\n\nThe usual bugs normally found in early Access\n\nConclusion\n\nFantastic game but is it worth £39.99........ If like me you loved Fallout 2 then definitely, it’s the sequel I’ve been waiting years for, luckily for me I picked it up during the Steam Sale for around £25 which I’m more than happy about, feel free to comment and I hope you enjoyed my review.\n\nScore so far\n\n9/10","June 29, 2014","true","87.1"," 122 of 183 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","122","183","0","3"

No. But the graphics transport the atmosphere in a way modern engines lack. In fact it´s not the graphics that lack, but the story and sometimes the gameplay.\n\nAnd that´s because it only gets a 9 - there is room for improvement, the combat system is well known from Fallout, the first parts, though it differs. I do miss some more tactical options, like delayed ambush or the ability to protect a weaker char. On the other hand it leaves you room for unorthodox methods of defeating an enemy.\nStill Jagged Alliance had the best combat system ever.\nSo why give it a 9?\n\nIt transports the original feeling, many of you might not have experienced, so well, i hardly can get myself away from it, even if i should - get some sleep, just take a break or make something to eat that takes more than 5 mins of preparation.\nBack when the orignal Wasteland was released i did not play RPGs, nor was my english (german here) any good.\nAnd i have to say that Wasteland and an english-german dictionary was quite advancing my knowledge, shortly after  i began reading english books.\n\nIn Wasteland 1 there were no fancy 3d graphics, no sound and surely no voice acting. If you have the digital deluxe edition, try the old one, if you haven´t experienced the DOS era, you might think, how the hell anybody could play such a game.\nWell, it was like a good book. You had to image the places you visit, only having (great) text based descriptions to fan your fantasy.\nI can still picture the inside of Cochise base.\n\nAnd there is one thing W2 does a lot better - it gives you more directions. W1 was pretty much open world, leaving one often with no clue what to do next, except from mentioning a city somehow. I do remember i had no idea how to get the visa card for the guy in... Needles, Quartz? Well he eats them, but that i needed it and how to get it....\nIn W2 you are pointed more directly in the right direction, but still you have to figure out how to solve things. I miss that a lot in modern games - as long as you can shoot stuff, you win. Quite boring.\n\nThe storytelling is great, if you take your time to read all the stuff. READ? Yes you have to read a lot and it is rewarding, though some areas have a bit too many people telling pretty much the same about the situation. Nevertheless, Wasteland 2  is a more than worthy and greatly rewarding game, that lives it´s orginial strengths inside a modern shell.\nModern? But you sais the graphics... Yep, i did.\n\nAgain, it does not take a 3d engine that requires 5 Nvidia Titans in SLI Mode to make a great game.\n\nAnd there´s the matter of time a game takes. Okay a good deal is reading, but i consider those modern games, i play through in 16 hrs. straigt still entertaining - but way to short, even if they look fantastic, but i often find myself that i don´t value the work the company put into it, just because the game ruhes me by it. W2 slows you down. And that is a good thing.\n\nI spend DAYS with the original Wasteland. I have spend DAYS with the Early Access already and thats just 50% of the game, though i replayed a bit, tested other options.\n\nWhere other games need a DLC after those 16 hrs gameplay you paid for, that will enterain you for 2 hrs at most, this game just sucks up your time and you want to do it again, just a different way next time, or just doing it better the next time.\n\nDo i recommend it? Though i cannot judge the other half, if you like a great story, with more than adequate presentation, tactical combat and some serious dark humor, i don´t think you can go past Wasteland 2 - even if it´s not a 9 for you.","September 18, 2014","true","201.7"," 107 of 160 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","107","160","0","1"

It plays and looks like a CRPG from 15 years ago and it's just great. I mean, to me Fallout 1 is undoubtedly the godfather of all RPG games. Fallout 1 was a mature, amazing game that almost everyone liked. However the inspiration for the creation of Fallout was Wasteland. Now we have Wasteland 2, which greatly honors the CRGP genre unlike the modern iterations of Fallout. If you enjoyed these types of games back in the day, you will love the gameplay and the unforgiving challenge in Wasteland 2. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604574249 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610206702","January 28","true","17.9"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","46","60","0","0"

I loved all the old Interplay games back in the day, and I thought that a modern remake of Wasteland that stayed faithful to old-school RPGs couldn't possibly go wrong.\n\nIt's a real shame that Wasteland 2 turned out to be such a slog. The 'tactical' combat is basic and repetitive, with no tactics beyond making sure you have your best weapons equipped, and focusing fire on each enemy until they are dead. This game is supposedly the spiritual successor to the early Fallouts but the combat is actually a step backwards from them. No aimed shot limb cripples, torso-shredding burst fire crits, stuns, knockdowns, or anything beyond hitting and subtracting hitpoints - headshots are available but they just take a bigger chunk of HP. There is a half-hearted cover mechanic but if you don't use it, it doesn't matter. Even when levelling up later in the game and getting better armour and weapons the combat is still the same grind.\n\nLevels are certainly sprawling, but are mostly full of monotonous fights and heavily trapped/locked boxes (that usually turn out to be full of jokey 'flavour' junk items). Fight, help locals, move plot forward a bit, travel to next area. Not necessarily a bad formula but it is the same over and over, coupled with the incredibly dull combat. Text pops up for dialogue and to describe things happening but it appears in a tiny box at the corner of the screen which can't display much of it at once - which seems bizarre when there is so much reading to be done, and very little voice acting.\n\nThe setting is interesting and the plot is well written with some genuine laughs and memorable characters to encounter. But when they come wrapped up in such an unpolished, uninspiring package with such ancient production values, it's very difficult to appreciate them.","March 5, 2015","false","18.7"," 396 of 644 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","396","644","14","14"

You march linearly through a sequence of mostly empty areas. In each area, you do the same tedious and repetitive click-and-wait, which is all minor variations on the following minigame: find box, disarm trap [wait], disarm alarm [wait], unlock lock [wait], unlock tumbler [wait]. The waiting really is excessive. If you accidentally click things in the wrong order, which is guaranteed to happen since the click-wait dance is so boring, the box blows up or the alarm goes off. When you succeed, you get some minor loot. Which you must hold on to forever, because there is only one container in the entire game that you can put things in, and the game tells you things are junk when they might be useful.\n\nSkills are all for boring skill checks like this; too few points, and you'll keep failing and waiting over and over, or have to take the long route through the area. That's too bad, since skills are your only way of interacting with the world outside combat.\n\nOccasionally an area contains a friendly NPC. I guarantee that NPC has nothing interesting to say, and don't expect deep dialogue trees with important and rewarding decisions. Even the writing is boring. Just click all the topics until they go away to update quest status. Then go to some other area, do same tedious boxes-and-combat dance, come back to turn in quest for reward. Your reward is to level up and increase the mandatory weapon and box-opening skills. These are also illusory choices, because if you put points into the wrong skills, you will just be waiting more. It turns out there's one optimal way to make a character, this is impossible to determine before you have played the game or copied the perfect recipe, and if you didn't do it, the game is even more tedious. Unlike Fallout, you can't make weird characters like a a low-intelligence talker character or a nonviolent sleazeball work out. Just restart and build the character in the combat-oriented way you are forced to do.\n\nWhat this leaves is a ton of unavoidable turn-based combat - which is decent, though simplistic; it mainly tests whether you put enough points into the right gun skills, because several of the gun skills are really not worthwhile.\n\nPlease do not buy this game unless turn-based combat is your primary interest. It's a "tactics" game. If you expect anything else, you'll be disappointed. If what you want is an RPG with choices, run away. There are no real choices. Your choices (such as they are) are morally 1-dimensional, you can't affect the politics or world in any interesting way, and it's not really possible to be bad or even strange. The only thing it is possible to be is a character which marches through the predetermined missions shooting things as intended.","January 2, 2015","false","48.7"," 132 of 206 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","132","206","3","0"

At best, it's just mediocre post-apocalyptic cRPG. At worst - it's game full of bugs, inconsistencies and bad design decisions. But for some strange reason, I couldn't stop playing it. So pick it on sale with 75% discount.\n\nPros:\n- Story you may like, especially if you're a fan of Terminator/Mad Max movies. There's enough bandits and robots to kill.\n- Most quests can be solve in more than one way. Or you can just shoot everyone.\n- Music.\n- Radio broadcasts are fun\n- Some strange magic - I couldn't stop playing, despite all flaws (and there are many flaws)\n- California - whole second part of the game is cool. Great factions, more interesting quests, etc. Unfortunately, more bugs too, and you first need to play 40h of boring Arizona. There's big chance you will never see Holywood.\n\nCons (long list):\n- Bugs, bugs, bugs - broken quests, cutscenes not diplaying correctly, messed-up scripts (leading to broken quests) and more\n- Game looks bad. Really, really bad. Fallout 2 looks better. Probably any game released last 10 years looks better. It's first game I wanted to quit while making character. And yes, I completely understand that graphic is not important.\n- Massive FPS drops.\n- Unresponsive UI - sometimes you need to click several times on button or on the ground to execute action (go somewhere, change or reload weapon etc.)\n- Tactical, turn-based battles? Forget it. In most fights (many, many fights) you just need to shoot enemies while they come to you. You can't cover (because there are no covers), head shot is not valid option (because of massive penalties) and most enemies are just chargin on you. Shadowrun offers more tactical battles that Wasteland 2. So, Wasteland 2 is not Divinity: Original Sin, XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2. It's not even close.\n- Pathfinding - if you want to move from one end of map to another, your team most probably will not be able to.\n- Character development - there's nothing interesting in it. With each level you get some skill points, sometimes 1 attribue points. As you need all skills (or almost all), trying to create some unique builds is not an option.

You also have a skill system for outside of combat that include things such as toaster repair (think the wasteland version of treasure chests), perception (land mines, trap/alarms on objects), lock pick and safe crack, computer repair, mechanical engineering and much more. All of your skills you will be finding yourself using quite often in your travels to do many things such as get the core out of a plastic man to performing surgery (a skill) on a kid who had his leg blown off from a land mine or fixing various broke down machines you come across for the people of the wastes to make their lives easier. There are so many places for you to use your skills that they never feel like a useless point dump when your weapon skills are high enough. With a story set in a post apocalyptic wasteland where life is cruel and unfair and just a bit radioactive (maybe more if you're not careful) that's what kind of game this is.

If you've played the Fallout games, everything here is distressingly familiar without ever improving on or deepening the experience.\n\nThe characters are all one note. The story has virtually no twists. It pretends to be an open map but is really a guided, railroaded experience. There are no random encounters bringing levity and humor, like in the Fallout games. And any emotional resonance the game has requires you to have played a 20-year-old game.\n\nI get that it's a sequel, but it shouldn't be so slavishly a sequel.\n\nThe game could have been fun and engaging, but instead it's a shiny promise that becomes a chore.","October 13, 2014","false","55.4"," 96 of 148 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","96","148","0","2"

I was a $100 backer on kickerstarter and the short of it, this game sucks.  Bugs are one thing, and there are plenty of those here which is quite disappointing.  But the real problem is that the game itself does not even look remotely close to a $3,000,000+ game.  What the did they spend that on, because it sure was not the cheapo Unity3d engine (looks just as bad as Shadowrun did with Unity3d, which just makes me mad).  The miserably bad live action intro (really?  I mean really???) maybe?  I'm guessing they pocketed it.\n\nI am looking at this game from the perspective of having played every single major isometric in the history of gaming, period.\n\nIf you were letdown by Shadowrun (which I was in a BIG way), be prepared to be let down again, just as hard.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Really bad, very primitive interface, does not seem to avail itself of any modern interface concepts.  Want a chat log?  forget about it, best write stuff down *manually* or just have photographic memory.  Quest tracker?  Forget about it, it is kind of there but is missing critical quest details, especially if you save and come back the next day you are left wondering what the heck is going on.  Moving items between people is painful.  In game help system is terrible, it is arbritrary not reviewable, fire once and then disappear forever which seems to be the basis for the entire game design.  Want to rotate your camera?  Be prepared to be fustrated by the terrible pausing mechanism (camera "hitches" on the cardinal directions) which prevents smooth rotation.  Limited options all around, the interface options you want are probably not going to be there.  Awkward, clunky, primitive, not a $3,000,000 interface!\n\n- 3d characters looks cartoony, again the same problem with Shadowrun and I will just straight up blame Unity3d and the laziness of not just doing it yourself.  In a game like this, a "serious" game, a $3,000,000 game, the last thing I think you would want is any kind of cartoon look and they blew that.\n\n- Very limited skill selection and character customization.  You load it up and you are like, huh, looks like quite a few skills there, especially in character creation (if the rest of the game had that level of customization, the game may have been worth a damn).  Then you realize it's mostly gun skills with a few tacked on skills like lockpicking and then the lol "hacking" skill that all work EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.  Click, watch an icon change color a few seconds, soon you will be bored.  And then a few hours later in the game you will be depressed by the limited amount of customization available once you start the game and next thing you know you are leveling up "submachine guns" to get 5% better chance to hit.  Joy, so fun.\n\n- Inventory / loot - terrible.  Just terrible.  You walk around mostly picking up Junk, literally called Junk.  Oh sure they spent some time putting description on the Junk, which you can one-click sell to vendors.  Whoop De Frickin Do.\n\n- The world map.  SIgh.  Why, why not just take some time to make it *cool*.  But no, it is half arsed like the rest of this game, you get to watch a spinning sheriffs star icon move across a static map.  Sometimes you find an "oasis" where absolutely nothing happens except to fill your water bottle, fabulous.  Some random encounters, with no plot attachment, no story, just random meaningless garbage.\n\n- The bugs.  I love watching NPC's run around with empty text bubbles over their head.  Right in the beginning of the game.  Right where even the most primitive QA process would have caught it.  QA.  That's an interesting word, one they obviously did not bother googling even, certainly did not spend any money on it.\n\n- I'm depressed, not because the game was super awesome, dark, apocalyptic and really drew you into the setting of the game and left you with the post apocaplytic feeling you have been craving for years after dumping money into this kickstarter project.  No just the opposite, it was so bad it draws you *out* of the game as you are appalled by the low quality that $3,000,000 can produce.  Well done there Inxile, a good notch on your belt.  Which is probably a Gucci belt that holds up your Versace pants as you get into your Mercedes AMG and laugh at the kickstarter chumps all the way to your McMasion.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Excellent job with the ambient music.  I would like to say that this extends to all the in game sounds, but not so much.  The bugs appear to make some of the sound not work to begin with, for example missing voiceovers, you will have one character with a voice over and the other character just has text and no voice, really poor form (I can't even write anything good without hitting the bad - BAD SIGN)\n\n- Good story.  Which would have been great, like really great, if it was paired with a game that was worth anything.\n\n- It is a post apocalyptic setting and you are fanboi and don't care about any of this...go for it.\n\n---\n\nFinally a special thanks to Kickstarter for making this steaming pile of garbage possible and stealing all of our money.

War never changes. Wasteland 2 is such a spiritual successor to old Fallout games that I almost expected Ron Perlman to deliver those iconic lines during the opening video. Now, let’s not forget that the original Fallout was inspired by the first Wasteland game. And now, in turn, a Wasteland game is inspired by the first 2 Fallout games – and as such, should be a treat for all those Nuke Cola loving, bottlecap collecting vault-dwellers out there.\n\n\nIt’s been more than 2 years since Wasteland 2 campaign on Kickstarter was successfully funded – and after more than a few delays, a full version is finally available – but is it polished? Well, yes and no. While the reports of bugs are everywhere on the interwebs, in my 10+ hours of playing I encountered only one game-restarting bug when my party just refused to move from the spot. A quick restart solved the problem, but such bugs should not happen in a game that was delayed for so long and live tested with the huge community of early access players.\n\nI won’t spoil the story so far, but the main premise is this – after the politicians “pushed the button”, the survivors of the nuclear wasteland are living in small interconnected communities, looked after by “Desert Rangers”, a self-made police of the apocalypse. You are one of them.\n\nThe choices you make in the game will affect the story, just like in any good RPG. For instance, near the beginning of the game, while you are patrolling the desert you get 2 distress calls at the same time – one from a farm where mutated plants and animals started wreaking havok, and one from a town being attacked by raiders. You can’t save both – I helped the town attacked by raiders, and when I managed to got to the other town, it was completely destroyed and overrun with mutant zombie plant people. Yup, enemies in Wasteland 2 are awesome.\n\nAnyway, my choosing to ignore the first one while helping the other had a consequence – mutated plants were now spreading across the wasteland, so now you encountered zombie plant hordes on the map, solving additional quests that included ridding the affected villages of them and treating the water supply with the serum to stop them from spreading further.\n\nThis is definitely a game that just has to be played more than once – and I love that.\n\nOne more thing I loved about Wasteland 2 is the sense of “yikes, I’m getting the hell out of here and coming back later with better weapons” feeling – the dangers in Wasteland are real – and some of them will require you to run with your tail between your legs.\n\nThat’s all I’m willing to write without spoiling details of the game further. Except for this one little spoiler: there’s a skill in the skill tree called “Toaster Repair”. Yes, there’s an entire skill dedicated to repairing toasters. Of course I invested points in it! :)\n\nIn short, if you loved Fallout 1 and 2, you will LOVE Wasteland 2. If that was not your cup of radioactive tea, look elsewhere, because turn-based combat and slow but steady exploring is not for everyone.\n\nMore game reviews at www.bundlehq.com","September 22, 2014","true","50.8"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","51","72","0","1"

It is horrible game that might be okay for 1980, but not for 2014.\n\n-Horrible skill system\nYeah, it is. Artifically bloated skill list in order to put some artifical replayablility in the game. If character with sniper rifle skill 10 will take assault rifle (it's like sniper rifle, but without a scope) - he won't hit anything and vice versa. Stupid? Indeed.\n\nSocial skills - pretty much the same. Instead of one skill responsible for speech, we have 3. And those skills aren't alternatives to each other in order to bring diversity in gameplay - different situations will require different skills. Why? Of course to enforce you to replay the game again and again. Let me remind you how it was in Fallouts: one skill that gave you different choices and those choices affected the result. When they wanted diversity - they were adding other skill/perk check in play. And don't even get me started on trade skills - it is all the same. We've got separate skill for cracking safes and we've got separate skill for picking locks. Why? Oh, see above.\n\nWe also got WTF skills like 'brute force'. While it will be used once or twice in game - it is still separate skill. Why devs couldn't make strength check instead of it? Well, cause we need 'diversity'. Oh, and you can't recover mines you disarm and use them later. Cause, well, this isn't Fallout, it's much much worse game.\n\nAnd stealth skills in game about SpecOPs unit? Never heard of them.\n\nAnd this isn't even deep analysis of how horrible skill system is - I can go on and on about every skill. And perks/traits like in any proper RPG these days? Nope, they don't exist\n\n-Horrible level design\nYup. Your ranger team can't climb on the roofs or hide in the trenches, unless designers intended you to do so. They convinently put the boxes in the battleield so you could use them as intended. Awesome. Levels feel like they are copypasted. Night/Day cycle? Nay.\n\n-Horrible (N)PCs\nIn Fallout 2 a lot of named NPCs followed schedule. Shops opening and clothing, NPCs eating and drinking and so on. That was 1998. In 2014 Wasteland 2 we have static NPCs that stand or patrol all day and do nothing. Not acceptable for the game that position itself as RPG. Even more - your rangers in unit never talk to each other or in any other way express their personality. Even followers don't express themselves as personalities. You can't talk to them at all.\n\n-Horrible gameplay\nBut maybe all other problems is redeemed by awesome gameplay and plot? Nope. Plot is all the same - save the world, blah, blah, blah. But it gets worse. We've got long checklists instead of proper reputation system. For example. We got 2 tribes that are going to war. In normal RPG we help each of the tribes, build the reputation and then convince them to stop fighting and bring the peace.\nWhat we have in WL2? We have chief of the tribe with checklist: "You disarmed bomb - check, saved us from raiders - check, saved child from the lake - check, found drug dealer - check, but you gave my dog beef instead of chicken and therefore the war won't end". This gameplay design is crap.\nOh, and don't forget the forced choice between settlements to save. You can't call reinforcements, you can't split your group, you have to make choice and then the game will make sure that you feel guilty about the choice you made, even if it was forced.\n\nConclusion: don't buy it and don't believe those who compares it to Fallout 2. It's much much worse. If you don't believe me - watch letslpays on youtube - they will confirm everything I said.\n\nP.S. I didn't mention outdated game graphics, because I don't think that graphics is what determines how good or bad game is.","September 21, 2014","false","23.3"," 179 of 290 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","179","290","0","3"

(Seriously though, couldn't you make some unique random encounters that are more than nameless badies, or stop spamming me with encounters when I have a 100% chance of running?)\n* Save scumming is not fun. Holy ♥♥♥♥, 50% of my time is spent save scumming. Want to open a safe? Save scum. Want to take apart a weapon and need a certain piece? Save scum. Starting a hard battle and need to hit an enemy with a hard-to-hit headshot? Save scum.\n\n"Oh but just don't save scum and accept the consequences" is the worst excuse I can think of. It is simply human nature to shoot for the best outcome; failing at a percentage based challenge we know we can avoid by save scumming just feels bad. It feels almost equally as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to waste time trying to get the desired outcome, but still feels better than getting ♥♥♥♥-all for your effort by accepting your ♥♥♥♥ luck.\n\nNew Vegas did this right: If you had the attributes to attempt a challenge it was pass fail. There was no reason to save scum,; save scumming wasn't even an option! Diablo did this right: If you exit the game, you save the game; you aren't even able to save scum! How did the devs mess up this crucial component in 2014?\n\n**Graphics and Camera**\n\nThe graphics themselves are only OK. I don't expect them to be ground-breaking on an indie game. With that said, Fallout 1/2 and Baldur's gate still stand the test of time because every background is a literal work of art. Wasteland 2 simply looks, well, OK.\n\nThe real issue is that the 3D camera mechanism SUCKS. The compass is constantly off in some unexpected orientation, things are often hidden from view, and the map system is painful at best. The landscape is so bland and monotonous that you can't tell where you are from simply looking around. Even after 40+ hours of game time I still get lost unless constantly looking at the map and re-orienting the compass. Even Baldur's gate, a game made in the late 90's, had user-placable map-markers, and BG 2 had pre-placed markers on top of that so you could tell where the ♥♥♥♥ you were.\n\nOn top of the confusing camera and map, there is almost NO quick travel. Why do I have to walk across the entire prison map or Ranger Citadel to get in and out!? How does that enhance my experience? How is that enjoyable? It certainly doesn't make the game any harder, it just wastes more of our time.\n\n**Combat**\n\nCombat is OK; there is some element of strategy, and action point management is mildly interesting. That said . . it could really use more variety. Games like Diablo and the BG series had so much variety with spells and skills. Fallout 3 and New Vegas had the VATS system, stealth, and live combat. Wasteland 2 is just a throwback to Fallout 1/2, which is fine on it's own, but 15+ years later they couldn't think of anything new?\n\nOn top of this, the lack of pause and coordination before a fight is maddening. In baldur's gate you could issue tasks to each member of your party to do unique and interesting actions . . you know . . LIKE A REAL AMBUSH!? In wasteland 2, all you can do is shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of one person. Hell, even fallout 1 and 2 let you go into VATS mode!\n\nWhen I win a fight in Wasteland 2, I don't feel very GOOD about it. There simply isn't enough strategy to actually make much of a difference in a fight. The real decider of outcome seems to rely on your weapons, and the enemies decisions. If anything, I feel like I should go grind for experience to have a better chance, and that just makes me sad about wasting more time to progress in the game.\n\n**The Attribute System**\n\nFargo talked all about making characters with specialties but absolutely failed. Getting by with a character who has under 8 intelligence is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you miss so many skill-based opportunities. None of the other attributes influence your skills, so they are all a depressing mix of combat-stats. Charisma only needs to be high enough to pick up companions, and you're left ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if you put it too low to include one. It all just feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ min-maxing formula: "At least 8 int, at least X charisma for these party members, and whatever mix gets the best AP for the rest of the stats while retaining a reasonable combat initiative. All this tailored to the weapon (higher CI for close-range weapons)".\n\nBecause the stats do not influence skills, they all do practically the same thing. Nobody is actually specialized because making a character with too low of AP or combat initiative makes them near useless. Anyone used to a little bit of customization in RPGs will just make everyone a bland average that optimizes as much AP as possible.\n\n**The writing/acting**\n\nGood god, I don't know if it is the writing or the actors, but this ♥♥♥♥ is cringe-worthy the whole way through. From the insanely clean live-actors (really? No dirt on a DESERT ranger?) to the how-in-the-♥♥♥♥-am-I-supposed-to-suspend-my-disbelief voice acting, it is just painful. Did anyone actually enjoy the live-action video? Couldn't that money have been spent better elsewhere? Does Vargas talk like any real person you've ever heard?\n\nAnd finally . .\n\n**Side Quests**\n\nRails nomad is the only place in all of Arizona that is full of quests you don't need to do to finish the game. All other standalone areas either have only a handful of trivial sidequests. The main areas themselves have many trivial side quests . . but none have any *substance*. The nuke silo is about the only substantial sidequest I can think of, and even that is pretty damn trivial in length. Compare to things like Fallouts 1 - New Vegas or BG, where there are side-quests spanning multiple areas, and MANY areas at least as intricate as Rails Nomad. All the side quests in Wasteland 2 just feel like shallow time-sinks.","April 6, 2015","false","45.0"," 383 of 642 people (60%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","60","383","642","37","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/240760/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","There have been a lot of high profile Kickstarter projects as of late, and few have been larger than Wasteland 2, the project that first showed up on the crowd funding platform back in 2012. RPG fans have been keeping an eye on the title for a long time and, after a lengthy period in early access and a few delays, it finally arrived in September 2014. It’s very faithful to its roots and it provides a lot of the complexity that fans of this genre have been hungering for. This challenging and addictive epic should hit the spot for old-school gamers looking for a party-based RPG fix.The game is a slow starter and it takes at least several hours to sink its addictive hooks into you, but it is an overall success, despite its ugliness and some blunders with the interface.\n\nAs a sequel to the 1988 classic Wasteland, Wasteland 2 stays very faithful to its roots and picks up about a generation after the events of the first game. It takes place in what used to be Arizona, which has been cut off from the rest of the world by deadly radiation. Your party of four is part of the Desert Rangers, a group of enforcers sworn to protect the innocent in this futuristic wild west.\n\nAs a post-apocalyptic game, Wasteland 2 contains just about all of the staples of the genre. It has mutant plants, mutant beasts, an assortment of guns, lawlessness, raiders, small settlements separated by vast empty space, survivalism, and radiation. It even has a de facto currency (“scrap” in this case), and just about every other feature that you may have already experienced if you have consumed the glut of post-apocalyptic fiction that is available today in games, TV, and movies. And, herein lies arguably the biggest problem with the game – its setting is stale and it does nothing to provide it with a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe somewhat overused setting shouldn’t be taken as an indictment of the game’s writing, though, which is very good.  The game has a ton of dialog, lengthy dialog trees, many memorable characters, and a lot of well written lines. You can skip through them if you want, but if you do you would be missing a critical part of the Wasteland 2 experience. The game sprinkles in a healthy dose of dark humor, and there are multiple laugh-out-loud moments. Much of this humor stems from the game’s basis as “1980s retro-future”.\n\nWasteland 2 immediately drops you into the thick of a mystery and asks your green recruits to head out and solve the murder of a fellow Ranger who was trying to set up radio transceivers in the area. Controlling them will be immediately familiar to anyone who has played any nineties CRPG, and helpful tips will guide you through the initial orientation. Moving your party around an area is as simple as selecting them and clicking the desired destination, but zipping around towns is not recommended as you will miss out on a huge amount of information.\n\nPop culture references are littered throughout the game, both relevant and obscure, and range from smirkworthy to hilarious. The breadth of coverage is extraordinary, running the gamut from Blade Runner to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, via The A-Team. Ever want to see junkie barflies sing the theme tune to Cheers? You've come to the right place. The writers have obviously had fun building Wasteland's world and exploration is thoroughly rewarded, not just with enjoyable throwaway lines but often with useful items for the inquisitive.\n\nThe story is broken up by the excellent turn-based combat system which will be familiar to Fallout fans. Combatants are queued up and assigned a number of Action Points (AP) to utilise. These are consumed by movement, attacking, reloading, and other actions such as crouching or preparing to ambush assailants which stray into range. When your AP are used up, the turn moves to the next attacker in the queue. You can store a small number of AP to use on your next turn and may benefit from Luck which can grant you extra AP or critical hits.\n\nBattles usually take place in areas which are strewn with objects to take cover behind or destructible items such as fuel cans to aim at, which adds more strategy to proceedings. Similarly, planning for encounters is essential to success - charging in gung-ho will get you mown down, especially if your gun jams. Instead, remembering to reload after battles, taking higher ground where possible and utilising the best weapons for the job are key. Sniper rifles are as useless up close as handguns are from a distance, so giving your team a combination of arms alongside hand-thrown munitions will generally give you the best chance of survival.\n\nCombat is genuinely fraught, and your team can become afflicted with unconsciousness, bleeding or more serious negative status modifiers which tick down to imminent death. You’re able to inflict these on the enemy of course, but if your medic is out of reach of the party, or worse, momentarily taken out, the tension can be unbearable. Even the new recruits to your team - amongst them a washed-up hobo and a diehard mercenary - have their own ideas during battle, and can often take fights into their own hands and throw your carefully managed plans into disarray.\n\nThe inventory system is laid out well, although the distinction between useful goods and junk which can be immediately sold is not as clear as it could be. The balance between available goods and the amount of scrap you have for sale is reflective of the overall setting; ammunition is scarce and you’ll need to make each bullet count. Caches of goods can be found in safes, crates and on the bodies of your assailants, but you’ll want to ensure that any traps are dealt with beforehand.\n\nIf the game falls down somewhat, it’s in its aesthetic. It’s far from the prettiest adventure you’ll play through and the browns, yellows and greys of the post-nuclear landscape are not particularly easy on the eye. That said, the areas you’ll visit are clearly distinguishable. Whether a lush, overgrown agricultural centre or the dingy tunnels of a water treatment plant, the variety of locations is impressive and the game gets by more on the personality of the characters within the world than the actual dwellings they inhabit.\n\nThe situations you’re thrown into and the decisions which Wasteland 2 forces you to make are what elevates the game beyond standard CRPG fare. The humour is as black as it comes and the gory dismemberment of your foes by shotgun and plasma rifle is easily matched by the disturbing encounters you’ll have with some of the world’s inhabitants. Early on, you’re given the choice of saving one of two key facilities. Choosing isn’t easy and the game will make it abundantly clear to you that your actions have damned the population of the location you neglected, in quite disturbing tones. Similarly, for many of the quests you’ll be handed, the “right” decision isn’t always the correct one and the repercussions of your actions will be felt further on in the game when you least expect it. The most enjoyable aspect of it all is that there is no set path.\n\nWasteland 2, for the most part, provides everything that its Kickstarter backers and fans of the genre were looking for. It has genuine role-playing, a lot of exploration, solid tactical combat, and a long and satisfying campaign. The game’s ugly graphics are the result of budget-related tradeoffs that RPG fans will probably find perfectly acceptable. Its unimaginative fiction and interface issues may be harder to swallow. These issues do keep the game from achieving true greatness as an RPG, but Wasteland 2 is still a very strong entry into the genre.","March 20","true","120.8"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","33","43","0","0"

I *really* wanted to like this game, and there are things I do like about this game, but unfortunately they are overshadowed by several design decisiosn that I feel are completely game breaking, decisions that ultimately left me feeling nothing but disappointment.\n\nTo get this out of the way first, yes, there were a *lot* of bugs, from graphics not lining up properly, to strange problems with the names of clothing, to crashes to desktop on load, to a horrific problem in Ranger Citadel where attempts to load the game in Ranger Citadel would leave me with a completely crippled interface and the feeling that I had somehow broken the game so much that it would never recover. To be clear, while these were annoyances (yes, even the Ranger Citadel bug for which I eventually found a work-around), none of them were bad enough to actually make me dislike the game.\n\nAlso, to get THIS out of the way, I agree that the visual style could have used some work, and the audio definitely left something to be desired, especially the background noises which, in the Ag Center, nearly had me tearing my hair out at one point. But, again, none of this actually made me dislike the game.\n\nInstead, up to a point I liked the game *in spite* of these problems. I liked the combat system. Sure it was relatively light on tactics if I wanted to just plough through encounters, but if I was smart, I could end encounters in one or two rounds. I liked the weapon and armor system well enough. They were definitely servicable, and modding weapons was kind of fun. I liked character customization well enough. The perks and quirks were a nice addition. I also liked some of the rebalancing, and felt like my characters in the DC were better able to handle themselves in a variety of situations than my original Wasteland 2 characters. I liked the plot for a while. I saved Highpool on my original Wasteland 2 playthrough, I saved Ag Center on my DC playthrough, and I liked them both. I liked the Rail Nomads, and the little hidden surprises scattered around the wasteland, including the random encounters. I especially felt good about the number of options I seemed to have for resolving a number of the situations I ran across. It felt good. It felt right. I was pretty happy.\n\nThen I went to prison, and everything went to hell. Suddenly all my options went away. Without spoiling anything, the prison area presents you with little in terms of choices, and it is frustrating. Especially in the DC, I got to the prison with characters that had a lot of options available to them, and yet at the prison they were largely unusable. Further, the logic that the game presented behind *why* I had no options just did not follow. What's worse, the outcome at the prison seems to be the same no matter what you do there. I've searched for an explanation online, only to discover various apologists saying that the development team was trying to hammer home the idea that the wasteland is really terrible. The problem with this argument, of course, is that you do not have to take away player agency to get this point across, and yet this is what we are left with. Confusingly, in earlier versions of this game those choices did exist at the prison, and there seems to be no good explanation as to why they were taken out.\n\nAnd, unfortunately this is where I had to stop playing both versions of this game. This is when it stopped feeling like a role playing game, and started feeling like a visual novel with some cosmetic combat, and not a particularly interesting or engagine one at that. Is it unfair to judge the entire game based on my experience? Maybe. But I have tried to get back the feeling I had of playing a role playing game, the one that the game still managed to engender early on in my playthroughs, but the immersion has apparently been broken irreparably.\n\nMaybe if I hadn't seen the setting half a dozen times in other games, or if the plot were more unique and engaging, or the gameplay more interesting, or the game less frustratingly buggy, or the graphics more beautiful or the audio less . . . horrific . . . Maybe if these things had been the case it would have carried me through this immersion-breaking area and onward towards the end of the game. And maybe I will still be inspired to play through the rest of the game, experiencing it in its entirety and I will change my tune. But every time I try to play again, I am presented with the fact that my choices in the Prison area will have no impact on the game, not even any HOPE of impact, and then despair sets in and I cannot continue. Not despair over the setting or the plot. Not despair over the fates of the individuals in the Prison area who are doomed because the wasteland is a horrible place. No, my despair is over the poor design decision. I *know* that it could have been a better game, that they could have confronted us with an unforgiving area that showed us how brutal the wasteland can be without taking away our options/choices/agency. But they did not, and so I cannot recommend this game.","October 25, 2015","false","40.7"," 68 of 105 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","68","105","0","3"

The choices in the game, at least at the beginning, are basically moot. IE: Choose food or water. Whatever you choose, prepare to hear what an idiot you are from everyone in the game constantly.\n\nAlso, after playing the first mission twice and experiencing both sides of the quest, I found that one side is monumentally more developed than the other.

Anyway, over the course of the development my opinion on Wasteland 2 has changed considerably.  Like a few others, initially I wasn't too happy with the progress and the money, but over time and updates ive grown to accept it.  It is a promising game, that I hope will resurface the Brian Fargo legacy, as it is an interesting setting for a video game.  Being a fan of fallout, I jumped to this game shortly after the early access was announced.  However recently there have been a number of large updates, most of which render saves useless, which is understandable.  I won't be playing it though until the stream of updates and patches come to a halt, as I am eager to see the finished product.\n\nIf you are considering this game, I'd say go for it.  You will have to be patient, as Rome wasn't built in a day, and post-apocalyptic Arizona wasn't nuked in a....well you get the idea.  It will take time, but i'm sure the hardworking developers are putting a great deal of effort into it.  Combining the X-Com and Fallout genres, this might be the game for your summer.\n\nAs far as recommendations on what to do with it, i'd like to see an improvement on all aspects of combat, like guns jamming, limbs being torn after you do an overkill.  One thing I would love to see is a more basic version of the Sniper Elite killcam, with bullet time.  Im not sure if that would work, but definatly might be a nice reward to snipers in game.\n\nAnyway, rant over, buy the game, enjoy the summer, aaaaaaannnnddd im done :D.","December 21, 2013","true","125.9"," 86 of 138 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","86","138","0","3"

Dude's place was stacked, every wall covered with game posters, every shelf packed full of memorabilia--dude even had a collection of vintage arcade cabinets. We had a fun little conversation and after I left that town I didn't think of it again.\n\nA few weeks later I'm out dicking off in some obscure corner of the in-game map, wandering around looking for an oasis to refill my canteens when I stumble upon a little easter egg: the buried literal truckloads of unsold 1980s ET atari cartidges. There were a ♥♥♥♥-load of them, way more than we could carry in our packs. Then it ocurred to me: you know who I bet would be into all of these cartridges? Video game collector guy.\n\nSo we load up with as many cartridges we can carry and backtrack all the way to that town. Now, we exhausted all the quests in that town, met with all the dudes and solved all their weird problems; we had no real reason to return. The game gave me no indication that this dude would be interested in these ET cartridges. No quest compasses, no journal entries, nothing. But lo and behold collector dude loses his ♥♥♥♥ with excitement over the ET cartridges. It was like we brought him the holy grail. We got experience and rewards for doing it. And this was something that we easily could have missed, something I easily wouldn't have even thought of doing. But the game knew.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/recommended/240760/","kozzy420","kozzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/","478 products in account","One of the first rpg's I ever played was Wasteland 1 as a youngster (Either first or second). I have great memories from it, at the time it was something very new and different. Years past by and when I was a bit old Fallout 1 came out, while not the same it was great to play a game with the same "heart" as my beloved Wasteland 1. Then came Fallout 2 which was even better and Fallout Tactics which was alot of fun to. Years later Bethesda does a new "next gen" fallout game with fallout 3, which while good for the mainstream and new players to the series, to vets it just wasn't the game we had hoped it would be. It didn't have that fallout (or wasteland) feel to it, the story was crap, most the characters extremely dull and overall a game that just realy felt like Oblivion with guns (as annoying as that saying was to me before fallout 3 came out, it did ring true for me after fallout 3 came out and I beat it).\n\nThankfully Obsidian came to save the day and released the wonderful Fallout New Vegas. I was excited by this, Obsidian has alot of old Black Isle devs (guys who made fallout 2) and sure enough the showed Bethesda how to do a proper fallout game with there engine. A bunch of factions helped, Obsidians wonderful writing for the story helped, the dialogue was well done, interesting characters, great voice work (John Goodman? Hell yes), it felt ALOT more like the early fallout games (it just had that fallout feeling, something fallout 3 just couldn't nail)..\n\nAfter all that we have Brian Fargo bringing his talents to Kickstarter and getting Wasteland 2 kickstarted. What we have here is a wonderfully crafted game, jam packed with content, Wonderful writing (characters, story and dialogue), tough choices that matter (best since Alpha Protocol and New Vegas decisions imo), great atmosphere, fun gameplay, Controls are good and a great job of balance (especially in the skills and character builds you can do). For new comers asking "What is this game like? I never played wasteland or Fallout1/2!". Well it has a bit of Wasteland 1, a bit of fallout 1/2 and a bit of xcom all mixed together. The turn based combat is a joy to play and doesn't get boring as each battle can be different then the last.\n\nYou're choices actually matter in this game, you might make a decision and not think about it, only to have it come down on you later as it shows the consequences of you're choice. The game does a wonderful job in the writing department as I said above, having Chris Avellone from Obsidian helped in this aspect and it shows. Characters you meet are interesting, the dialogue is very well done and the story keeps you very interested. The game world is harsh and unforgiving, you better make you're decisions wisely, always make sure you have ammo and medical gear and be on you're toes. You will thank me later :)\n\nThis game is deep, complex and I friggin love it. The game has come a veyr long way since it was in alpha, at first the UI they had was terrible and I was worried this was really going to take away from my enjoment of the game. Thankfully though the developers tried some new versions, listened to fans and in the end made the UI a ton better. Alot of missions have multiple ways of doing them, you will find yourself either playing the game 2-3 times or saving the game and seeing how different decisions or actions effect the game and the world around you later on. Sometimes I find I have made the right decision at first and then hours later you might hear of bad things that happend because of what you picked.\n\nThe game is not perfect, there is a few bugs, I wish there was more visual customization for characters and the graphics are not the best, but the good far outweighs the bad in this  new modern crpg. If you are looking for a new rpg that has hundreds of hours of gameplay, great replay value, wonderful writing, nice atmosphere and great gameplay give this game a go ASAP. You can really tell that this game was crafted with love, no publisher telling them to get it out early or telling them what to add to make it more popular. This Brian Fargo and his team at there best and this is a testament to old school rpgs and doing kickstarter/early access the right way.\n\nAfter spending 100+ hours on this game (and plants to play atleast another 100-200 ours), I can say it was well worth the wait, it is one of the years best games and that I am very excited to see what InXile comes with next for there new Torment game. If it is as good as Wasteland 2 we are in for another treat and another resurection of a charished old school rpg. 26 years after I first fell in love with Wastelands charm we get Wasteland 2 and Inxile sure did deliver, this game rocks boys and girls. There are a few things I wish where in the game and a few negatives but 95% of this game is a masterpeice I must say. As someone who has been playing rpgs for 25+ years, this is just what I wanted from a Wasteland sequel, good writing, fun gameplay, interesting characters, tough choices and tons of content. In a day and age where old game series get new reboots and games totally different from the original games, it is a breath of fresh air to have a sequel to an old game be JUST what the fans of the original want.","September 29, 2014","true","170.0"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","35","49","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doraaregames/recommended/240760/","doraaregames","Dora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doraaregames/","357 products in account","I really wish instead of a yes or a no we could choose "Eeeeehhh" when it comes to whether to recommend a game, because that's basically how I feel about Wasteland 2. While the story is interesting and the character creation is deep, the combat is basically broken. Your party members will miss most of their attacks regardless of what their to-hit-chance is, and I literally just spent two and a half rounds watching every single character I had miss every single attack over and over, and each of them had a percentage chance to hit their enemy higher than seventy. This isn't unusual, and the frustrating thing is your enemies typically have no such issues, and always have greater AP than you do, so when you're frequently facing off against multiple enemies, you're basically just watching your party take piles of damage. It got so bad that at a certain quest location, I had to leave the area to purchase more supplies because my party had no way of healing itself, and the NPC who was with us called us cowards and left the group, and now I have no way to complete the current questline without going and grinding up levels so I can sink points into the required skills she had to pass obstacles.\n\nIt's not about challenge, it's about a lack of balance in the to-hit numbers generator. When my characters can succeed every single time cracking a safe or defusing a bomb with less than a 30% chance to do so, but they can't hit something standing right in front of them three times in a row with a 76% chance to land a blow, there's something broken. Similarly, though this is more an issue in the player's favour, early Raider loot is sort of ridiculous. If you wander around outside the Ranger HQ and grind levels there, after one level you should have no difficulty slaughtering the raiders that pop up as random encounters with ease. Not only do they give a solid chunk of EXP each time you win, but they drop PILES of expensive healing items and ammunition, sometimes multiple stacks of them, and everything else they drop can be sold for a ton of cash. The machetes, for instance, go for $42, and while not every Raider will have one, they still drop frequently enough that you can simply farm them for cash and equipment until you have stacks and stacks of healing items and armor and ammunition.\n\nThe other complaint I'd offer is that the setting and world doesn't feel very apocalypse-y. Yeah, it's all sand-blasted, but water seems to be plentiful, people are growing food, and the atmosphere fails to give a sense of tension and danger. This is largely due to the fact that travel simply happens on a map, and the random encounters take place in the exact same little mini areas each time (down to the placement of objects), so the world seems very small and empty rather than giving you an idea of scope and the consequences of the end of the world. It feels less like an RPG and more like a linear turn-based strategy game... there's no real reason to explore the world map, and there's nothing to do unless you continue the main quest, which you don't really get any input in. In all honesty, I likely would have been a lot less harsh on this game as a whole if the accuracy issue hadn't soured me towards it, and if that were patched I'd recommend it a lot more. It has the potential to be a rock-solid, challenging, deep strategy game, but as it stands, it feels like it needs more tweaking under the hood.","September 22, 2014","false","40.7"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","0"

That said, I am sure you have read that multiple times now through the various posts.  So, where to start?\n\nStraight up, this game will not be for everyone.  No, that does not mean it is a bad game.  Far from it, honestly.   I bought the deluxe edition on a whim.  Wanted to try something new.  I saw it was beta, so I started playing with that mindset.  That, so far, is the biggest thing.  It is not a complete game, so some things do not work, or work as expected.  Now, keeping that in mind, if you get this game, the end product in my opinion, will be phenomenal!\n\nI am playing on max settings, looks and runs smooth, no issues.  I DO NOT have a top of the line machine.  Voices thus far are good, dialogue is great.  Combat mechanics are good.  Story so far seems great as well.\n\nTo make this easier, if you take the time to read this, I will break it down.  Again, keep in mind this is a BETA.  Not a beta you may be used to, more like end of the line alpha.  Point being, a WORK IN PROGRESS.\n\nPROS:\n--Character customization and looks in game.\n--Story is great thus far.\n--Combat will be great once game is complete.\n--Graphics / audio / and interface thus far are all great.\n--Gameplay is sweet.  I said it may not be for everyone because combat is tactical / turn.  So, think back old school with X-Com.  I love that part of it, personal opinion.\n--Combat animations / effects are sweet.\n--Choice and consequence are a part of this game.  You save someone from drowning, his parents offer him to you as an added party member if you want.  Plenty of characters to change up the party.\n--Different skills are used for different things.  Obviously, ha ha.  Those chances to use the skills on a frequent basis are not persistent in other games.  There are a lot of opportunity to use each skill you have in your party.  I like that.\n--A TON of interactions within the world.  Be it digging stuff up, repairing gadgets, even down to repairing toasters, ha ha!  (definitely have someone in your party that can repair them, because you never know what's stored in one!)\n--Completed game will hands down be great.\n\nCONS:\n--Loading a save will often change the portrait of your character(s) if they are created from scratch.  A minor annoyance, unless you get into combat, then you have to go by name.  Or, if you made a guy and your portrait is now a gal.\n--Combat, sometimes, can be a bit.. Interesting.  You have a sniper, that has 0.0% chance of hitting a target.  That same target now moves behind cover, and you now have an 80.00% chance to hit.\n--Combat again, some enemies have ridiculous move / attacks.  They will move across the screen, attack you twice, then move again... BETA, remember.  It will frustrate / annoy you though, ha ha.\n--Make sure you get a dedicated surgeon / healer.  I roamed around for a bit trying to find someone that could heal my wounds, to no avail.\n--There are times when walking around on the world map you are accosted by bandits, raiders, whatever, only to enter combat (if you choose) and find everything dead.  Good for the free loot, bad because you never know what will really happen!\n--The game crashes from time to time AFTER combat is completed.\n--Some game choices have to be made on the spot, you do not have a lot of time to fart around and trying to figure the puzzle out.  You take your time, (drowning boy for example,) he will die.  Some people may not like that part.\n--With no tutorial yet, character creation can be.. difficult.\n--Finally;  some characters you may spec for conversation bonus dialogues, sale prices, et-cetera.  Once you enter dialogue, there is no way to change who is talking, so in cities, towns, you want to lead the party with the talker if that is your thing.\n\nAgain, it is a beta.  So far, overall, great.  Most of the cons I have listed will be fixed (I assume / hope) with end product.  If you can look over those things for now, you will not be disappointed.  ESPECIALLY if you like RPG, tactical combat, decision making, and crafting.\n\nI do not typically write reviews, but I wanted to get one out there since there are a lot of negative reviews.\n\nA hidden jewel for a game, even in beta.  I give my nod of approval.","January 29, 2014","true","9.2"," 65 of 102 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","65","102","0","0"

Not perfect, but damn good.  If you can't wait till the August release date you better go ahead and get it.\n\nI decided to add to my edit today.  As I am clearly a fanboy and need to offer up some of the negatives.  The AI still aren't the most diverse group of people.  The different factions all wear the same gear.  Sometimes they make really strange decisions.  Mostly they are balanced, sometimes WAY stronger than you expected.\n\nWhen you put on that awesome new combat armor you just purchased it seems to fit under your leather jacket.\n\nThe character creation system lacks some depth that I came to love with the SPECIAL system.

Imagine something similar to the original Fallout games, but with an interface more akin to the new X-Com. You can rotate the camera and zoom-in and out. Plus, you create four characters rather than control a single hero. The skill system, quest structure, and NPC selection add greatly to the replay value.\n\nThere's also some fun writing and scenarios you'll find yourself in. It's definitely a bit gritty, but not without some humor of the dark, grossout, and lewd varieties.\n\nIt's not without faults, but in my opinion it's a great tribute to the original Wasteland and a great game on its own.","October 26, 2014","true","63.9"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","31","43","0","0"

If you explore thoroughly and do everything you can, the game will take at least 70 hours. And if you enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2 then you will almost assuredly enjoy this.\n\nBut the real reason to play this, and something I don't see discussed much for some reason, are the choices you get to make throughout the game. I've played a lot of games where you are given quests and different ways to resolve them, but this game blows all of them out of the water. Almost all main quests and most side quests have 2, sometimes even 3, different ways to resolve them. And it isn't just a simple resolution with a different reward, characters and sometimes places change based on your decisions. Almost right at the beginning of the game you are given the choice to save one of two towns (or neither) and both places have their own unique recruitable NPC and quests. Not to mention the ever present option of "kill everyone you meet".\n\nIn fact, there are unique dialogues put into the game if you choose to kill indiscriminately. For fun I decided to save my game then kill everyone in the mayor's office of the town I saved. Afterwards some anonymous citizen radios Ranger Citadel and snitched on me, so Vargas radios me asking if it's true and I'm given a choice of admitting it or playing dumb. If you play dumb he tells you to go check it out, if you admit it he asks you why and then gives you a free pass this time. I'm pretty sure if I had continued my murdering ways Vargas would send after me the elite squad I met at RC who handle "problem rangers". I reloaded though.\n\nIt's not uncommon to go to a town and there be some kind of conflict going on. You pretty much always have the option of siding with one side or the other (or neither), but more than that there are usually different ways to solve it for either side. If you have high enough speech skills you can usually make it easier and/or more diplomatic, or do what the leader wants you to do (like eliminate the opposition instead of finding peace). Although, since this is the wasteland, few people are entirely "good". Almost everyone is bad in their own way, though not always entirely malicious. Sometimes the bad stuff they do is to try to help others, so is bringing them down truly the best choice for that town in the long term?\n\nWhat really impresses me is not just the incredible amount of quests and their multiple ways to solve them, but all the little touches made based on your choice. In one town there was a guy about to be executed and I had noticed a pre-dug grave for him. After I managed to free him I decided to go back and re-examine the grave, and there was new text saying someone had taken a dump on the gravestone. I love it.\n\nYes there are some bugs, including quest-breaking ones. But when you understand the mind-boggling amount of connectivity everything has based on quests and the many different ways to do them, then I think you can forgive the relatively few bugs there are currently in the game. And don't worry, the devs are working on fixing them!\n\nIn closing, there is an extraordinary amount of replayability in this game. If you love the ability to make choices and see those choices have a real impact on the world around you, then you simply cannot pass this game up.

Familiar places and characters, tons of references to the original game and even plot continues W1 storyline almost directly. Graphics is functional and personally I like the style and design. Combat is pretty fun and satisfying, death animations are gorgeous, but most of the time it is very straightforward and tactical depth is lacking. I think it is not a huge problem because it is  not a pack of "clear the map"  missions unlike Fallout Tactics (don't get any ideas, I love it) but true big CRPG with choices and consequences and you don't need to fight anything on your way. And there is so much things to do here! So many non-obvious ways to deal with problems, that you hardly see 65% of the game content in one playthrough. Beating this game once took me about 80 hours.

And no, I'm not talking about the game being difficult.\n\nI'm talking about:\nA skill system which is broken\nAttributes which mean nothing\nclunky game mechanics\nthe AI taking multiple turns in a row with unlimited SP and near 100% hit rate\nstatistics shattering weapon jams and misses\nutterly no roleplaying experience\na tactical game where you only need one tactic\nand the list goes on.\n\nIn fact here's one example, you have an assault rifle, there's no one around you, your enemy is in the "sweet spot" as in not too close, not too far. Your gauge shows that you have a 70% chance to hit. and you miss. not just once, but 5 times in a row. or more. As I posted on another person's review in a comment: "I really think the devs need to go back to hs and take some statistics, cause the odds of missing so many shots in a row when it's 70% or more "to hit"... is beyond stupid. Think about it, a 3 in 7 chance to miss five times in a row is 3 in 16,807 (or a 0.01% chance of happening). But it happens so frequently it's more like the reverse 70% chance to miss. But then again, even the odds of missing 5 times in a row would still be 7 in 243 (or a 2.88% chance of happening).. which is still absurd. And yet the game does this for most people I've heard talking about it."\n\nThis is a common experience. and it just keeps going. enemies almost always hit, have twice the range of your snipers (from even the beginning missions), your guns jam at least once a battle (when each gun's jam rate is 5% or less), and so on.\n\nI just about rage quit the other night because the immersion in the story is so awful it just breaks you out of the game by destroying the suspension of disbelief. You get "badass" rangers telling you that they are the team that goes in and kills other rangers, and get told stories of other rangers making tough choices and coming out on top. Then you try and do anything contrary to the story and you're done. You do one thing wrong and an entire town aggros against you. And no there's no charisma stat that calms people down, no speechcraft skill which says "slow down compadre," no kill the leader and stop the aggro, it's just one bugged out exchange where you might as well reboot to your last save (if you're lucky enough to not trust the game to make backup saves from time to time) or you kill the entire town/area and (as some have said) you cannot complete the game. I personally don't have any experience with that, as I'm only 20 something hours in, but come-on, this is ridiculous.\n\nIt's not about a complex storyline or making a game that's tough, it's sloppy game design mixed with poor story writing. And it's bad programming, on numerous occasions I've experienced a plethora of bugs including one where the camera won't pan, but for some reason I can move the sun in the sky (yeah, no joke). And the stuff that is programmed "right" is just poor. There is no choice in the game other than linear save town A and you have problems with town B for the game, or save town B and have problems with town A down the line. Then there's the AI and battles, at first it's new and fun and interesting. Then it's just a poorly designed squad tactics game where the enemies do the same thing every time and so do you. I really only employed one strategy in 20+ hours of gameplay. set up 2 short range fighters, set up 2 assault rifle fighters and 1 sniper and the rest of the game is a cake walk. It's not fun, it's repetitive.\n\nAnother problem is the "fans" who jump on any topic you make or post and immediately say it's your fault the game is bad, or that you're not reading all the text, or that you are doing combat wrong, or... blah blah blah, but the game is as I've stated above, one-dimensional, clunky, broken and worthy of ragequitting. This last bit about the fans can't be the dev's fault, but the hype about this being the game everyone wanted Fallout 3 to be, is like gasoline on a fire, it just burns hotter and less controlled. If you take an objective look at the game, you'll see the same stuff that I and many others have pointed out. At least with the story stuff I'm willing to agree to disagree, as I can see how if you don't think about the story or complete failure on the roleplaying aspect of the game then you've got yourself a repetitive one-tactic game where you make choices like a train choosing which railroad track to take, sure you can take the long way around, but the end result is the same, you're still stuck on the tracks.\n\nI really really really wanted to like this and I just can't. Maybe I'll give it another try down the road, but I've got a sour taste in my mouth right now.","September 22, 2014","false","23.7"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","34","49","0","0"

It is this element that is at the heart of all turn-based tactical games, from Silent Storm and Jagged Alliance through to the original Fallouts. Wasteland 2 throws this aspect of the genre out altogether. What is not clear is whether this was intentional, or just the result of really incredibly poor game design and a lack of knowledge of what the genre is all about. Remember, Wasteland was an RPG, not a TTB, and Wasteland 2 has not made the transition well. It's not RPG enough to be an RPG and not TTB enough to satisfy the TTB grognards.\n\nThe combat system is borked. There is no tactical complexity to the combat at all. In all real combat, the side with the initiative tends to win. In this game, initiative automatically goes to the enemy. No setting up mutually supporting arcs of fire then luring the baddies in. No, you set up your mutually supporting arcs of fire, fire a single shot, then the baddies swarm you.  You only get to try to gun them down when they're next to you. They are able to run across the map to get you.\n\nMy 'leader' toon has an assault rifle. When he fires a single shot to initiate combat, enemies (even those outside his range of fire) have the opportunity to run fifty or sixty yards and initiate hand to hand combat before he can fire a second shot. It's ludicrous to include a semi-automatic rifle in the game that fires the equivalent of once every fifteen seconds. A hundred years ago, soldiers with bolt-action rifles were firing aimed shots every two seconds. Does InXile understand how firearms work?\n\nThe probability engine is also borked. It's not uncommon to miss 5-6 60% shots in a row. This also extends to other skills such as lockpicking or safecracking. Many other people giving negative reviews have also commented on this.\n\nThe presence of indestructible objects (ie, the vines in the Ag Centre) that block progress until other goals are achieved is inexcusable, especially considering the confusing and unclear mission objective system. You literally cannot approach a mission in any way other than that deemed appropriate by the developer.\n\nThe character development process is bizarre. Your Strength stat has nothing to do with your strength-related skills. Your Charisma stat has nothing to do with your social interaction skills. You may as well put all your points into Intelligence to maximise stat points on level up and enough into Agility to maximise your action points in combat. To reiterate: no matter how rubbish your stats are, as long as your skills are high enough, most of the stats really don't matter.\n\nI completed Fallouts 1 and 2, and got as far as I could in Tactics until the bugs killed the game, and never felt as frustrated as I have with this game. The fact that I have 20 hours invested without even completing a single module says a lot about the game.\n\nThe graphics are, to my mind, no better than we saw in Fallout nearly twenty years ago.  But I could forgive that if the core gameplay was there, but it's just not. The tactical aspects are ruined by an idiotic system that ALWAYS gives the enemy the initiative. The mission log system is unclear and confusing. There are booby traps on at least a third of the items, doors and chests EVEN IF THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT.\n\nI applaud the attempt to bring Fallout-style gameplay into the present day, but this game is just a wasted opportunity. I wanted to believe, and instead I just wasted $40.\n\nWhat a tragic waste of time and money.\n\nEDIT:\n\nYou know what?\nThe only thing funnier than how bad this game is, is the number of people who keep comparing it favourably to Fallout 1/2/Tac (bearing in mind those games are 10-15 yers old).\nThe only thing more tragic than a wheelbarrow full of cute puppies on fire is the number of fanboys who cruise the negative feedback section giving 'not helpfuls' to people trying to steer unsuspecting buyers away from this piece of crap.\n\nIt's just sad.","September 27, 2014","false","16.1"," 58 of 92 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","58","92","0","1"

Its was a damn good game but with a couple of issues here and there but overall a really fun game that was essentially the closest thing to Fallout 2 since Fallout 2. (I love the original Fallouts almost as much as I love the new ones.)\n\nIm happy to say the Director's Cut version is a massive improvement over the original. With a multitude of fixes and additional content/mechanics to make the game feel fresh. Its overall the superior experience. It does still have a few bugs, a few confusing quests and overall slow pace early on in the game but despite this the game is great fun.\n\nFor those of you that dont know Wasteland 2 is the sequel to the original game from the 80's and a spiritual  sequel to Fallout 2. Its an isometric turn based post apocolyptic RPG, one of the few of its kind. You have some really in depth character customization/rpg elements and some really damn good combat. Seriosuly its great, its even better than X-COM's combat. Overall if you love Fallout, RPG's, post apocolyptic games and have some patience then Wasteland 2 Director's Cut is the game for you!\n\n(Note I have deleted my original review and updated it with this one)","October 22, 2015","true","53.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Its clear a huge amount of effort went into the artwork and world creation, so kudos to the developers for that.  But for all that work, the truth is the gameplay doesn't feel all that compelling and quickly devolves into a tedius slog.  Despite the size of the world, you really don't feel "free to explore" it, because the area you are allowed to explore is artifically constrained depending on where you are in the plot.  Once you finally gain access to a new area, there is no reason to go back to the old ones.  It all results in highly linear gameplay, rather than world exploration.  There are other ways to control the plot development, rather than walling-off the player.\n\nAdding to the tedium, about halfway through the game it gets really preach-ey.  And I mean really.   It's clear the developers have a social message they are trying to send, but it's so relentlessly beaten over the player's head that it comes off with a very self-righteous air.  I just wanted to play a game, but I felt like I was reading a never-ending steam of someone's angry Facebook rants.\n\nLots of potential, and it looks like a lot of work went into it...but I regret purchasing the game.","January 16","false","69.1"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","28","40","3","1"

The hype and the promise of a return to old school, turn-based, squad based adventure gaming in the mould of Fallout 1 and 2 was enough to have me keen to play.\n\nUltimately, having just finished the game, i have to say it was a disappointment that fell way short of my expectations and my desires. The gameplay is a regression to 20 years ago (with updated graphics). The environments look good, but they are mostly eye-candy and are not interactive at all (except for doors,chests,safes and holes in the ground).\n\nIt is as if the last 25 years of turn-based games never happened, and none of the detail and gameplay innovations from games like JABIA have been considered for this game. Worse still, the game is not even as good as Fallout 1! The combat is so old-school it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...one of the worst turn-based combat engines I have played in years. Like I said...as if nobody in the development team had even played any modern turn-based games in the last 20 years, or if they had, they had chosen not to apply any of the principles to their game.\n\nIt is barely a sandbox - with two small maps and about 6 major locations on each map. The game felt very scripted and linnear and freedom of gaming choice felt very limited. This game is not worthy of admission into the post-apocalyptic hall of fame. It is as if Fallout 1 and X-Com Enemy Unknown had an unwanted, stupid, ugly child.\n\nAll in all- NOT woth the $40 u.s.d. that I paid for it and it has left me feeling very disappointed because I wanted so very much for this one to knock it out of the park and to redeem the genre for a new generation.\n\nIt looks as if I am still waiting for a game that completely updates my favorite style of gameplay, with an intricacy of detail that modern computers make possible, and a depth of interactivity with characters that I create within a massive story that I control through the choices I make.","October 25, 2014","false","118.5"," 47 of 76 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","47","76","0","6"

I guess I can't complain too much. I am a huge fan of Fallout and Fallout 2 and it is truly a blessing someone wanted to create a game in that vein. However, there is too much that cannot be overlooked. The game looks hastily prepared. Interactions feel generic. There are countless in game glitches. Pathfinding is very difficult and that makes it hard to complete the missions without having to read clues from forums. Even when you know exactly what you are supposed to do, it is sometimes very difficult to make the NPC's progress to the next quest item or find the resolution without hunting down some obscure almost unrelated item to trigger the resolution after doing all the rudimentary work to complete the quest.\n\nI tried to find enjoyment, but after a while, the game became tedious as I had to level up a specific skill in order to complete a mission. That meant I had to wander around the wasteland searching for enemies to kill just so I could level up skills that would open my dialog choices or help me "see" things in order to trigger events. So if you are playing, make sure you level up perception, kiss ♥♥♥, smart ♥♥♥, and tough ♥♥♥ skills. If you level up combat skills and the usual lock picking, medical, hacking skills, you will not beat the game. That leaves you with very little freedom in choosing your skills, and to add insult to injury, you are only allowed to level up to level 50, therefore you cannot waste your skill allocation on something you might need in the beginning of the game like melee weapons. Energy weapons are almost useless towards the end of the game. Only level up in Assault rifles, sniper, and maybe Heavy guns.\n\nLastly the back stories were dull and uninspiring. FInding things and reading things was a treat in the predecessors. The history books and back ground journals are dull and tedious adding to an already tedious game. When the game hinted of a Wasteland 3 game, I thought oh no.","July 8, 2015","false","153.4"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","0"

With 20+ hours of gameplay so far, I'm enjoying Wasteland 2 more than I have any other RPG in years -- more than I have any other game I've gotten from Steam in a long time with the exception of Civilization releases.\n\nWasteland 2 is engaging, thought-provoking, well-written, intellectually stimulating, and even educational. Every battle is a new puzzle. No amount of playing can make the player impervious to what may come next. The writing is superb (surprise, surprise) the music is great, the graphics are beautiful -- although not a selling point -- and all in all this game is easily a 9/10 in my book, and it's not even selling at a triple-A title price (just 40 USD on release day).\n\nNegatives: people say there are bugs everywhere. I have encountered one. It was not a game killer and I expected to see more bugs than one within 48 hours of release.\n\nPeople say it is too hard. If you were born after 1990, you'll probably hate even the normal difficulty and very likely the game altogether. There's plenty of reading to do and very little hand-holding. I don't mean to be guilty of ageism, it's just that games have gotten far, far, far more user-friendly since the days of Atari and Infocom. The truth is, Wasteland 2 has 1/10th the difficulty of Wasteland, and W2 is catering to the same crowd. In short: this is a *compromise,* and InExile Ent. isn't apologizing.\n\nConclusion: if you loved the Black Isle games and are on the fence about W2, don't be. I'm hardly through my first sizeable misson and I haven't relaxed so deeply into a game in years. It's like all those comfy afternoons playing Baldur's Gate, except new and improved and back in the Wasteland I spent my 20s in.

First 4-6 hours i wondered what's so good about it, but later it was impossible for me to stop playing, so if you're having problems with the game just try to force yourself through couple of first quests. I promise you, it gets better.\n\nPros:\n+ nice and versatile story. There are several different outcomes of the main quest and each is interesting in it's own way\n+ gameplay is good. It's turn-based and mostly depends on your positioning, gear and your character's skills\n+ visuals are fine. Sure they're not stunning, it's not Crysis, but it'll do\n+ tons of cool side-quests and ways of completing them. You can go in guns blazing or take a more subtle approach(es). Each choise has it's own advantages and good sides, but it's up to you to decide what to do.\n+ interesting characters. Not all of them, of course, but mostly characters (aswell as the story) are written very good with a nice slice of humor.\n+ exploration is really rewarding. Game encourages you to go where you're not supposed to (like radiation clouds and other places, where you might find shrines or cache)\n+ lots of weapons, clothes, equipment and other stuff\n+ tons of fun easter eggs and references\n+ is generally fun to play once you get a hang of it\n\nCons:\n- sometime it feels like the game overstays it's welcome\n- some quests and their alternative ways are really not so obvious. Some people might like it that way though\n- it's really easy to screw up your character (try to pick 3-5 skills for each character and only level up those. Otherwise your char will be a mess)\n- it's slow.

In any case, if you've played any of the original isometric Fallout games, then you will be right at home playing Wasteland 2 as the locations, world map, sound track, random encounters, combat, sense of humour, and missions all hold strong comparisons. Also, interestingly, there are positive aspects of the combat that are borrowed from XCOM: Enemy Unknown as well.\n\nBut that's not to say that this is just knock off - Wasteland 2 is deeply linked to the original Wasteland in its lore and the developers have learnt from the long gap between releases and taken the best of the old and the new and combined them to create a well-designed and deeply entertaining product.\n\nSpeaking of well-designed, as much as I generally dislike what Early Access has done to Steam, this is one of the games that has clearly benefitted from the system as you can spot numerous little features that have been implimented to improve the game's basic playability and fun-factor. Things like a button to sell all your junk at once, comparisons between the weapon you want to buy and the weapon you have, a solid log book that displays your missions, a button that reveals all objects that you can interact with, and the choice to automatically distribute your loot intelligently to the people who would use it best. All these things and more save the player time, eliminate clunky inventory management or frustrating moments when you don't know where to go or what to click - issues that were all too common in the heyday of isometric games.\n\nWasteland 2 is a loving heir to the original, and exists as a well-designed gem in a genre that typically suffers from over-complexity, suffering little of the clunkiness that one might expect from what one could call a 'throwback'. Its world is real and believable, the combat is fun (even if, at times, the hit chance feels skewed) and its characters are numerous, colourful and well-acted.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who loved the original Wasteland, any of the Fallout games, or indeed anyone who likes a well-optimised RPG.","November 28, 2014","true","17.1"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","29","47","0","0"

Ugh. Unfortunately, the camera does not seem to expand far enough in any one direction, and the overall size and spacing of the terrain means you will constantly be heading into dead ends because the camera didn't let you see far enough ahead. It's not a game breaker, but is consistantly annoying.\n- Too many skill options. I understand that maybe this eventually improves replayability, but it's frustrating to make it through a couple of quests, level up a couple of times, and still be level 1 in most of the skills you've chosen for your character.\n- Controls and gameplay are annoying. I don't know of a better way to describe it then that. They are not bad, they are not game breaking, but it is constistantly a nusance to come up on an enemy unexpectedly, and all 4 of your squad members are clustered together and are immediately getting shot at.\n\nIn summary, it's not a bad game, but so much of it is frustrating and cumbersome that it becomes kind of annoying to play.

And it shows:\n\nThe new graphics are based on an innovative new rendering system that builds characters and environments using nothing but jaggies, bringing to life a rich and vibrant world of faded browns and greens. Despite the 3D graphics, the bold choice of camera angle in the game restricts your view to only a tiny rectangular area of the game world at a time, at times feeling like the top-down perspective of the 1988 release - something that should go quite well with inXile's nostalgia-based marketing. In essence, they've managed the herculean feat of combining unattractive low-budget 3D graphics with a visually uninformative, claustrophobic old-school style, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point I wanted to discuss: the interface. Now, I love games like Darklands and Dwarf Fortress not because of the sheer breadth of possibilities and amount/variety of content that they offer, but because I'm a masochistic chump who enjoys the feeling of eyestrain, befuddlement and constant annoyance. In that sense, Wasteland 2 was perfect for me as a game in that regard - as it's managed to combine the obtuse, archaic interface design of those aforesaid games with the gameplay of a straightforward and mediocre RPG. I was worried that the Director's Cut might excise this feature from the re-release, so imagine my relief when I started the game and found it nearly impossible to buy or sell items! Folks, this wasn't even something that was a problem in the original release - you can tell that they really went the distance here.\n\nBut, when you get down to it, all of that stuff is just window dressing when it comes to an RPG. The two things that really matter are the gameplay and the story. Where's Wasteland 2 stand on that? Well, the gameplay's your standard fare - you click on guys that you want your guys to shoot. There's also enemies that explode on death so that four guys with clubs isn't the most optimal party. That's the extent of the tactical gameplay.\n\nRoleplaying-wise, Wasteland 2 is very limited. Your party members are all interchangeable, and your communicative options are extremely limited as a consequence. For the most part, skills don't really factor into things beyond being used on objects to get extra loot. Your party does go around resolving conflicts and righting wrongs, and there's even a handful of world-affecting decisions you can make. It's got some interesting bits of world-building and story elements, and I feel that the story is genuinely interesting, if unexceptional - after all, as my friend Manco says, fight one megalomaniac with a messiah complex and you've fought 'em all. As an aside, you can tell how unimportant the characters are by the fact that there are only about four portraits per gender by default (and only two genders? inXile could stand to learn a thing or two about cis privilege I think) but I'm willing to excuse this because you can play as the Madoka Magica crew if you import your own portraits.\n\nAll in all, Wasteland 2 is extremely disappointing. For all the hype it's gotten, it is ugly, limp and flaccid. Out of all the more recent RPG releases, Divinity: Original Sin has funner tactical combat and Shadowrun: Dragonfall has a much better story. That said, I kind of liked it - I don't really regret backing this game, despite my disappointment, and I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. However, I still wouldn't recommend it to another human being, unless they're also the kind of weirdo that feels the need to play every isometric cRPG in existence, in which case they probably wouldn't even listen to me if I told them not to play this game.\n\nAlso, the music's pretty decent.\n\nOverall, I'd give this release an outrageously disgraceful 7/10","October 22, 2015","false","71.3"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","58","45","78","20","5"

The isometric perspective might be nostalgic, but it works so well. There are a ton of great details that make combat fun and interesting with more than enough skills and attributes to make each point assignment a tough debate.\n\nPerks are sadly missing. That really would have iced the deal. Regardless, you're getting a great script, fun old-school gameplay with some modern tweaks.\n\nIf the game has already caught your eye, you aren't going to be disappointed with a purchase.

Party based RPGs have been missing for a LONG time, those in a post-apocalytic setting for even longer. Wasteland 2 brings this forgotten genre back to live with thrilling tactical combat, great story telling and that sense of humor that made the orignal Fallouts so great in the first place.\n\nI am not sure how far in the story I am now but after doing the first set of major places (4 of them visited) I can also say that they really stuck through with their promises that choices in this game would matter. Both local and immidiatly as well as on the grand scheme of things to come. And I love the game for it.\n\nI am not really sure what some people's gripe with the combat system is because as far as I can see there is not much difference from X-Com's and Shadowrun's systems other than some rules about iniative that lead to enemies doing their turns before some of your squadmates do as well as squadmates having two action phases per round. And hey for the most part the AI acts a lot smarter than in those games, which makes overcoming forces that outnumber your squad quite the challenge. You gotta use the terrain and cover otherwise you are quickly out of means to heal your squad or even worse out of ammo.\n\nA Modding Toolkit is announced for some time after release and when it arrives I am looking forward to playing some really great mods.","September 23, 2014","true","97.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I feel the same way about computer roleplaying games - especially the kind calling itself Final Fantasy.\n\nWasteland 2 is a game that requires a ♥♥♥♥ing huge commitment - beating it took me 100 hours (more or less, I tend to be a slowbie). And that was just one playthrough where I played the game as a stereotypical do-gooder hero, exploring everything and being a helpful do-gooder with a ♥♥♥♥ed up set of character skills and a tendency to reload and find the best outcome to satisfy my sad, sad do-gooder neediness.\n\nBut god damn it, this game is worth it if you're into these kinds of timesinks. It's a mix between the old gameplay styles of Wasteland and more recently released computer roleplaying games - a lot of the mechanics of the original Wasteland are at play here, re-tooled for an experience more suited for modern gaming. What I liked the most about it was the ability to solve problems through different means without hinting too deeply at what a solution could be, letting me get creative whenever I could. Locked safe? Hit it with a grenade. Locked door? Get that sledgehammer and ♥♥♥♥ it apart. Terrified settler due to gigantic robot scorpion? Hack the mini-scorpions that it produces to distract the big scorpion while drilling .50 caliber rounds into its face. A guy begging for a CD-i? Shoot him in the face and take his video game rocket launcher to sell for Snake Squeezins. This is such a refreshing breath of fresh air in a roleplaying game, this ability to solve problems!\n\nAnd yes, it looks like something from 2003. Yes, you shouldn't need to read a little text box to figure out what's going on in the game, but what are you, scared of reading? Are you yeller about words? If I had any complaints beyond those two, I'd say the combat gets a wee bit much at times, the atmosphere and story are good but a bit flat in some places, and the thought of playing it AGAIN over another fifty hours or so is not something I'm interested at all in doing right now (but then again, I don't typically re-play video games I beat, mainly because I'm out chasing after a new experience or doing something equally wasteful with my time, like moving my eyes to read a page of things in a collection of pages bound by a spine that also is host to two covers HAVE YOU FIGURED IT OUT YET, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S?)\n\nSo yes.

The original version of this game I have only idled for 15 hours or so get the cards drop (which seemed to take forever by the way). In Director's Cut I have 210 hours, and this review is for the Director's Cut only.\n\nMaybe the best testimony I can give of Wasteland 2:Director's Cut is that it made me put in 210 hours in less than 6 weeks. Now I might have been a bit slow and thorough, but as you can tell by those hours the amount of content is huge. Maybe the first 20 hours or so I spent playing with my first crew which I then discarded, having learned enough of the mistakes I had made creating it. The rest of the time, 190 hours were divided between two complete playthroughs maybe by a ratio 100:90 respectively.\n\nIt's not a flawless game and it may be easy to disagree on various amounts of it's design decisions. Nevertheless it certainly is a worthy effort in it's genre, and as a whole it captivated me like only a few percent of all games have done. If the post-apocalyptic theme appeals to you and/or you miss the classic isometric RPGs, I think you would be potentially denying yourself one heck of a ride by not giving this one at least a shot.","April 17","true","18.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

My two favourite games are Planescape Torment and Fallout 2. I’ve completed both numerous times, however I gave up on Wasteland 2 halfway through due to a combination of boredom and frustration. Let me try to explain why.\n\nBefore the final release of the game, I was pumped. I read the whole manual, then sat down and wrote lore friendly bios for my four rookie rangers and distributed all the stats according to their role in my team. In the end I found this whole process more fun and engrossing than the actual game.\n\nBasically the game is boring. These were the main things that I found dull:\n\n•It’s filled with loot which is pretty much junk and doesn’t give you a proper reason or options to customise your character load outs.\n• Drawn out, repetitive, dumb combat. They could have learnt some lessons from X-Com here. Basically there are no tactics, there’s no cover, no use of the terrain. I ended up maxing out the Outdoorsman skill and skipping Outdoor encounters to avoid the snoozy combat and the same tiny maps I’d seen so many times before. The combat boils down to a battle of attrition. I hurt you a little, you hurt me a little. Repeat.\n• Poor level design combined with a plethora of boring fetch quests which force you to run from one end of a massive map to another.\n• Finally the choices you make don’t impact the world in a way which made me care. The only noticeable impact was that in the main base everyone was like “Why are you so big and strong and everybody likes you!” Which I generally liked. But it does feel shallow after a while. I hadn’t really appreciated how immersive and good the quests were in Fallout 3 until I played this game.\n\nIn the end I hit a bug where one of my party members got stuck in a quest and I couldn’t get him back or replace him. I think that bug has gone now, but I still feel no inclination to go back to the game.\n\nBasically I can’t recommend this game even a little. If it was free, I’d suggest that your time is too valuable to spend on it.\n\nAlso I forgot to mention. At one point you have the opportunity to free a bunch of female sex slaves from the Red Scorpion Militia and one of them is called Schnitz, which I found to be poor taste and it’s the kind of joke a kid might make. This gives you an idea of the maturity of the people that put this game together and the kind of story telling you’ll be exposed to playing it.","January 28","false","41.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","1"

Drill this to your head. Do not buy this game thinking it's Fallout. Do not PLAY this game thinking it's Fallout. Wasteland is one thing, Fallout is something completely different. Now lets begin.\n\nDo you like post-apocalyptic lite CRPGs? If you do then this is something you should definately check out. Now when I say "lite" I do really mean it. This game feels, at times, extremely shallow and simplistic in everything from interactions with the environment, quests, combat and items. Everything is simplified. Yet this still is a good and enjoyable game and worth every penny you spend to buy it.\nThe closest comparison that I can make to this game is Fallout Tactics, which in my opinion was vastly underrated and received way too much flak than it deserved, and I still rate Fallout Tactics higher than this.\nCharacter creation is based on the CLASSIC system (whereas Fallout uses SPECIAL) with just attributes and skills. No special perks or traits. You can customize your Rangers appearance, bio and so on but none of that affects your game in anyway.\nCombat is single squad, turn-based and squared grid layout playing field. Nothing too fancy, straightforward and to the point. You have different guns, bombs and heavy weapons with some different fire modes and ability to try a headshot. The cover system is similiar to the new XCOM Enemy Unknown game with the icon showing cover positions.\nQuests are typical (somewhat gliche'd) CRPG quests of fetch things, solve problems and make binary choices between factions.\nEnvironment is a bit stoic. Things you can interact with can be highlighted with a press of a key and that's about it.\nGame is full of easter eggs, dark humour and references. This was actually something that really started to annoy me. It feels like in every scene and place you visit is just riddled with them. I mean come on! Candy is nom noms but too much candy makes your stomach hurt.\n\nAs a whole Wasteland 2 is a good game. It's not fantastic or rebirth of CRPGs. It's just a good game. Just do not try to compare it to Fallout games. The only things these have in common are Fargo and the post-apocalyptic theme.","January 7, 2015","true","82.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

The NPCs and their dialogue are boring and lack character, they're little more than placeholders to guide you to the next quest, which is unfortunate because Fallout 1 and 2 had such interesting NPCs and conversations.\n\nThere is no perk system. Attributes other than strength and intelligence are pretty pointless. Levelling isn't exciting since there's no reason to diversify your skillset, so you wind up dumping all of your skill points into one or two different skills.\n\nThere is WAY too much combat. In fact, this game is almost exclusively combat focused, in my time playing it is very rare to move the story forward without a lengthy combat sequence. While this isn't ideal, it'd be fine if the combat were at all interesting. There's a cover system, but it's hardly used and most combat takes place without being around any cover. There's no bonus to pincering an enemy, so there's not much point to moving around during combat. Gone is the Fallout system of targetting different body parts to cripple them, or make them drop their weapon, the only option you have now is to take a headshot for two extra AP at -50% chance to hit for 200% weapon damage (which is never worth doing since your chance to hit will never be above 95%). The jamming system has replaced the critical failure system. Now you can have a weapon that has a 1 in 10 chance to randomly jam up, wasting your turn.\n\nUsing skills is tedious. After combat you will want to heal your rangers, which requires using first aid. Each use of first aid requires watching a cross fill-up over 5 seconds, and most rangers require two first-aid packs to fully heal. With a party of 6, healing after battle requires about a minute of not being able to move around or do anything else in the game. Almost every loot container is locked or booby-trapped, oftentimes both, which requires watching some other animation that lasts 5 seconds to fill up. Waiting for animations to complete gets very tiring.\n\nOne of the strangest design choices was to have a rotating camera. The camera is VERY annoying, you'll frequently miss important items, people, and entrances and exits because your camera wasn't pointed the right way. Designing the levels from the ground up to have a fixed camera perspective would have made a lot more sense.\n\nLastly, the game just doesn't have much character. So far it's a lackluster wasteland without the zaniness, wonder, and humor of the classic Fallout games.\n\nI hope they do a lot better with Torment...","September 27, 2014","false","13.1"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","28","47","0","0"

A PC-centric isometric turn-based cRPG through and through; detailed stat sheets, lots of options, lots of skill and much room for exploration. This game has a learning curve, it doesn't hold your hand in the way many modern AAA RPGs do. It's also long. Very long. Depending on how thoughrough you are with side quests and exploration it may take between 40-60 hours to complete. The many choices you have in the game does offer replayability, but the gameplay is quite combat-oriented.\n\nBut it also has some problems though:\n1) Pacing. This game requires a lot of patience. It takes a while before the story gets off the ground. The skill checks eat up time as well. I needed to take a break from the game about half-way through (I found some of the areas midways somewhat uinteresting and the combat was becoming repetitive) and then come back to it again after a couple of months. However the second half of the game feels better. I almost think it would have been better if the developers had cut some of the content to make the game more focused.\n2) Armor system. This is just badly designed. Armor comes with a armor threshold. Weapons come with armor penetration. If weapon penetration exceeds armor threshold then armor does nothing. And it so happens that most enemies you encounter use weapons with armor penetration that just about match the best armor you can get in that part of the game. And later in the game more enemies use energy weapons which deal increased damage to high armor ratings. Thus you find yourself in situations late game were your armor is either detrimental or useless. This really calls for a major balance rehaul patch.\n3) Graphics and animation. This game would have looked good ten years ago. The animations are fairly rough and stiff at times. Many backgrounds are nice, but the overall impression is very mediocre.\n\nBut these issues should not deter you if you're into long and involved turn-based cRPGs.","February 28, 2015","true","63.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

If we, as players, accept this very low bar of completion as OK, then we will reap the "rewards".\n\nIn-Depth Review: I think it's important to understand where this game is coming from before criticizing it.  Tons of Fallout fans were less-than-impressed when Fallout 3 came out and, despite being promised something other than a re-skinned Oblivion (now Skyrim) got just that.\n\nAs such, the hype was huge for a game from the original makers crowdfunded a true sequel with tried-and-tested Firaxis on board.  The target of 1 million was met and grew to 3 million dollars. The game won a GOTY award and has been well-received.\n\nThat was all I needed, so jumped in and was ready for just such an experience.\n\nI did some reading and carefully crafted characters for the long journey ahead, nevermind thst there's very little in a tutorial to prep you.  I'm seasoned gamer, so go!\n\nSo I end up roaming the wastes and get random encounters.  Some I try, some I try to flee.  You get "caught", and then you're loaded into an instance.  The mobs are now romaing about in the instance, not chasing you, and you get to do these a lot unless you have one skill.  Same scenarios and maps.  Hmmm...is this GOTY material?\n\nThen you get into your first quest to go to X place and do Y things.  Along the way, my noob party visited a much higher level area than they were fit for.  Hmmm...no warning?\n\nLuckily, we left and didn'tengage our certain death.  We went on to the Ag Center.  I was woefully unprepared, but managed to survive most of it...until I found myself at an impass:  I had tried to crack a safe that has a critical keycard to enter one of the next areas, but I critically failed which essentially bricked the safe, which was the only place where I could get the keycard.\n\nI went on having learned the critical rule of this game: you save about every 2 seconds and keep vast repositories of save lists.  Unfortunately, I learned this after i borked the safe with the keycard.  Not one to give up, I went on to other areas and did a boss fight where only 2 of my people had ammo left.  After about 20 tries, we got the guy without running out of meds for people he wasted.\n\nNow, that's what happened in the game.  The combo of ridiculous bosses, minimal resources, and the CRUSHING fact that I might not get the keycard I needed nearly caused me to uninstall.\n\nMy reaction to this is now what you might expect, but it's what gets repeated ad nauseum on forums related to this game.  I took this as old school. You just have to deal with your decisions.  YEAH, and this makes everything more realistic, right?  So I left and had my NPC surgeon Rose desert us and picked up Angela Deth, who is great and all but nobody told me i'd need her, and we progressed...\n\nBut at the same time, the clunky camera and its limited zoom functions created this "very atmospheric" sense that I was lost.  I was...and just wanting one more level of zoomout as compared to the satellite view in my inventory.\n\nAnd then you go into a scenario and place your characters just like you want them as you've done a thousand times by this point: in the right position but facing walls.\n\nAnd this was the point of no return.  I just realized that, for all the "difficulty" you face,  the execution is just sucky.  I knew that, if enough people complained, patches would fix things,but, I thought to myself for the first time ever, "THIS is GOTY?"\n\nI stopped blaming myself and started thinking "these are the problems that justify the existence of play-testers."  Did anyone playtest this game before release?  Not based on my experience, and forums suggest I'm not the only one who's had the same problems I've encountered.\n\nAND AND, if you want to see this done right, X-COM does it to near perfection.\n\nBottom line: the game required a million dollar budget.  It got 3 million.  In turn, we got something that is still in beta. finished.\n\nI don't blame players who are enjying this, but I'll never trust entities again which have chosen it as GOTY when it's not","January 9, 2015","false","39.3"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","31","53","3","0"

That's neither a good nor a bad thing. It encourages RP, which is not usually a factor in most RPGs. (eg. most JRPGs just have characters with their own stories and motives, while this game encourages you to tell your own story of your 'rangers'-- that's not to say there aren't already characters with detailed backstories) Some may love this; others, not so much. But the RP is not mandatory, and generally does not affect gameplay.\n\nOne of the main selling points of the game is the story. The story of the world is pretty huge and detailed. It really brings out the RP in RPG. If you liked the fallout series for its story then you'll love this game. There are plenty of similarities in story. The plotlines are also very interesting and compelling.\n\nHowever, the game itself doesn't feel complete. It feels very unpolished, with unappealing and often reused graphics and character models reminiscent of playstation 1 games.\n\nThe gameplay does trump over the ugliness. The exploration and combat system is quite fun and actually works well with the graphics and semi-isometric gameplay.\n\nThe menu system works well and does not feel cluttered, in fact may be a bit simplistic. The item system is also pretty straightforward.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent, and the sounds and voices are really good, at least when they are present (and it would seem to me that voicing is actually missing from quite some text).\n\nThere is no fast travel, so maps with one exit will be a pain to get out of. As well as travelling between destinations.\n\nI would compare this game with xcom mixed with runescape, placed in the fallout universe. Overall I would say it's merely a decent game. Personally, I cannot recommend this game; at least not at full price. That being said, I don't think I would categorize this game as a kickstarter flop. It really does have something nice. But it just feels very unpolished.\n\nGood to know that the developers are actually still very passionate about the game with updates still coming out from time to time.","January 13, 2015","false","44.7"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","24","40","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/240760/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Wasteland 2 is a tactical RPG sequel to a very old text-based game.  While I had never heard of it before, it was the inspiration behind the well-known Fallout games.  To have a sequel come along after 27 years is unheard of, and thankfully they did a very good job with it.\n\nWhile the game was released in a pretty buggy state, inXile diligently released patches to fix everything.  When I played it, I didn't run into any significant problems and there is a director's cut special edition coming in the near future to improve the game even further.  While I feel bad for those who bought the game at release, I'm very glad that inXile stuck with it rather than leaving it a buggy mess like many companies would.  Hopefully their future projects will be released in better condition.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a top-down squad RPG with tactical turn-based combat.  There is a metric ton of text dialogue, with the main story being voiced.  The writing and voice acting is ok, nothing special, though there is a lot of humor and references to many other games and old technology which I found enjoyable.  I would prefer more voice acting since I get tired of reading text pretty quickly but I understand that inXile wanted to stick to a similar style to the original game and at the same time having the whole game being voiced would likely be too expensive.  The pathfinding is some of the best I've ever seen in a game with your squad able to easily navigate all the way across large maps with a single click.  Unfortunately, traversing these large maps can take a long time and you will be doing a lot of this, especially if you want clear out your inventory which I will go into later.\n\nWasteland 2 has its own unique RPG systems, with a standard stat system providing bonuses to various skills.  Each character will only get enough skill points to be competent in a couple skills so specializing is required.  There are even special skills that can only be acquired by finding specific skill books throughout the game.  Several of the skills deal with unlocking containers and doors and this is where one of my sticking points comes in.  Even with maxed out skills, your characters have a very low chance of succeeding (and an accompanying high chance of critical failure) and these objects can only be repaired once.  Following a second critical failure they can never be accessed again.  I believe it's meant to convey a sense of permanence to decisions but I feel like it just encourages save scumming.\n\nThe combat could be a sticking point for many people, though it's not an issue for me.  Everything functions as you'd expect but later in the game, tactics becomes less and less useful.  Arranging party members behind cover can get tedious and isn't necessary later in the game since as you level up, enemies are less dangerous.  At the very end of the game however, it becomes necessary again.  My only real complaint about the combat is that at the very beginning of the game, it is extremely difficult.\n\nThe game's biggest problem though is inventory clutter.  The game is filled with the greatest variety of junk items I've seen in a game.  Most of these are just sold to shops but some have a shining effect indicating that they are useful in some way but you don't know how.  Unfortunately the "sell all junk" button includes these shiny items so you have to manually remove them from the shop each time.  In addition to the junk there are tons of miscellaneous items, each of which can be given to a specific NPC for a reward.  There are tons of these items and tons of NPCs with no hints about who wants them other than remembering what NPCs may have told you when talking to them.  It's a royal pain trying to deal with it all but can be ignored if you aren't a completionist.\n\nThe game makes good use of the Unity engine with DX11 support and pretty good graphics, though unfortunately due to using Unity it does not support fullscreen mode.  This led to significant performance problems for me.  I'm really hoping that the update to Unity 5 for the director's cut version will fix this particular problem.  Regardless, the game does seem to require much more power to run than it should for the type of game it is.  It seems to be a common problem with Unity games that aim for high graphical fidelity in my experience.\n\nDespite a few problems, Wasteland 2 is a fine game.  It has all the RPG depth you'd expect and plenty of content to play through.  Having skipped most of the dialogue due to not wanting to read so much, it still took me more than 50 hours to beat the game.  Wasteland 2 is a game I can highly recommend to RPG fans.","June 24, 2015","true","58.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","4"

The story is again similar to Fallout series, with a dose of humor and typical post-apocalypse madness. It was definetly entertaining and motivating to find out, but could have been slightly better written to enhance the immersion. The world in Wasteland 2 is huge and allows a lot of exploration, but is not entirely open: you have to progress the story to gain access to certain areas. The world itself is highly detailed in content, and is therefore fun to explore. My favorite part of exploration is that you can find interesting and weird stuff where you least expect it. Here I rather mean finding weird characters and in most cases items, and not unique new quests or adventures like you do in the newer Fallout games.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed by the graphics. The details of certain objects and buildings were non-existent. I wish the game simply was sharper and more detailed, which would farther help increase the atmosphere. The voice acting was in most cases pretty good, but not always convincing, and to compare to Fallout 1 & 2 lacked some of the uniqueness in the characters you meet (i.e. like Marcus), but only to a lesser extent: there are lots of weird people out there.\n\nIn general the game is absolutely worth your time. Strongly suggested to Fallout fans (especially 1&2) and those who are into post-apocalypse in general, or just someone looking for a game that can draw you in for at least 50 hours. I spent 80 in the end, and still hadn't explored every corner in the wasteland and finished all side quests.","October 26, 2014","true","82.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

Please stop saying things like it's "the true Fallout 3."\n\nIt's not.  It's not even close.  It lacks any and all of Fallout's whimsical charm, it forces you to create a squad at the beginning instead of striking out on a lonely, eerie struggle.\n\nMoreover, the game feels like it's high on its own supply.  Overhyped, oversold, generally just not ideal for someone who wants an original Fallout experience.  There's a big difference between this super serious, staid setting and the wacky retro-future of Fallout.\n\nHonestly, this is like a better verison of Fallout: Tactics at the end of the day.  I'm not saying this is a bad game, it's just extremely misleading to compare it to the original Fallout titles.  It is NOT like them.  No traits, no perks, no color or humor.  Not enough attribute and skill points at the beginning for an individual character, since you're supposed to make four.  There's no room for character development or finding your own identity.  The very first conversation, I'm pushed into saying "sir" constantly and being a military recruit.  Maybe I don't WANT to join the rangers.\n\nMaybe I want to just run out into the wilderness or find a city hub and just make my own path - like I did in Fallout.\n\nI realize everyone is different.  But part of the reason I loved Fallout was that my companions had their own minds and I didn't have to micromanage them constantly.  It ended up creating hilarious (and sometimes awful) situations in which my companions surprised me in combat.  Overall, it was more immersive (to me) because I was focused entirely on my own character, instead of mysteriously mind-controlling a group.\n\nOverall, it's hard to say whether or not I recommend the game.  I know some people will love it.  But I can't get over the vast disappointment after I was lead to believe, from literally everyone, that this is like Fallout.  It's not.  Fallout, in my opinion, is way more fun.  Mechanically, aesthetically, and otherwise.\n\nJust one woman's point of view.

The fact you move your characters around in real time before a combat start oftens leaves you're characters all huddled together before you can start the combat, as at least 2 or 3 members of your party are out of cover. The combat soon turns into a waiting to see if you're lucky enough to hit as the AI just charges forward or stays still shooting at you. The options in combat for crouching, headshots and ambushing just aren't enough or actually useful, the combat is really stale it really could have done with copying xcom wholesale.\n\nThe game hides the fact of which skill to use on particular objects, which left me to go to the internet to figure out that the demolitions skill allowed you to disable traps. The uses for the various skills are fairly pointless, you need perception, demolition, lockpicking, first aid, surgeon and safecracking, then you need to invest heavily in combat skills to stand a chance of hitting anything.\n\nThe conversation system could have been wonderful and added much needed depth to the game, it is generally well written, but it turns into a case of just clicking every single option to find out all of the information the uses for social skills tend to be few and far between. There are apparently hidden key words in the conversations, I tried asking about lots of different options and none of them came up.\n\nThe camera also is pretty limited and hides things, you'll end up pressing z almost constantly whilst exploring to see stuff to interact with.","September 22, 2014","false","59.9"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

I love isometric RPGs and i played them all. I even replay both the original Fallouts once every three years or so. Sadly, the Wasteland 2 fails on so many levels that the few that are actually good won't save it. And the fact that Divinity: Original Sin and Shadowrun: Dragonfall came out recently and are superior on almost every level makes this game look even worse.\n\nCombat:\nTotal letdown. Almost no tactial options. While in Divinity i would use my rogue to sneak behind enemy lines and start with an ability that costs a lot of AP and is therefore only useful as an opening getting bonuses from backstab as well as from attack from stealth. After that i will use the artifact and teleport my tank to the rogue and make him knock down the most dangerous foe while my mage will teleport oil barrel near the enemies and ignite it. While my tank has fire resist over 100% so the flames actually heal him.\nAnd in Wasteland? I open with a shot. After that all my other characters shoot. Some use the weapon ability to shoot multiple rounds as it has the best dmg/Ap. Then all the enemies shoot, now all my characters shoot. When you are skilled you can try for a headshots (And that just causes more dmg, no penalties to the enemy or anything and you can't aim for any other bodypart) Sometimes you can use verticality or cover (that has been clearly added to the game as an afterthought as it is not possible in most of the fighths) And THAT IS ALL! No abilities, no gadgets, no skills, no perks. NOTHING!!!\n\nCharacter progression:\nThere is none! You have attributes and skills. Attributes can be minmaxed as some are clearly better than the others. Skills are just your percentual chance to do stuff. You will NEVER gain new ability or perk or anything. Nothing that will change the gameplay. You will just know how to open a box better. Mainly because boxes near the end of the game are harder to open than the boxes at the beginning of the game. Yes, the same boxes...\n\nQuickloading:\nAs the game desing is bad you will load very often. In fact you will memorize the loading screen very well. You see, everything is percentual and dependant on your skill. Luck based. You see a locked box with a trap and an alarm. You have 50% to disarm the alarm, 40% to disarm the bomb and 70% to pick the lock. So disarm - fail - disarm - fail - disarm success - alarm - fail - alarm - fail - alarm - success - pick - fail - pick - critical fail - LOAD and repeat.\n\nGraphics:\nAmazingly bad. I mean really bad. Much worse than Fallout 1 or 2. It is technically bad (low res textures, low poly models) and aesthetically bad (repeating of assets, assests with different textures next to each other, the same mood everywhere, the same models everywhere). You don't even have much of an avatar picture choice when creating your characters. And some of that pictures are later used in the game on other characters! The graphics are much worse than in The Fall: Last days of Gaia which is old, low budget german post-apo game from noname developer.\n\nStory\nHere it isn't bad. The story is quite good. Sadly it is told via big chunks of texts. I like to read in games. Planescape Torment is one of my most beloved games and it has much more text. But the text in that game is exciting and relevant. Here most of the things that people will tell you are things that you have already heard milion times from others. But you have to read it all because sometimes in this ocean of text there is useful information.\n\nChoices\nThe choices are a mixed bag. You are often presented with multiple choices and you actually feel the consequences. That is very good. But sometimes the choices themselves seem illogical. At the beginning of the game you have to choose to save one of two settlements. Either the superimportant one that feeds all the surrounding settlements (including your ranger base), or the other superimportant one that provides water to everyone. You as a new recruit. One ranger of many. And after you do that you suddenly hear the other rangers chat on radio. How they helped to save some merchants or how they saved some cows. Yea, but they couldn't save the superimportant settlement...\n\nConclusion:\nThis review might seem too harsh but if someone asked me what game to play - Wasteland 2 or Fallout 1, the game that came out 17 years ago, i would recomment F1 without hesitation. And that tells you something about this game...\nIf you want to play good modern isometric RPG, play Shadowrun: Dragonfall or Divinity: Original Sin.","October 20, 2014","false","14.5"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","34","60","0","2"

In this game Armor actually kills you and you have to strip down to actually beat some encounters or you will die!\n\nSpoilers will be in here.\n\nSo after 70+ Hours I think I have played enough of this and gotten the mechanics down to write a review. Now I get this is supposed to be a classic styled game. I loved Wasteland and the Fallout series which is why I had to play this. I went in expecting some pretty decent gameplay ala Fallout 1 & 2 style. While the base game has some decent overtones and it looks extremely polished. The feel and amibiance are fantastic game looks and feels great and just oozes style. However the mechanics are what destroys this title or should I say lack thereof.\n\nUnpopular Mechanics: How the Waste was made.\n\nSo lets get this started you have Attributes which give you various bonuses to derived stats and a lot of skills. Every skill or stat goes from 1 to 10 including the  equipped armor stat, but more on that later. Now most of your stats are straight forward extra skill points on level up or higher crit chance on in particular is interesting "Combat Intiative". Seems pretty standard it makes you act sooner in combat right? Well partially right, it allows you to act faster in combat. Meaning you can go two or even three times more then a character with a low score. Making it a godly stat if you get enough of it. Also the average of 13-15 is considered low by the game. Enemies have average 17-19 meaning they go first and sometimes twice before you do.\n\nThat leads us into the mess which is Wasteland 2's combat system. Lets start with weapons and see what does what.\n\nAssault rifles: High damage, wonky stats between rifles as some higher tier ones do horribly low damage and most have a solid three round burst mode. This is the go to weapon for most situations the only draw back is they have accuracy penalty at point blank range and if a enemy moves next to you a further aim on all shots is inccured. Also the enemies WILL do this every chance they get to cripple your snipers even if they don't attack them.\n\nPistols: high crit low base damage. Early ones fire for a pittance of 3 action points a shot allowing you to do some damage. Later higher but not assault rifle damage ones are typically 4 AP a shot. A decent side arm for using 4 ap you can't shoot with a rifle as you switch between guns, not particularly effective though, As you can rarely get a third shot off late game.\n\nHeavy Weapons: These are joke level, they waste huge amounts of bullets to fire large bursts of VERY low damage shots that combine up to equal a couple good assault rifle shots. Bonus joke is you start with a broken M2 .50 caliber machingun rechambered in 5.56 if you select this skill at start. Even though you get .50 BMG ammo later on there is apprantly no real M2 that uses it. To put it in perspective a assault rifle using the same round does 44-70 damage for the 20-30 damage of a heavy weapon. Both of which will be reduced by enemy armor making even a minigun barrages damage miniscule. No mods can be used so they will jam or not have great chance to hit/Hit your own dudes.\n\nSubmachine guns: These are to pistols what heavy weapons are to assault rifles. Low damage bullet wasters.\n\nEnergy Weapons: Now we are talk here is the games central gimmick and one of things that breaks the game utterly. The more armor the target has the more damage it takes from energy weapons. Late game enemies use energy weapons and melee weapons that go right through your armor. There is a ambush later in the game where synthetics attack you from all directions, I died after 2-3 turns and retried this encounter many times and went back and leveled up and did stuff I might have missed. I was level 34 at my highest character and still died. Solution? I took off my armor before entering the location and the 120 damage hits I was taking turned into 15-20 damage hits. I completed the whole fight with no one under 80% health and having done NO healing during the fight.\n\nTotally disgusting as all my power armor and cool gear I worked for actually slowed me down and made me take MORE damage. Also Explosives do straight damage ignoring armor so a pipe bomb always does 50 damage and a frag grenade does 100.\n\nTo reiterate I had to take off all my armor in order to progress through the game or I would die if they I wore armor.\n\nShotguns: Laughable for a good eighty percent of the game. Enemies will often kill each other with the low damage cone effect. Later ones gain burst fire but insane accuracy penalties where they will either do maybe a shot of assault rifle damage or triple shot remove late game enemies.\n\nSniper rifles: High damage and long range, Keep enemies back or lure them in for close combat. The best gun in the game is likely the .50 caliber sniper rifle you pull out of the dump as it can and will crit for 250+ oh and like pistols these have a high base crit and rarely miss when in range.\n\nOh and uh melee weapons: they do more damage based on levels you put into them even though it apprantly doesn't say that. Anything with AP 2-3 is extremly viable especially against rifle using enemies who will run away from you. If you max these out early they are absurd like no other. Especially as later ones have very high armor pen and status effects. Do not trust the listed damage, once you are 6-8 skill points in they pulp whatever you hit, and you can swing multiple times.\n\nSkills or how I learned to extend play time through save scumming. Every skill besides first aid (unless surgery on npc's) has a critical failure. Even a easy 92% check has a chance of going HORRIBLY wrong and maiming your character or breaking whatever you were interacting with. This can straight up break entire quests as you break a lock and are unable to progress in that chain. Frequent saving and loading on critical areas is advised. The game loves to throw critical failures even when its only a 5% chance to hit them.\n\nWeaponsmithing is a mess as it provides a chance to get weapon mods by destroying guns. The random list has older mods which are no longer useful. Though breaking weapons can lead to weapon parts which can be sold at the ranger citadel in arizona for huge profit once you get the basic tier of mods done. Even maxxed out the chances of good mods is not that good unless you have stacks of high tier energy guns and assault rifles. which can instead be sold for bullets and health items better guns.\n\nTheres also a bunch of crazy trinkets that you can swap out for stat bonuses though you will have to save scum when you realize you didn't have your ranger badge on when you needed that extra point of hardass in a conversations as the conversation skill prompts are removed if you quit the conversation or talk about something else no backsies!\n\nSpeaking of no backsies, if you pass up a safe or locked item only to come back when you have higher skill. Several times the safes are now "looted by scavengers". Tough break.\n\nThe quests, dialog, writng, amibiance, voice acting, art style, animation, story and basically every thing else are top notch. However this game most reminds me of Arcanum with its horrible skill and combat system.\n\nSo in summery: Armor kills you and also slows you down, Assault rifles blow basically everything out of the water, even more so when weaponsmithed (save scum those laser sights!), Combat intiative is the best stat next to action points, You can go two to three times for their one and get all your action points each time. Heavy weapons are a funny joke by the devs and are ineffectual unless enemies spam them and even then kinda meh.\n\nFinally, you can't polish a turd but you can sure ruin something trying to polish it with a turd.","October 5, 2014","false","75.9"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","2"

Put points into outdoorsman and flee every random encounter.\nThere's no cool stuff like reverse pick pocketing a land mine into someone's back pocket, or shooting their legs off so they can't flee.

It's very much like Fallout 1 and 2 (which were based off the first wasteland game), with lots of differences.\n\nFirst of all, you start by creating a party of up to 4 people (and can have a party up to 7 from npcs recruited in game), there a tons of different skill to choose from for each character, ranging from mechanical repair, to computer science to assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, outdoorsman, smart ♥♥♥/hard ♥♥♥/kiss ♥♥♥ (3 dialogue skills that vary on attitude), etc.\nThere is also a decent attribute system, much like the SPECIAL from fallout, except this one is called CLASSIC (coordination, luck, Awareness, Strength, Speed, Intelligence and Charisma), and the attributes have a huge impact on characters and what they can do.\n\nThe battle system is much like DnD or any D20 system, grid turn based combat, using initiative to choose when people act. If you've played X Com then it's much like that, except more in depth (then the newest x com) in terms of mechanics and what you can do. As opposed to the two move system from x com or D20, this one is based off action points (like the original fallout games), you have so many action points (depending on your speed, strength, awareness and many more) that you can do in a turn. Walking 1 square requires 1 action point, shooting different weapons require more as well as other various actions.\n\nTravelling the world map, again is very much like the original fallout games. You have the map, and your icon traverses across it as you may run into random encounters, there are oasises everywhere that give you water (as you gotta refill water to keep traversing the map), and you can run across various settlements this way. There are also radiation clouds that you must watch out for, you can go through them but you need radiation gear otherwise your party will get killed while walking through  it.\n\nOn top of the game mechanics and battle systems, the quests themselves are very intriguing, lots of side content and missions to do, and A LOT of choices to do in those missions. You can do missions so many different ways, from sneaking into a fort and killing some dudes to negotiating with them and allying them with you, to poisoning their food and killing them off.\nThe main big missions usually have various different outcomes in the missions, each giving you a drastically different faction running an area, or having you liked or hated by another faction, and even unlocking different potential companions depending on how you finished the mission.\n\nThe game itself sort of gears you to be a "good guy", in that you are a team of rangers that are supposed to be a police force in a post apocalyptic wasteland - but you don't have to be. Though the game would be MUCH harder being a bad guy, there's nothing stopping you and you can kill anyone you feel like for any reason. Though your NPC characters (that arent created by the PC) usually dont like when you go around double dealing guys, killing innocents and just failing to protect people (though there are other NPCs that don't mind you doing so, just dont expect the philantropist doctor girl to stay with your team when you betray a settlement or start murdering people indiscriminately).\n\nHell, you can even roleplay the morally gray ranger that is willing to sacrifice people and lives for the greater good if you so desired.\n\nSo far, i'm about over 100 hours in game (right now steam says im at 88, but after an update when i was about 20 some hours in, it reset my hours played for some reason), and I'm only about half way done the main game (though ive been doing any side stuff that i come across).\n\nSo far the game is amazing to me and im having a blast with it. Been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and definitely having a lot of fun with it and to me, this game will be a classic that i go back and play multiple times over the years, much like other classic RPGS such as Fallout 1 and 2, Knights of the old republic, Bauldur's gate, Neverwinter nights and Morrowind and so on.\n\nI would recommend this game to any RPG fan, specifically hard core RPG fans, and this game is definitely worth the 40 dollars for the base game. Such an awesome game!","November 14, 2014","true","108.3"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

Quite frankly, the Turn-based strategy genre has been in a drought for nearly a decade and fans are dying of thirst to the extent they'll lap up contaminated water riddled with disease and ask for seconds.  They're so enamored with a sub-standard product they don't recognize they're dying a most dishonorable death from dysentery.\n\nCombat - The combat is lackluster and is not tactical nor strategic in any sense of the fashion.  OK Corral gun duels might be more appropriate, except slow and with none of the skill involved.  If you want a game with good combat, just replay XCOM2012 or Xenonauts.\n\nCharacter building - No skill tree, no perks, nothing to be found except redundant skills to simply dump your stat points into every time you level up.  If you're looking for the complexity and fun of a D&D style character sheet, keep looking.  If you're looking for a Fallout perk system... keep looking.  Even Diablo 3, which the avid fans of W2 seem keen to mock, has a far more indepth character building system.\n\nStory -  Glaring plot hole at the beginning of the game that most people seem to overlook or simply not notice.  Even if you look past that, the only clever aspect of the entire game is the little Easter Eggs you'll occasionally find.  However, finding kitty litter, a condom, or big black didlo for the 15th time is just sad.  It's funny the first time, but like any good joke, you have to know when to quit effing telling it.  If you want a game with a good story, reboot Mass Effect, BG, Fallout... pretty much any other CRPG.\n\nCharacters - Easily forgettable and none that will be remembered.  No Minsc & Boo, HK-47, Commander Shepards, Irenicus (best villain ever), Tomi Grin Undergallows etc.  No Delita or Ramza to be found here.  For the most part, they're as bland and lifeless as the Arizona wastes you'll wander around for the first half of the game.\n\nExploration - Some of the environments are interesting, but with the terrible combat and random loot, much of the fun is taken out of it.\n\nGraphics - The game wasn't trying to inspire us with graphical prowess or eye porn, but what it delivered is unpolished and ugly.  Some will argue it's stylistic or gritty, but to each their own.\n\nSound - Ok, but no gripping musical scores to be found here.\n\nAt the end of the day, everything W2 set out to do has been done before (obviously), but done far better.","October 17, 2014","false","31.7"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","31","55","0","0"

I tried to play and like it but was frustrated at the learning curve and didn't really have the time to invest in it. This winter/spring I finally had the time and was rewarded with a terrific experience. Like every game I have played, it has a few warts. That's expected and if they are warts you can live with you will absolutely love this game. So let's talk warts first.\nVery convoluted plot lines for a few important quests. I didn't find the solutions intuitive and resorted to a walkthrough because while I had extra time, I didn't have THAT much time to constantly reload and try all of the different permutations.\nI did not like the mechanics of weapon stripping. Could just be my luck but when it said I have a 20% chance at a tactical scope...it never worked out that way. But honestly, the system could be better. Realistically, a weaponsmith takes a gun or whatever and removes the non damaged parts...right? At level 10 weaponsmithing I expect to be able to choose what to take and, assuming it's viable, I should have a 100% chance of removing it. I own firearms in RL, have stripped them and cleaned them too many times. A better approach would be a predetermined roll on what attachement(s) is/are undamaged and then based on your WS skill make the roll. Frankly, a Tactical scope is still a scope, and if undamaged, would be just as easy to remove as my old scope I had on my .22.\nI started recording my skill checks and at the end of the game, for those checks of 65% or less, I averaged half that. One time it took me 23 tries on a 28% lock. So, my point is, I wasted a lot of time reloading instead of playing. Accuse me of OCD? You'd be right but it still interfered with the game to a level that I thought, disturbed the immersion.\nSo, the good stuff? EVERYTHING else is fantastic. The combat tactics are brilliant. The skill and attribute systems perfect for this game. The atmosphere, the music, the diverse characters you meet and sometimes recruit...love you Scotchmo. Story, excellent, gear, terrain and graphics very good. Voice actors, 9/10.\nAll the little bits. IE: finding caches and shrines. Having a goat or a dog or a puppy (careful with that btw) or a robot or a terror hang with ya and love you....priceless.\nFinally, if you want and old style isometric game that is very challenging to learn, then provides a great story and combat tactics......this is for you.\nWELL done InExile, well done. 9/10","April 15","true","424.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/recommended/240760/","3InkSheep","3InkSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/","218 products in account","In recent years there has been a lot of games that have tried to fill the gap that is the survival genre,  but there is few very games that quench that thirst quite like Wasteland 2. The difference is how involved you feel when making decisions. Generally in games, you're divided between good and bad, and depending on how you want to play, you'll either help or kill those you meet. Of course this is possible in Wasteland, but your actions bare much larger consequences than you might have first anticipated. Then again, you probably won't live long enough to see these play out...\n\nThe short:\n\nWasteland 2 is a top-down, strategy-survival, RPG that is difficult, challenging and extensive in both content, and quality. For those that love narrative, there's plenty of it, and it's good material, well written and some is voice acted, which is exceptionally high-quality. Combat is much alike that you'll find within XCOM: Enemy Unknown. You'll find yourself using cover to reduce hit chances, you'll command your units individuially around the battlefield and when a unit is down, he's down for good. There's a unique sense that your actions matter. Each trap you disarm, each surviver you encounter, you feel a part of a world that's much larger than what you see. Characters have personalities and behave in believeable motion. It's an experience that, unless you're an old-school RPG fan, you'll unlikely have experienced before, and that's a refreshing sensation that's rare to find.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great narrative & voice acting.\n-Dynamic, tactical combat.\n-Well optimized.\n-Choices with consequences.\n-Rich character creation and custimization options.\n-Great emphasis on survival & difficulty.\n\nCons:\n\n-Objectives can sometimes be unclear, or poorly presented.\n-Slow to start and pick up the pace.\n-Graphics feel outdated in comparison to newer titles.\n\nThe Long:\n\nIn recent years, the survival genre has become saturated with a wide range of games, all looking to fill the gap. This could be traced back to the release, and huge success of Minecraft, which arguably changed the genre to what it is today. These games are great, but having played Wasteland 2 for a few hours now, the differences are remarkable.\n\nThe main difference I find is the connection you have with the world. You create a squad of four characters, either using pre-made selections, or by creating your own, from scratch. This is where this sensation begins. If you decided to create your squad, you decide exactly who your character is, what they look like and what their story is by creating a character page, which includes a bio, name, age and religion, Despite not being familiar with the Wasteland series, or games like it, I felt compelled to sit down and dream up stories that define my characters. Very few games can achieve this sense of importance and connection that ties you and your characters so closely together. Wasteland 2 follows a similiar perma-death system to that found in XCOM: Enemy Unknown. You'll play with your four characters, but once they die, they're gone, for good. You can reload saves and retry, but in a game that focuses so much on consequences and connections, it almost feels like you're cheating yourself out of the real satisfaction that makes this game unique. Sure, seeing a character you've survived with for ten hours or so is sad, but that sensation of waving them goodbye, and moving forward enhances the overall aspect of what survival is really about, and Wasteland does this brilliantly.\n\nAmongst the character creation is a range of skills and perks that you'll use to develop your characters personality. As you level your characters, you'll obtain opportunities to further enhance their abilities, or simply learn new ones. It's important to have a good balance of skills within your squad, otherwise you might find that you'll quickly become nothing more than a pile of bones amongst the wasteland. A few of these skills include:\n\n-Abilities to use weapons, such as: Heavy weapons, Assault weapons, Shotguns, Snipers, Blunt Weapons, Brawl weapons, Blades and so on.\n\n-Technical abilities, such as: Picklocking, Safecracking, Alarm disarming, surgeon, Field medic and so forth.\n\n-General abilities, such as: Leadership, Smart, Kick and Kiss-♥♥♥ conversational abilities, weaponsmithing and more.\n\nThere's a range of about twenty different abilities, which can be shared amongst your squad, however your see fit. In addition to this, your characters can be equipped with armours, radiation protection, cosmetic clothing, and untrained weaponary to suit your play-style. There's very few limitations within Wasteland, a point which is clear right from the beginning. You're immediatelly introduced how to interact with the environment, which brings me to versitility. Wasteland 2 is tinsled with the concept of free-choice, you're never forced into approaching an area or battle with a particular play-style, it's up to you whether you want to run in, guns blazing, or whether you want to seek out the high ground, and be more patient. The same can be said about the environment too. In the situation that you're presented with a door that's obstructing your path, you have several options. You can either hack it, picklock it, use brute force, set explosives, manipulate an NPC to open it, find the passcode or simply give up and go get lunch. The emphasis on choice is very much alive and kicking.\n\nCombat is fluid, tactical and intense. Each unit has a set of action points, everything you do will consume an amount, once you've used them up, it's onto the next unit for their turn. Alternatively, you can end your turn sooner to save the points which will be added to that units next turn. This makes for strategic decisions and a good mindset in plannig ahead. The combat system uses an inititive system. Each unit has an inititive stat, decided by their stats and their gear, depending on how high or low that number might be depends on which position in the queue roaster they'll be able to take their turn. Units with a higher inititive might find themselves acting not only quicker, but more frequently than those with lower stats. You control your units independantly, moving them across the battlefield, using cover and action points each turn. If a unit dies, you have a set amount of turns to revive them, otherwise they're gone for good and you best hope there's an NPC in a nearby town willing to fill the hole. Combat in Wasteland can be compared to that within XCOM, however because this is also a survival game, there's much more to it that simply shooting at targets, it's knowing when to shoot, and when to run that matters. Ammo is limited, very limited. At the beginning of the game you'll start with no more than a single round of ammo, for each of your weapons. It's up to you to hunt and purchase more. This doesn't seem like such a problem, but it makes combat encounters that little more intense, just knowing each bullet you use could well be the reason you die ten minutes later to a group of bandits. There's a tactical element to the combat that very other games can match. There are plenty of times when an opportunity to kill an enemy emerges, but it's in those moments when you have to pause, and consider the consequences of using those rounds, those supplies. It sounds very simply. Shoot, and resupply later, but in Wasteland, later is a struggle to reach when you're well equipped, let alone when you've got one arm shot off and you're crawling amongst the dirt like a sloth.\n\nThere's much more to say about Wasteland, but it's an experience you'll have to have yourself to know the true values that make this title unqiue. It's engaging, connected and impactful right from the moment you hit play. Pick this up, take your time, question your decisions and enjoy perhaps one of the best RPGs in recent years.\n\n9.5/10 ~ Simply brilliant.\n\n\n","October 12, 2014","true","15.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

There's intermittent crashing at the Damonta location, but by the time you get to Hollywood, the game is unplayable.  Characters randomly transporting all across the map, quests that get stuck or become impossible to complete, with most players getting past the location by killing everyone on the map as the only way to 'complete' the location.  Unlike Fallout 1 and 2, you can't "skip" a town's quests and move on.  If you can't complete the quest, the game is permanently stuck.  There are so many times I've gone across the whole game map, only to find out that I need to talk to some obscure, random NPC at some location just to "complete the quest" and open up a new location.

We have the imminent and long overdue release of Wasteland 2.\nAfter 26 years lost in the wilderness, expectations are high, but are we in danger of placing Wasteland 2 on a pedestal, expecting too much and inevitably about to face disappointment when September 19th rolls around?\n\nFour Rangers and a Funeral\n\nAfter hitting the play button for the first time you'll find yourself at the character creation screen.\nHere you'll find more stats and options than you could shake an iguana on a stick at, with skills ranging from animal whisperer to toaster repair.\n\nPrepare to spend an unhealthy amount of time agonising over the attributes and skills sets for your posse of wannabe rangers.\nNot that this isn't fun, It's a good kind of agony trying to build your perfect team but if this kind of stat tweaking isn't for you, there is a roster of pre-built characters all lined up like puppies in a pound waiting for you to give them a new home in your squad.\n\nOnce you've settled on what you hope is a complimentary skill set for your four rangers you'll be treated to a highly atmospheric cinematic which cleverly fills in a little of the back story for the desert rangers and leaves your group standing around the fresh grave of a fallen comrade.\n\nAce in the Hole\n\nThe writing on the makeshift coffin reads "Born a man, died a desert ranger"\nIt's here that the game starts as "Ace" is laid to rest and you're team picks up his failed assignment.\nIt's this assignment that will be your first thread of the main quest that you will follow through Wasteland 2.\n\nTriffid or not Triffid, That is the Question\n\nAfter some interesting conversations with the NPCS at the graveside you'll head off on your first mission and it's here that the first moral choice hits hard and fast.\nThere's a distress signal from Highpool, a community under attack, they need your help, then almost immediately another from the nearby agricultural centre that's having some "plant problems", you'll only have time to try to save one, but which....\nIt's decisions like this which really make Wasteland 2 come alive, whatever you choose will have repercussions, you're a part of this dying world and your choices matter.\n\nWe come in peace, Shoot to Kill\n\nThe tough decisions don't all come in the form of moral choices either. The turn based combat present here will test your tactical decision making too. You'll be glad you spent all that time tweaking your stats and skills and matching your weapon load outs to your strengths when bad guys, gals, animals and plants come for you.\nWhen they do come, they'll look great. you'll find crisp detailed graphics and atmospheric audio in Wasteland 2 which makes every encounter a vivid experience.\n\nThe end of the world never looked so good.\n\nIt's The End of the World as we know it\n\nThe experience InXile are creating here is shaping up to be one of the most interesting RPG's in a very, very long time.\nAt the time of writing the game is still in Beta, although you wouldn't know it, the experience to be had in the first few hours of play is already highly entertaining and very polished.\n\nIf you remember, earlier in this preview I expressed my concern that anticipation for this release is too high and that it can only lead to disappointment.\nSo how do I feel about this now, after I've actually played the game?\n\nI Feel Fine\n\nFrom my experience with the beta, the answer to this question is a resounding No. Wasteland 2 is everything I'm looking for in a crunchy RPG and I love it.\nThis is going to be something special. I'm genuinely excited for the release of this title and I'm certain I'll be sinking an ungodly amount of time into the wastes over the coming weeks.\n\nIt's time to rediscover the Wasteland\n\nTo view the full review and others please take the time to visit  Review-Well.com [www.review-well.com]","September 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","4"

After playing for a few hours saving Highpool I felt really burnt out which isn’t something you want your game to do. There is just too many meaningless fights and the quests are the most boring nonsense I have ever encountered most were broken at the time which greatly ruined the game for me.\n\nThe main problem with the game is its gameplay I love turn-based combat but not when it takes 20-30mins per fight it just isn't fun. It still doesn’t have that element that makes combat satisfying that will have players coming back and investing hours into your game. The story is uninteresting, companions have zero personalities along with its countless bugs, forced story choices, stupid AI, no strategy required, useless game mechanics or terrible controls.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this game I had to force myself to finish it and don't understand how it is getting a Game of the Year Edition. Wasteland 2 is just mediocre at best Fallout 1 & 2 or Jagged Alliance are by far superior and I wish I could refund this game.","July 6, 2015","false","48.5"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/recommended/240760/","yoshikawa","Venom Krulin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/","424 products in account","Summary at bottom for those of you in a hurry.\n\nI approached this game as a newcomer to the series. I had never played the original. So, I have no fan boy bias at all. I will probably end up comparing it to Fallout at times, but I WAS NOT expecting it to be a clone of Fallout. I will repeat that to make sure everyone understands that. I WAS NOT expecting this game to be exactly like Fallout. That being said, nobody can deny the two are similar. They’re both apocalypse’ish games that are centered on RPG mechanics.\n\nThe Good: I actually liked the looks of the game. They’re aren’t the most high definition graphics, but they do look right. The game mechanics work well when it comes to combat. I liked that you got to customize up to four characters to play as. That’s something you don’t get to see very often. The last time I remember getting to customize more than one character in a game like this is Jagged Alliance 2. The combat was pretty solid. It has some issues, but nothing that can’t be fixed with some tweaking. The sound effects were good and so was the music. Sadly that’s about where my praise for the game ends.\n\nThe Bad: The characters. I didn’t really find any to get attached to. The only character I liked was one of the random NPC characters you can pick up. Any game like this has to have characters with personality. You have to either love or hate at least some of the characters for anything to matter. Fallout 2, which is the closest game to compare this to, had great NPC characters. I just would have liked more connection with the characters. I remember going around with Cassidy (and his daughter in New Vegas) and enjoying their company. Next, there are the bugs. This game has acres of them, but I’m willing to give that a pass right now since it’s new and this is an indie developer. They seem determined to fix them, so good on them.\n\nThe Ugly: The story. I found it boring. There was no hook to it. The story starts off with you attending Ace’s funeral. Ace was a ranger and so is your party. You are tasked with the mission he was trying to complete of attaching devices to some nearby towers to track a transmission. This transmission has been transmitting some very worrisome messages. The problem with this whole plot is there’s no attachment to it. I didn’t know Ace before he was dead, so there’s no attachment to him. I don’t know the Rangers, so I can’t feel attached to them. This comes especially so when the General doesn’t let you in the main fort to get supplies. He even lampshades this saying something about it being a real dangerous mission when you ask to go inside to get supplies. You can very minimal supplies outside at a trader, but still. You don’t feel like you’re being treated like one of the group, so why should you care about them? Without spoiling anything, you get to a point in the story where some bandits are harassing the area, so you have to deal with them. Now, their camp is guarded by these huge invincible turrets. I was gratuitously over leveled at this point because I had explored every square inch of the game so far, but they slaughtered me. I was frustrated with this, but accepted it at the moment. But, on a whim, I decided to see if I could take on Ranger Citadel (the Ranger HQ). I wanted to do it just for fun, not to actually keep as part of my save. I slaughtered everyone with ease in there and the only one who posed a threat was the General. The four turrets in Ranger Citadel went down it 2-3 hits each. It made no sense that the highly militarized and organized group had worse equipment than some bandits. To be fair though, I did like the second half of the story a lot more. The second half of the game could have been the start and I would have liked it a lot more. There was more personalization with the characters and therefore the events happening in the story mattered.\n\nLong story short: I do not recommend this game. The story was lackluster. It lacked any sort of immediate trouble in the game. There weren’t any memorable characters for me. I had the same problem with Skyrim (I know they’re very different games). They both had good gameplay, but lacked anything that could remotely be called a good story or characters. Good story and characters is pretty much 75% of an RPG.","October 17, 2014","false","20.5"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","30","54","0","0"

Or, maybe more legit.\n\nI backed this game on the Kickstarter, but after few updates I had this bothersome feeling that it won't end well. And it didn't, IMHO.\n\nAfter 20 hours, I didn't experience any memorable event or interesting quest. Not a single one.\nAfter 20 hours, I didn't visit any interesting location or fight any enjoyable battle. Not a single one.\n\nThere is just nothing interesting or enjoyable in the game. There is no atmosphere. It's a post apocalyptic game, and there is no atmosphere. I mean come on, how is that even possible? Even Failout 3 had atmosphere FFS.\n\nThe dialogues are more often than not boring or unnecessary. Characters are unmemorable, generic, boring. And the game is hideous. I don't care about the graphics, but I honestly can not think of uglier game I played in past decade.\n\nThere is a lot of skills, that's nice. But most of them are completely redundant. There is 25 thousand skills for different kind of weapons. But no skill for throwing "weapons". So you have lvl 7 assault rifles skill and 80% chance to hit. And you have no skill with throwing grenades but you'll always hit the exact spot.\n\nWhen you want to open a safe, you need a demolition skill, disable alarm skill and safesomething skill (You don't always need all of them, but a combination of them more often than not). You need to switch between them and repeat until you are successful. I have to say that I enjoy the thought of having many different skills for different occasions. But not this huge number of unnecessary skills.\n\nI don't like the combat system either. When a melee enemy comes to you and you have a firearm, you immediately gain huge penalty and you have like a 15% chance to hit. So you have to run and shoot, which is just unbelievably stupid. And he will come to you in one turn without any problem.\n\nWhen you have 3% chance to jam your weapon, the weapon will jam every 5 turns. When you have 87% chance to hit the target, you will miss 2-3 out of 5. When you have 18% chance to hit the target, you will hit 2-3 out of 5.\n\nThe game is throwing huge number of enemies at you most of the time, so the fights are long and boring. There is no excitement there. None what so ever.\n\nI honestly can't find a single nice thing about this game, so I won't waste my time.","October 26, 2014","false","20.7"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

Some very excellent post-apocalyptic sarcasm to be had :D\n\nGame play - loved it, obvious comparison to other genre staples aside, the game has a really smooth challenge curve, very rarely did any fights feel easy.

Learning how to build a team is key, but there are guides around for that. Over all i'd give it a solid 8/10. My reasoning is there is always a bit of room for imporvemnt, like greater customization. It also could use a few more deeper choices or branching story lines, but it does have many already so it is more nit picking thatn a flaw.

I really like deep rpg's and thought this would be my game.\n\nUnfortunately, there are little things that are a bit off and unpolished in the game. Like the delay in drag-and-drop. How some lines are voice acted but most aren't. How it's hard to hit a door's or a safe's hitbox without turning the camera (and not knowing why brute force skill can be used on a door/crate but not on a safe because the game doesn't give you any clue when you try it). How I haven't found a single upgrade to my items after two hours of playing. How you need to google what skill disarms trap because the skill with disarm in the name is actually "alarm disarm" and you need to use demolitions skill. How lots of things are introduced to the player right from the start but I'm still not sure what they do or why they are important. So little things like how to build self-teaching tutorial and a solid UI seem to be kind of missing.\n\nAlso, about the story. I just don't see it. Maybe it's too early but I'm not captivated by the world. I can't freely roam, but must move on a map between zones. It just seems like a bunch of missions on a map with no real reason to care.\n\nIt might get better. In fact, I'm sure it will get better and I will learn the quirks of the game.

Unfortunately there is not a lot to love. I know with the onset of roguelike RPG's there seems to be a consumer market for old-school difficult games but there is a fundamental difference between difficult and inconvenient. Wasteland 2 isn't that difficult it is just extremely inconvenient. Spammy and monotonous battles on the main map, no useful fast travel for getting from one area to another, and writing that, while definitely serviceable (sometimes funny), just doesnt stack up against other major RPGs. The combat is boring as hell, the upgrades system is weak and unineteresting, and their is little depth (though they can be interesting) to the few characters you can pick up that do have characterization (the main group you use is a blank slate with zero characterization). When you compare this to Kickstarter RPG's such as Pillars of Eternity there is just no comparison. Pillars of Eternity (which I am using as a comparison because it is also a kickstarter) is just a fundamentally better game.  Sure the graphics are crap (what do you expect from a kickstarter game?) but the plot, characters, upgrade system and combat is infinitely (haha  pun) better.

So, the time has come to make a judgment (preliminary since I did not finish the game, yet).\n\nWell, it is a difficult to decide, if I should recommend this or not.\n\nI will judge based on playing a lot of computer games, especially role-playing ones, but tactical, TBS, RTS and plenty more, too. First of all, I consider Fallout 2 with Restoration Project from Killap (I bow before this guy) as a kind of standard. I did play the original Wasteland, all Fallouts (F1, F2, Tactics, F3, Vegas).\nRight at this moment, this game is a disappointment for me (because I had very high expectations). The combat is comparable to Tactics (FT being better for me, but it is a matter of taste) and the role-playing part is worse than F2. It's a mixture, but it seems to me that the focus is on tactical combat with some RP decision making.\nIt is not a bad game compared to what is produced these days. I just hoped that it would be so much better. There are some things – even in combat – that take away the immersion for me. So, if you liked Tactics, go for it – but not for the current ridiculous price. If you like more role-playing I would wait till the game is modded (fingers crossed) and there is a sale.\n\nGraphics is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but it does the job.\nAudio is OK, there no catchy tune in my mind, yet – but it corresponds to the setting.\nI would like to note that there may be something along the story that will change my mind. I will update after I finish the game (I will also go into more details about those little pesky things like the enemies with infinite ammo; they don’t drop stuff they were using in combat, etc.).","August 26, 2014","false","80.8"," 45 of 84 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","45","84","0","4"

I'm not unhappy with my purchase, sure there are things that need fixed, its a beta that should be expected. But, you are able to see where the game is going, what is being done, and how its all getting put together. All of which I find very enlightening.\nI'm very excited to be part of the beta, and I'm really looking forward to the finished product. I think people will be rather surprised and satisfied with Wasteland 2 once its complete. If you don't have an extra 60$ burning a hole in your pocket, then wait till the finished game comes out, it won't cost as much and you'll get the finished game. Its not like its an MMO so the beta people like myself won't be getting any type of advantage over you.

In the before time, there was gaming, and whatever it was, we don't remember it now because in the intervening decade and some, we grew up and so did gaming. We learned that telling tales of "how hard game x was" to be far more entertaining than actually doing it. We learned how to design levels and create meaningful narratives and games that were fun to play, not just fun to have played. Oh, and we learned how to find voice actors. Wasteland 2 is probably faithful to its spiritual predecessor. I wouldn't know, because I wouldn't play that now either. The bones of a decent tactical rpg are there, but the level designs don't reward you for making use of them. Similarly, the bones of a good story rpg are there, but the disconcordant voices muddy the experience. Much like, "an arrow to the knee" cried out for a mod to stop, Wasteland 2 needs some serious fan love to be worth playing. Until the need to wander around the desert, grinding out raider encounters to level up is gone, I suggest you give this a pass and stick to New Vegas.","September 27, 2014","false","52.9"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

Your 95% to hit is really about 40%, and the levelling system is ponderous at best. As others have said, the voice acting is atrocious.  The game plays better without it, but that doesn't help all that much because the text is boring to read.  The movement is slow and lanky.  It really ruins immersion when I'm bored and watching my guys move ponderously slow.  This game has too many serious flaws to be worth playing.\n\nThe levelling system is seriously just painfully bad. You get 23 attribute points, and you get 2-5 skill points depending on how many of your attribute points you put into Intelligence.  You can't raise your attributes later on.  So if you put half your attributes into intelligence, then you cripple your combat skills so you can get enough survival skills end-game.\n\nFirst skill level takes 1 point, 2nd takes 2, 3rd takes 3, etc. You have 4 characters and you can get an npc.  You will need to level 10 non-combat skills to open doors, see traps, upgrade weapons, etc.  Another few skills if you want to get good use out of your medical supplies.\n\nIf you're a big fan of games like these, check out the Avernum line of games or X-COM: Enemy Unknown.     You can get Avernum on sale for $1-3  and it is far superior.","July 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

No, sadly, it is not.\n\nAs a squad-based RPG, it feels more like FO:Tactics than Wasteland.  There is a storyline, but the actual roleplay suffers from the lack of a central character.  You end up with less of a Fallout-style Jack of All Trades and more of a set of specialists that feels stale.\n\nThe game also seems unfinished, with many bugs still present and most problems have one real solution and a bunch of approaches to it.  The conversation choices are just garnish and a lot of interactions will result in being attacked without a chance to explain or talk it out.  Prepare to be frustrated by a game that looks more modern, but lacks depth (plenty of breadth, though).\n\nIt's been covered in other reviews, but here are the basic issues with this over-specialization:\n\n-You have to constantly switch between party members for each task (lockpicking, safecracking, defusing, disabling) and wait for each to have a small loading icon to complete the task.  The delay between selection, the poor controls, and having to swap between them makes it tedious.  All for an old teddy bear, a used polaroid, and some scrap metal (not a joke, this is the kind of loot you will be seeing a lot of).\n-Success at these skills yields XP, but only to the party-member who does it.  This means that your demo guy will be getting a lot more, as almost everyone in the wastes seems to have the knowledge, supplies, and desire to trap everything.\n-Some weapons types are so situationally specific as to be obnoxious (looking at you shotgun and heavy weapons).  Others have handicaps that don't make sense (an assault rifle suffers a penalty to hit when a target is adjacent, which the AI exploits by rushing a group of heavily armed people with an axe).\n-You have to micro-manage prior to combat to ensure that your weapons are optimally employed, but it is often a matter of getting interrupted by the enemy spotting you (no, there is no "sneak" option either) and having combat kick off prematurely while you awkwardly select and move your personnel.\n-NPCs (to include hire-ons) have a tendency to go rogue, ruining your carefully-crafted team composition and plan.  This usually means rushing out of cover and often shooting past teammates, hitting them in the process.  Tag-alongs (like animal friends or story characters) are always in this AI pattern, making you leave your positions to take the heat off of them.\n\nNow let's talk about design.\n-Levels are often open areas with little or nothing to do in them.  A few stashes (with locks, tumblers, alarms, and traps... whee!) or cliche'd NPCs and a lot of walking in-between.  You keep looking, using your perception skill, to try to find SOMETHING there, but the return is rarely worth the effort.\n-The AI.  It's horrible, devolving into people with guns rushing into range and often sharing cover with the enemy (in some cases, side-by-side).\n-Difficulty.  Harder levels just mean more HP and armor for the enemies and higher levels required for defusing, unlocking, etc.  Just a waste of time, as it makes the game tedious and not challenging.\n-Combat is disappointing.  While they did add "headshot" as a choice, the fights seem to be somewhat formulaic and the level design does not make for interesting cover-based shootouts or flanking.  It feels somewhat stale and would have benefitted from the location-based targeting of the Fallout series.  Also, the incidence of shooting friendlies is too high, making it a common occurence when AI starts rushing.  APs are too few to attempt to run around and you really don't have many options or any selectable skills to make it tactical.\n-The UI is clunky.  Rather than have selectable portraits at a fixed point, when you open the inventory/skill screen, it pops up a new set.  Baldur's Gate did not suffer from this issue, so why move in this direction?  When you open your skills screen to level up, the bars don't always load and you have to scroll to force it to do so.  There is also a delay when opening this screen, despite the relatively simple nature of its display.\n-The engine has issues with mouse-based selection, with items blocking your click with a transparent "hit box" (this happens with both terrain and mobs).  There are also times when the game does not register a click.  Not a deal-breaker, just makes the game feel less polished.\n-Movement honestly feels worse than in Wasteland.  I preferred the grid-based precision that the original had to the click and watch a throng of morons push past each other.  The ability to set up formations would be a welcomed solution (again, Baldur's Gate had this...).\n\nI'm disposed to complain, but here is the up-side:\n+The game seems pretty long and there are a lot of locations to visit (even if their maps are too bland).\n+There is a weapon mod system in which you can recover parts of a weapon (though it seems odd that it's random what you get).\n+The conversation system shows you what skills you would need to select what options, setting it up for future play-throughs in which you can make informed decisions regarding new NPC skills.\n+No crashes to date.  Despite some clunkiness, they seem to have made it very stable.\n+Some elements of the original remain and it is kinda neat to see how things have changed since.\n+The millieu is interesting, if limited.  There remain a lot of quests, both cliches and refreshing.\n\nIf you liked Fallout Tactics, you will be right at home.  If you like Fallout 1&2, you might be a little underwhelmed.  If you're looking to recapture that Wasteland feeling...  Well, it's there in some storyline nods, but the gameplay has changed significantly.\n\nThe sum is greater than its somewhat-flawed presentation.  You will get your money's worth if you stick with it, but there will be moments of aggravation.","September 20, 2014","true","44.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The kickstarter was the first time I had heard of Wasteland so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that it was a combat heavy turn-based strategy game set in a nuclear wasteland. Based on the fact that "Toaster Repair" is a useful skill made me it assume it had a healthy dose of snark as well.\n\nWhen I started the game I found out it was both what I expected and entirely different. The interface was more or less exactly what I had expected. The descriptive text and conversations were a lot more detailed than anticipated, but still lived up to expectations. [WARNING: This game has swearing.]\n\nThe fact that the interface was as expected made it seem easy to jump right in and start exploring. Wow, was I wrong. The content and difficulty were another beast.\n\nFrom what I've seen thus far the overall tone is best described as “Dark Attitude”. The rangers aren't lights in darkness, they are flawed individuals who find themselves in the roles of peacekeepers. Its not a game where you get thanked for helping, its one in which those you help will gripe about it taking too long to get there and generally be jerks. Fellow Fallout fans should be prepared for a very different tone.\n\nContrary to what I expected it was not easy to jump in. I had chosen a party of pregenned characters, thinking they were relatively balanced, and was proven very wrong. This became very obvious in the Ag Center and led to me restarting. Chance to hit was low, ammo usage was high, and eventually I was running around punching everything with characters spec’ed for ranged combat. If you don’t explore everywhere and carefully manage your ammo, you are in for a hard time. Don’t forget your shovel, safe-cracker, and toaster repair expert!\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, the difficulty, I find myself continually thinking about the game and wondering what is next. If you like turn based combat and don’t mind having to work for victory it is worth getting. Just don’t go in expecting a Fallout clone because its an entirely different game.","September 22, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Netsu/recommended/240760/","Netsu","Netsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Netsu/","135 products in account","Let me get one thing out of the way first: I do recommend this game, I think it's great and it makes me feel like I'm playing the original Fallouts again... BUT. I had very high hopes for it initially, I wanted it to be a worthy successor to Fallout 2 and it just falls short in comparison for several reasons.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the locations are graphically very busy but their size encourages to view them with the camera zoomed out all the way. This sometimes makes it hard to make out items of interest like NPC, chests and doors, I often find myself scanning the screen with my mouse, hoovering over everything trying to find something I could have missed. It's often also hard to see how high a given structure is or where are the characters allowed to walk, this is also due to the camera rotating freely and the levels not being designed to be viewed from a certain fixed perspective.\n\nMy second gripe is the dialogue system, there are no dialogue trees and instead you always have a list of topics a given NPC can tell you more about, this makes talking feel much less impactful. I do love however that there is not one but three talking skills that might come handy at different times, hard-♥♥♥, smart-♥♥♥ and kiss-♥♥♥, each of which unlocks different replies that might change the outcome of a conversation.\n\nAnother thing is the level design which often feels streamlined with one path leading you from start to end of a level. This is not always the case and there are some great non-linear locations, but I feel the Fallouts did a better job at this.\n\nLastly, I don't really feel there are that many impactful choices in the game, NPC interactions often just lead you to the one expected outcome and 12 hours in I think there was only one meaningful choice I had to make.\n\nStill it's a very solid game. The combat is pretty deep, with positioning playing an important role. The skill selection is awesome, every one feels very important and comes in handy more often than not. There is an element of crafting, you can apply upgrades to weapons or strip them for parts. Trying to optimise your team build to cover the whole spectrum of skills and to be effective in combat is fun in itself, and you can always ignore some skills and concentrate on others (for example you don't need lockpicking and safecracking much if you know how to use explosives or brute force). I also like how non-initial party members always have a chance of going 'out of control' during combat and shooting an enemy of their choice instead of letting you issue orders, this effect can be mitigated with the leadership skill.\n\nAll in all I don't regret backing it on Kickstarter and I haven't played such a good RPG in a very long time, but still it could have been much more.\n\nEDIT: After finishing the game I have to admit that there is indeed quite a lot of interesting choices in it, the longer you play, the more of them you see. I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed Fallout 1/2 and Torment.","September 24, 2014","true","86.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The problem is if you don't go there straight away and roam a little you trigger this new quest line of either going to Highwater or some agricultural station. Your 'boss' tells you that these calls have priority over you initial mission, so off you go!\nProblem is, you automatically fail one of them. While you're exploring some hydro-plant which is about to fail you get this desperate radio calls from the other mission, how they're overrun but you can do nothing about it as the hydro-plant is about to explode. Moreover, prior to the power plant mission you get some side quests which ALL fail if you don't do them first. Basically, I saved the town's power plant from destruction but the grateful people of Highwater kicked me out of town because I did not kill the bandits first, found a dog and put out a fire for them. Consequently, the wrong person gets the votes to be the new mayor. He's all in with the bandits and tells me to get the hell out of town.\nBasically, after six hours of game play I'm a total failure. Is this a feature? I don't know. Maybe this game is about priorities but the jumps in the quest system seem contrived and lack immersion this way. Non-linear is OK but if you simply say 'If you don't do missions A,B and C before D then they must have failed!' is a bit sloppy in terms of story-telling to me.\n\n***END SPOILERS***\n\nApart from that you pretty much get a product as advertised: An isometric sequel to Wasteland 1. It is all there! The setting, the desolate arid lands, the radiation zones, the bandits and mutants and all those old-school turn-based combat fights. The skill system is almost pen&paper-like but does the trick. The item system is working as intended. I really like how easy you could set up hot buttons and point and click your way to skill checks and interactions.\nI did have a hard time getting used to camera controls and setting up teams of party members but that might be my inexperience at work here.\n\nBottom line: As a fan of the original Wasteland, you will not want to miss this, but the game does confront you with certain constraints you might not consider acceptable in a modern open world setting.\nBut what do you get if you deduct the fandom? Not sure about that at this stage of development. I will restart the story with my utter and complete failure in mind and update my verdict.\nAs for now I think you get a better chunk of post-apocalyptic America for your bucks from Fallout 3/New Vegas games.\n\nWe'll see.......","August 15, 2014","false","13.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I can reduce my settings to make it work... but, ♥♥♥♥... I play the most graphically demanding games on ultra settings, and for some reason this kind of game which isnt graphically impressive in the least bit is causing me trouble? No, this game needs to be optimized BADLY.\n\nDespite the flaws of this game, I still recommend it highly.","November 1, 2015","true","72.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you love Fallout 1 and 2 and just feel fallout 3 and the new fallout 4 missed the mark, then this is the game for you. If you liked Fallout Tactics, despite it not being considered Fallout canon, then you will really really really love this game. I have played wasteland 1 back in the day and I have to say this game follows through perfectly. I beat wasteland 2 once, then realized the storyline, as with fallout, is affected by my choices. Once GOTY edition comes out, I plan to beat it several more times. I rarely do this with games unless they are topnotch.

Please read further as I try to form paragraphs and make relevant points.\n\nProbably the biggest compliment I can give this game, this is as close to Fallout 1/2 as we are going to get anytime soon.  There are lots of weapons/skills/stats and character development.  The post apocalyptic atmosphere is well done.  The game has dozens of hours of content.  The game was compelling enough for me to play it to completion.\n\nWhile the game is a positive experience overall, I have a few nitpicks -- The UI is a little clunky and limited. The balance between weapons\skills\stats could be better e.g., Assualt rifles are generally better than other weapons in most circumstances.   Finally, the skill checks encourage save scumming like no other game I have played in recent memory.\n\nBest Regards, (the)King of Save Scumming","March 7, 2015","true","120.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It s not hard to be the best when you re the only one competing for the title, but despite the lack of competition for being the best Old school RPG the game is pretty damn good at becoming something as memorable as the Fallout 1 & 2 games where for me. (Not talking about Bethesda s version of Fallout as that is clearly a different game: more an adventure game like Oblivion). Fallout 1 & 2 fans will feel right at home, not having played wasteland 1 I can not speak for Wasteland 1 fans.\n\nThe bad:\n---- Combat turn based isn't as good as in the latest Xcom game, could use a lot of improvement. But this isn't the focus of the game, so that s ok.\n----- Random encounters not always as good. But I guess these can be improved later with patches to improve them.\n\n------ Learning Curve: Hard to figure out for new players how to build your characters: f.e. in the build screen it isn't obvious that low intellingence will cap the progress of your surgeon skill/ other skills or that strength lvl 4 is needed to wear certain types of armour. You will need several tries before you will figure out what is a good party and what isn't and which attributes go well together with each other and with which other skills. Maybe that s why this game has a manual: but to be honest, I never read the manual for playing a game (I try to figure it out on the go)\n\nIt would be nice to see in a blink of an eye which attributes affect which skills and how.

Are there bugs, yes, but from what what I noted they were minimal and most have been address if not noted on the many dev forums.\n\nLet me say this, Wasteland to me is a breath of fresh air to me in regards to gaming, I'm a fan of the original Fallout 1 and 2 and will admit to have never playing the original Wasteland. This game left me wondering something about myself, I've never really been able to get into Turned based combat RPG save for a few.\n\nFor instance I can't get into any of the X-COM series...There's nothing wrong with the games, Maybe I just like post apocalypse more than aliens I guess. Every time in this game I had an idea about, I wonder if i can do this, the answer usually was yes, could I avoid contact with damn near all the wild life, due to animal wispers ability, damn near. Did it pay off to be skilled in toaster repair, sometimes. Finding out I could reprogram robots instead of fighting them everytime sure helped. On almost every instance I encountered someone the game has an option for the pasifits. Did I kill A LOT of people and things, oh god yes. But along the way the game has left you with so many options by the time I hit the "endgame" I had over 8 followers with me. I guess I can get 10 somehow, But from what I've seen I've gone over the entire map.\n\nBut that's fine for me, I've seen everything however, not in EVERYWAY I can see it. Some of my crew were idiots who could take more than 4 steps in the game and were total meat heads, BUT could punch you in half and just walked around were the most perceptive of my crew. In the end I had a very Niave boy, a drunken hobo (who activily stole liquor from other crew members), a mutant horror that loved candy, a man who  Inever found out who is is other than I think a robot speaking in latin phrases and a goat that gave my animal lover a buff along with the people I actually created.\n\nYes there is still room for much improvement which I can almost be assured is coming in the next couple weeks. Would I love to see body part by body part targeting. More story, more things to do, yes, but I must remember this is a ♥♥♥♥ing wasteland, so to want a heavily filled wasteland is kinda oximorinc. It's great for what it is now. and I can say for my money equalling now $1 for every hour I've played. I'd say yes totally worth it, also knowing that where I left off in the game it's whats known as the half way point. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I can't wait. Hell I'd pay a subscription to keep a steady flow of this, to find more of america or the world for that matter.

You take the role of four desert rangers who have been tasked with traveling to different areas in Arizona to help people in need in a world where nuclear war has taken place and is now... well, a Wasteland. The world is ridden with radioactivity, punks, fanatics, cyborgs, the list goes on.\n\nWasteland 2 is a roleplaying turn-based strategy game. You have the ability to move about as either a group or split your team members up for tactical advantages. For example, mabye one of your team members is a sniper and you want that person to stay behind and pick off the enemies while your mid to close range characters take the front line. Be careful though since this game has friendly fire.\n\nAs you start you get to create your four characters in a typical roleplaying game fashion. Place stats, choose skills, names, looks, etc. It can be very tricky to pick the right skills for each character because there are many skills to choose from and you won't be able to pick them all and still be able to use them all effectively since there won't be enough points for you to distribute for such a run. You will quickly notice that there are occasional obstacles that will require a quite high level in whatever skill is needed.\n\nOne of my favourite aspects of Wasteland 2 is the text that is constantly being displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Just like in the Fallout games, it details your surroundings, people you meet, objects, etc, just as if it was being told by a very witty game master in a pen-and-paper roleplaying game. Wasteland 2 has lots of black comedy, and I'm a sucker for comedy in games. I generally don't read most flavour text in video games, but in Wasteland 2 I'm willing to make an exception.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad to see that Wasteland 2 turned out the way it did because it proves that Kickstarter can work as long as you crowdfund the right projects. Anyone who played the older Fallout games or Wasteland 1 will most likely be very happy to play this. I would go as far as to call this the real Fallout 3.\n\nGOTY 2014.","September 19, 2014","true","32.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

There is no diversity or difference to parties anyplayer will create.\nYou will get so many xp and levels and skill points that you will be able to cover everything you might need.\nIn addition to that several skills are just superficial skill bloat, where what can be called a unique skill was simply split into several "different" ones.\nSome of those you really dont need at all, some only need a few points invested over the whole game, some are just pointless filler. If your team of seven rangers takes all of them - you will be bale to pump them all to levels more then sufficient for the game.\n\n\n\nThe setting:\n\nThere is no actual Post Apocalypse at all, its just inane, incoherent circus painted over with superficial PA "graphikz" and backgrounds - none of which play any deeper role in anything you will experience. Save one or two locations that are flukes in the overall design. It is true that Wasteland setting is a zany kind of post apocalypse, but that does not have to mean it should be cheap, superficial, incoherent and frankly speaking - stupid.\n\nThere is no scarcity of anything in the game. In fact the gameworld has more stuff in it then our current civilization has.\nWhat you cannot find - you can easily buy -and you can get as much money as you want due to random encounters and other content available.\n\nAll the factions and groups you encounter in the game are just ordinary everyday types of groups that were just put inside that incoherent circus backgrounds presenting itself as post apocalypse. There is about two exception here too - but those are mistakes and flukes, rather then what should be the norm.\n\n\nWriting:\n\nThere are two general streams of writing in this game.\nThe first are verbose dialogues and descriptions you can read in the dialogues, text box in the Ui and so on, but they dont really influence the design of quests and stories and events, nor the choices and consequences of the game. That kind of writing is nothing but a background noise to whats actually going on. Unrelated.\n\nThen there is the writing as design of the quests, areas, locations, characters and all and any choices and consequences, which is best described as continuous insults to intelligence, common sense and good taste. It is all incredible cheap schlock that most of TV soap operas actually surpass in quality.\nThe game does not have anything else to balance this bad content. It is in fact all there is in the game.\n\n\n\nThe fabled Reactivity:\n\nIs a constant stream of horrible inane schlock scripted sequences and events you cannot affect in any way. Here are some of the examples:\n\n- Whatever you choose between Ag center and Highpool you will get the same gameworld consequences for it.\n\n- Angela gets angry at you for shooting or killing civilians all the time and even leaves the party if you do, but kills some poor innocent trader for a completely nonsense reason - and that doesnt affect anything. And you cannot do anything about it.\n\n- Ralphie the idiot is drowning two meters from the dry ground (and he is actually standing in shallow water but they darkened it after i laughed at it). Next to that "lake" is a witness who rats on you if you try to help but choose the wrong option, but he never goes to help "poor" Ralphie.\nHis Juliet doesnt try to help him but runs away to a completely empty area of the map - because thats where your team will magically arrive. Angie tells you how you must go and save him but if you just leave and dont do anything she doesnt react at all. And if you shoot the idiot yourself neither she or Vargas the telepathic wizard comment on it - but if you try to help and pick the wrong option they both berate you for it. Vargas is apparently stalking you all the time through the radio - only not. (dont ask)\nBut if you do "save" Ralphie he and Juliet immediately go to a explosive rigged bicycle for more stupid schlock moments. (designed by the boss himself i hear)\n\n- Scotchmo (a companion NPC) attacks you if you try to dig the only unmarked grave in the graveyard, which is where he buried his wife recently.... and thats the only grave without a name or any marks on it. Right? Just so you try to dig it, then kill Scotchmo - then reload because the situation is completely stupid.\n\n- The ranger that sells you cheap weapons in the Citadel has a sister who had been ♥♥♥♥♥ because of his debt and now she is in hiding from that ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a stupid single schmuck who is supposed to be scary because they called him Pit Bull.\nSo now the brother who is a ranger in a citadel full of high level rangers (dont ask) - is selling cheap malfunctioning weapons to...get the money...so she can pay not to be kidnapped and ♥♥♥♥♥ again by a single stupid bandit.... while her brother is a ranger in a Ranger Citadel full of high level rangers...(dont ask it hurts the head).\n\n- There is a woman in the prison area who is sick and begs you to KILL HER. You cannot do anything about it with any of your skills. Your forced schlock choice is to kill her or to do nothing so she dies. And then nothing happens.\n\n- There is a woman in Titans Canyon area that gets her legs blown off in an explosion and she begs you to KILL HER or LEAVE HER ALONE!!! - because thats what people who just got their legs blown off tend to do, right? You cannot do anything about it, your medic and surgeon can just stand there, suffering through the blindingly stupid schlock as you do.\n\n\nThe main plot:\n\nIs the same unoriginal garbage as it was in original Wasteland. The evil robots want to kill everyone.\nIf you try and play for them - you will just get force killed after a few minutes. Because.\n\nWhen you get to California all that happens is that the game resets and you just go through same stuff you were doing in Arizona.\n\nIt first forces you into some pointlessly huge and completely empty "base" location, where all the high level rangers were killed by some stupid small doggies, and then you cannot leave that location until you go around and kill all the stupid doggies and plug some stupid holes in small walls around by clicking on them - and until you go and visit one of the two remaining rangers DYIIINNGG AARGHH. Of course, you cannot do anything about it with your skills.\nThen you go around collecting bags of cat liter... fixing radio towers and shooting stupid robots and cyborgs naked, since wearing any armor makes you take much more damage then without - versus energy weapons.\n\nThe combat:\nIs a fairly simplified turn based that is as actiony and quick as possible in its mechanics. A few weapons may feel useless but nothing too bad there.\nIts huge problems come from horrible encounter design that repeats itself through the whole game and relying on enemy HP bloat of gigantic proportions to create a false sense of difficulty. Compared to beta, nothing changed at all except enemies were given three to four times more of health points.  The additional smaller bugs and the laughable armor design only serve to degrade it al even more. Enemies have no Ai whatsoever and its all one looooong repetition of always the same stuff.\n\nAll locations and maps for combat are drowning in incoherent false cover props.\n\nToo much bad stuff to write all of it... out.","February 2, 2015","false","8.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","6"

It was a cross between Bards Tale 1 type combat with Ultima IV type world movement. It was one of the first games to include a persistent world. The manual asked you to create a copy of the game disks so that choices and consequences you experienced during the game were saved. If you suspected your entire party was going to be wiped out or a gaming catastrophe was imminent and tried pulling out the floppy – it failed.\n\nYou were prompted to read chapters of text from a booklet at key points in the game to further the storyline. Wasteland 1 was released in a world without many hard drives so computer memory was restricted. The story booklet also provided a form of copy protection. The developers included fake text to give cheaters a hard time and prevent players from reading ahead and discovering the plot.\n\nTime passes and its now 2015. It fascinates me that I have read reviews about Wasteland 2 from RPG “experts” who were not even alive in 1988. It’s been a long time. Reading these thoughts from youngsters about a sequel to a game they have never played was slightly interesting and mostly offensive. Saying that, I know nostalgia can be a powerful thing. I am glad that the passage of time has faded my memory. Some days I believe any old game released in the 1985-1995 period was a great game as there wasn’t many around. Or more accurately I could not afford that many – heck I was in school. Just look at me now with Steam or GOG – I don’t even have to leave my mother’s basement :)\n\nWL2 is set in Arizona after a nuclear event destroyed much of civilisation. It is a RPG where you can control a party of four rookie desert rangers that have been asked to investigate the murder of a veteran named Ace. As your progress through the game you can recruit NPCs that join your party who bring along their own skillsets. Lacking a medic in your party? Recruit a Doctor. 15 long years have passed since WL1.\n\nCharacter design\n\nWhen you begin a new game you can create a party from scratch or import and amend existing rangers. In an attempt to show traditional RPG credentials – the developers have given each character seven attributes using the CLASSIC method (never heard of it either – hardly classic). These include Strength, Intelligence and Awareness.\n\nInterestingly Luck and Charisma also appear. These two seem to be a throwback to D&D and live gaming with a Dungeon Master. Developers seem to struggle finding a real use for them and most players will therefore roll a low score in these to obtain higher scores in Strength, Endurance etc. I would have preferred a more balanced approach regards the attributes so that they were all equally important depending on the build or concept for that character.\n\nIt’s almost become fact now that Intelligence is the most important attribute in WL2 as that determines the ability to learn skills. Pretty soon it becomes apparent that unlike many RPGs your attributes do not always link with or enhance your skills. For example a character with 1 ST can be highly skilled and effective in a skill called Brute Force. This disparity is not quite fatal but a poor show nevertheless.\n\nThe skillset of your characters are the key factor in determining on whether you will be successful – at anything. The skills are divided into three groups, general, weapon and knowledge and each has ten levels of expertise. There are far too many for any one character or party of four to excel at everything. You need a plan.\n\nIf you want to recruit other party members beyond your base four – learn the Leadership skill as that improves their combat abilities and keeps them in check.\n\nIf you prefer to shoot first and chat later – you may want to ditch the three conversation skills.\n\nOver my 100 hours of game time – I found that levelling is quite generous and any reasonable INT team member would gain sufficient skill points over the game. I also found that combat skills and ‘how to open stuff’ skills were used 95% of the time.\n\nSkills such as Animal Whisperer, Alarm Disarming and Surgeon were hardly required. The Toaster Repair skill just seemed to be included without much thought and relied heavily on pre-game knowledge. For example, if you fixed a toaster in day 5 of gaming and subsequently acquired an item, that same item would only be of value if you happen to have it in your inventory on day 55. Items from toasters are not marked as quest items. Poor show.\n\nGame Engine\n\nThe game engine has a two-fold approach. Movement across the world map is a 2D affair – think Indiana Jones in his airplane. 95% of the game is top down, 2.5D isometric movement with a camera that can zoom out and turn left or right. Graphics were sufficient and I cannot remember any bugs or glitches. Sometimes the game would slow down a trifle in heavy combat or densely populated areas.\n\nThe local map representation of towns and places you visit is just diabolical. I struggled to find any use for it apart from seeing where your party is in relation to your entry point. For some reason the developers camouflaged the entries/exits to buildings and other locations on the local map so it takes the gamer about 50 hours to even realise they are there. Not fantastic. I thought we were going back to Wasteland of 1987 – not some crappy game from 1957. Ask the developers when Ultima Underworld was released – for goodness sake!\n\nSummary\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this game. I would really like to know if players spent more time on opening things or in the dialogue system. I would like to know why in the Rail Nomad area I had to criss-cross the various maps about 100 times.\n\nI want to know why the local map is crap.\n\nLooking back to all the press about it, I wonder about the ‘choice’ you are given at the beginning of the game and why so many journalists sang its praises from high.\n\nI couldn’t remember which items emerged from toasters.\n\nThen I met Simon Le Bon in a random encounter that was Hungry Like a Wolf and then Frankie told me to Relax. Then my heart just melted away and this somewhat not that bad game became something special.\n\nI really enjoyed storytelling for once even though some of it was boring and mundane.\n\nI really enjoyed building up my team of four and wanted them to do well. I watched over them, groomed them and bent them to my will. I was proud each time the radio sent me a message back promoting them in the field of operations.\n\nI spent 100 hours on this game to completion and the only reason I didn’t do another playthrough was because I have some urgent business working through a list of 71 other decent games.","May 26","true","111.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

If you like old school turn based rpg stategy, such as Falloout 1 & 2, old X-Com, Jagged Alliance series, Balders Gate, Planescape: Torment (and somebody needs to gtf on with rebooting Torment, that game was !@#$ing GREAT!), you're going to want this in your collection. The story thus far is pretty damn good, in my opinion, voice acting is well done too. I think it looks great graphically, and I run a mid range gaming comp. Buy it now and help them make it great, or buy it on release, but get it. Seriously. Just understand it's a beta build and treat it as such and you will enjoy it if you like this kind of game, the bugs are not that bad, except for a couple I'll note below. .\n\nThe random encounter battles as you travel on the world map are a little small in area, which makes combat down and dirty and  fast, if you're playing anything but Rookie difficulty. That can be a pro or con, depending on what you like and your play style. Feels cramped to me on the majority random encounter maps. It takes away from the strategy aspect when you're pretty much at point blank range in most of your battles, which are pretty lethal to begin with. BUT, they are still fun and it's extremely satisfying when you win by the skin of your teeth. The big battles are hella fun!\nNot so much a con and probably a bug, but DO NOT dismiss characters on the world map. At least not Angela, if you have her. I did and unless she's supposed to be gone, she's still out in the Wasteland where I left her. Hope I left her some water, I tkink it was close to a water source, or her and Ace are gonna be meeting again real soon....she's not in the Ranger Citadel either. If you take that kid you save from drowning into your party, and go back to the Citadel, leave him at the entrance or don't let him be with you when you go in, a conversation fires off between him and another member of your party when you go near the museum and you'll be stuck there, in the conversation, with no choice for a response and no other choice but to reload, and that's the only game breaking bug I've found so far. The UI could use some tweeking, status effects are hard to determine visually on quick glance; I had already played many many hours before I noticed the tiny consussion icon above the character portrait for the first time.\nOther than those issues and some very minor stability issues that are probably more related to my rig than the game itself, any other bug I've come across, hasn't been anything major. I emphatically recommend this game, it has the potential to be one of the best titles of it's kind in a very, very long time.","April 4, 2014","true","180.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Having played all FallOuts up til New Vegas with the Exception of Tactics I was genuinly interested how this game would work out. That and I'm a huge nerd over CRPGs, still considering Baldur's Gate II the best RPG ever developed.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is played from an Isometric perspective, with a typewriter on the right side describing the locations and subtitles. This game has ALOT of reading, so when you are no fan of that you should take that into consideration. Only a few important characters are voiced and your PCs are  mute all the time (Sadly we can not make our own basic voicelines like in Baldur's Gate, but hey atleast we can use our own portraits). You traverse the locations in realtime while the Worldmap has a water limitation and combat is turnbased. It is pretty much reminscent of FallOut 1&2 before the series became what is today. You travel through Arizona visiting the different locations and working towards your way to uncover a sinister plot.\n\nStory\nWarning: Heavy Spoilers ahead, read at your own risk\n\nYou create your own Rangersquad, consisting from up to 4 Rangerrookies, with different talents which you will more or less all need in the Wastes. Rangergeneral Vargas then sends you to investigate the murder of one of your fellow Rangers paired with the quest to investiagte strange radiotransmissions coming from behind the great radioation wall to the east. While the games plot starts superstrong, it will degrade over time and if you hit Los Angeles later it will drag on longer than it should (Felt for me like it). As soon as you know who Mathias is and what is behind his "war" with Dugal the plot becomes more or less predictable and the end feels a bit unsatisfying. The proverb "The journey is the reward" pretty much sums it all up. Also for a game that starts strong in meaningful choices and their consequences it als degrades in that regard. There is no evil playthrough possibility and if you try to side with Mathias he will blow you up with a nuke. (I refer to FallOut here where the Master was more than happy to add you to his army) So you are pretty much forced into a Good-Guy-Role.\nIt was not a bad plot, but it started way stronger than it finished\n\nGrafics, Sound& Music\nThe game was made in the Unity-Engine and is certainly not the prettiest one, but it does the job and all locations are unique and memorable. The sounddesign is well done and paired with the games music it can feel downright creepy at times, the perfect feeling for a post-apocalyptic game.\n\nAll in All if you liked the old Fallout-titles or you are intrested in CRPGs Wasteland 2 is definatly worth a look, even if it can feel downright clunky sometimes yet it was modernized in the right way and I will definatly see forward to a 3rd installment","January 29, 2015","true","79.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","4"

I thought maybe I can start a fresh in another part of the wasteland, but you can't go walking too far into the desert, oh no, don't go exploring and trying to have fun because then you'll die of dehydration, you need to stay around the oasis' which are conveniently located along the routes to places you need to go, mother nature you sly dog.\n\nIt's disapointing that there's nothing to do around these oasis' except fight the same raiders over and over which for some may be fun for a minute or two, but you'll soon run out of ammunition and you're party is very fragile often bleeding from a single gunshot until death. Not a problem if you have plently of supplies dropped by the raiders you've killed for no reason, but wait a minute, I can't use it because I didn't go through med school, I needed to spec my character in a particular way otherwise I'm not able to heal.\n\nThat's alright I'll just go back to the ranger base and get them to heal me up, seeing as I am helping them out by investigating the death of their friend. Nope, they'll let me buy more of the supplies I've already got with the very little money I already have. But it seems they aren't prepared to give me treatment or anything else accept for the odd 'hurry up and do your job' radio message, If only I could somehow communicate to him that our group is very close to dead and would likely not survive another raider ambush.\n\nIt's puzzling how these characters survived for the 20 odd years prior to the beginning of this game without any decent weapons or currency? Don't think about that you gotta keep focused on the story, about a ranger that was killed by a giant frog when he went for a walk? The only appeal a game like this has for me personally is story and I am trying really hard to find some story here, it's just not happening.","October 24, 2014","false","4.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

It's definitely a spiritual successor of Fallout 1 and 2 in many ways (kind of funny, seeing as how Fallout was a successor of Wasteland) - even the art style reminded me of the pre-rendered cutscenes in F1, 2, and Tactics.  The gameplay can get a bit frustrating with the absurd number of jams and critical failures that seem to occur, but once you get into it, it's really fun, especially since it forces you to rely on a balanced squad rather than maxing out every useful skill for one guy.

They don't understand how the trademark system works. inXile could potentially lose their trademark if they don't defend it.\n\nThe game is definitely enjoyable and provides a challenge even on the lowest difficulty. It's quite refreshing to find a game that doesn't hold your hand as though it's life depends on it. Even moreso with a game that actively rewards interacting with characters and exploring like Wasteland 2 does. The amount of lore behind every setting and character is fleshed out and gives a lore-nerd like me something to read, inbetween blowing people's brain's out.\nA love-it or hate-it thing about the game is that it doesn't do much in the way of quest markers. Typically the quest log will tell you where you should start looking and nothing more. While this does result in much more organic gameplay and storytelling, it can be frustrating when you've been searching for that one guy that you need to talk to for the past fifteen minutes.\n\nThe game's addition of it's humor in it's post-apocalypic setting is implemented very well. The humor is enough of a sideshow to be entertaining, without ruining the theming of the game - it reminds me of Fallout 3 with the 'Wild Wasteland' perk in some ways, just the little things.

It is so damn buggy it's stopped me playing. I only hope my $60 will go towards cleaning up the end product and make it all worth while. I mean the story is great as I'd expect. The concept solid as ♥♥♥♥ but the combat is just ok. Skills are questionable. This is after just a few hours playing the game. I think the first 1 or 2 were spent wandering aimlessly in the waste as I had no concept of how to change camera angle let alone WTF the water gague was and how to refill it.\n\nSo I finally find an oasis... I AM, FROM 1988, A FAN OF WASTELAND! ON THE APPLE II NO LESS AND I AM NOT HAPPY. Get it together guys, I know it's beta but $60? I can't even get it to full screen on windows 7. I love the story, the puzzels are great, the combat is ok but the skills and stats etc?? Did the first 3 missions which were kind of fun. The patchy loading is really annoying as is the lack of a full screen view. By highpool mission I'm a more than annoyed. I really hope the completed game is less patchy, has better graphics, more dynamic feeling turn based combat and is more imersive then just getting a portrate box with text and voice over. Maybe just some facial movement ie their lips move when they speak, expressions??\n\nSo yes I do recommend this game, if anything to give the developers more cash to polish the end product. If this is pretty close to the finished article there are going to be many dissapointed fans of the original. At least I can play the original if I have the time to indulge in nostaligia... for the price not really worth it. In the long haul if the game get's a serious overhaul and some much needed improvements then I will be a happy camper. If not, well that is $60 I wasted. If your a fan of the original, can overcome some serious glitches and bugs and annoying status effects that appear to have no cure (the plant infection WTF, even if it only last until the relevant section of the game is completed I think) confusion (expected from any beta) and a hefty price tag well this is for you. I look at it as a donation towards a fantastic end product.

It's one of the worst modern RPGs I've played.  The graphics are bad and the art design is uninspired. Many of the environments are hideously repititious. The camera controls poorly. The RPG aspects consist of ensuring skill points are dumped into a couple of specialties in order to pass checks in conversation dialogue and opening locked boxes.\n\nIn combat your options range from: Shooting, Crouching to Shoot, and Reloading. You can also hide behind arbitarily designated cover positions. If you've played XCom or Divinity: Original Sin you know this style of Turn-Based combat, and what you'll find here pales in comparison.\n\nThe AI of the enemies is basically nonexistent. They will run at you and shoot you or they will run at you and stab/bludgeon you. Upping the difficulty seems to only increase the Bullet Sponginess of your foes.  Since you have extremely limited tactical options there's basically no point in playing on anything beyond normal unless you enjoy reloading quicksaves.\n\nCombat initiation is wonky. You can attempt to arrange your characters behind cover beforehand, but this process is extremely janky and you'll probably inadvertently trigger combat before you intended to.\n\nThere are no real characters. There's a Native American companion who has a bow and is really good at sharpshooting. She talks a lot in ham-fisted stereotypical fashion. Oh and she also has a skill that allows her to Tame Wild Animals.  There's a gruff commander. He is gruff and old. There is a ranger who is sad that another ranger died.\n\nThe entire thing feels completely perfunctory.  I got about four hours into the game and had yet to decipher what the game was supposed to be about beyond meandering from fetch quest to fetch quest.\n\nOne storyline involves doing a bunch of quests for some townsfolk. One guy's house is on fire. One guy's dog is missing. The waterpumps aren't working.  If you help the people in these quests, the townsfolk will elect a good mayor. You know she's good because she's nice to you. If you don't do the quests the townsfolk elect a bad mayor. You know he's bad because he's mean to you. There are virtually no consequences in either result. If you enjoy this kind of compelling, interactive storytelling this game is for you.\n\n\n\n\n","October 18, 2014","false","19.0"," 34 of 64 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","34","64","0","0"

When I took it back, the bugs had been fixed (at least the ones that plagued my playthrough), so I went on...\nThe game wasn't as good as I expected it to be, but at the time I needed something to relax after more action-oriented games, and this one, for some time, suited my needs.\nIt quickly bored me though. It was super repetitive and combat was so boring... but I wanted to see if, progressing through the game, things would have changed.\nI had to stop again when I read about the upcoming Director's Cut: better graphics (wow that was needed!), reworked gameplay, perks, quirks, body parts aiming à la fallout... oh and CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! That's what I needed! A relaxing game that could be played on my big tv while lying on the couch!\nSo I waited. And waited. And finally it came out.\n\nSo going back to the opening of my review, why isn't this a review of the long awaited DC? That's quite simple... because I didn't had the chance to try it yet.\n\nCONTROLLER SUPPORT (my top feature): moving my guys is impossible.\nThey do half a step at a time. Animation is broken and movement is slow and clunky as hell. I google for a few seconds and see that I'm not the only one experiencing this.\nThey say that turning the graphics to minimum settings resolves the issue.\nIT'S TRUE! IT WORKS NOW!\nJust, the game, which already didn't look good, looks even worse now.\nOk, nevermind, let's ignore graphics and let's enjoy all the amazing improvements this version introduces...\nCRASH TO DESKTOP.\nOk, nevermind, let's reload and try again.\n10 minutes in, CRASH TO DESKTOP!\nAGAIN AND AGAIN!\nAnd googling around I see that I'm not the only one. And it's not the only bug. for example, a known issue concerns dismissed followers who, instead of going back to base waiting to be recruited again, just disappear...\nAt the moment I don't even want to try any workaround as I personally think such release status is unacceptable even for an indie/small team game.\nI'll sure wait for some updates (they already had one out, but it did just address the zoom level of the camera as far as I understand...)\n\nTO ANYONE THINKING TO BUY THIS:\nThe price is high. Too high in my opinion. If you really want to get this mess I advice you to wait for a 50% sale, at least.\nBut keep in mind: in less than one week Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced edition's gonna be out and I think it will be a much wiser purchase.\nOtherwise you can stick to this buggy-1998-looking-mindless-turn-based-combat-no-magic-no-combat-skill-no-real-options-besides-shooting-and-hoping-to-hit-even-if you're-on-95%-hit-chance game.\n\nEDIT: in 1998 games looked better than this one.

A strong pitch which felt like it laid out realistic goals, along with a spokesman who was hitting all the right notes. Yet what they delivered was so very bland. A combat heavy game with an incredibly shallow TBS component, one where it felt you did little more than maximise your damage each turn and terrain had little to no impact. Compared to Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall, which had built their entire editor around creating good combat layouts, this was weaksauce.\n\nMore than that though, the characters and story were dull. You have a team of nobodies, which would be fine if you had a strong combat system to back it up. The personalities you do collect are at a Baldur's Gate 1 level, and less memorable than those. Not one of the NPCs, party or otherwise, stands out.\n\nIt just all came together to form a rather dull experience, and after a while I found I just sort of stopped playing.

Do not worry, we have all struggled in such ignorance or died of thirst in the desert. To understand what the wasteland is, is to understand the Great Glow. Everything is part of it, but it is the mushroom cloud that expresses it most directly.\n\nBut, do you not need to seek the next mushroom cloud to find the Great Glow? The answer is no! Look into the eyes of a mutated animal that is about to attack you. See that energy, that life there? That is the Great Glow.\n\nOf course the blessing of the Great Glow is not for free, for nothing in life is free. Study the various wasteland guides to truly understand the Great Glow, the nature of the mushroom cloud, and understand why salvation lies only through their wisdom.\n\nAnd always keep these rules in mind:\n\n1. Tread lightly and carry a big gun and/or stick.\n2. Every animal with the prefix ‘mutated’ considers you to be its lunch.\n3. If your Geiger counter starts going off the scale, you should turn around.\n4.

Not to go into too much, but its from the same developers of the original Fallout games, joined by some of the creators of the newer versions of Fallout.\n\nAs of now, the game is still in beta but is scheduled for release soon, and yes, I'll admit, the price is a bit steep for now, but I'd suggest it once it releases, and the price drops. You get a few added things if you buy the DDE, but that's for you to decide if its worth it.\n\nThe game itself is interesting. There's a lot of reading, remembering key words, critical thinking (should I send my team in fighting? Or should I try a more diplomatic approach?) and storytelling. Quests and advancement is a little lackluster, but not bad, and every choice has a consequence. Graphics are decent, sound and music are stellar, and some of the game (easter eggs, dialogue, and random loot) are a little corny, but not bad.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys any kind of Role-Playing game.","July 17, 2014","true","346.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Wasteland 2 got a pretty cool flair to it, rough and sometimes weird characters. Lots of text, which you actually have to pay attention to - really nice to have something like that amidst the dozens of games requiring nothing of you but to look at the minimap and the HUD telling you to what to kill and how many of them.\n\nPretty good integrated tutorial function, which holds your hand if you want to but you can also just go ahead and figure out most of the mechanics by yourself. Either way works. Skill system is deep enough but not overly complex and the story kept me hooked most of the time.\n\nThe only thing that is not quite favorable are the graphics - and that is coming from someone who usually doesn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about the looks of a game. And I'm not talking about polygons or explosion effects. It just seems a little bit too blurry in some scenes, the colouring is very desaturated and without a lot of contrast, sometimes making it hard to spot certain things like crates or objects related to quests.\n\nOther than that, if you like the style of games like XCOM, the Fallout series, maybe even S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (even though that's an FPS) you might just dig Wasteland 2.","September 26, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very true to the wasteland of old, part of what I love is how you don't need to have played the ancient classic, but if you have it breathes life into many facets of the story. the gritty feel is spot on, and the skill system and character building is intriguing -- though perhaps not as fun as fallout series. It is interesting to note that Wasteland is THE game that inspired so much that came after it in the post-apoc rpg genre... so it is interesting that when it's sequel finally arrives, some of it's successors have already pushed the horizon beyond what it appears (thus far -- haven't finished yet) wasteland 2 will be able to take us. The "robots rising from the ashes of the past to take back the earth" premise has been done so many times since wasteland 1 -- at least twice in the fallout series alone, I'm kind of sad that wasteland 2's synthetics seem to be shaping up to be more of the usual as well... still, I can't write out the idea that this is a red herring as of the time of this review, but lets just say I'd be slightly sad if it's not. Wasteland 1 was revolutionary in almost every respect -- for Wasteland 2 to rise from the ashes, like the numerous armies of robots of whch I've spoke, only to not deliver something new would be unfortunate.

Not even really an rpg unless you consider a billion of supersimple fetch quests to be hardcore roleplaying. (you can complete most of them without actually going and actively fetching ♥♥♥♥)\nThis doesn't stop game from having stellar wirting and great atmosphere though, they really put a lot of work into descriptions, world building and dialogs (as simple as they mechanically are). This is probably the most text heavy game I played in a while.\nGameplaywise this game is more in tune with Xcom:Eu (combat system is nearly completely lifted from there) or Silent Storm Sentinels or hell, even Jaggged alliance 2 - combat and squad based tactics are the real meat of the game It's definitely not the deepest game in the genre, but it manages to be entertaining for the most part of it. (I do wish weapon balance and variation were much better though)\nOverall I'd say the game is a really rough gem with a lot of flaws but it had just enough redeeming features to keep me interested.\n\nP.S.

This was a game I had been watching from the early beta days but decided against diving straight in and waiting for the "final" version of the game to come out. On that note before continuing, I use the term "final" very loosely.\n\nThe first half of the game is fantastic. Hands down one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. Refreshing real choices with actual consequences. Multiple choices and decisions to be made at every corner ranging from simple attire, to devastating lesser of two evil choices that affect the rest of the game and years to come following. Great character creation allowing role-players to enjoy a world the can fully immerse themselves in. This and so much more awaits you.\n\nOn the opposite side of the review this game is not without short comings and issues. The second half of the game is anything but complete. More than ever this is a game that you save often for and making 100+ individual save files. Major quest lines are riddled with bugs and plot holes the size of the grand canyon can be found more frequently than not. While I still enjoyed the vague idea of the second half of the game, it was a disappointment after how amazing the first half was. Another big issue was balancing. Take this bit of advice. Sniper rifles/ assault rifles/ shotguns and energy weapons are the only good guns in the game. The rest are terrible.\n\nIf you enjoy turn based RPGs and an apocalyptic theme this game is for you, while I may have listed some off putting downsides especially for the second half it is still worth playing. The first half of the game does such a great job and the curiosity you will have to see how things turn out will help you through the issues of the second half. I finished this game 100% including a run on the higher difficulty in 158 hours. Well worth the money. 8.5/10\n","February 5, 2015","true","157.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Your choices make a difference to the world around in you ways few games can claim. Simply recovering a nuke can wipe out entire areas of the game making it impossible to do those areas. Shooting a guy can make enemies out of friends, can get you labeled a murderer and warned by the rangers to stay clean or become an outlaw you self. Your choices matter here. Just one thing.... this game really makes the graphics card GPU heat up. My system rarely goes higher than 60c on the worst games, this game takes it to 80c.

I mean this is a real hardcore, oldschool RPG at it's best! Early access brought on us many bugs, glitches and many times after another patch game would not run... but, now it's made a whole, there are some minor fixes left so what will Wasteland 2 can give you?\n\nGraphics: Decent. It's not masterpiece in graphical state, but it's not the polygons that make game looks, it's artstyle. And it's there! You think Wasteland 's a big sandbox? With some rubble piles here and there? Destroyed houses and cities? yes all that, but also plenty more! Gen labs, terrariums, farms, villages; there are enough places and variety to feel like home (if you're a fan of postapocalyptic).\n\nGameplay: True oldschool. Do not touch this game if you're JRPG\console raised or school lad\lass. You probably feel lost, because game require brains to play. From Charecter creation to Wasteland jorney. You allowed to create up to 4 charecters, and will meet some more on ye joprneys, team can be 7 people max. And it is important what stats and skills charecter posses. Many times to find alternate root or to unlock secret, or simply to snoop around you will need some particular skill; One charecter will not be able to be master of everything, so think, do math... still you will probably will have to start game all over after first 3 hours. Stats btw are connected, so if you want fast or strong charcter you will have to sacrifice something in order to build that charecter. So it's important to understand what do you want, not blindly jumping into a game (stats btw can not be increased with level up, only skills can. Though you will find little trinkets here and there that will amplify particular stat). And the most awesome of all -- you can write your own biography for charecter! And use random avatars! As the game starts, well it's you standart RPG; World map, quests, exploration, fights... but with a certan twists here and there. For example, while wondering through the desert your charecters will need water and rad protection (or they will die) water can be refiled in Oasis or on base still you need to plan ahead. Combat can be very hard, or simple (depends on your charecter combatant skills and difficulty level), there are a variety of enemies and some of them can be really chalenging, or will require a certan tactic to defeat. Finaly a lot of secrets, alternate roots, quests that go against each other: Right from the begining you will have a choise to save X or Y and this WILL, I repeat WILL affect game, not like in JRPG or modern adventures. No, you WILL suffer the consiquences of ye choise... High replayability value.\n\nMusic and Sound: Musik is... well it support atmosphere still you will probably won't even notice that it exist. Sound on the other hand is great.\n\nFinal verdict? If you love Fallout 1 and 2, if you love oldschool RPG that require brain for play, if you hungry for challenge and want game that will give you freedom while restricting you gently. This is Wasteland 2 lady and gentleman: a game that every hardcore player and every oldschool gamer must own.","July 5, 2014","true","42.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However this is coming from a gamer who still replays Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of steel and owns both Xcom: Enemy Unknown and its expansion. I love my squad based RPGs, turns or no. And I love the post-apocalyptic setting even more, it has always been one of my favourite areas to tread, and with Wasteland 2 I have tread far and wide, nearing the end of this game I am already looking forwards to re-rolling on Ranger difficulty for many more hours of frustratingly amazing gameplay.\n\nMany people complain that this game is too hard, and that they have to restart multiple times, but I have not restarted a single time, nor have I encountered many bugs aside from the occassional camera glitch (Exactly 3 times in 50 hours of game play). I am still playing through on my first squad roll and loving every bit of it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noisemarines/recommended/240760/","noisemarines","Rock Ironsmash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noisemarines/","166 products in account","Let me begin by saying that Wasteland 2 is not like Fallout outside of the post-apocalyptic theme, and a few design choices. Wasteland 2 is a great game, but it is not as good as Fallout 2.\n\nThe game is a good squad-based RPG that reminds me heavily of those old Fallout games, though. And indeed, I love this game much the same. There is a variety of ways you can solve most of your problems, and because of that, this game has consumed what has to have been over 10 hours of my life already.\n\nThere are some problems I have with the game. And if this game were made by any other unknown indie developer, I would have rolled my eyes and moved on. But this game was made by Brian Fargo, with help from several other veterans of good old RPGs that we knew and love, so this makes me disappointed at a few design choices.\n\n1. A few skills are a bit too divided. Unnecessarily so. Why is Safecracking and Lockpicking two different skills? Why not just make Safes harder to lockpick? Why are Blunt Weapons and Bladed weapons separate? What was so wrong with a general "melee" skill? Why is there a skill just for modding weapons? Who in their right mind would put skill points into Toaster Repair? While some skill divisions made logical sense -- obviously, in a squad-based RPG, a generic "guns" skill would be broken, and speech is basically divided into what you want to accomplish with words (Reasoning, Seduction, or Intimidation). But I honestly think Weapon Modding should have been covered by Mechanical Repair, and Safes should fall under Lockpicking.\n\n1a. And while I am at it, what is the point of the Demolitions skill outside of trap disarming? All explosive weapons are disposable, one-use items (REAAAAALLY dislike, by the way), and none of them are affected by your skill at handling explosives. Instead, grenades and bombs are handled XCOM: Enemy Unknown style -- click where you want the bomb to go and the character tosses it, with little chance of error. Now, I loved XCOM, but what the hell? No grenade launchers with appropriate ammo? No rockets for your LAWs and RPGs? No mines? (well, the ENEMY can place mines, but you can't). No C-4? Why have Demolitions at all, outside of defusing the numerous (frankly obnoxious) traps inside every other box of loot?\n\n2. No Stealth mechanic or skill. This hit me pretty hard when I realized there was no stealth in the game, because I am all about conflict avoidance in RPGs. I am the kind of guy whose priority in Fallout New Vegas was getting my speech to 100 -- the fewer bullets I fire during a quest, the better. Not to mention there were several situations I ran into that practically BEGGED for the usage of stealth, and yet, it simply wasn't possible.\n\nAside from that though, the game seems to be doing well in the "cause and effect" aspect that many RPGs sorely lack. There are tough decisions you will find yourself making as you journey across the wasteland. The best solutions that benefit everyone often require large amounts of skill in the required talents -- Unless you specialize your rangers, you aren't going to do many great things. It's a good RPG. And honestly, it has me hooked. But damnit, I DID expect better.\n\nI do recommend it though, despite its flaws. The game itself is good, it's just that I did not expect to find the flaws I did from veterans of the industry. If you liked Wasteland, and you liked Fallout 1 and 2, check it out. Of course, I must stress this -- it is NOT Fallout. Don't get the game expecting Fallout.","September 28, 2014","true","79.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mouthyb/recommended/240760/","mouthyb","wormwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mouthyb/","286 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I played the beta of this game in 2013, I was not impressed. I was frustrated with the UI, the art direction, the scripting, and the way combat was weighed. I played the original in the late 1980s, and loved the surreal and unforgiving world it created.\n\nI came back, this month, hoping that the issues I'd complained about had been fixed. I genuinely love this series and was pessimistic about its survival. I owe the devs an apology--the beta I've played this month has been everything I could have wanted (though I could always use more toasters and mutants, if anyone is listening).\n\nI can recommend this game to fans of the first game, as well as fans of dystopian and apocalyptic games. However, it is distinct from other entries in this genre, including the often-cited Fallout series.\n\nCloser to the roots of such games than the more recent entries in the apolcalyptic genre, Wasteland 2 is tactical and played from above your party's head. You can pause between turns, and sometimes you'd better think about it first.\n\nIt also has the charm of being more appropriately unforgiving--it's the !@#(*% apocalypse, the stakes are high, and I APPROVE of punishing button mashing and careless playing.\n\nKnow your save file, love your save file. The game saves less often than you might want it to, so you'll want to stay on that yourself.\n\nYour characters will have to specialize, and no single character will be able to be everything. You will want to think hard about how you want to allocate specialties.\n\nIt is very possible to make in-game mistakes that kill you and your party instantly, though you'd have to be pretty oblivious to make them. If the button says "do not push me," do no--actually, if you push it, you deserve what you get.\n\nThe wrong comment to the wrong person can touch off wars between groups, closing whole story sections to you. The appropriate choice in dialog is not always obvious, and the best choice is not always available to you, without specializing.\n\nDepending on your level of difficulty, making use of the ability to create ambushes and lead people into them will become very useful, as is developing a character able to scout ahead.\n\nThe game is still being developed, and has some on-going and minor technical issues, including an optimization problem I ran into on my rig that required me to turn down the refresh rate and render quality considerably. From reading the forums, this problem is not exactly common, but happens often enough to merit mention.\n\nThe half of the game available for play right now also seems a bit short--I'm hoping that the final product will be much longer (gimmie!)\n\nIt's hard to evaluate a story when you're missing the denouemont, but to this point, it has a familiar and interesting arc. Given the development, I'm fairly confident the finished product, based on the skill I've seen, will have been worth backing the project.\n\nA word of advice: do not buy this game expecting Fallout: New Vegas, or expecting a completely open, huge world filled with 1950s kitsch, naivete, and classic sci-fi allusions.\n\nExpect, instead, a world hemmed in on all sides by radiation and death, with the disaffection, paramiliatry themes, and violence of the 1980s. The devs have done a particularly good job of recalling the first game without simply recreating it.\n\nAnd devs, at the risk of spoiling something, the Brothers patrolling the mountain pass are just about perfect. If there's any fear close to our current, collective hearts, it's contamination.","August 17, 2014","true","41.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The problem is like many alpha and early games the changes that can and will come can drastically alter your entire experience.  In some cases an entirely new build may completely destroy what you got use to over the last 5-6 months of playing.\n\nWasteland 2 I waited until it was on sale for, 60$ price tag was justified by not spitting in the faces of their kick starter backers, and I do respect that.  Was the $40 (on sale) I paid to play this game a few months before release worth it?  I would say yes.  While not an MMO and i won't get points for getting to x, y, z before anyone else, it still is a really solid return to classics.\n\nIt shows that classic systems implemented correctly into newer engines can play really nice together.  Now I must admit i don't remember much if ANYTHING from the original wasteland, but I do remember Fallout and playing that.  This game feels more at home with an isometric Fallout (to me at least).  It plays really well, but for some it can be described as "too slow".\n\nWasteland 2 doesn't hold back on a classic experience by giving you a bunch of tools at your disposal, and giving you the freedom to resolve conflicts your way.  Save a few game breaking bugs (again early build beta), the game is overall really solidly done.  Now while playing I felt like I have in most RPGs eventually your character becomes a hoarder and you are able to basically buy anything without it having it hinder you in any real significant way.\n\nFor being survivors of a wasteland these guys sure as ♥♥♥♥ stockpiled the ammunition up.  It became overly easy to have an abundance of ammunition, also after recruiting 3 extra characters ontop of your 4, you become a small wrecking crew that is essentially an unstoppable killing force.  There are moments that will give you some pause and trouble, but for the most part i was able to breeze through the content without too much trouble, hell barely even used my medic skill yet continued to skill it up.\n\nDespite this, as you progress you start to want to ♥♥♥♥ with the wasteland's inhabitants more and more.  From the Rail Nomads and their rediculous fued, to the Red Skorpions in the prison, even the lowly little Wreckers.  All in all the game presents itself well, plays well, and has a story that is interesting enough to keep you wanting to play more.\n\nI do recommend when it releases, but I would not recommend the game for $60.  There is speculation if the game will be 25$ - 40$, and I'd recommend around those prices, but for just playing early on / few extras the $60 is up to your own budget.  A solid and promising title, with a good amount of polish and a hopeful final push before release date this could shape up to be an amazing title.\n\nAlso the promise of the mod tools after release is a killer bonus as well.","July 7, 2014","true","31.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Many people have clearly loved it, and so maybe you will too, but I feel let down and consider this a title that for me has lived up neither to its hype or even to its promises.\n\nClearly a lot of care and attention to detail went into crafting this game, as well as a long process of interacting with the community during development, and I am impressed with the features.  That they did not add up to a fun and immersive experience for me may have been primarily due to a dislike for the camera handling.  I found early on that I preferred a wide view most of the time, but the camera handles poorly for that.\n\nI also believe that the bar was set reasonably high for visual quality, but again I feel like the look achieved was not equal to the sum of the components, and possibly that has to do with the Unity engine.\n\nI have generally good feelings that Fargo's team was revived by this project and has leveraged the enthusiasm for this revival to  continue on with new projects as well as encouraging other developers doing interesting projects, but otherwise am not too excited to have been a day 1 kickstart supporter.\n\nSome 32 months after the project was officially funded we have not seen the mod tools kit that was promised.  I realize that Fargo was honest in projecting that mod tools would require further time and it will probably come someday, but at this stage of the game's shelf life I'm about ready to declare that a broken promise.

A lot of players have commented that it brings back the feeling of the old fallout games, but I can't agree with them.  The greeat thing about fallout 1 and 2 were the intellegence and humour of the games, and also the sense of progression.  The quests and puzzles were tricky, but not so much that you got fed up and gave up on them.\nWasteland 2 seems to have taken all of the bad bits of the fallout series and left out the good bits.  There's lots of trudging around the wasteland with not much to do.  You encounter vastly overpowered enemies early on, you have to cycle through reams of pointless speach, progression through ranks is slow and painful with little reward at the end, the missions are nonsensical and give you little clue about what you are doing.  The last point is the worst part about the game.  I've trudged about for hours trying to fathom out what the hell I'm supposed to do to complete the first missions.  I ended up being attacked by most of the main characters and having to kill them!

It has been since the fall-out series that I have been waiting for something comparable.\nSo there it was: Wasteland2.\nI started playing and thought:"This looks nice, this is fun. Looks promising!"\nSeveral hours in I was still playing, but something was off. It took me a while before I realised:"I'm bored."\n\nThat is the problem of the game. Looks nice (if somewhat unpolished), story line is okay-ish, but the game devolves into endless shooty encounters where the best tactic seems to be: focus fire on one target and then go onto the next one". You can outflank and stealth and whatnot, but in the end focus fire is the main thing.\nBored with all the shooting? Travel to town, here you can only talk and there is no combat whatsoever.\nSkills and characters are bland. Just dump all points into two or three skills per teammember and over-specialise. NPC's are cardboard boring figures with no depth. Your actions do not have real consequences, it may seem like it, but nuh-uh.\nIt's not a bad game, but it is just very, very boring to play.\n\nTo sum it up:\nAn okayish game, but bland and boring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djinnbit/recommended/240760/","djinnbit","Djinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djinnbit/","37 products in account","I found the game to have serious game design flaws that make me regret the purchase.  May this be a warning to others.\n\nFirst there is way to much useless clicking involved. Seemingly every action requires another useless click. For example: characters don't just level up, one needs to call in to HQ then pretend to read the useless exchange with the caption then click through a series of boring dialog options only then can one go to assking skill points. Seriously I was annoyed by this even the first time around. You have to do this each time a character levels up ...\n\nHere is another: assigning an item to a hotkey is not just dragging the item into the hotkey slot, you have to right click the item (even though the help says right-click to use, you have to disregard that) then click the assign hot key then click the hotkey. The interfaces are a little sluggish so you won't be clicking all that fast either.\n\nMaps: The maps are tiny, cramped and sluggish. One seemingly needs to always rotate the map back and forth not to miss a detail. There is always another zone to load there is no sense of exploration or adventure.  All the background are prerendered and non mostly non destructible. It is very difficult to figure out quest objectives - some objects are "indestructible" until some quest objective is finished but still show up as targetable - so you end up wasting ammo on them.\n\nCombat: The game interface is unforgiving in combat - it is hard to tell which character is in LOS of another thus in danger to get into a friendly fire incident. Combat alway seems to play out the same way, the enemy bum rushes you - and because the AI is dumb it has beefed up stats to make up for that. See that big rabbit that you shot four times already - it still has an insane range and attack power and still has the ability to quickly take down a trained well armed ranger. It is just bad game desing.\n\nTravel: The map travel is boring and uninspired, who wants to watch an icon moving on a map - there is this seeminly pointless difficulty setting of having toxic fumes appear out of nowhere thus killing your entire party. WTF game design is that?\n\nI really tried to like this game but unfortunately it lacks the simplicity and fun factor of old school tactical games such as XCOM or Jagged Alliance.","October 24, 2014","false","5.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You can spend hours just building your squad, making sure that they have the right mix of skills, knowledge and weapons to survive and conquer. Which really leads you to invest in the team member you build and train. I restarted the game so many times to make sure that I was covering all bases and leaving the right gaps for recruitable NPC's to fill. This has kept me in the first part of the game for a while now. However, having an exciting and deep background story I don't mind going over it again as it allows me to  pick up on things I've missed and uncover new dialogue that I would have otherwise missed.\n\nThere are more bugs in the game than I would expect from a product no longer in beta. Though not catastrophic, they can take frustrate and take away some of the fun from and otherwise well designed and thought out game. Also the models could use some attention as the seem to lack any real depth or contrast and on that note im also finding the camera system too constrictive in the way im not able change the veiw in all of the directions I would like. Camera snapping to charecters during combat is also an issue, it completely resets veiws and im finding myself having to constantly readjust to get the veiw back the way it was after each charactors turn instead of the black screen it leaves me with. There is also a problem where the terrain and light source seperate not allowing panning of the camera during combat when trying to move a charactor which I was frustrated with a few times. Using ladders during combat can lead to some very interesting animation where you can expect to see the charactor ascend the ladder when it should be descending and just recently my whole world map reset after a raider battle. Although the forums say there wil be patches, by the time they're released I and im sure many others will be onto a whole new game.\n\nAlthough I do enjoy playing the game I also enjoy playing alphas and I think that a lot of the features this game lacks or has wrong feels very similar to an unpolished product that should otherwise be less than $20 and have Beta stamped across it. The only real saving grace at the moment is the depth of story as the game at $40 should look more like $20 in this condition, after all there are games at this price point that outstrip Wasteland 2 in a lot of ways. So would I recommend it? Not at this price. However I do enjoy playing it but would like to see it cheaper until fixed. $40 for a buggy, glitchy game or $40 for X-com? Perhaps more time in Beta and less rushing to push the game onto shelves could have seen an amazing game to rival RPG's its predecessor "inspired" but instead, all we really get is a great story full of bugs.\n\nI've noticed people hating on bad reviews so I would like to say that this is my opinion of the game if you don't like it then that's yours.

It is just not so good that amount of money/time one gonna spend is justified to what’s he gonna get.\n\nThat being said, here is a list of things I found disappointing (list is incomplete and unordered):\nRepetitiveness of using skills to get random scanty stuff from chests, safes, etc. One cannot know beforehand if there will be random contents in a box or not. It gets boring, and save-loads before each box makes it even more miserable.\nUnrelated skills and attributes make some of latter inferior.\nSome of the weapon types are inferior to others by design. One cannot know beforehand (one third of the game it is becoming clear, and you lost about 25 hours already).\nSome of the skills are not needed to to be taken at all as some of recruits will have them. One cannot know which ones beforehand. So player is doomed to waste either time to restart the game, or read spoilers in guides, or waste skill points which actually needed to upgrade needed skills as difficulty of the game makes a sudden jump up in about half the game.\nThere are not enough locations to roam, gameplay is a bit too linear.\nIf the game has a squad-based combat tactics in it, why do characters walk a crowd and there is no way to choose a formation before the combat starts? Especially sudden scripted combats.\nNo way to revive fallen surgeon. Even paid doctors who rarely happen to be nearby cannot help. Sorry, lad, load your game.\nHow comes leaders of two different towns are both into other men’s wives?Overall it is actually a nice game, which should be recommended to a person who has spare 150 hours of time and desire to repeat one half of a game to learn what should and should not be done at character creation. Maybe GOTY edition will fix some of the issues, but I am not up to repeating this adventure.","March 14, 2015","false","79.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

Second disappointment of this year together with Divinity OS. Together they could be good game with 90+ out of 100 raiting, separate it's 45- for each.\nSo basically no tactical gameplay(Brawling starts at first turn in that tactical game with relatively modern weapon, unless you know that there will be a fight and start first - then it starts 1-2 st turn).\nI wonder how do they get 80+ and community support though, even with rabidly old fan base - there is simply no game behind it.\nMy advice - choose simplest level of difficuly(that doesn't make any difference except in how many bullets you spend), give 2 different weapon and 2-3 different skills to each toon(you have to use all skills to open all boxes), put points into 3 different ways of persuasion(yep, you cant threat on same level you can suck up) - and just RP through it.\nWill be nice japanese like story, with no - ofc.\nP.S. There is no point to compare it to Fallout - there is nothing that connects(except postacalyptic thingie) - visuals, tactics, RP - it's better in good oldies.

Mostly at the beginning of the game to be fair, but even later on there are several objects to interact with that often cause you to fail critically when using a maxed out skill on them. You then either have to accept this and carry on or load a previous save game and try again.\n\nGiven the fact that the loot often is not worth the trouble, option 1 should be the way to go (or ignore the possible loot in the fist place), but that's not what I expect of a game. Reloading (and again and again sometimes) is a slow and tedious process. May be I'm not getting the point and Wasteland 2 then is not the game for me, but on the other hand this is a personal review and all about how I like it.\n\nThere's more boring stuff in it, like quests which have you to visit the same places a few times over without the possibility to quick travel. Given the size and layout of some areas and the way they are connected to other areas sometimes causes you to sit there for minutes and tell your team to go back and forth. That's a way of extending the play time. One I don't like at all. Especially if the quest giver sends you more often than needed to the same place when all that has to be done could have easily been accomplished on the first visit.\n\nPersonally I didn't care much for the story. Cannot really identify the cause though. I found myself mostly rushing through the dialog options, only scanning for relevant key words to get through quickly - which is a shame because I think the writing itself seems to be fine. But I couldn't connect the the world like I did when playing Fallout 1 and 2 for example. In the end I tried to solve all open quests and finish the story so I could mark this game as completed.\n\nTechnically I had severe performance issues in some (mostly indoor) areas on my Linux machine and encountered several bugs. The Linux version of Borderlands 2 for example runs much better here.\n\nI'm not saying Wasteland 2 is a bad game. Most people seem to like it. But you have to tolerate a couple of things which just annoy me to the point the fun gets significantly spoiled. All in all I'm too disappointed to recommend this game.","November 13, 2014","false","62.6"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","1"

This is a game for a true armchair general, utilizing turn based combat; the gentlemen's way to fight. Including full 3d top down violent depictions of violence of the murdering of your fellow men.\nThis is the type of game in which you take your time to plot your next move. Not Run N' Gun, but Think then Shoot. this is going to be a huge timesink for me.

I also want to thank each and every baker for giving us the chance to play again a fantastic game like the ones from our childhood.\nI didn't play Wasteland 1 because I was to little. My first post apocalyptic game was Fallout 2. I remember that a very good friend of mine got me Fallout 2 and I was thinking that this is crap I mean I didn't like the graphics at the beginning of the game at the Temple of trials. Boy was I wrong. I felt in love with that game and after 2nd I played the first. After that I only liked Arcanum but although it was a great game it was not in the Fallout setting. Fallout Tactics was released and the graphics were great but that was not the Fallout I grew up with.\nInterplay lost the licence to Bethesda and so Fallout 3 was born. I liked it but it was like Fallout Tactics more of a spin off then the real thing. Fallout : New Vegas was great though thanks to Obsidian.\nBut now we have the opportunity to play the real prequel of Fallout and what a great time this is for CRPG.\nFor the ones that are asking how is WL2 compared to Divinity : Original Sin I have to say that I really like that game but I don't like the setting as much and the dialogs seemed they repeated a lot. And now about the game itself :\nI like it from the beta. I played it since the very first beta and I just love how it has been upgraded and improved in every single way. I managed to finish the beta.Now that it's finally out I am trying to take my time and enjoy every pixel of it. I am not at all bored by having to start from scratch and I already managed to do the good part in Rail Nomad.\nThe story is strong and very mysterious. The choices do matter in short and long terms.\nPeople complain about the graphics but I do like it a lot. I really love the gore in combat and the death animations.\nThe Unity engine is great and I really like that we can have a bird eye view of the party.\nThe music is incredible and Mark Morgan shows us what a talented man he is.\nMy only complaint is the lack of stealth ond steal but I can live without them. I know that steal tend to break the barter system.\nEvery day since release I just want to finish the work day so I can come home to play.\nThis game is the perfect example of the games that we love can have a big success as well as the dumb ones that have flooded the market in the past years.","September 22, 2014","true","291.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never played Wasteland 1 and only heard of this when I started playing Fallout, by which time it was already 'dated' and I never bothered to play it (which might have been a mistake!). I was quite disappointed by Fallout 3 (though New Vegas redeemed the franchise for me). Yes, it was graphically more advanced but it totally lacked the feel and freedom that FO1/2 had. Sure there was a ton of stuff to do and the world was rich, but where it lacked was the way you customized your character and your inventory. One of the things that made FO1/2 great was the sheer amount of weapons (most with multiple ammo types/modes) and it always felt that stuff was scarce and you had to use the right tool for the job.\n\nSo when Wasteland 2 was announced I was apprehensive: Would it stand up to FO1/2? I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed, and in some areas it even surpasses it.\n\nHere are a list of things I love about this game:\n- The party system. It has been a while since we had a great game where you can control all members of your party (another great game recently being Divinity Original Sin). Even FO1/2 only had a main character plus one companion model. The fact that I don't have to discard 90% of items because my main cannot use them is very refreshing. I also don't feel like I am missing out on stuff because among all members of the team someone will be able to cover it.\n- Meaningful skills. Every skill (well maybe almost every) is useful throughout the game and needs to be constantly leveled. However it's not hard to build a party that covers everything. And this again goes back to the party system. You need to create a team that complements each other and not just dump everything into guns. In fact one member in my party only had a rudimentary fighting abillity but turned out to be the most crucial to success throughout.\n- Tons of items. Lots of weapons, all customizable. At the same time ammo is scarce, especially at the start. Rely on melee to save bullets (this is reminiscent of one of the first fights in FO1 when I had a pistol with 3 bullets...).\n- Tactical combat. The combat is fun, positioning matters and many a fight can be won by changing tactics or preparing better by positioning the team. Combat doesn't always start at line of sight which gives you the opportunity to get everyone in a favourable position.\n- Meaningful decisions. I wont spoil too much but the decisions are there and meaningful and not just a simple try A, reload, try B. Sometimes it's only hours later that you realize what effect your actions had.\n- Humour. There are some great easter eggs in there that add to the humour. It's not as overboard as FO2 was but it has the same wacky ideas.\n\nSome areas where the game shines less:\n- The graphics are somewhat outdated. Personally I don't see this as too much of a problem (they are nowhere near bad) but if this concerns you, it might be a problem.\n- There is a LOT of text. Don't expect everything in voiceover. Very little is covered. Again, not a problem as the dialog is well written and worth reading, but nothing for people with short attention spans.\n\nOverall I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loved FO1/2 or any classic RPG.\n\n9/10","January 3, 2015","true","41.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This hasn't happened since the Mass Effect series and Skyrim.\n\nThe theme of Wasteland 2 is consequence. This is very much the same as Wasteland 1, but more pronounced. Everything you do has consequences, not just the little things like missing a target on the battlefield or epic things like the survival of mankind; though, those are certainly there. Your choices decides what individuals, factions, and settlements survive. Who you help affects who will help you in turn and even make new enemies. Despite the natural technical limitations of any scripted game, inXile has managed to deliver a game that provides a near a living, breathing world as I've ever seen. Even if that world is a radioactive wasteland rasping out what could be its last breath at any moment.\n\nThere is a certain level of complexity to the game, but the character system (attributes, skills, equipment, and combat) is simple enough that you can grasp them quickly. The reason for this complexity quickly becomes apparent as you find you can use different skills to try to get around the same obstacles, offering you multiple approaches to the same problem.\n\nThis freedom cascades in all things: how you build characters, how you approach encounters, the soluitons you choose, and the direction you take. Where there is a certain amount of gating (e.g. you must have these rad suits to safely proceed), you are free to explore, ignoring missions and quests as you like. This exploration can be quite rewarding as you find shrines and caches, but it can also get you in trouble as you face enemies more powerful than you. Again, consequences. Enemies don't "level" with you; so if someone's too tough, just come back later.\n\nThere's still some bugs, sure, especially once you leave the desert for overgrown marsh of LA, but none of them are game breaking and I'm sure they will get shaken out.","September 21, 2014","true","92.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The character building is deep enough that you have to really think about rounding your team out. For instance you might not want a heavy gunner and an assault rifleman because they use the same kind of ammo, which can be sparse. Every fight requires some strategization, from avoiding triggering environmental stuff to positioning your shotgunners so they don't also pellet the guy in front of them. The game is also difficult enough that I don't feel bad about savescumming. At first I was honestly wondering why there wasn't an ironman mode because that seems to be so popular nowadays, but I see why. This is one of the few games lately that can keep my attention for hours on end. It might not be for everyone but I highly recommend it for people who enjoy CRPGS because so far it's gone toe to toe with the classics and has me curious about Wasteland 1.\n","January 1, 2015","true","106.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/recommended/240760/","TheSilverHammer","TheSilverHammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/","404 products in account","First off, wait until this game has been out a few months before buying it.  It needs several rounds of patches, especially in the 2nd area.\n\nAnyway, it is rare to get a sqad based game ala Jagged Alliance, let alone one set in a post-appocolyptic world.  I did have fun exploring the world despite the bugs.\n\nI would rate the combat mechanics as a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  They are servicable and certanly can be improved.\nThe skill gain system is quite dull, such as the next rank just adds 6% to some ability (hit with a guy, unlock something, disarm something, etc...).\n\nSome of the puzzles in the game are not very intuitive.  I had to google a few of them, but hopefully if you wait a few months, there will be some nice faqs.  Even after reading the solutions to some of them, they are things I would have never figured out.  For in one area you find a screw driver.  In another room there are some odd looking tiles here and there.  No tool tip, just odd looking.  The thing is, there is no hint that you need to use the screw driver on these tiles.  Even given that, if you use the screw driver on the wrong tile (of the right kind) it tells you that you can't use the screwdriver on that.  So that would lead you to think that isn't the right use for the screw driver.  However there is one tile which looks just like all the rest of the tiles that say "You can't use the screwdriver on that" that you CAN use it on, which has the tresure you are looking for.\n\nThen there are other objects you find that have NO CLUE as to thier use, but indeed are useful to someone, somewhere.  Here is a hint, the stuff you get out of toasters IS USEFUL to SOMEONE SOMEWHERE.  It may even be useful to someone in another act.\n\nAnyhow, you might be wondering why I am recommending this to buy with the above said.  Despite all that, it is a fun game.  I enjoyed the exploration and the story.  I did not finish it because it was too buggy in the 2nd act.  Maybe I will someday because I am curious as to how the story turns out.","October 5, 2014","true","58.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In-case you don't get it PATIENCE MUST BE ONE OF YOUR VIRTUES, otherwise completing this game WONT be.\n\nLoad times are quick [1-6 seconds on SSDs], gfx are okay (for this year, could be better...) sound is appropriate including periodic voiceovers that are well done and music that is quite fitting and will make FO 1&2 players feel right at home (Mark Morgan).  Good job getting the Fallout music man to come back.\n\nWent through and got the repeaters, and then had to go to the Ag center, to do the next mission, and the whole while I'm doing this, another outpost is claiming it's getting clobbered, and now I'm poisoned, and don't have a clue what to do.  You feel a bit helpless, and at fault, and not entirely in a good way, but that may have been just me.  There is entirely too much going on at once and I'm unable to concentrate on this mission enough to solve it, while still having to go to another place after this is done.   First hour or two went pretty smoothly, hours three and four I'm out of ammo, there's entirely too much ammo management for me to put any more effort into it so in most of the battles half my guys were without ammo and getting massacred by rabbits on easy (well almost).\nMay want to invest in some unarmed skills at some point, just keep in mind to save enough skill points to get your gun skills up too or you won't hit ANYTHING.\n\nWill eagerly be waiting for Fallout 4 as this definitely is not Fallout... not 1 not 2 not any of them.  Too much inventory juggling - that was the icing on the cake and I'd have rather eaten the plate whilst I tried to figure out what to do!  A shared inventory screen would have been a wonderful invention with individual character inventories being limited to slots guns, armor, trinkets, etc.\n\nPass this one up until you've exhausted the fallout series as of late.  It can be a good game, but you will struggle to afford enough ammo unless you loot everything and take every last bit of junk you can scrounge.  There is a barter perk but it brings at most 10% discount/10% bonus on bought/sold items.  It's not that this game is bad, it can be very unforgiving and hard to keep your guns loaded let alone hit the target until your gun skill is maxed.\n\nFor those playing on a RADEON video card, I can attest that there isn't much gfx issue at all sans the water-building interior in Domonta - a little bit of flickering, but can still play fine.  You're only in there for the duration of one battle anyways so regardless, it won't be too much issue.\n\nI have updated my review a bit, after playing 30+ hours (it is a long game, I'd say im half-way through it), and it feels like a touch of fallout tactics along with fallout 2.  I'd have to say that players who enjoyed the late-90s playthrough of Fallout 1 and 2 will feel at home here in the setting - all the way down to accidently nuking some religious cult - oops... heh.  Though I will say you can with assuredness tell that this is the first-go-round for some of the people creating the game, it is NOT shoddy work by any means.  There is much fun to be had here, and much humour to snicker at if you have the patience.   This isn't DooM, this isn't run-and-gun and blast through everything with reckless abandon...this is it's own game.  A 25-40$ USD price-tag seems appropriate here, and I think most people would be satisfied with the game for this.  That being said, it isn't nearly as crashey as Fallout 3 and New Vegas were out of the box (or possibly even now years after release), so don't let me sell it short.  Watch some videos, read the reviews and decide for yourself.  Try not to get discouraged before getting to level 15-20 or so with your characters, as it gets much more rewarding when you can actually afford ammo AND hit the target in battle.  I would also mention on this last note that the age-rating for this game applies to both the violence and the difficulty mentally that you may have if you lack extremely good problem solving skills (teenagers barring some ingeniously crafty ones may have trouble).  Good luck.\n\nRecommended to take a field medic-surgeon, weaponsmith, locksmith/safecracker, and someone with keen perception and good with knocking down obstacles with you on your first try, you'll get more characters in your party at a later date if you so choose.  You still won't be able to do everything your first time.  This game for most will be good for more than one play-through.\n\nJust buy up all the ammo & health-items you can afford, seriously.","October 27, 2015","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Favmir/recommended/240760/","Favmir","Favmir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Favmir/","44 products in account","Looks like lots of reviewers are already familar with this genre (like the classic fallout series). Well, as a newcomer, I'm writing this review for all rpg newbies like me out there.\n\n- Background:\nThe world is destroyed by nukes, hundreds of years passed. Your home area is isolated by radiations, you don't know much about what's beyond them. You're(will be) a new member of the Rangers, an organization trying to keep order and peace of the area. It's not about the nukes(generations passed), but more about the post-apocalypse-world-people-sucks-thing-ness.\n\n- Gameplay\nTop view, you control four characters(Unless they're dead) + followers you picked up. You talk to people, get quests, get random abandoned loots yadi yada.\nAnnnd most importantly, the battle. it's turn-based. Every character gets a turn(some get more often than others - fast and smart ones). You can attack, move, ambush etc during that turn, each move using up your points for that turn.\n\n...how do I explain this game...It's freakin' huge, for one. I don't know if this is the usual standard for this genre, but the devs thought of everything, really. For example, you can use lockpicking on a locked door, but if you fail...you can try again. Of course! I didn't even think that was possible for some reason the first time, but then I realized that it makes much more sense. But if you make a 'critical failure', the lock mechanism breaks and you can't lockpick it anymore. BUUUT you can repair it back with your 'mechanical repair' skill and try again. Also if all of that fails, you just smash the door by force(which also has a chance of critical failure).\n\nSame vibe goes for the battle. I learned not to shoot enemies with sniper rifle when my teammate is in the way the hard way.\n\nAll your characters can die, and the game will keep going. Unless all of them are dead, of course. In that case, the game says, "Well, all of you died in the wasteland. We don't have fancy ending for that, few people will even remember you anyway...bye bye"\n\nIt's intended as a game where you're NOT supposed to reload after a failure, I think. It's like the game's saying, "Oh, you failed! Well, take your responsibility, live with the consequences from now on. We've already prepared another ending for ya...and it will affect your future quests as well"\n\n[THING I'D LIKE TO BE IMPROVED]\n\nA few things, but I'm picking mostly on character models. Yes, I know I can't really see them in-game, but when I'm in this fiction-writer mode and trying to bring my imaginary characters to life, the horrible models kinda puts that out.\nFor examples:\n- Clothes are limited, and most clothing you find in-game have the same model with just different name tags...and seriously, ripped stockings and deep v-neck all the way to nipples for male characters, but not any decent looking shirts? Every clothing should have individual thumbnail as well.\n\n- Hairs, at least color option PLEASE. No, I'm not just saying this for pretty female characters. Out of all my four characters, the only one I can tell by looks is the one with red hair model. HAIRS ARE IMPORTANT\n\n- Weight option maybe? I want to make my fat middle aged male shotgun surgeon look more like himself :'(\n\n- I know it's hard to give us customization options like skyrim or something, but I want at least some pretty face models. And yes, I'm one of those people who'd like my character physically attractive.\n\n- They could really do with some more dramatic camera movements. Like if one of your characters dies, instead of a simple popup saying your member died, how about some dramatic slow-mo closeup on him falling? or","December 7, 2014","true","185.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In-case you don't get it PATIENCE MUST BE ONE OF YOUR VIRTUES, otherwise completing this game WONT be.\n\nLoad times are quick [1-6 seconds on SSDs], gfx are okay (for this year, could be better...) sound is appropriate including periodic voiceovers that are well done and music that is quite fitting and will make FO 1&2 players feel right at home (Mark Morgan).  Good job getting the Fallout music man to come back.\n\nWent through and got the repeaters, and then had to go to the Ag center, to do the next mission, and the whole while I'm doing this, another outpost is claiming it's getting clobbered, and now I'm poisoned, and don't have a clue what to do.  You feel a bit helpless, and at fault, and not entirely in a good way, but that may have been just me.  There is entirely too much going on at once and I'm unable to concentrate on this mission enough to solve it, while still having to go to another place after this is done.   First hour or two went pretty smoothly, hours three and four I'm out of ammo, there's entirely too much ammo management for me to put any more effort into it so in most of the battles half my guys were without ammo and getting massacred by rabbits on easy (well almost).\nMay want to invest in some unarmed skills at some point, just keep in mind to save enough skill points to get your gun skills up too or you won't hit ANYTHING.\n\nWill eagerly be waiting for Fallout 4 as this definitely is not Fallout... not 1 not 2 not any of them.  Too much inventory juggling - that was the icing on the cake and I'd have rather eaten the plate whilst I tried to figure out what to do!  A shared inventory screen would have been a wonderful invention with individual character inventories being limited to slots guns, armor, trinkets, etc.\n\nPass this one up until you've exhausted the fallout series as of late.  It can be a good game, but you will struggle to afford enough ammo unless you loot everything and take every last bit of junk you can scrounge.  There is a barter perk but it brings at most 10% discount/10% bonus on bought/sold items.  It's not that this game is bad, it can be very unforgiving and hard to keep your guns loaded let alone hit the target until your gun skill is maxed.\n\nFor those playing on a RADEON video card, I can attest that there isn't much gfx issue at all sans the water-building interior in Domonta - a little bit of flickering, but can still play fine.  You're only in there for the duration of one battle anyways so regardless, it won't be too much issue.\n\nI have updated my review a bit, after playing 30+ hours (it is a long game, I'd say im half-way through it), and it feels like a touch of fallout tactics along with fallout 2.  I'd have to say that players who enjoyed the late-90s playthrough of Fallout 1 and 2 will feel at home here in the setting - all the way down to accidently nuking some religious cult - oops... heh.  Though I will say you can with assuredness tell that this is the first-go-round for some of the people creating the game, it is NOT shoddy work by any means.  There is much fun to be had here, and much humour to snicker at if you have the patience.   This isn't DooM, this isn't run-and-gun and blast through everything with reckless abandon...this is it's own game.  A 25-40$ USD price-tag seems appropriate here, and I think most people would be satisfied with the game for this.  That being said, it isn't nearly as crashey as Fallout 3 and New Vegas were out of the box (or possibly even now years after release), so don't let me sell it short.  Watch some videos, read the reviews and decide for yourself.  Try not to get discouraged before getting to level 15-20 or so with your characters, as it gets much more rewarding when you can actually afford ammo AND hit the target in battle.  I would also mention on this last note that the age-rating for this game applies to both the violence and the difficulty mentally that you may have if you lack extremely good problem solving skills (teenagers barring some ingeniously crafty ones may have trouble).  Good luck.\n\nRecommended to take a field medic-surgeon, weaponsmith, locksmith/safecracker, and someone with keen perception and good with knocking down obstacles with you on your first try, you'll get more characters in your party at a later date if you so choose.  You still won't be able to do everything your first time.  This game for most will be good for more than one play-through.\n\nJust buy up all the ammo & health-items you can afford, seriously.","October 27, 2015","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a long time we were left with a very skeptical mood toward Wasteland 2… And it lasted until last week, when we got its release version on Steam.\n\nGuys, it turned out to be very interesting! I.e., this game, of course doesn’t have anything in common with either Fallout 1&2&T, or with After Reset RPG… But it doesn’t even have to be like them, or even be a classic RPG. It has its own interesting style/setting/mechanics/gameplay… In general, I personally don’t understand what exactly its secret is, but it’s really cool and fun to play. I played all weekend without stopping (and there’s no end or border in this game), and I’ll be very happy to back Wasteland 3!\n\nOne nuance: two times in the beginning I thought of deleting the game after creating a character (a sentiment I’ve heard from plenty of gamer friends). I really didn’t like the character portraits, and I don’t like to play as a big faceless group. But Brian Fargo has slyly provided for the ability to load your own portraits and delete the others besides your own character from the group. We’ve prepared a character portrait pack from After Reset especially for you: http://indiedb.com/games/after-reset/downloads/after-reset-rpgs-custom-avatars-for-wasteland-2.\n\nI’m sure that even if you’ve had doubts, with our pack, Wasteland 2 will sparkle with fresh colors for you! You have to play it; the game is really worth it!\n\n- Richard Nixon, Black Cloud Studios, http://afterreset.com","October 11, 2014","true","124.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play a group new recruits out to investigate the death of a fellow Ranger, but get sucked into something much bigger.\n\nIt doesn't quite have the depth of games like Baldurs Gate, but the humour it gives, the world it portrays and the character you meet are really diverse, from your lowly farmer to the suicidal mini-nuke cult thing who's name escapes me!\n\nIf you grew up with BG, or IWD, this is very good return to those nostalgic days.","March 28, 2015","true","72.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite simply when I kickstarted this game, Brian Fargo liked to go on and on about how they wanted to get away from big Publisher models, always being on the hook to publishers just seeking profit. But then they have been going out and trying to force developers with complete success so far, to change the names of their games if it contains the word Wasteland.\n\nYou know its funny, because thats exactly something a publisher would do, they would throw money away pursuing these things instead of making games like Brian Fargo claimed thats what he wanted to do. Its understandable to engage in these legal matters when a game is intentionally trying to ape your stuff, but in every case the only similarity between titles, was the word Wasteland.\n\nHave the courage to stand for something InXile, no one is going to try and USURP the Wasteland IP by making ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little indie games. I won't be sending you anymore of my money(unless you get the Fallout IP back and make Fallout games). So yeah, Never again.\n\n\nOriginal, still true review below:\n\nI have about 110 combined hours between Wasteland 2 Classic and the Director's Cut.\n\nI backed this game on kickstarter and was pleased with Wasteland 2, to get the Director's Cut after for free was a huge bonus for me.\n\nThe game itself plays like a squad-based Fallout 1 and 2, but in its own 1980s style post-nuclear setting. The RPG elements are solid but the game is combat focused which I am happy for. You get a number of useable skills to to do quests with, find hidden objects and loot. There is a ton of flavor text everywhere you go which help adds to the immersion and feeling of the game which I love. The music is a perfect ambient style soundtrack which hits all the right notes and there is an ambient soundtrack for areas aswell to help add to that immersion.\n\nThere are tons of things to do in the wasteland and plenty to shoot aswell. Lots of weapons to choose from and different types of armors to wear. You can find clothing to dress your rangers up if you want, or will need to find clothing if you get it burnt off in combat!\n\nI think if you enjoy squad based turn based combat, you'll like this game. If you enjoy post-apocalypse settings, you'll enjoy this game. If you like to read and use your imagination, you'll like this game.\n\nIf you liked Fallout 1 and 2, you will like this game.\n\nI found a Speak and Spell(remember those?) and pawned to the vendor for 8 scrap, it doesn't get much better than that.\n\n9/10","November 4, 2015","false","50.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is what happens when you let talent of the likes of Brian Fargo and his dream team of writers and designers (and Mark Morgan) create the game they wish to make: a love letter to classic CRPGs full of rich descriptive text and atmosphere, amazing depth in options, laugh out loud ridiculousness, and several truly chilling moments.

This is what happens when you let talent of the likes of Brian Fargo and his dream team of writers and designers (and Mark Morgan) create the game they wish to make: a love letter to classic CRPGs full of rich descriptive text and atmosphere, amazing depth in options, laugh out loud ridiculousness, and several truly chilling moments. In an age of gaming where we've grown tired of pressing the win button, Wasteland 2 throws hundreds of possibilities in your direction and doesn't even pretend to try to hold your hand, allowing you the joy of discovery and surprise as your decisions often leave no clear cut winners.\n\nYou'll often find yourself under-equipped and struggling to keep your party members alive, tossing those last few rounds of ammo to a teammate and praying for their 35% hit probability to go your way after enemies have left you devastated. And right when you think you've gotten the hang of things, new scenarios will put you firmly back in your place.\n\nWasteland 2 is a shining beacon of what games once were, and a sensational example of what they very well can be today when the fans - and not profits - come first.","September 27, 2014","true","192.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Wonderful writing, haunting atmosphere, a universe that straddles the line between believable and silly (though the use of CDs as jewellery is a bit much) and the satisfying sound of a bullet (or bullets) tearing through some schlub's skull make this a must for those craving a hit of old-school Fallout.\n\nEven better, if you remember the original Wasteland, there's tons of lore call-backs here to reward your playtime. Knowing the exact details of Highpool or Base Cochise isn't necessary, though - exposition galore takes care of that for series newbies.\n\nI would like to see skill use streamlined, through.

Wasteland 2 may not have the best graphics, but for a game on a budget, it did pretty good. The game definately does things better than some games that came out in 2014. However, there are a few bugs. Such as characters not wanting to follow where you tell them to and your mouse disappearing, but usually these can be fixed with a quick restart of the game out return to the main menu. I found myself laughing at the little things in Wasteland 2, as well as reading it's what seemed like endless lore, doing it's numerous side quests, and replaying the game to see the affects of the choices I did not make in my first run. In all I give Wasteland 2 a 9/10 since there are some bugs that need to be fixed and the character customization could use some work ( the characters look pretty bad and ugly close up), but in all the game is really fun.","January 10, 2015","true","49.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Ranger customization really gives you a sense of connection to your team and there are some really interesting NPC characters you can interact with, some can even join you in your mission.The game itself is quite fun, holding simple, yet fun, turn-based combat combined with a well paced leveling system, a wide array of different skills your characters can spec into, and writing that you can tell had a lot of love put into it. I can tell the devs of Wasteland had a lot of fun and enjoyment with this game, returning to the roots of classic video games with their encouragment of exploration and higher difficulty.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is worth your time. Though with any game it may take some getting used to. This is very different from the typical video game that comes out these days, retaining it's old concepts of exploration, branching paths, missions that can be failed without a game over (most of the time) and even have worse consequences than a game over, and requires you to manage who is talking with whom when you have a charisma guy in your party.

Haven't had a single crash after that.\n\nAbout the game, Wasteland 2 is not for everyone. Not by a long shot. It requires patience, thinking and in some cases, nerves of steel. The top-down view and turn-based combat may turn some people off. It's a hardcore RPG where your choices, starting from the very beginning at character creation, have lasting consequences throughout the game. If you're looking for an experience similar to the more recent Fallout games, you won't find it here.\n\nThe character creation is intimidating at first, especially for newcomers to these types of games. There are tons of skills and you have no way to know in advance which are useful and which are more situational. I suggest consulting a character creation guide, but if you want to do everything on your own, one tip: make a team of specialists. After character creation, it's good to keep in mind these three things: Talk to EVERYONE, LOOT everything that isn't bolted down (or if it is, Brute Force can help with that ;)) and do EVERYTHING you can before moving to the next area. If you miss something, it might mean missing out on quests, companions or loot.\n\nThe combat is tactical and turn-based. Director's Cut added precision strikes, which are not too useful at the beginning but can be lifesavers late in the game. It also brough some flavor to the combat system, which can be somewhat tedious at times. I found most of the quirks to be quite useless; their downsides were either too bad or they were too situational.\nSame goes for perks, they were a nice addition, but when selecting perks I had difficulty finding ones that were actually useful. Overall, precision strikes, quirks and perks feel somewhat like an aftertought; they're there and they're nice to have every once in a while, but they aren't really crucial to completing the game.\n\nThe weapon rebalancing of DC was a welcome addition. Assault rifles and Snipers are still king, but Shotguns, for example, now actually have some use. SMG's and Handguns still suck, though.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game to everyone. While it can be somewhat tedious and difficult at times, it's still a whole lot of fun. The world is huge and there's plenty to do, like blowing off the heads of raiders or solving feuds peacefully.

What is the appeal? With their emphasis on story over gameplay, why not just read a (good) book? Why interrupt the (maybe good) story with some of gaming’s weakest gameplay?\n\nSince then he’s likely discovered that there ARE good RPGs, and that good RPGs don’t emphasize story over gameplay; rather they emphasis both.\n\nIn fact, the only key difference between an “RPG” and, say, a shooter like Half-Life is that in an “RPG” the development of your avatars’ virtual skill is emphasized (via leveling up, getting more powerful items, etc.) over your muscle memory skills.\n\nAnd here we have Wasteland 2, and like most old- AND new-school RPGs, it manages to emphasize neither gameplay nor story.\n\nYou may at first find this hard to notice if isometric (“old-school”) RPGs are new to you. Even I was smitten. So turned on was I that, a dozen hours into the game, I donated $30 to InExile’s Torment project (OOPS!), to be followed an hour later by Wasteland 2’s depressing emptiness finally crashing down on me (♥♥♥♥!!!). Its gameplay proved to be just drudgery. To get a picture of it, imagine XCOM, but not anywhere as good, and with the saving angel of “reloading the last save” always being available? Now consider that to play without the reload function would render the game impossible to win within a lifetime, OR SO easy (because you can change the difficulty at any time) that there’s hardly any drama at all. Now add to this an inventory system that demands so much of your “play” time (a time-destroying chore similar in fun to data entry, except you don’t get paid). Then throw in the various versions of locked doors and chests and whatnot that all have their own skill trees. I want to underscore the fact that this last feature is neither fun nor intellectually stimulating, and that you need to do it to win the game. If, InExile, you are going to make your players spend a lot of time deciding where to invest their skill points, then at least make the payoff’s worth it. Make it so there are AWESOME rewards for opening stuff—a cool joke, a sexy weapon or armor set that you won’t find from enemies or shops—not just , soon-to-be-forgotten items.\n\n[There are also bugs, which, to their credit, they’re continuing to address.]\n\nNow for some almost good news. The writing is almost good.\n\nBecause of the setting—a nuked one—they, like Bethesda, have gone the mostly-serious tone route. There are moments of cruelty in the game that invoke the horrors of real, demonic human beings, atrocities that happen in, say, Syria and the Congo. And sometimes it’s effective. For example, there’s a scene where a character died a horrible death, and as he or she lay dying, he or she told my party to deliver something to another character in some town. Well, I went to this town and got distracted.\n\nAnd many hours later, across the Arizona map away from the town, I thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥! I forgot to deliver that object!” And I trudged across the game world back towards that town, knowing that it would put me in boring battles with weaker enemies. That is a moment of video game art that taught me something about myself.\n\nMoments like these are rare in the game, and the writing is mostly grim for no other reason than to remind players that nuclear holocausts are bad.\n\nAs for strong characters; I think the leader of the Desert Rangers is named General Vargas. There’s also the Matthias guy. Aaaaand those are all the names I remember from my 50+ hours of playing.\n\nAs for the plot, it’s an uninspired, boring cliché. To give you an idea of how zero it is, consider this. During the first half of the game, in the Ranger HQ, there’s this nuclear weapon in a museum. And when you press the wrong button, the place explodes and you get a Game Over screen that says, due to there being no Desert Rangers, Matthias and his Robot Army conquer the human race. In other words, InExile do not care about their own story enough to make a truly mysterious (or at least funny) enemy; this of course explains why the plot twists are so pathetically predictable that they basically don’t exist.\n\nThe NPCs talk a lot of “who is this Matthias person” emptiness, to which I respond, “OH C’MON, HE’S OBVIOUSLY A BORING ROBOT HITLER!”\n\n[Robot Hitler, by the way, would be a more compelling, entertaining villain than Matthias.]\n\nSo if the intellectual bits are rare, and the characters are boring, and the plot is boring, then is it funny?\n\nNope. There’s at least one homage to a famous comedy. But basically that’s it. Visually they could have done many funny things—this is a 3D computer game, after all—but basically we got nothing. What missed opportunities…..To underscore how much these devs missed the mark, consider this: early in the game there’s a place you can opt to rescue from a giant flora infestation. What the developers could have done with this was pit your Rangers against, say, killer salads, aided by giant, banana-toting bananas. But what did InExile do? ZOMBIES! They made it so the plants infected the local fauna, turning them into zombies. Jesus Cliché Christ.\n\nAs for the graphics in general, it’s black, brown, green and grey. There’s some red for blood.\n\nI do like the bullets flying and the body parts falling, especially when said body parts fall because someone hit the person with a blunt object. I also like some of the lasers. And the large robots look cool. Mostly I like the fact that you can dress your group like the Three Amigos. That was fun for twelve seconds.\n\nThe game also features sound.\n\nSCORE: 3/10\n\nBack of the Box Statement: “Is there too much happiness in your life?”","December 3, 2014","false","55.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, if you only care about combat and don't care about things like quest design or reactivity, you'll probably get bored.","January 1, 2015","true","89.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Definitely an improvement over similar modern titles in the like of XCom, however compared to the classics the tactical options still fall tremendously short.\n\nI also have trouble seeing past the walls of text - in the end, I just didn't care. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the storyline, the game just left me with a general sense of "meh".\n\nThe throwbacks to pop culture were initally funny, but dragged on and ultimately became just another "meh" moment.\n\nThe skill system became trivial towards the end of the game, where there were more than enough points to go around.\n\nDifficulty curve? The "difficult" part of the game is scaled by opponent health, which, after carrying around launchers for most of the game, quickly disappeared. I think the "hardest" part of the game was working out which option to choose, which in itself is another attempt at "grey" decisions.\n\nSpoilers ahead;\n\nI saved the AG centre. I never saw ANY repecussions in the game world for not saving Highpool, besides a slightly different map and a shout-out at the end of the game, trying to guilt trip the player because of a choice they could do nothing over. If I'd saved Highpool, I probably wouild have received the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nI also defused the nuke in the canyon. The monks disappeared? No cares whatsoever - I never saw any repecussions in my game, except for a slightly different map on the way out of ♥♥♥♥-central.\n\nOverall, a very solid "meh" out of 10.\n\nDidn't care about the story, didn't care about the characters, didn't care for the combat system. Not even sure why I finished it, but I did. So that's something.","October 1, 2014","false","41.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

RPG Turn-Based Strategy Game, one of those games that are yet to amaze you. Though the high price, the game still seeks true content it contains. Getting to create your own characters (Rangers) with specific skill abilities, traits, and more! The maps are fantastic, I'm still exploring one map for over an hour looking for treasure, supplies, etc. It took me over 30 minutes just to create 4 characters so I can organize my team. The missions so far are good, the given content is exceeded over good, but great. Kinda hard to play, but I will get along because of the deep gameplay it gives. Though it's difficult to start at first, you will learn it soon enough as I am. The game isn't perfect since it contains some bugs, but it's still worth it.

The guy who tried to land the Desert Rangers in trouble with them is scared for his life because I dobbed him in as the true culprit - even after he helped me put things right, even after I said I wouldn't. He runs off to get his scaly mates all wound up and ready to make trouble.\n\nI think about it for a split second then headshot the stupid bugger. He can have his little hissyfit, but there's no way he's stuffing up this unexpected and welcome truce, Not while my sniper's rifle is loaded.\n\nThen I realise the effect this game is having on me. I'm horrified with myself. I rationalise the decision: the guy was too dumb to live; he'd have only got more innocent people killed; he was trying to covertly start fights he couldn't finish; at least if I put him down like this the other mob wouldn't torture him to death or something. I'm even more horrified at the rationalisations. I wonder if the game even has an event path for what I just did. Would his friends jump me next time because of a bug, or did he need to actually make it back to his friends to trigger that situation? Would there still be a truce when I got back? Did I really take care of the problem?\n\nThe problem. Huh. That problem had a name. And friends. Possibly a family.\n\nThis game is getting me to play like an amoral hardcase for the first time ever (usually I do my best to be a good guy) - and I simultaneously love it and fear it for that. Not because it's fun but because everything is a moral grey area, every success has a bit of failure in it, and it's rare for everyone to make it out alive and unscathed.\n\n10/10","September 28, 2014","true","34.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There's an ambush attack similar to overwatch from XCOM which is pretty useful, but there aren't any aimed shots except for headshots, which are pretty boring. The weapons are seriously imbalanced, with assault rifles becoming really good about 1/3 of the way through, and godlike in the end-game.\n\nThe quest design is decent; there are a handful of major quests in both areas of the game that are pretty complex and fulfilling to solve but the majority of them are short and combat focused.

I recomend it highly, it was worth my 60 dollars to play it in the early release it is definitely worth the 40 dollars it is now.   It has come a long way since the Early Access review that I did, so I am updating it now.\n\nThis game plays very much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fallout Tactics (minus the real time option).  In it you will create 4 of your own Desert Rangers and then head out into the wastes and explore, and either clean up the wasteland or kill everyone and thing in your path.  Along the way you can recruit many extra characters to your cause, each with their own personality and traits, up to 3 may travel with you at any given time.\n\nThe difficulty of the game varies sharply depending on how you choose to play it.  Early on most enemies you fight will be much weaker than you are, however you are not forced to play the game in any linear fashion and as such you may wander into areas with much stronger enemies than you are prepared to face (not that you can't win but it can be brutal).\n\nThe ability to go where you want and do what you want flows throughout the entire game.  You can sweet talk people into giving you what you want, threaten them (with the proper skills) or if that fails shoot your way through.  Wall in your way?  Use a grenade.   Person make you mad?  Shoot him, or don't.  Raiders take over a town?  Negotiate or kill them it's all up to you and how you want to play.  Most choices have concequences further down the line, some amusing and some well down right destructive, even when you think you are making the right choices nothing is ever black and white.\n\nYou will collect all kinds of weapons and armor, and most weapons can be customized by stripping down others for base parts.  Everything from WW2 rifles to futuristic laser weapons are represented each with an optimal range, armor penetration and rates of fire.  In battle many of your enemies will show up with different kinds of weapons, often enough you can kill them an take it for yourself.  The various enemie types also force you to prioritize targets: Do you kill the big guy with the sword made out of the one way sign (yes, they really are swords made out of sign posts and one way signs) attacking your medic, or do you take out the guy who is still too far out to hit you but is charging with grenades that will hurt everyone?  Oh and friendly fire is a thing, don't try and use a shotgun from behind your own people.\n\nCharacter progression is handled in an RPG like fashion with skill points gained at every level and ability points every 10.  You can be a generalst and do a bit of everything but nothing well or you can specialize each of your characters (highly reccomend you do) into different things.\n\nI broke my basic team into:\n\na) Sniper / Lockpicks / submachine gun - gave me nice range and something when stuff got closer\nb) Sniper / Perception / Kiss A** / Submachinegun - can see traps still shoot far and sweet talk\nc) Heavy weapons / Safe Cracking / Assault Rifle - HMG to mow down eneies - rifle to consere ammo\nd) Energy weapon / First Aid / Rifle / demolotions - can remove traps and is the field medic\n\nThen I picked up and kept in my party a\n\ne) A drunkard shotgun specialist whom I also turned into the groups weaponsmith (because drunks make the best weapons right?)\nf) Lady scientist who can hack any computers and is handy with a pistol (and later rifles)\ng) Young kid who's life I saved,  he started with brawling and ended with rifles pistols and the ability to talk to strange animals.\n\nI built my team knowing that I would go to a specific place and pick up a particular npc.. how you create your team is entirely up to you and playing around with different builds is half the fun.\n\n- Pros -\n\n- Great turn based combat.\n- Easy to understand mechanics\n- Fun!\n- Lots of humor built into the game\n- So many different ways to resolve things in the game\n- Ability to break your own missions through poor choices (and sometimes good ones) requiring some creative solutions to be used to move on.\n- Solid strategies will win most fights.  Using cover, hitting clusters of enemies with a grenade etc.\n- Ammo doesn't grow on trees, making conservation of rounds part of the strategy.\n- All different kinds of weapons with all kinds of pros / cons built into them.\n- Not all weapons are a straight forward upgrade, sometimes you just have to try them out.\n- Each person can only carry so much weight, there is no way to be Rambo and run around with 1000's of rounds of ammo and infinite first aid kits.\n\n- Cons -\n\n- Did I really just wipe out an entire town on accident? Oops.\n- Random battles can be major easy or completely overwhelming.  Luck plays a part.\n- Bah stupid AI won't stop throwing grenades at my clustered people.\n- Drunk bugger keeps going rogue on my party and getting himself shot to pieces.\n- Some fights, more so early on can be extremely difficult to get through.  The first boss fight was really bad for me as my squad was almost dead and did not expect the guy to attack me since we were talking at first\n- Ammo can be hard to come by in the early game, forcing you to either use weapons your team isn't skilled for or to spend all of your money on nothing but ammo instead of armor / weapon mods / first aid kits etc.","May 3, 2014","true","77.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertisdik/recommended/240760/","robertisdik","Mr. Grey*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertisdik/","181 products in account","As I am not really experienced in writing reviews, but since I just completed the game, l would like to share my experience with others whom are still deciding to buy it or not. I am dividing it in several stages: Character Building, Storyline, Combat and Gear.\n\n==\nCharacter Building\n==\n\nI found it really challenging to build a team that would last me through the whole game, just because there are too many skills to choose from for only 4 characters of your team. I had to make a new game 3 times to find out that it's actually better to leave a couple of skills out, which you will find on other followers (even better progressed) later on in the game. - Rose for example has a really high computer skill and handgun skill.-  Apart from the skills I think there are limited but reasonably enough faces and clothing to choose from to make a pretty random team.\n\nEDIT: After I made new game on highest difficulty, it came to my surprise that I could use me old rangers again, still having all the skills and abilities from my previous end-game. Knowing this I can reccomend new players to start and complete an easier difficulty and then use the same experienced (veteran) rangers on higher difficulty to make it easier! Changed my rating from 7/10 to 8.5 after knowing this.\n\nRating 8.5/10\n\n==\nStoryline\n==\n\nDepending on the choices you make, the storyline will change in many, many ways. Sometimes it doesn't turn out the way you want, and you can't do anything about it because of one of your previous choices. I quite liked this because it makes making choices more difficult and you will have to think ahead to make sure everything turns out ... o.k.\n\nDialogues are sometimes crazy long, and very tiring to read it all. You will be clicking a lot. Mind you, read carefully. Sometimes you will need information in order to make the right choice. Having an advanced speech skill will also come in handy to unlock several special dialogues which will help you get things easier.\n\nThe main story takes you and your team into the wasteland of Arizona to plant a couple of radio repeaters on several radio towers and re-establish broadcast range for your fellow rangers at the Citadel. During this mission you will stumble upon a lot of people whom need your help... or do they? You decide.\nAfter going through a lot of trouble to get the radio going again, you will fly to Los Angeles, where you will have to clear the name of the Rangers and bring good to the people of LA. You will soon notice that you're not the only one trying to gain power in LA and find yourself in conflict with several organizations that will stop for nothing until they have it. Make the right choices to make the right alliances and save the world from extinction.\n\nRating 9/10\n\n==\nCombat\n==\n\nCombat is pretty much the same throughout the whole game.. this doesn't mean that it’s boring though. You will have a limited amount of action points per character, depending on your skills. Both moving and shooting will cost action points so use them wisely. Some combat phases can be really challenging because of the environment you're in. Gain advantage by seeking higher ground and make sure that you get a lot of cover, it will definitely save your life multiple times. A higher combat initiative allows your team to act more often in a battle and will surely come in handy when you fight 10 baddies at once.\n\nRating 6/10\n\n==\nGear\n==\n\nYou will be happy to know that you will be able to choose from a lot of weapon types to use. And you can even put modifications on them! A big variety of weapons and weaponmods allow you to create your own personal weapons of mass destruction. The only thing I found disappointing was that you will be using the same weapon for a long time until you proceed into a new area. They are also pretty expensive in the shop. Make sure that you make the right decision on bringing the guns you find with you, or turn them into scrap metal to sell.\n\nThere is also a lot of clothing to be found in the wasteland. You will stumble across the weirdest hats, shirts and pants which together make an even weirder outfit. Make sure you try everything on!\n\nRating 8/10\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSo after having said all of this, I would very much like to recommend this game to people who like a game full of adventure, mystery and action with a lot of choices and plot twists. The overall rating of this game for me concludes:\n\n7,9/10\n\nA few extra tips:\n\n* Save a lot!!\n* Always reload before battle!!\n* Stock up on ammo!!\n* Take cover!!\n* ENJOY!!\n\nMr. Grey*","September 13, 2015","true","208.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I never got to finish the game, but I would still recommend it. Alas, it's has almost no replayability, due to the quests being quite limited and story line only going down one path. Still, it's fun.

After the disappointement of Pillars, and the overrated stuff I kept buying, Wasteland 2 is the only saving grace in my library, and Alien: Isloation.\n\nIt's smooth, combat is tactical, characters have weight because of how varied you can go with skils/stats/traits, and you will need a guide to find out all the solutions to quest. Iv'e been through it four times and still have read about things I haven't done yet.

I hardly ever write reviews but I feel that this game deserves it. When i first bought it (a week or two after release) the game was buggy to say the least. A bit boring during combat and the story was dry...\n\n...then the patches started rolling out. The game became beautifully designed. The artwork is amazing, the combat feels solid and easy to use. The story feels like a true rpg. I'm getting to know my characters like I did in Fallout and Skyrim. I was really excited when this game hit Steam and I had high hopes. Still being in Beta and being apart of the process has been amazing. I have enjoyed every patch and have no complaints. I can wait to see what it's like once it's fully released.\n\nIf you have any doubts about not liking this game wait until full release, but if you want to buy it now and help the dev's create a game more to your liking this is the company to do it with.

I have not read any forums/guides/walkthroughs or whatever. No spoilers!)\n\n- Read about all values/statistics and their interdependency. Think about what your group should be able to do\n- Best group ever! Will rule the wastelands!\n- First larger mission. Got stuck. Should have read the NPC-Dialogues. No pretty quest-pointer taking my hand. Ok, like in the old times now!\n- Walk into a fight feeling like a boss. This group can't loose! Got my ♥♥♥(es) handed over some seconds later. Bad lizards! Half the group is wasted, no ammo left, no medipacks to heal.\n- OK, Reload! No problem!\n- Lose one dude more this time\n- Start all over again. Thinking about lowering difficulty this time.

Even on the lowest difficulty setting its easy to find your characters out of ammo and with no scrap to buy more.  I gave it the best attmpt I could before i grew tired of the turn mechanics that ultimately result in dead party members from low skills or lack of ammo and before anyone says use melee, that just results in seriously wounded characters that once again die from thier wounds.  Trust me even on the easiest setting its wasnt uncommon during my game play to have characters with only 46 hp crit for over 30 dmg in one hit by an enemy.  Id hate to see what the harder settings numbers look like.  If you want a turned based game with shooting and some melee thats a lot more fun then this play XCOM.

However I am a fan of the genre and generally like RPGs of any type if they are well made so I thought Id give it a shot. This game IS well made, but thats about all its got going for it.\n\nThere is something about this game that just doesnt do it for me. Ive just played through Baulders Gate and Shadowrun Returns and compared to them, this game is flat and boring. I have no interest in the story line and the quests themselves are too dam long and boring. Theres no clear sense of what to do next and if you do things in the wrong order, you end up having to back track all over the joint.\n\nTraveling the wasteland is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Requiring you to stop at these stupid oasis to replenish your water supply is unnessecary and adds to the boredom. I know it was part of the original game, but that doesnt make it a good idea.\n\nGames that have voice acting are fantastic, it really adds to the atmosphere and gets you into the game. This game has voice actors, but they only some NPCs use it and only with what they first say. I understand the fact you cant give every NPC a voice sue to space constraints, but those that do speak should speak every line.\n\nIm a bit mad at how much I actually paid for this game. If your thinking about getting it, wait till a sale when its like $5 or below.

After many, many, restarts and partial playthroughs I just ended up calling it quits. Played FO1 and 2, and Tactics when they were first released and they sit high on my list of "fond of old games." This, I did not care for at all. Enemies zerg you (that's the extent of the AI). In FO Tactics they at least had the sense to flank you, take cover, hide, runaway, switch weapons appropriately, etc. You'd think that would be something we'd see in the 21st century. Not here. They run at you or shoot, then you shoot back, repeat.\n\nThe stat system is broken (not using that word as a euphamism or perjorative, there are stats that matter and those that don't. And your stats don't effect your skills at all beyond intelligence).  There are only a few viable builds to complete the game. The skills are so convoluted and could have been easily reduced by half. For instance you have: Alarm Disarming, Lockpicking, and Safe Cracking. Is there any reason these couldn't be under one skill instead of three? No. Then you have: Hard A*s, Kiss A*s, Smart A*s, Barter, and Leadership, aren't these all subsets of a larger skill like persuasion/speech or based on charisma? Well, no, not in Wasteland 2. Why are they convoluted? Probably to compensate for a game design that allows for so few actions in game beyond "kill person in this manner" or "successfully interact with this object for a reward."\n\nWeapons and armor have arbitrary penalties that exist only to impose penalties. For instance, did you know that an "assault rifle" loses all efficiency at five feet and  a board with a nail in it works MUCH better? I didn't know that, but after playing WL2 I do. Further energy weapons do lots of damage to you if they hit your armor, but if they hit your bare skin they don't do much on any damage at all. Logic! It's the guise of strategy, not actual strategy. It's strategic like rock, papers, scissors.\n\nThis game has a lot of heart. It tries very hard an certainly has charm. Yet I've played browser based games with more depth, complexity, strategy, and sophistication. Really wanted something to take me back to those first days playing FO1/2 and Tactics. Instead it's better to just play those instead of WL2. Or, if you really want a strategy based around functional abilities, gear (that you build or collect), multiple means of achieving you goal, and competent AI go play XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within.\n\nI want my money back.\n","January 23, 2015","false","3.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The tactical combat is challenging and rewarding. The storyline is solid and  cohesive. As someone who didn't play the original before I got it along with this game I feel that the devs did a great job at staying true to the original while making a wholly playable and engrossing sequel, paying homage to the players of the 1st game while not entirely alienating their new market. Simply one of the best role-playing games I have had the pleasure to play in the last decade.\n\nWasteland 2 made me feel like I was playing Fallout-Advanced Edition. Yes the post apocalyptic genre may be reaching its saturation point, but to pull it off with the style and flair that the devs did with this game is truly a feat that others should feel beholden to match in the future. Back in my day *takes a slug off of a clay jug marked XXX* players used their imaginations to fill in the holes that graphic and framerate left empty and Wasteland 2 managed to bridge that gap with nuance and gusto. I felt for my characters. I lovingly crafted their skills to conquor all that the wasteland had to throw at me. I was treated to inside jokes, 80's humor, and a difficulty that suited my playstyle (played on hard difficulty). If you're looking for a great tactical RPG, this is a sure bet. If you're looking for a storyline that will keep you playing to the end, start clicking the buy button now. Dim the lights. Crank the speakers.

Now I’ve played Wasteland 2 for around 7 hours, it’s not a fast paced game, this has only been enough time for me to complete one of the first main missions.\n- Overall I was very happy with the game, personally it was awesome to see a modern Fallout-like game with a traditional isometric view and detailed text descriptions of everything seen and done in the world.\n- However I found that I spent way too much time having to loot one loot container after another as well as sometimes fighting identical enemies repeatedly.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/DfGcRcBmcsQ\nhttp://youtu.be/U4P28iQRIvQ\nIn the character creation the graphics aren’t very appealing. However when you actually play the game you don’t usually view things so closely.\n-----Generally the actual graphics looked good in my opinion. But personally I’m satisfied as long as it’s a competent modern three-dimensional adaptation of Wasteland and an adequate improvement compared to the two-dimensional Fallout titles.\n-----What I was really impressed by was actually the textual description of entities and objects in the game. They provided more interesting details about everything you see.\n-----I also really liked the text dialogue that my companion expressed during combat rather than being mute. It really made the character seem more alive.\n-----Most of the character models looked fine, especially humans who featured a lot of variety. But I really got tired of seeing the same unimpressive giant bunnies again and again.\n-----There were also a couple of locations which I was not impressed by. One area was just a big empty square. While another fenced you into lanes which I don’t think fit well into a world that I believe should feel very open.\n-----But I was really impressed by many of the other environments that I saw. I liked how you could rotate the view, this would reveal objects you couldn’t see previously.\n-----Many environments looked handcrafted and irregularly shaped. I think this platform has a lot of potential even for other games with a fantasy theme.\n\nI liked the character attributes and skill system. However the benefits of investing into some attributes didn’t seem worthwhile. Likewise investing in combat skills seemed to suffer from strong diminishing returns.\n-----I set out to play this game in an unusual way. I didn’t want to micromanage a squad. So initially I took only one ranger. This didn’t work out so well initially.\n-----So after playing for an hour I started over and I redesigned my starting character. This time I created a more intelligent character so that they could multi-skill and thus take on multiple roles.\n-----Early on there is a high level character who you can recruit named ‘Angela Deth’, I took her along with me because going solo with a low level character is actually very difficult. So the game almost let me play the way I wanted to because I didn’t have to take a whole squad.\n-----I don’t mind the turn based combat, but it’s one of the reasons the game is slow paced. I knows it’s more traditional. But I would have preferred a real time system where you could pause and redirect the action.\n-----Occasionally my companion would go out of control in combat and make actions without me directing her. How do I make her do this all the time? I’d rather my NPC teammates were more autonomous. I don’t want to have to tell them to do every little thing.\n-----Outside of combat for the first several hours that I played, I couldn’t move my characters individually for some reason. So I wasn’t able to rearrange my character before entering combat\n-----This was a bit weird. I don’t know why this happened but eventually I was suddenly able to direct them individually.\n-----In games like this I feel compelled to search every nook and cranny in a level for loot. Especially because you really need to do so in order to scrape up enough ammunition to fight and enough medical supplies to survive.\n-----I know it’s a post apocalyptic game and scavenging may be the ‘thing’ to do. But I think I easily spent half of my seven hours of game-play looting and managing my characters’ inventories. That was tedious.\n-----Why do I have to ransack the property of people who I am supposed to protect? How do my characters carry all those guns and where do they keep them, just to sell at a vendor?\n-----I wish there was a better system for acquiring better gear. Perhaps credit towards an interchangeable load-out based on each characters rank and experience levels?\n\nSo yes, I definitely have my gripes about this game. But I was very happy to play it. This game proves that Fallout 3 didn’t have to make the shift to FPS. Not sure that I will have more time for Wasteland 2 though.\n-----I’m happy that the price has come down. The previous $60 price tag was a major reason that I had not purchased this game quite some time ago.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","October 1, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","11"

Get ready to remember which party member owns a shovel, switch to them, activate the shovel item, and wait while a progress bar fills up, every time you want to dig something up.  And this isn't just shovels, it's *every specialized skill*.  You're not realistically going to put together a party with more than one girl or guy who knows Safecracking or some other random ♥♥♥♥, but the game will never let you just click on the safe and have the one Safecracker open it.\n\nThe maps suffer from a similar level of fiddliness.  You will have to memorize where in town that random questgiver is, or come back from a fetch quest to wander all over wondering where his shop is among a town of identical-looking dwellings.  No quest markers is fine, I don't think that the player should have telepathic knowledge of where stuff is ahead of time, but when you're looking to turn in quests (and the characters would already know where shopkeeper X is) it's just a hassle.  Isometric design also means that the level designers hide crates in places where you need to rotate the camera to find them ... which is fine, but after a while, it's not clever, it's just irritating to have to rotate the camera every time you enter a new room or potentially miss out on loot.\n\nI could go on with examples of the weird sort of micromanagement that Wasteland 2 requires of the player (there are many more), but you get the point.\n\nBottom line, it feels like a game that came out in 2000, not 2014.  If you're fine with this, go ahead and get it (but you probably already did).  If you're not, and especially if you haven't played Fallout 1/2 to death, there's really no reason to play this instead of Fallout 1/2.","January 7, 2015","false","26.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

I've been eagerly watching the development of this game for quite a while now. Upon finally playing it, I am sad to report that it is far inferior to any of the recent (or classic) Fallout games. Just like Wasteland 1. They can't quite seem to hit on a winning formula.\n\nYou command a squad of desert rangers as they try to stop Very Bad Things from happening, mostly by killing all kinds of things in turn-based combat. Your rangers have absolutely no personality, and are combat units with a portrait. You can recruit other wastelanders to you cause, and they do have personalities, but for some reason the developers made the recruitable characters absolutely awful in terms of statistics. Managing your team of fighters is a chore instead of a joy. The interface is awkward and clunky, with strangely reversed controls. Typically, left click is "go there" and right click is "use/take/kill that", but this is reversed in Wasteland 2 with no option to change it.\n\nIt all comes down to a statistical analysis of the utility of various statistics and skills, with a larger dose of probability-based gameplay. It reminds me of business school, and is just about as fun. I literally had to make an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of who was going to learn which skills. The developers of Wasteland may have been groundbreaking and inspired the Fallout series... but they've pretty clearly shown why Fallout was a cult classic and Wasteland was quickly forgotten.","January 8, 2015","false","11.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Many of the reviews equate this game as being a "tactical RPG",  I would classify it more as an RPG with some (note emphasis) tactical elements, there's a difference.\n\nLike in the "golden age" of PC RPGs, you create your inital squad members, you can recruit up to 3 others, making a total of 7.  There are quite a few NPCs to recruit also, each has their own reasons for being on your team.  Depending on your actions it can be quite temporary how long a potential recruit stays on your team.  How you mix & match your PCs & NPCs can be quite interesting. Like the PC based RPGs of yesteryear, once a character dies, they're gone forever, so save often.  The game does not hold your hands on things, some of the clues in certain quests are down right obtuse & depending on the difficulty you set it at certain other things... well you'll see for yourself.\n\nIs the game "pretty", nope.  Is the story something I've not seen before, nope on that also.  But this games does give me something I see too little of in RPGs these days: choice & consequence.  Most of the consequences based on the choices are also not readily apparent, they have a small ripple effect that may not be seen for hours down the road; are you seriously about to reload a save from 2 or 4 or more hours ago when the consequence of such a decision is happening so far down the line?  I seriously doubt that, which is another thing I like, you have to think on most of the choices here; "How will doing X bite me in the rear?" is something you should really consider.\n\nI did one playthrough, it took me 120 hours to finish, I had a blast in exploring & finding things.  I intend on another.  Just 'cause I liked it though & felt it a fitting sequal to the original, it doesn't mean that I'm blind to the weaknesses of the game.  In most cases I hope what I wrote n the weakness column is considered & fixed for Wasteland 3, should the franchise continue.\n\nSrengths\nChoice & Consequence\nBig & long game reminiscent of the games of yesteryear.\nDoes not hold your hand, it's a thinking persons game.  Either have a decent memory on certain quests or use the notes system provided, you'll be glad you did.\nDark humor a-la the original Interplay Fallouts, but more subtle.\nWeaknesses\nUI not as tweakable as I'd like\nThe character customization could be way better. While I didn't expect it to be anywhere near as pretty as Divinity Original Sin, I did want my characters to look somewhat like the pics I imported to represent them.\nA lot of the portraits & random areas were reused.  The battles also felt repetative after awhile, the latter being the fault of a really bare-bones tactical aspect (no called shots on body parts other then the head, no sneak skill).\nI would've liked a few more optional quest areas like the Mine & Rail Nomads.\nSome areas were really big, I would've liked a waypoint option.\nFor better & worse most of the Skills didn't relate to the statistics of the characters.  At least to me they didn't feel this way.\n\n\nHaasGaming wrote it best:\n\n"If you are patient and give Wasteland 2 the time it needs to show its potential, it will be a tremendously enjoyable experience.

So with my experience out of the way now I might as well get on with it!\n\nWasteland 2 has not been regretted at all for an early access purchase, as to where I will be spending a lot of my time playing this game when the game fully releases! I feel that a lot of gamers anymore lose interest into these games, because it's not action 24/7 but I would say that these games now have got my attention and this game has taken over my life so far!\n\nPros:\n1.) The environment is very detailed where it doesn't look pixilated at all and from that shows the time it took the developers to give a great Post Apocalyptic experience.\n\n2.) The variety of skills to master in at which can change a lot in the future of game play from Toaster Repair, to being a Kiss ♥♥♥ to survivors. These will keep you thinking on which will be best for each character and from that can alter what your character can do.\n\n3.) Character creation is very generic as to any other RPG element, but there's nothing wrong with that at all! Create your own character and make him/her a minigun wielding badass! But if you're not comfortable with creating your own character (or squad), you have preloaded characters to choose from at which have their own specialties for you.\n\n4.) The combat system in the game can be very tense and frustrating (in a good way)! Every combat you encounter has you looking for anyway to wipe out your enemies as fast as you can from breaking through their coverage, to flanking them with your sniper. Every battle is definitely tense from where a simple 80% or above chance to hit still will miss (most frustrating thing in the world!!!!).\n\n\nCons:\n1.) A few minor glitches in the game which is common for a early access game, but some are still effective even though you reloaded the game before that glitch happened.\n\n2.) For my perspective and for anyone else who isn't too familiar with Turned-based strategy games, I had to restart the game a couple times as to where I screwed up and once you screwed up, you might as well restart and fix your mistakes. It may not seem like a con for others, but to me it's kind of frustrating to be restarting this game just to get it right.\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nI highly recommend this game for when it comes out, or even if you would like to play it right before it comes out! As for anyone who is considering buying the game full price, I would say that you wouldn't be disappointed in this purchase and would be looking forward to more hours of this game!\n","September 15, 2014","true","67.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnxfire/recommended/240760/","johnxfire","#Stumped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnxfire/","1144 products in account","RELEASE VERSION UPDATE: Initial beta/backers review found after.\n\nThis is it. This is the big one. For many people, this is one of the most anticipated games of the year - the great inspiration for Fallout, the driver of classic RPGs, the callback to a genre slowly reviving. One of the first big huge Kickstarted games. After two years in development, how does it hold up? Spoilers: it holds up damn well.\n\nWasteland 2 is a classic RPG in the style of Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics. In fact, the original Wasteland was the inspiration for the Fallout universe, and shares many similarities and concepts with Wasteland. You take control of four fresh-faced Ranger recruits, sent out on a task to make yourselves worthy of your badges. What ends up happening is a journey across Arizona, and then some.\n\nThe game starts off with character creation. You can choose to create your own Ranger from scratch, or pick a pre-made Ranger from a list. The pre-made characters are alright, but for most people, you'll want to make your own customized Rangers. You can distribute attribute and skillpoints as you see fit, change your Ranger's physical appearance, and even stick in his/her own little bio and a custom portrait.\n\nAfter setting yourself up, you end up in the Arizona wasteland, right outside Ranger Citadel. You are greeted by General Vargas, a veteran Ranger and an old character from Wasteland.  Another Ranger vet, Ace, has just died in action, and you and your team are sent out to investigate his murder and finish his mission as a trial. Succeed, and you all become official Rangers.\n\nAt first glance, one can immediately note the biggest downside to the game - graphical fidelity. While I personally feel that the graphics do not detract from the game, and in fact works to further the atmosphere it sets about creating, it is easy to see that the game is not about the shinies. Its easily trumped by Divinity: Original Sin in terms of fidelity, but that is not to say the game looks bad. It is simply objectively dated, even for a Unity-based game. Performance also leaves something to be desired - on a GTX 765M, the game hovers at about 40-50fps, sometimes dipping below to 30. Whilst expected for a new release, it certainly does not look like it should be choking up a moderately good mobile GPU as far as it is.  However, the graphical style the game takes is very immersive - you have varying environs, from lush greens to barren browns, and everything in between. The wasteland feels desolate and real.\n\nWasteland 2 is set in an isometric, top-down view. You control your Rangers overhead, order them around by clicking in the world. There are two world types - the main world, showing you Arizona and the rest of the area, where you go around between smaller local maps, looking for oases for water, and avoiding rad clouds, then the local maps, which is where you explore, do missions, talk to people, shoot people, all that good stuff. Combat is turn based, engaging when you run into hostiles or turn other people hostile by shooting at them/having a negative interaction. Characters take turns in commiting actions, with each action costing certain Action Points to do. Your characters can use a slew of weapons, from going in fisticuffs, to heavy armanents such as bazookas and heavy MGs, all of which can be skilled up. Positioning is key, with certain weapons being effective at certain ranges, and cover helping you avoid damage. Damaged Rangers can only be healed up with medkits, pain pills, and trauma kits if they bleed out. There is no idle healing, which means every fight has to be planned, and you have to have enough supplies to last.\n\nOverall, I feel that Wasteland 2 offers a refreshing jump back into cRPGs, bringing the spirit of post-apocalyptic games from the past well into the 21st century. If you love turn based games, old RPGs, post-apocalypse settings, then you'll love (or absolutely hate - in a good way!) Wasteland 2. Give it a try.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWasteland 2: One of the first gigantic projects on Kickstarter, the revival of an era, the granddaddy of Fallout, the great leap back for inXile.\n\nIs it any good (so far?) The short answer:  yes, yes it is.\n\nWasteland 2 is one of the biggest, most high profile projects funded through Kickstarter – indeed, funding for the game came after Double Fine Adventure’s own successful Kickstarter. The game raised roughly 3,000,000USD, well exceeding its goal of 900,000USD.\n\nThe game follows up on Wasteland, which was the basis for many elements in the Fallout series. Many elements seen in Fallout can be seen here – radioactive wasteland, Rangers building up a civilized society, raiders, tech-fanatics, militant religious fanatics are all present in the game, clearly showing how much it influenced other games later on.\n\nGameplay is very much Fallout like as well. You explore the world with your party, with the world map being just that – a map that you navigate your party blimp through. Movement is dependent upon your water supply – you lose water, you die. Thankfully, there are hidden oases all over the map, giving enough opportunities to refill water to quench one’s wanderlust. In local areas, one goes about with the whole party, with your selected member doing the interactions. Conversations follow a keyword system – anything you observe in the environment might pop up as a keyword for characters in the locale, while some words in conversations can lead to further inquiries as well. Some conversation options require certain skills to be at a certain level, and can lead to clearing certain obstacles in a peaceful manner. Combat is turn based, following an AP system similar to, again, Fallout. On this, I cannot say much – I’ve only played less than two hours, and so far, the early mobs were easy enough to wipe without having to worry about cover and positioning. Even then, I did take a noteable amount of damage, and would probably lose my party members if I continued to do so.\n\nWasteland 2 runs on Unity – so far, in this current beta build, there are no graphical options to speak of, besides resolution and an overall graphics preset. Setting it to Fantastic with an i7-4700MQ and GTX 765M, the game looks fantastic – it pushes Unity to the edge. However, this being a beta, performance is not spectacular – fully zoomed out, FRAPS was showing around 24fps to a max of 30fps, which is barely passable. Dropping presets down to standard did not help performance, so I am assuming this is a “beta is beta” issue, and will be patched before the actual launch.\n\nIs Wasteland 2 worth your time right now for 60USD? I would say, yes – if you can get past the beta-ness of it (you’ll have to download and print the reference sheet as there isn’t much of a tutorial in game), it is a good sign of the return of cRPGs and TBS games with rich narrative and an open approach to quests. While it wouldn’t hurt to wait, if you’ve been on the fence on it and can’t wait, it’s a solid game beta.","December 14, 2013","true","75.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I've been playing this game for several hours now and just completed  first mission.\n\nTo be honest. Wasteland seems like a lot of Waste time. Just read a little before you commend.\n\nBelieve me when i say that i loved Fall out series. I started with part 2, wich is actually allmost a complete copy ( graphic wise) of watse land 2. Come on guys!!!! A rlly nice budget trough kick starter and you give us graphics like that. PLS.\nGraphics compared to games anno 2014 , hell even anno 2005, are way, way , way better than this\n\nIt hurts because i rlly care. Bought this game beta stage, almost a year ago......\n\nPortraits do not fit the chars u play or npc's in-game.\n\nMusic pretty dull and much of the same. Sound affects, not so good.\n\nOMG dont get me started on the combat.... The system works fine. Just some good old fashion tunr based action, BUT\n\nSPOILER ALERT               SPOILER ALERT        SPOILER ALERT\n\nbut you got chance to hit in %. Ok.... you might think, but in-game this means that even when you get a 75% ( 75% is crazy high, you need to lvl up big time before you even get near it ) chance to hit, you probably gonne miss 3 out of 4 times still (percentage is iI guess based on rolls). This does not include weapon jams, and the fact that if surrounded by 2 mobs, your caracter feels pressured and get's a 20% debuff on his hit chance. And you got to reload every once in a while 2 .\n\nNot to mention that ammo is F^%&^%% scares and if you do find a shop that sells , it's a lot of money to buy new.\n\nSO..... adding all that up. Get your team in a fight and from all 40 shot's fired, you will probably hit about 8 times and killed maybe 4 out of 5 mobs. not a joke. So in the mean time you wasted a lot off ammo and a lot of time before the next encounter.\n\nIt is frustrating my brains out........I WANT THIS TO BE GOOD!!!!\n\nSo to be honest, (sad face) maybe i'm gonna play a few more hour's, but honestly, I think i'll just pick up a nother game.\n\nDont buy it.

Now, it isn't bad because the options are limited, it's bad because it's design is so shallow abd the tactical options are so very few. Fundamentally combat boils down to two options: Click on target to attack or run away, not exactly deep or engaging stuff.\n\nThe story is reasonably good, at least from what i've seen, but the dialogue therein emits the overwhemingly pungent aroma of particularly strong cheese.\n\nGraphically the game doesn't look too much of an improvement over fallout 2, indeed the low poly character models are just all kinds of wrong in a game being released in this day and age. Some might give Wasteland a pass for being an old school game, i'm not one of them, whilst I agree that graphics aren't everything, when you're trying to create a game like this, atmosphere and immersion are fundamental, having my eyeballed flicked every few minutes by those low res, low poly models and the peculiar animations does not lend well to the mise en scene when it comes to creating a convincing narrative. The graphical fidelity is something that struck me almost straight away and remains the elephant in the room the entire time, it's incredibly jarring and blows away immersion from the outset, the lack of atmosphere in the game is truly disappointing considering it's a game that would have benefitted exponentially from some sense of environmental depth of scene. The other aspect of this is that the animations are so poor. The way people hurry about is deeply unnatural, and indeed combat animations are every bit as unconvincing. This all adds to the game's lack of depth and continually smashes any sense of immersion to pieces.\n\nThere's a whole raft of smaller things that bug me too, for instance, the lack of a day/night cycle, which even the original Baldur's Gate had, which could have added a much needed layer of depth to that chronically boring combat - creatures that only come out at night, reduced visibility, the need for different tactics at different times of night. That's just one example of the smaller things, and before anyone dons their majestic white armour and starts foaming at the mouth, consider this: The investment level was huge so far as crpg games go, so why exactly does the gameplay feel so shallow? You cannot honestly tell me it all went into the sparce voice acting or the fmv sequences, and it's abundantly clear that it didn't go into the engine, so what gives? Where did the money go?\n\nStill, all told, by far my biggest gripe is how low rent the game looks and plays.\n\nFargo set out to make an old school game, and whilst he has achieved that, unfortunately, I suspect in literally doing so, he has failed to take full advantage of modern technology and game design techniques. Like so many dinosaurs of the industry, it seems he too has failed to adapt, just because you're making your vision does not mean that you should shun the good that has come from the advances in both technology and the games industry at large. What irks most is that this was a game with a £3m development budget, for a crpg it should have been absolutely jawdropping with an investment like that. That, above all else, is what makes Wasteland singularly disappointing, and also raises some rather pointed questions about just where the hell that £3m went, because it sure as ♥♥♥♥ doesn't look or feel like it went into the game itself in any truly meaningful way.\n\nLarian came out of left field with an absolute stunner of a game this year with Divinity, maybe i've just been spoilt by it and can't look at Wasteland in the same light when you hold the two side by side, but to be honest, when you look at what Larian achieved with a budget a fraction of the size of Wasteland, I can't help but feel that Briand Fargo, for all his good intentions, was taking the ♥♥♥♥ when he released Wasteland into the wild. Divinity is now far and away the market leader in the crpg market, and not because of a huge budget, because the guys and girls at Larian had the kind of vision and sense to use what they have available to them to the absolute best of their ability. I can't help but feel that not only was development time on Wasteland squandered, but also kneecapped by Fargo's single minded determination to make something 'old school'.\n\nthe tl;dr boils down to this: if you're a fan of Wasteland 1 or the original Fallout games, and can look past a distinctly shoddy game engine, then you might find something to like here. Otherwise, wait for a very significant sale, or just take a pass altogether and play Divinity or Xcom instead, both are vastly superior alternatives that do what they do a good deal better than Wasteland ever can, or I suspect, ever will.","September 23, 2014","false","1.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Simply put: if you are looking for an experience like the original Fallouts, keep looking. This isn't any fraction as good as either of them because it simply isn't good at all.\n\nI can forgive an ENORMOUS quantity of technical faults. Bugs, bland combat, and graphics that were obsolete 10 years ago simply don't phase me if the less tangible aspects of a game are exceptional. These aspects include, in order: writing, character interaction, and world interaction/immersion (coherence, reactivity and a sense of player agency). Fallout 1 and 2 had these in spades and although no game can touch Planescape: Torment's character interaction, I at least never felt like I was running around with faceless, generic AIs for companions.\n\nI should've known by the fact that you create an entire party (versus one player character who represents you) that the most meaningful and elusive elements of an RPG would be missing (the feeling that you're a participant in a world). The difference between Fallout and Wasteland 2 is like the difference between Baldur's Gate 2 and Icewind Dale...except Icewind Dale advertised itself correctly and successfully executed the thing it was trying to do/be.\n\nI don't know if it was laziness or simply a lack of skill that produced this heap of a plot, but it feels like it could be either and/or both. At around the 12 hour mark, I hear the radio transmission about becoming immortal, invulnerable, disease free and beautiful...Combined with the mysterious robotic/synthetic threat, the 'faction' known as Children of the Cathedral and the basic ability to put 2 and 2 together, I deduced that the plot was something to do with turning people into robots. Not unlike Fallout 1's Children of the Cathedral being a front for the Master seeking to turn people into mutants who are long-lived, disease free, stronger, faster, better, whatever. That's so much not unlike it, that it's EXACTLY like it. You can't even call that an homage...because homage doesn't mean 'blatant ripoff'.\n\nAnd the writing that everyone is showering in praise? Here's a stool - I mean writing - sample from Wasteland 2: "A lone road stretches on. A dry wind whips at your back with the sandy shards from decades of lost hopes and dreams." That's the line of text you get on entering The Prison...which is a former prison now occupied by raiders. So not only is there no visible/audible wind/swirls/eddies/gusts, the other half of the description is hard to connect to a place that housed criminals in the past and present. I'm not sure that I care about the hopes and dreams of murderers...and unwarranted melodrama aside, it's just too lengthy and hard to read...the second sentence should've been broken up into two. Compare this with a description from Fallout 2: "Before you stands Hakunin, the village shaman. He appraises you with his crazy eyes from somewhere in the world only he inhabits." Not only is that less cumbersome/awkward to read, when you actually see and speak to Hakunin, you realize that a more perfect description could not have been penned.\n\nAll I have to say about the music is that I can't believe it was done by the same Mark Morgan who composed Fallout 1 and 2's music. It's as if he couldn't find any inspiration in the material for which he was to compose. No surprise there.\n\nThe voice work is...serviceable at best and one step shy of laughably bad at worst...but mostly serviceable. I don't know if it was for a lack of space on CDs or for an abundance of sense, but games back in the day RIGHTLY kept voice acting to a minimum. This guaranteed that the voices that were present were of excellent quality. Compare this to the Elderscrolls approach of giving a million characters the same grating voice. Thank christ for the march of technology. There simply isn't a game budget (unless Warren Buffet was involved) to fund quality voice acting for all characters. Wasteland 2 seemed to understand that...but then couldn't cast decent actors for the few voiced characters it had. It also should've voiced fewer characters and hired better actors instead.\n\nThat about covers all the non-mechanical stuff. And the mechanical stuff has already been covered by everyone else and yes, it's as awful as they say. 5 different skills for opening things. 3 different skills for talking to people. Did there really have to be separate skills for assault rifles and SMGs? Or for bladed and blunt weapons? The more obscure skills yielded disproportionately better results than the generally useful ones, artificially decreasing the effectiveness of reasonable characters. For instance: Hard safes contained the same crap as easy safes but hard toasters contain useful and unique weapons?!? 4% jam rates translate to 6 characters jamming in a row for two turns??? It costs more action points to clear a jam than to reload?!?!?! I can make headshots but I can't target other body parts for at least SOME tactical depth?!?! Enemies can't do more than charge or stay in place? Characters' faces can't have features in 2015???\n\nI could've forgiven all of that...if only Wasteland 2 gave me a world I could care about with characters that were more than quest dispensers and text that was better than college level. UGH! Even the first major choice you make, going to Ag Center or Highpool, is so poorly and heavy-handedly executed. HERE ARE TWO PLACES THAT NEED RESCUING BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TIME TO SAVE ONE. MAKE A HARD CHOICE AND THEN LISTEN TO THE DRAMA OF THE SCREAMING PEOPLE FROM THE PLACE YOU CHOSE NOT TO GO TO!!! IT'S BRILLIANT AND IMPORTANT AND NOT AT ALL FORCED! In Fallout, there would've been 5 ways to handle it. 2 with different, gruesome outcomes. 2 different neutral outcomes. And 1 where the outcome was unrelated but important and revealed later in the game (like in the Vault City vs Gecko quest arc).\n\nTL;DR Fallout is an experience. Wasteland 2 is just a game. Don't buy this thinking that your Fallout needs have finally been answered. They haven't. Lets just hope Beamdog somehow acquires the Fallout license and remakes Fallout 1 and 2 with added content or makes a Fallout 4...or something...I don't know...I have a Fallout deficiency.","March 11, 2015","false","13.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The combat is interesting and dynamic, feeling much like the original Fallout series and Xcom series.

Maybe a "FAIR" game.\n\nDIfficult to control gameplay; difficult to see around objects-- a visibility problem which also changes with zoom level.

A week passed by and the update had finally been released, it had fixed 2,000 issues, such as bugs, glitches, and even added new structures and maps.\nI started up the game and i was blown away, there was no lag at all and the graphics where stunning. They had even added a store to the primary area, i exited the place and there was no crash, "that is what im talking about" and so the game went on with no bugs or lag.

When I had a lot of free time, I didn't mind investing a few tens of hours to appreciate W2's strong points. Now that I have less time for gaming, there are enough better games that I won't play Wasteland 2 again (although I'll probably reinstall to look at the Game of the Year version).\n\nIn this review, I'll compare it to X-COM: Enemy Unknown and Skyrim, which seem like natural comparisons for different aspects of Wasteland 2. (I assume Fallout 3 is a more natural comparison, but I never played it.)\n\nGood parts\nWeaponsmithing: Interesting and fun. Deeper than the smithing system in Skyrim but easier to understand.\n\nRoaming freely: Exploring in W2 isn't as rewarding as Skyrim, but the hybrid turn-based system combined with exploring makes Wasteland 2 feel, if not bigger, at least freer than X-COM: EU.\n\nNPCs: Several but not all NPCs are well-written. NPC interactions add something that wasn't in X-COM: EU, but they're not at the level of Skyrim.\n\nBad parts\nLack of tension in combat: X-COM: EU's well-designed maps and the soldiers' vurnerability made combat a taut, exciting chess match. In Wasteland 2, the lack of cover, friendly fire (by itself a great addition), and soldiers durability (on seasoned difficulty), made combat an exercise in lining up American Revolution-style and rolling your dice against the enemy. On seasoned difficulty, my soldiers never went down except to friendly fire. Ranger difficulty made combat more difficult, but the outcome of combat never felt like the result of skill or strategy.\n\nMediocre writing: For me, the writing was good enough to made up for the uninteresting combat through the end of the Arizona section. The Rail Nomad camp and Happy Valley set up interesting scenarios. However, the narrative lost momentum after the start of the California section. When the game essentially copy-pasted the Rail Nomad scenario for another level, I lost interest.\n\nSkills: More than half of the skills feel like they were added to pad the game and provide a sink for skill points. For example, Skyrim had one skill for picking locks. Wasteland 2 has 5 or 6 skills that serve exactly the same function. What's the difference between lock picking, toaster repair, and brute force? Nothing. Skyrim's two melee combat skills are fundamentally different and highly customizable. Wasteland 2 has 3 melee combat skills that all work exactly the same. Skyrim had one speech skill. Wasteland 2 has 3 speech skills that all work exactly the same. Skyrim has two healing skills (restoration and alchemy) that could not be more functionally different. W2's two healing skills are almost exactly the same (although some of the status effect descriptions are funny). At least half of the skills in Wasteland 2 are unnecessary clones of other skills.\n\nOverall, Wasteland 2 has some strong points that are overwhelmed by it's weaknesses.","June 8, 2015","false","66.6"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

The story is nice, the writing is good, but the combat is awful. The gameplay is dated, maybe it can appeal to retro gamers or people who mistake boring mechanics with hardcore. There is a lot of boring combats, which is slow and crappy.\nThe hard consequences that the game touted are...subpar so far. Fallout New Vegas felt more alive and your actions had more weight than here.\nTo talk in details about the combat system, think fallout without any combat options (no called shots) and moronic AI. You just trade blows with hard-hitting melee sprinters or eagle eyed ranged NPCs that suffer from a preference to eat lead by leaving cover if someone is next to them. It's turn based, but with no tactics (you could call the cover system tactical if you were very nice) and as such it ends up being slow.\nThe character creation system is poor and having no perks and lackluster attributes leave not so much to the imagination. The skills are varied and made necessary if you don't want to trudge throught the combats.\nThe dialogues are sometimes a tad strange and you end up with some stereotypical NPCs. They try to put a veneer of gray on your choices with cynicism and "realism", but it often fall flat IMHO due to the comedic nature of some situations.\nA lot of the quests are fedex quests made painful by the lack of fast travel, slowness of movement and the ubiquitous boring slow combats.\nThe so-called inhospitable wastelands are filled with oasis, making the presence of the water mechanics... strange to say the least as it never occured to me I could lack water.\nThe "open world" is level locked, so even though you could probably go wherever you want, the choices are often limited.\nIf you have most of the skills (and with the 3 NPCs you can recruit, it's easy to keep nearly all of them maxed) you'll be rich and never have to worry about ammo.\n\nI understand the devs wanted to cater to the nostalgics of Wasteland 1, but gaming has evolved and some mechanics are better left dead in the 90s.\nIn short, a promising game with crappy combats\n","October 1, 2014","false","60.1"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","27","53","0","2"

Now if you don't know already, three million creates hype for those who don't even understand the cultural relevance of the first wasteland, so this early release had something to live up to. Hell even the early reviews state that the game is promising, so maybe i'm not the one understanding what the word 'promising' means any longer. See when I think of a 'promising' three million dollar game, I think of an enjoyable yet somewhat bumpy experience at this point of development, not some poorly put together thing called a game that can't function past fifteen minutes without bugs annihilating everything in their path. And the best part, that during those fifteen minutes of play I recieve, even the bugs aside, the game is boring. Nothing, and I mean nothing, compels me to go forward with the lackluster story, the combat is atrociously broken and slow, and the whole experience feels like it was made by two men in a basement with a few connections to decent voice actors who had no idea what on earth they were doing, not a skilled development team with a ludicrous amount of money at their fingertips.\n\nBut hey.

The player controls a squad of Desert Rangers, whose mission is to protect civilians and maintain law and order, but now an army of robots want to wipe out Humanity, and its up to the Rangers to stop them. I never played the original Wasteland, but I'm a massive fan of RPGs, and I certainly found alot to enjoy in this game.\n\nCombat is turn based on a square grid, with each action such as moving, firing, reloading and healing costing ability points, similar to Xcom or Shadowrun. Its very tactical, and you also have to pay attention to factors like cover, line of sight, weapon range and friendly fire. The maximum party size is seven, four of which are created by the player, and the others have to be recruited as you progress through quests.\n\nThere is a wide variety of abilities to put points into when levelling up. You can use several different types of guns and melee weapons, but also non-combat skills including lockpicking, safecracking, computer hacking, trap disarming, machinery repair and more. These skills are very useful because many quests can be completed in multiple ways, by finding alternate routes to enter a building or unlocking extra dialogue options.\n\nThe story is really good and there are lots of interesting characters and groups. From drug gangs to slavers and religious fanatics, there's always somebody more crazy in the next town. Many quests involve a conflict between two or more factions and the player has freedom to choose who to support, but you'll rarely find an obvious "good guys" faction, more often its a case of "which is the lesser evil?". Dialogue is mostly text based, with only the major characters being voiced, but its all well written with lots of dark humour.\n\nI didn't encounter any game breaking bugs, but occasionally I thought certain quest progressions could have been better. Like the time I drank from a water well, got infected with a disease, and used a normal inventory item to cure myself. Later I found the town's doctor, who asked me to investigate why the people were getting sick. I didn't have any option to say "dude, its your well". The only way to progress the quest was to travel to another town to find a special microscope so the doctor could check out some samples, and discover what I already knew several hours of gameplay earlier.\n\nI also didn't like that inactive companions didn't seem to gain XP. One of my earliest recruits was kind of annoying, constantly complaining about literally everything, so I wanted to ditch him. But every new recruit I found after that was several levels lower, and I didn't want to be weaker in combat, so I was stuck with him.\n\nExcept for those complaints, Wasteland 2 is a really great game, and I definitely recommend it to RPG fans, although genre newcomers would be better off starting with something less complex. It took me 68 hours to finish and I didn't complete every side quest, which is excellent value for money at full price.","January 31, 2015","true","68.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an old school isometric RPG, and it's excellent.\n\nIt has it's flaws, but overall they don't undermine the experience, the worst I could say about this game is that there are some balance issues, and there are elements of the game that feel rough and unfinished.\n\nI think it suffers from kickstarter-itis .. where a developer seeks a budget on the KS platform, achieves or exceeds it, then works to that budget.  Back in the day, a company would outlay their own capital and not make money until the product was released, now kickstarter covers development and profit goes into someone's bank account.\n\nThe problem with this (understandable) model is that there's not a lot of room for stretch and polish.  You either wildly exceed the kickstarter or you don't - and if you do, let's face it, there's probably a bit more of a 'loose' approach with project management and a higher budget for chicken chow mein.\n\nI think there are functional elements of the game that should have been deeper, and there are story-telling elements that fell onto the 'nice to have but not essential' list and got cut.\n\nIncidentally, I haven't finished the game yet, I'm about 75% through (I think).\n\nHere's my view on the Good/Bad\n\nGood:\n- graphics and theme are nice\n- world map and random encounters makes you feel 'there'\n- radio chatter from different factions is immersive\n- background lore (the rangers, their character, their personalities) .. all good\n- combat: for the most part is satisfying and tactical\n- story: although contrived in places, overall the storytelling pulls you in and holds your interest\n- conversations and character writing is good for the most part (but also a missed opportunity)\n\nBad:\n- weapon balance has some very bad decisions, energy weapons in particular range from OP in some situations to useless in others.  I say balance, but I don't really care too much about balance, what bothers me is some of the weapons are balanced is .. well, not logical and doesn't fit into a consistent and realistic universe\n- Skills & Attributes: for me a real missed opportunity, they disconnect.  Example, Charisma doesnt effect conversations.  Seriously.  There's no randomness or discreet skill impact on conversations, just gatekeeper skills hardarse/intimidation, smartarse/logic, kissarse/charm .. and those skills are just numbers.  Likewise the balance of stats and skills is not really intuitive and clever in it's design, I guess in a way the game suffers from being compared to Fallout 2 in that regard.\n- Contrived/Illogical writing:  there are some key points where the writing is a bit .. contrived.  No matter what you do, it's pre-ordained that the outcome will lead you from A->B->C, doesnt matter if you're evil or good.  If I were to analogise with pen&paper roleplaying, it's basically having a GM who can't 'think on their feet' .. the underarching story should be invisible, it should feel like you have total freedom and YOU (the player) are calling the shots .. instead, there are a few key points in the story writing where you feel more than a bit led by the nose (worse, there are some points where you only have a couple of options and those options don't allow for wide variations in character, one specific example you have 3 options to respond to a challenge from your CO, and each of them forces you to lie.\n\n\nOverall, I give the game a solid 8.5 / 10 golden jabberoos.","February 1, 2015","true","286.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I managed to find a few plot glitches and 1 graphical error, but I'm lead to believe that they will be resolved by the devs in time. It has some roguelike elements, such as the irreversable death of party members-- the permanent results of your decisions, and the cold pain of knowing you could have done better if you had "only known." I give it a solid A, being bumped to A+ when the graphic and plot progression errors are smoothed out. The game has some pretty extreme replay value, not to mention huge potential for steam workshop additions, and further additions by the developers.\n\nThis has to be one of the VERY FEW crowd funded games I've played that wasn't an overhyped sack of crap.","January 9, 2015","true","86.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Giving off a fallout type of vide through out the whole game had amazing easter eggs to find and tons of interesting dialog. The combat was great and simple, Despite the minor bugs involving the camera glitching out durring combat but fixing itself after the next turn. Wasteland 2 state that there is 80+ hours.\nThis may be true for some, yet for me it left me wanting more after finishing the game in under 60 hours. (All quests, side quests, locations, caches, characters, easter eggs, and pretty much everything was achived with a amazing immersive experience.-For me at least in under 60 hours) All and All wasteland 2 brings back the nostalga of the original wasteland and orginal fallouts. I would have to recommend this to everyone that loves the first wasteland and the fallout franchise. Although i would say i was abit annoyed by the fact it isn't open ended in terms of being able to continue to play and explore after the ending credits. I cannot however recommend this at its current pricing. the amount of content is great yet still is lacking in key areas.

My only wish for this game was that the world was 'more open' and that the last 10-15% of the game felt rushed. Now that the criticism is out of the way heres what you will like.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is the RTS [duh] which is slick, and relatively smooth but often forces the player to watch all enemy moves [forces the camera to lock onto each hostile unit] but that is a small setback. The weapons and wearable cloths look great, with a fair amount of customization [not great but decent]. The combat is fun, and challenging and for loot hoarders such as myself there is ALWAYS something to loot, scavenge, and steal. The diologue system is great, but requires characters to upgrade non combat skills which can be frusterating for some, but offer rewarding new story archs for the player to follow which are otherwise impossible. I highly recommend creating you're own ranger or two [remember to specialize them in something] and create a backstory for them - makes you feel invested in the game and makes the player care who lives and who dies.\n\nHowever anyone with a heart can tell this game is a love letter to the fans who have been waiting for decades to indulge themselves within the wasteland universe. As with most love letters they at times try to hard, and on occassion written in haste. This is evident in some parts of the game [specifically late game]; despite this the effort and excruciating detail that went it to this game shows how much InXile wanted to make this game for others and for themselves. The story is great, the side quests have meaning and concequences with numerous outcomes all expressed in the epilogue which most will be more than satisfied with the thorough and satisfying ending; which leaves just enough loose ends to imply a wasteland 3 could see the light of day in the near future [ I hope anyway]. This is one of those games where I want to scream at the developers to take my money to support the game with new content [full expansions preferably] hoping containing a new area  map to explore.\n\nThe epilogue this game provides will take a modest 5 minutes to read, and it manages to wrap this game up in a satisfying way. I'm a major gamer having thousands of hours on steam alone [doesnt even count for my console based games] and I can't say I havn't been as satisfied with an ending in years, I'd say the ending is similar to dragon age inquisition neatly wrapping up everything.","October 20, 2014","true","87.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As with some kickstarter/small studio games there are some quirks, such as the ending scenematic and some odd crashes, but for me this doesn't take away from a very enjoyable game.\n\nA lot of people compare this game to Divinity, and I really don't think there is a contest.  This game is markedly better in most regards, but I do like both games.  The main difference is that Divinity has harder combat and more tactical combat, but doesn't have a very deep plot and has parts that are time sucks for the sake of being time sucks and just call it being difficult.  I like both games, but Wasteland 2 offers what Divinty doesn't, more polish, more depth, more plot, and frankly it is pretty funny.","October 25, 2014","true","77.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Game is amazing the Character creation can take an hour or more trying to fit all the skills your want in to 4 characters you quickly learn you cant have what you want, time to pick what you think you'll need.\n\nWhile I see alot of comparing it to Fallout 1&2 no one mentions how close the game is to Fallout tactics the combat is almost a clone.  Fallout tactics was also a squad based game with the same Map system for travel.\n\nAll in all I love the game, Best $40 I have spent this year the replay value is high and it makes me feel like I was a teen again, Playing Fallout on a computer that could barely run doom.\n\n( Edit ) Having Completed the game I feel I should fill out the reveiw Some more.  First The Battle system does get a little bit boring shall I say? but its to be expected in a battle System of Turn Based and Guns in the end you know what is going to happen you'll hit that wall for every shot hits. The AI does tend to simply Rush at you rather than use cover but again to be expected from this type of game ( Fallouts where all the same )  But the story and the choices you make unlike normal RPG they carry a certain weight too them which after the first one or two you make and you realise this you start to question your actions, what to say to the NPC's what the out come might be and how to push it the way you want.\n\nAll in All I loved the game it felt Fleshed out and complete to me, I did not see any of the bugs the others have added to their reviews infact the only issue I did was that the Camera locked at one point and I had to Alt + Tab to fix it.  I will Play again, many times. I feel that if you want a game where choices do matter and who you Shoot changes the game this is the game for you.

I believe that this game is a worthy successor, albeit not as good as the early Fallouts. It has the same perspective as Fallout 1 and 2, but is now using a 3D engine. The game is a fair bit more combat heavy compared to Fallout 2, but unlike Fallout Tactics has a far deeper role-play element to it.\n\nDetails\n\n+ Character creation is quite deep with plenty of attributes, skills, and derived stats. You get to create four characters at the start of the game and up to three more NPCs can join your group at a time. There are enough skills to make you want to create specialized characters for different purposes. There are skills for using different types of weapons, social skills, ability to perform certain actions such as lockpicking, safecracking, using computers, medical skills, etc.\n\n+ Combat is turn-based and has a feel very similar to the early Fallout games except that you get to control a party instead of just one character. NPCs that join your group will sometimes choose to do their own thing if you do not have a character with high enough leadership. You get a certain number of action points to perform actions during a character's turn such as moving, using one of the weapon's firing modes or an item, reloading, and so on. Cover exists and increases both aim and defense of a character in it. When and how often characters get to move depends on their combat initiative.\n\n+ Game is long and completing it with all of the sidequests can easily take 60 hours. There are plenty of different locations to explore and while there are radioactive walls that prevent you from going to certain places before you are supposed to in the story line you generally get to decide where do you want to go.\n\n+ Story and writing are both solid. A lot of quests have multiple solutions and in a number of cases social skills can help avoid confrontation. Decisions you make will affect the ending and the ending itself will clearly show the results of your actions with slides explaining what will happen to every place you have visited.\n\n+ Great ambient soundtrack from the same composer who created music for Fallout 1 and 2 as well as Planescape: Torment and a number of other games.\n\n+ While overall graphical quality is quite poor by today's standards and character models especially could use an improvement, I feel like the designers and artists have made the most out of a kickstarter budget.\n\n- Most of the loot in the game is completely random and changes on reload encouraging save scumming. It is completely possible to crack a well-protected safe only to find a few bullets in it while a game reload could give you a nice weapon instead. Furthermore most of the loot is broken down into tiers based on location or your place in the story line so there are often points in the game when you know your party is equipped with best equipment possible until you progress further making looting until that point completely unexciting and even becoming tedious with how plentiful containers are. Also a number of items that are marked as junk end up having a purpose in some of the quests.\n\n- Some balancing issues make certain weapon types completely useless throughout the game. If you choose wrongly in the beginning you will feel screwed later on.\n\n- Due to how plentiful combat is higher difficulty levels require very specific character builds to make the most out of combat initiative and action points in order to progress. If you want to create a role-play party my advice is to stick to the default difficulty level.\n\n- The game still had plenty of bugs upon release, especially in the second half of the game. The very last few areas also feel like they have been a bit rushed, but at least the game ending is satisfying.","October 29, 2014","true","105.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Awesome story, great characters and really mordern gameplay combined with the best old school features from the Fallout games. It's basically almost everything I would have expected from the game. The story is a bit short, and the world map is not quite as big as I watend but if the developers will ever release any modding tools then I don't see any problem in expanding the map.

I was an impressionable kid, getting owned by floaters and centaurs, unprepared, Sulik bursting like a dumba$$ riddling Vic with holes-- but I loved every moment of it.\n\nWasteland 2 took me to that place once again, especially as you progress through the game, it becomes an old school classic that we were sorely missing in our lives for the past 20 years.\n\nThis game is an heir to the likes of Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1&2 and of course the grandfather of them all, the original Wasteland.\n\nThanks Brian & Co. for the liquifying energy weapon animations.

You know the one I'm talking about), I was pretty much expecting a better version of Fallout Tactics with a deeper, richer story line. The result? I little underwhelming, but overall a good experience.\n\nTight, turn-based tactical combat with a rotatable isometric view mean that other than a few oddities that occur with objects that are "between the camera and the view," the control is pretty solid. The game rewards you for good tactics and positioning with every weapon skill having it's pro's and it's cons. You're not penalized for having a diverse team and the biggest problem of simply having a team of grunts with no real other skills is simply that a lot of side missions will be more difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThe downside... the story feels a little "been there, bought the t-shirt." And not just for a player of wasteland. There really isn't anything in this world that the game presents that genuinely feels original in any way, with the unfortunate majority of the various groups you come across feeling like someone blew the dust off and gave it a new coat of paint. Not a slapdash job though, but a loving restoration with a few embellishments here-and-there. The big disappointment was the final mission/ending. If any part felt like you'd played it before, it was this one. *sigh*\n\nStill, an enjoyable game for Hardcore fans of the Post Apocalyptic genre, or relative newcomers.

I never played the first game, and never really got into it when i tried. But that does not mean i do not know of it. I watched full walkthroughs to understand the first game years before Wasteland 2 was a recent concept. Because i am a fan of the Post-Apocolyptic genre, i knew Wasteland 2 would apeal to me as Fallout's 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas has done for me in the past. This game, from what i know of as one of the bigger kickstarter projects of its time, is well worth it.\n\nThis game is not only a "True" sequal to the first game, but it also is NOT half-asses like some other abondoned Early Release titles that never were finished. Not only was thsi game finished, but the story is compelling, the charactors are likable, the voice acting is incredible, and the overall gameplay is rock solid with very minute bugs every now and again (enemy i was fighting once fell through the ground and got stuck in part of the map, kept shooting me but i couldnt shoot him, but i eventually used a grenade and got him).\n\nThe map design is great, it does get repetative having to backtrack, but at least you have a feeling of accomplishment when you get further into the story. The weapons are great, as well as the skills and leveling aspect (I can have a trained SMG guy be able to mow down enemies with a trained sniper or 2 backing him up).\n\nTo conclude, this game is great and worth the money for both a great game and a great time waster, because once you start playing, you wont want to put it down any time soon.\n","October 19, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you want games with tactical, turn-based combat and adult but funny rpgs in isometric perspective with an open world and choices and consequences heres a possibilty to make such a game come true. Big publishers dont seem to want to finance such games. So the gamers have to, allowing the developers to produce a game without restrictions from publishers.\n\nYou get some digital goodies and the game when its finished. The current beta is also lengthy, at least about 8-12 hours. There are still some major bugs to be fixed, optimizations to be done, some mechanics to be included, and some heavy balancing issues to be solved, but according to inXile the beta should get updated regulary and they also said, they are going to add a few maps to the beta over time.

The visuals are also very pleasing and level of detail is nice. Your actions do have consequence to the world and some choices will cause certain areas to be inaccessbile, this makes me think that multiple playthroughs will be necessary in order to experience most of the comabt.\n\nOther than the obvious issues associated with being early in beta such as missing or limited content there are some major issues.  There is little feedback for most of the skills and during combat it is hard to tell how many action points some actions cost. There are also numerous bugs and pathing issues that can be frustrating but most won't ruin a playthrough.\n\nI would hesitate to buy this game now while it's in its infancy and with its current 60$ pricetag it is a sizeable investment. Down the road when it becomes more finished I would highly recommend this game. Based on the current direction I am estimating that this game will be a very enjoyable RPG.","December 24, 2013","true","168.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

My copy was on a couple of 5 1/4's, and my drives were single sided, so there was some floppy flipping involved. And there was the paragraph book. But I cherished that game like no other at the time. For me it was in a class of it's own, way more interesting then the bard's tales or m&m's or wizardry's, with a silly sort of dark humor built in. Blowing up the hotdog stand just about made me pee myself laughing.\n\nI was very happy to see it lovingly resurrected as a kickstarter project, but didn't find out about it until I saw it on steam, so I missed out on backing it. So I went ahead and grabbed the steam beta copy.\n\nAfter playing the beta copy for a little while, it is very obvious that this is a very well done game with high production value.

It's almost like this game is littered with easter eggs.  I love it when you snuff the life out of something.  The combat logs are nice too as well.\n\nThis game is very well thought out, runs smooth, looks great and is great fun.  This game isn't even fully released yet and it's top notch.\n\nThis game for sure will take up 40+ hours of your time.  Exploring, leveling, questing and messing around.  Do a game being a nice guy, do a game being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or being a pyscho and just murder everybody and every goat. ....poor goats....\n\nOne nice feature they also put in is all the different ways you have to access something, IE:  oh a locked door.  I can lock pick it...or..spartan kick that ♥♥♥♥♥ in....or....use lots and lots of explosives....MacGruber would of wanted it that way.\n\nIf they see screaming goats on the internet, it goes in the game.  It just goes to show the amount of passion and joy they put into this game.\n\nI highly recommend if you love this style of gameplay!","April 16, 2014","true","29.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dbrains/recommended/240760/","dbrains","Braains","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dbrains/","226 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is based on the early access so I will try to be reasonable with how I feel about the game.\nThe game reminds me so much of Fallout 1 & 2 with support for higher resolution. The graphics are nothing spectacular but it doesnt have to be since the game focuses more on user experience and immersion. Yes immersion! I'm not a big fan of reading especially long dialogs but this game does it well by letting you visualize what's happening in the world via text (type writer) and npc barks. It totally allows you to use your imagination without even realizing it. Yes, there are a bunch of typos that I've noticed which affects my experience personally, but then again it's still on beta. I like the fact that the quest log system does not treat you like a dumb person, unlike Fallout 3 where it shows you on your compass where you need to go. Instead the log gives you details of what you've accomplished so far and what you need to do next. I'm playing the default difficulty (seasoned) which is very challenging and the loot system is well thought of. The scarcity of ammos and health pickups allow you to decide whether you should go back to citadel (home) by travelling which is by the way is very very dangerous, or just keep pursuing hoping that you'll maybe get lucky and find some loot or vendors along the way. There are also a lot of interesting items you may find such as sega genesis console, neogeo, and even a used condom. I think they are irrelevant to the game but it's defnitely entertaining. I probably won't sell them. It would really be awesome if the developers can go even further with it and allow you to give it to a person in citadel to place it in citadel collection room or something, to display your awesome finds.\n\nThe controls are pretty good, it's could be improved though. But I liked the fact that I can play it with just the mouse, so I don't have to hunch down in front of my keyboard. I can just sit back, relax, with one hand on the mouse. It accomodates old gamer like me who's retired and doesn't have to work and just allow the kid inside me to just enjoy what I've missed when I was growing up working too hard. No more stiff necks and sore elbows. But like I said it can be improved. Also, if I may add, I really like how the cursor system was in fallout 1& 2. I think it's actually one of my favorite and memorable to me that right-clicking changes the cursor behavior to walking or action command. I can't remember if it was double click the walk mode to run but that would be awesome option. instead of holding down shift key.\n\nI like that they stayed away from static camera, but sometimes I wish there's an option to turn it back to static camera because the camera can get a little clunky sometimes. When you're tryign to find the travel zone it can get very frustrating, I think the way to solve this is by minimap (starcraft like)  which you can click on an area in the minimap and move the camera to that spot, which is currently not in the game. Speaking of map, I wish they have the option like in fallout 1 & 2 to have some kind of a town map that you recently visited to allow you to just go directly to a certain part of the town instead of walking all the way from the travel zone just to talk to one guy, then walking back all the way again to get out of the town. By the way the first time i took a ride at the crane elevator at highpool i was like, "Oh cool", but after doing that for about 10 times I'm like "Okay...", then I'd noticed one of my party member was left behind so i have to go through the cutscene again just to get my other team mate. I know it probably took some time and even effort for whoever designed this but it get's annoying especially when you're on the go. I'm not sure if there's vehicles in the game that you can ride like in fallout 2, and if there is it'll be awesome if you can customize it to add protection from radiation and and dehydration and allow a faster travel with options to attack random encounters using a higher outdoorsman skill. Also what's up with kick ♥♥♥, smart ♥♥♥, and hard ♥♥♥? I mean, does it really need to have 3 separate skill for each one? I hope they make this into just one skill, I don't know like just Kick ♥♥♥.\n\nI'm kinda glad that it's still in beta, which leaves a lot of room for improvements, I just hope that the deveopers are as open as they should be for suggestions and improvements. And I look forward for this awesome game to get even more awesome.\n\nBottom line is I'm totally recommending this game if you can tolerate grotesque, rude languages, violence, drugs, prostitution, and sad reality of the world to come after the apocalipse.\n\nI know I've written a lot already, but I will add some more as I progress with the game.\n\nThank you InXile for making this game.","May 2, 2014","true","50.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My copy was on a couple of 5 1/4's, and my drives were single sided, so there was some floppy flipping involved. And there was the paragraph book. But I cherished that game like no other at the time. For me it was in a class of it's own, way more interesting then the bard's tales or m&m's or wizardry's, with a silly sort of dark humor built in. Blowing up the hotdog stand just about made me pee myself laughing.\n\nI was very happy to see it lovingly resurrected as a kickstarter project, but didn't find out about it until I saw it on steam, so I missed out on backing it. So I went ahead and grabbed the steam beta copy.\n\nAfter playing the beta copy for a little while, it is very obvious that this is a very well done game with high production value.

The game is awesome. I'm an early backer and I've played every beta that has been released, as far through as I can. Many of the bugs/issues noted by previous reviewers just simply aren't there anymore so a lot of the Cons of the reviewers just aren't correct.\n\nIf you loved the original wasteland and you like turn based combat and actual movement strategy (think X-Com where if you move the wrong position you're toast) and a place where choices have real consequences then you will love this game. If you like all action and no brains then don't get this game. While it isn't a deep cerebral game, you do have to think about the solutions to problems (there are almost always two solutions or more to every problem). The isometric view isn't for some people but for those of us who came from the original world of RPG's it's an old friend that gives you a better view of the battlefield.\n\nSome in-depth points. This is a deep story and if you played the original you will appreciate a lot of the subtle humor. The NPC's almost all have a background - you don't though and you don't ever "grow" into a personalilty with a back story. I happen to like this approach where you get to explore your world without worrying about yourself too much. However, almost every path through the story will shape how other people view you and it will either help you accomplish missions or make it much more difficult.\n\nPros: Everything. Basically if I was going to wait for a sequel then I would want it to be this.\n\nI don't really have any Cons for this game. Everything is beautiful and well done. It is a very replayable game (I've mapped out about 9 different paths that I want to (or have tried) try. In addition sometimes having certain NPC's with your party allows you to unlock areas or conversation paths that you could not otherwise discover.\n\nThe team did a great job and I hope to write up a complete walkthrough in addition to the getting started guide which I'll update once the game goes live.","July 27, 2014","true","340.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wasteland 2 has captured the essence of computer role playing games, the best indicator of which is the giddyness you'll feel when you think about doing another playthrough. It has an astounding wealth of good writing in it, so many encounters, quests and dialogues that are simply joyous to experience. The best thing is, that so many of these things can play out differently, depending on your party and your actions. A reactive world with a deeply emotive story.\n\nOn your adventures through the sands, towns and cities, the game accompanies you with amazing music and visual style. The art and sounds immerse you, creating an atmosphere, that is both truly gritty in its post-apocalyptic splendor and darkly humorous with countless references and jokes. It's a world you want more of, a world you want to experience and are constantly thrilled to see what comes next.\n\nCombat is tactical and bloody, you will be able to attain all kinds of weapons, hilarious and deadly, and the death animations with the combat action descriptions make it purely Wasteland. Thoroughly enjoyable action from beginning to end. Different playstyles are well taken into account, playing with a bunch of melee bruisers or a squad of dead-shot riflemen, it's all equally satisfying. Though let's just say, that my favorite remains pummeling four raiders into red mist with a single well-placed burst from an automatic shotgun. Brutal and awesome.\n\nYou will be creating characters of any variety you wish, and you will fall in love with them. The attribute system, skill system and a cool variety of cosmetic customization are a joy to tinker around with. As you play the game you will learn more about how the game progresses with the type of characters you've created, or NPCs you've recruited, and you'll be excited to try out different things next time. It's a game that keeps on giving.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you've liked the 90's cRPGs, and play this game. It has been a long wait, but we finally got a game worthy of being up there at the top, with the best cRPG classics. Many games fail to deliver memorable moments, but this one, just like the good ones before it, has you fondly thinking back at the great things you've experienced with it.","September 29, 2014","true","102.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like older RPGs like the Baldurs Gates, Fallout 1 and 2, Arcanum or even the oringinal Wasteland, GO GET IT, DONT WAIT FOR ANY SALE!

Although I would like to inform you of a few caveats.\n\nThe game difficulty is well balanced at the normal suggested difficulty setting but starts to break while it is increased. Unlike Fallout Tactics, as the difficulty in Wasteland 2 increases the only change is quantitative. Your aim probability decreases, enemies do more damage etc. but the AI remains the same. Beating a battle set piece doesn't make you feel like you played well it mearly feels like you got lucky over and over again.\n\nOne last pet peeve. The issue here is the half turn discrepancy between setting up your squad before combat and the first turn of combat. Since you can see battle coming you are able to plan ahead for it by setting squad order but the second battle starts all of your squad move just a little out of place and destroy all chance of strategic combat.","October 15, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will not be remembered for years to come as a high point of the genre. It will not spawn remakes and imitators. But it's still good enough, and frankly, if you like your combat turn-based and your texts long and well-enough written, you have no choice this Autiman, but to spend some time playing Wasteland 2.\n\nNow, let's dig in to see what went wrong.\n\nCharacter development\n\nAt first, character development looks good enough. For the first half of the game, you will value every Skill Point you get. Unfortunately, after that it becomes evident that character development is quite limited in Wasteland 2. You can spend Skill Points to get slightly better at hitting enemies. Or opening locks. Or disarming traps. Et cetera. But if you try to make two characters with the same specialization (say, Sniper Rifles), you will develop them in pretty much the same way. There are no ways to make a character unique: no Perks, no Feats, nothing of that sort. Why didn't the developers add such feature to the game, I can't imagine. It's not like it would require expensive voice-acting or even additional 3d models...\n\nAt the very least, they could have borrowed a page from Shadowrun's rulebook, and give special abilities or bonuses at certain levels of skill. I don't really see a need to give my Sniper 10 in sniper rifles, when all it gets me is a few more percents of To Hit chance!\n\nCombat\n\nCombat here is turn-based and slightly more varied, that in Fallout 2. This is all good that could be said about it. Lacking abilities, this game offers little in a way of infulening the outcome of combat in dramatic way. This is especially dissapointing after GREAT combat in Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nIn terms of combat, Wasteland 2 is far behind not only D:OS, but also both Shadowrun and X-Com. This is made worse by strange balance, which allows enemies to mostly negate all your careful placement of characters by running a very long distance in a single turn (this is not a bug: with bug, they had pretty much unlimited running range, now it's just too big).\n\nStory\n\nShould you expect a great, thoughtfull story from a game that has Toaster Repair in its list of skills? I guess you shouldn't. But I still was disappointed by a pretty cliche main quest.\n\nAnother bad mark here is tired trope where heroes take about 15 minutes to solve problems which locals could not solve for years. Negotiate a peace between two warring tribes? A bit of shooting and one dialog. Convince a community to stop ritual cannibalism? Two dialogs! Now, you shouldn't probably make the player feel like they are negotiating for peace in Middle East, but this is borderline insulting.\n\nDialogues\n\nDialogues here are all right. Text are well-enough written and I had no wish to skip them.\n\nStill, there are to little Skill Checks, and lack of complex trees lead to shallow experience. Compare this to Arcanum's dialogues with Persuasion...\n\nWorld\n\nPost-apocalyptic games, books and movies are not known for a well-tought-out worlds. They are often seem more like a zoo. "See here, children, this farmers worship an unexploded nuke; and those town took their god from an old folk song!"\n\nWasteland 2 did nothing to change it. Still, some are turned off by what they consider over-the-top sillines, especially in the very beginning of the game, in Ag Center. I, for one, found acceptable, but no engaging, and the rest of the game is the same. This world does not seem alive, I can't feel anything for it, it's just a backdrop for some fighting, questing, looting and trading.\n\nSummary\n\nRiotPixels, gave the game 78% out of 100. I think this is exactly the right score for such a game. inXile failed to make a masterpiece, but, well, it's still a good, playable game. You can spend some fine time with it. Just don't place too much hopes in it, so as not to be disappointed. I, for example, do not regret backing it on Kickstarter, and will back other inXile projects in future. I mean, what's the alternative? How much turn-based RPGs are there every year? Two? Three? Another one is good, even if it's not a great one.","October 20, 2014","true","92.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat was great and simple, Despite the minor bugs involving the camera glitching out durring combat but fixing itself after the next turn. Wasteland 2 state that there is 80+ hours.\nThis may be true for some, yet for me it left me wanting more after finishing the game in under 60 hours. (All quests, side quests, locations, caches, characters, easter eggs, and pretty much everything was achived with a amazing immersive experience.-For me at least in under 60 hours) All and All wasteland 2 brings back the nostalga of the original wasteland and orginal fallouts. I would have to recommend this to everyone that loves the first wasteland and the fallout franchise. Although i would say i was abit annoyed by the fact it isn't open ended in terms of being able to continue to play and explore after the ending credits. I cannot however recommend this at its current pricing. the amount of content is great yet still is lacking in key areas.

My only wish for this game was that the world was 'more open' and that the last 10-15% of the game felt rushed. Now that the criticism is out of the way heres what you will like.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is the RTS [duh] which is slick, and relatively smooth but often forces the player to watch all enemy moves [forces the camera to lock onto each hostile unit] but that is a small setback. The weapons and wearable cloths look great, with a fair amount of customization [not great but decent]. The combat is fun, and challenging and for loot hoarders such as myself there is ALWAYS something to loot, scavenge, and steal. The diologue system is great, but requires characters to upgrade non combat skills which can be frusterating for some, but offer rewarding new story archs for the player to follow which are otherwise impossible. I highly recommend creating you're own ranger or two [remember to specialize them in something] and create a backstory for them - makes you feel invested in the game and makes the player care who lives and who dies.\n\nHowever anyone with a heart can tell this game is a love letter to the fans who have been waiting for decades to indulge themselves within the wasteland universe. As with most love letters they at times try to hard, and on occassion written in haste. This is evident in some parts of the game [specifically late game]; despite this the effort and excruciating detail that went it to this game shows how much InXile wanted to make this game for others and for themselves. The story is great, the side quests have meaning and concequences with numerous outcomes all expressed in the epilogue which most will be more than satisfied with the thorough and satisfying ending; which leaves just enough loose ends to imply a wasteland 3 could see the light of day in the near future [ I hope anyway]. This is one of those games where I want to scream at the developers to take my money to support the game with new content [full expansions preferably] hoping containing a new area  map to explore.\n\nThe epilogue this game provides will take a modest 5 minutes to read, and it manages to wrap this game up in a satisfying way. I'm a major gamer having thousands of hours on steam alone [doesnt even count for my console based games] and I can't say I havn't been as satisfied with an ending in years, I'd say the ending is similar to dragon age inquisition neatly wrapping up everything.","October 20, 2014","true","87.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As with some kickstarter/small studio games there are some quirks, such as the ending scenematic and some odd crashes, but for me this doesn't take away from a very enjoyable game.\n\nA lot of people compare this game to Divinity, and I really don't think there is a contest.

I believe that this game is a worthy successor, albeit not as good as the early Fallouts. It has the same perspective as Fallout 1 and 2, but is now using a 3D engine. The game is a fair bit more combat heavy compared to Fallout 2, but unlike Fallout Tactics has a far deeper role-play element to it.\n\nDetails\n\n+ Character creation is quite deep with plenty of attributes, skills, and derived stats. You get to create four characters at the start of the game and up to three more NPCs can join your group at a time. There are enough skills to make you want to create specialized characters for different purposes. There are skills for using different types of weapons, social skills, ability to perform certain actions such as lockpicking, safecracking, using computers, medical skills, etc.\n\n+ Combat is turn-based and has a feel very similar to the early Fallout games except that you get to control a party instead of just one character. NPCs that join your group will sometimes choose to do their own thing if you do not have a character with high enough leadership. You get a certain number of action points to perform actions during a character's turn such as moving, using one of the weapon's firing modes or an item, reloading, and so on. Cover exists and increases both aim and defense of a character in it. When and how often characters get to move depends on their combat initiative.\n\n+ Game is long and completing it with all of the sidequests can easily take 60 hours. There are plenty of different locations to explore and while there are radioactive walls that prevent you from going to certain places before you are supposed to in the story line you generally get to decide where do you want to go.\n\n+ Story and writing are both solid. A lot of quests have multiple solutions and in a number of cases social skills can help avoid confrontation. Decisions you make will affect the ending and the ending itself will clearly show the results of your actions with slides explaining what will happen to every place you have visited.\n\n+ Great ambient soundtrack from the same composer who created music for Fallout 1 and 2 as well as Planescape: Torment and a number of other games.\n\n+ While overall graphical quality is quite poor by today's standards and character models especially could use an improvement, I feel like the designers and artists have made the most out of a kickstarter budget.\n\n- Most of the loot in the game is completely random and changes on reload encouraging save scumming. It is completely possible to crack a well-protected safe only to find a few bullets in it while a game reload could give you a nice weapon instead. Furthermore most of the loot is broken down into tiers based on location or your place in the story line so there are often points in the game when you know your party is equipped with best equipment possible until you progress further making looting until that point completely unexciting and even becoming tedious with how plentiful containers are. Also a number of items that are marked as junk end up having a purpose in some of the quests.\n\n- Some balancing issues make certain weapon types completely useless throughout the game. If you choose wrongly in the beginning you will feel screwed later on.\n\n- Due to how plentiful combat is higher difficulty levels require very specific character builds to make the most out of combat initiative and action points in order to progress. If you want to create a role-play party my advice is to stick to the default difficulty level.\n\n- The game still had plenty of bugs upon release, especially in the second half of the game. The very last few areas also feel like they have been a bit rushed, but at least the game ending is satisfying.","October 29, 2014","true","105.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakethebadass/recommended/240760/","blakethebadass","Flapjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakethebadass/","102 products in account","Wasteland 2 was one of those games that really speaks to older generations of games. There are many good as well as bad design features, but overall it's an enjoyable experience if you're willing to put yourself through it.\n\nUpon starting up your first game you create a party of four Rangers and can choose their stats and skills, select character appearance options, and write a quick bio should you so desire. Of course, one of the things that is limited by the standards of old crpgs is that you can't play your character too far off the path of the desert rangers, but still the story is interesting and features a lot of unique ideas that might just get you to crack a smile.\n\nNow there is a ton of dialogue and text in this game, but of course that means a lot of conversation options come up time after time. You'll find your self clicking things to get them out of the way, and of course sometimes this can get you into confrontations without any clear indications. Since I like to schmooze my way through many of these it was kind of annoying that there werent more options to use the skills associated with conversation, but at least they were there.\n\nThe combat mechanics were probably the most fun. I played this game at the second highest difficulty on my first try and didn't have too much trouble. There are some frustrating things, like enemies walking 150 tiles across the map straight up to your characters on the first turn and punching them in the face, but so long as you're prepared you can usually deal with this by lobbing out grenades and rockets. That being said, there are plenty of different weapons to take advantage of and they are all useful and unique in different ways. Some character stats are more useful to combat than others, so it helps a ton to diversify your party because the situations that arise require different skills and weapons. Some enemies are tough to take out with light weapons, but easy targets with energy guns, and vice versa.\n\nAs a piece of advice you will be binding quick save to the key closest to your keyboard hand, and pressing it often. There are times where it is not always clear what you have to do, and if you do them in the wrong order you can get into situations like endless combat for HOURS before you give up and reload. It's truly unfortunate that unorthodox situations do this to the player, as it feels restricting at times. I remember early in the game trying to expedite a mayoral race, and did as many helpful tasks as I could save for one that I could not find. Turns out the doctor, who said he didn't need any help, actually needec you to use your surgeon skill on his patients... seriously? I spent hours trying to figure this out before looking it up.\n\nAnother gripe is that you will spend hours just walking across maps, for no purpouse other than you're going back and fourth for quests. There are sometimes ways around this that open up after having done enough to open up a quicker passage, but usually by this point it doesn't even matter anymore. You'll experience this enough to come to hate the experience. You'll be getting out your chair to find something to distract you for three minutes while your party walks around, and sometimes you have no idea if where you're going is going to help your quest. Truly this was the most frustrating aspect of the game.\n\nYet another thing, many characters have the same portraits, even important ones at times. I really wish that they had taken the Baldurs Gate appreach and only gave important characters unique portraits. And the portraits, they look like they were painted by a college student. They werent bad, but felt lacking. Sometimes it made the characters you meet less unique, as they just sort of blend into each other.\n\nNow it might seem i'm going off on the negative aspects of the game, but these are things you should know before you start playing. It's by no means perfect, but hightly enjoyable. Comparable to Shadowrun Returns, where as shadowrun had a really focused story and an enjoyable simplicity, Wasteland 2 has a very big and diluted feel with explosive chests falling out of the sky and arguably more interesting combat mechanics and a big world.","October 19, 2014","true","72.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your peace-keeping activities involve what you, the seasoned gamer, might have come to expect of the genre:  mutants, barbarians, and insane robots.  Where this game shines is in how it utilizes these very typical post-apocalyptic tropes to portray some very realistic and human settings as well as very real consequences for your actions.\n\nThis is the most interesting development of this game.  Typically role-playing type games cater to the completionist crowd by making most every quest available and completable.  Wasteland 2 rejects this model forcing the player into branches of decisions and consequences which make other outcomes and objectives inaccessible.  Complicating this new quest model is that these decisions are never simple.  It is not a matter of choosing to save one good guy or one bad guy.  Instead the game asks you to decided from among two terrible choices.  Save this murderer or save this ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The game gives you the option to sit on the fence for most of the quests, however, this comes with its own (often terrible) perils.\n\nWhere this game also shines is in the little details.  Specifically the writing and music, both of which are excellent.  Even the voice-acting is mostly well done.  The game also plays like a sort of love-letter to the video game communmity.  This makes perfect sense as this game would not have been possible without the financial support of the fans of this community.\n\nThe little details is also where the game falls apart.  The GUI, graphics (the world map), and combat mechanics all leave something to be desired.  Where the game falls apart is the entire last 25% of the game.  Although the game was delayed by nearly one year from its original date, and although it enjoyed a great deal of free beta testing from the Steam Early Access Program, this game was rushed to market before it was polished and complete.  The game literally falls apart at the seams in the last 25%.  This lack of polish creates nonsensical dialogue choices which makes the quests  broken.  Even worse is that the final encounters (those which shoudl be the most emotionally impactful) are broken.  In one I had to manually attack the boss to force a battle.  The final encounter is a simple matter of hacking and slashing your way to victory.  I wasted one attempt looking around for a secret way to complete the encounter and eventually realized you are simply supposed to blow everything up.  This unfortunate final encounter is partially a result of the boring combat system, partially a lack of imagination, but primarily the result of a game which should have been delayed by another year.\n\nIt is easy to say this from the arm chair of course.  In another year the game probably would have run out of funding or the audience would have moved on.  InExile has been releasing rather huge patches every week since the game came out, however, one wonders how much a skeleton crew of developers on bug-fixing duty can really accomplish.  Each patch has thus far read like a bible but this game needs a church full of bibles to make the last quarter not suck.  I included the date because perhaps a year from now, if churches full of bibles, materialize, I coule recommend this game.  As it stands I only recommend the first 75%.","October 21, 2014","true","84.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You know the one I'm talking about), I was pretty much expecting a better version of Fallout Tactics with a deeper, richer story line. The result? I little underwhelming, but overall a good experience.\n\nTight, turn-based tactical combat with a rotatable isometric view mean that other than a few oddities that occur with objects that are "between the camera and the view," the control is pretty solid. The game rewards you for good tactics and positioning with every weapon skill having it's pro's and it's cons. You're not penalized for having a diverse team and the biggest problem of simply having a team of grunts with no real other skills is simply that a lot of side missions will be more difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThe downside... the story feels a little "been there, bought the t-shirt." And not just for a player of wasteland. There really isn't anything in this world that the game presents that genuinely feels original in any way, with the unfortunate majority of the various groups you come across feeling like someone blew the dust off and gave it a new coat of paint. Not a slapdash job though, but a loving restoration with a few embellishments here-and-there. The big disappointment was the final mission/ending. If any part felt like you'd played it before, it was this one. *sigh*\n\nStill, an enjoyable game for Hardcore fans of the Post Apocalyptic genre, or relative newcomers. But anyone else may want to give it a miss if retreading familiar ground doesn't catch their fancy.","October 18, 2014","true","95.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I never played the first game, and never really got into it when i tried. But that does not mean i do not know of it. I watched full walkthroughs to understand the first game years before Wasteland 2 was a recent concept. Because i am a fan of the Post-Apocolyptic genre, i knew Wasteland 2 would apeal to me as Fallout's 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas has done for me in the past. This game, from what i know of as one of the bigger kickstarter projects of its time, is well worth it.\n\nThis game is not only a "True" sequal to the first game, but it also is NOT half-asses like some other abondoned Early Release titles that never were finished. Not only was thsi game finished, but the story is compelling, the charactors are likable, the voice acting is incredible, and the overall gameplay is rock solid with very minute bugs every now and again (enemy i was fighting once fell through the ground and got stuck in part of the map, kept shooting me but i couldnt shoot him, but i eventually used a grenade and got him).\n\nThe map design is great, it does get repetative having to backtrack, but at least you have a feeling of accomplishment when you get further into the story. The weapons are great, as well as the skills and leveling aspect (I can have a trained SMG guy be able to mow down enemies with a trained sniper or 2 backing him up).\n\nTo conclude, this game is great and worth the money for both a great game and a great time waster, because once you start playing, you wont want to put it down any time soon.\n","October 19, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an old school isometric RPG, and it's excellent.\n\nIt has it's flaws, but overall they don't undermine the experience, the worst I could say about this game is that there are some balance issues, and there are elements of the game that feel rough and unfinished.\n\nI think it suffers from kickstarter-itis .. where a developer seeks a budget on the KS platform, achieves or exceeds it, then works to that budget.  Back in the day, a company would outlay their own capital and not make money until the product was released, now kickstarter covers development and profit goes into someone's bank account.\n\nThe problem with this (understandable) model is that there's not a lot of room for stretch and polish.  You either wildly exceed the kickstarter or you don't - and if you do, let's face it, there's probably a bit more of a 'loose' approach with project management and a higher budget for chicken chow mein.\n\nI think there are functional elements of the game that should have been deeper, and there are story-telling elements that fell onto the 'nice to have but not essential' list and got cut.\n\nIncidentally, I haven't finished the game yet, I'm about 75% through (I think).\n\nHere's my view on the Good/Bad\n\nGood:\n- graphics and theme are nice\n- world map and random encounters makes you feel 'there'\n- radio chatter from different factions is immersive\n- background lore (the rangers, their character, their personalities) .. all good\n- combat: for the most part is satisfying and tactical\n- story: although contrived in places, overall the storytelling pulls you in and holds your interest\n- conversations and character writing is good for the most part (but also a missed opportunity)\n\nBad:\n- weapon balance has some very bad decisions, energy weapons in particular range from OP in some situations to useless in others.  I say balance, but I don't really care too much about balance, what bothers me is some of the weapons are balanced is .. well, not logical and doesn't fit into a consistent and realistic universe\n- Skills & Attributes: for me a real missed opportunity, they disconnect.  Example, Charisma doesnt effect conversations.  Seriously.  There's no randomness or discreet skill impact on conversations, just gatekeeper skills hardarse/intimidation, smartarse/logic, kissarse/charm .. and those skills are just numbers.  Likewise the balance of stats and skills is not really intuitive and clever in it's design, I guess in a way the game suffers from being compared to Fallout 2 in that regard.\n- Contrived/Illogical writing:  there are some key points where the writing is a bit .. contrived.  No matter what you do, it's pre-ordained that the outcome will lead you from A->B->C, doesnt matter if you're evil or good.  If I were to analogise with pen&paper roleplaying, it's basically having a GM who can't 'think on their feet' .. the underarching story should be invisible, it should feel like you have total freedom and YOU (the player) are calling the shots .. instead, there are a few key points in the story writing where you feel more than a bit led by the nose (worse, there are some points where you only have a couple of options and those options don't allow for wide variations in character, one specific example you have 3 options to respond to a challenge from your CO, and each of them forces you to lie.\n\n\nOverall, I give the game a solid 8.5 / 10 golden jabberoos.","February 1, 2015","true","286.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact, Wasteland 2 looks and feels so much like a Fallout game that it took me some time to accept that I had no Pipboy, Vault suit or funny perks.\n\nIt's a really engaging game with an interesting story (without being revolutionary in any way), with the usual moral dilemmas and multiple paths to complete objectives. And it's great value for money; I personally spent 86 hours on a single playthrough! Granted, I like to take my time more than most, but few games offer me that much nowadays.\n\nIt's not a perfect game though; the ending is lackluster and the latter half of the game (with one area in particular) is riddled with some rather annoying (but not gamebreaking) bugs. But eh, I guess the bugs is just another aspect  that emulates the good old Fallout games...\n\nAll in all, I'll definetely recommend this for fans of post-apocalyptic settings, roleplaying games and the Fallout series in particular.\n\n8/10 (perhaps even 9/10 if they fix most of the bugs)","October 15, 2014","true","100.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Its the original concept to the Fallout series, so fans of that will get it instantly)\nSo far I have sunk over 45hours into this game and only in what you would call "Act 2" to avoid spoilers. Think Baldurs gate, Divinity series, Torment, Neverwinter Nights in terms of side quests, loot and rewards for exploration of the world.\nStory is engaging and entertaining but could be seen as means to an end for the 4 protagonists rather than an epic personal journey. Saying that though, the different stories and factions to discover through the world gives you incentive to carry on into the end game with curiosity. I couldn't stop playing this game, it will make you curious to explore and see what lies south of that radiation well.\n\n\n","October 3, 2014","true","56.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sheer firepower is the only thing that gets you through the firefights. Your sniper can be crouching in an elevated position and blocking the only way up, and the enemy WILL run the equivalent of 30 odd action points to circle the position just to stand beside your sniper. Likewise the AI npc follower WILL make the same circuit just to stand in front of the enemy to die. Doesn't help that the AI followers have 1 or 2 bullet shot's worth of hp and can't be healed. Even under normal circumstances depending on the AI's whim and fancy they ocassionally develop a sudden ability to produce more ability points than otherwise deemed possible so that they can come and hug your characters in a loving embrace. The AI npc inconsistency has the potential to utterly ruin your attempt for a perfect quest clearance for at least one of the compulsory quests.\n\nThere's a general lack of ammunition and medipack drops at the start of the game, so each encounter has to be carefully planned and executed. Unfortunately, in the early parts of the game, much of the available ammunition can only be found in locked/trapped safes/chests/boxes, which require a significant investment into the necessary non combat skills, which affects the distribution of limited stat points for combat skills, further wasting limited ammunition. Not a bad thing in itself, but would require careful planning.\n\nA corollary to the above is, on the long run characters starting with high intel and charm will significantly outstrip all other characters in every single way. One of the earliest followers you can get is characteristic of this. Low intelligence results in inadequate points to spread amongst auxiliary abilities, which results in bombs exploding, locks breaking, alarms ringing, bone fractures, skipped conversation choices and blue screens of death, and crucially, low supplies.\n\nOther than this, an excellent, excellent game. The story is brilliant and the choices you make in the game have implications and depth, though a number are more akin to morally abstract implications.\n\nP.S. There is a hidden choice at the start of the game, though it makes your playthrough a little harder than the standard choices.

Think about a mix between Fallout 1/2 and Tactics (an actually good Tactics).\n\nYou probably will like this game if:\n- you enjoyed Wasteland 1 back then\n- you like turn based combat but don't expect it to be like in Jagged Alliance 2\n- you like Fallout 1 or 2 or Tactics\n- you like post-apokalyptic themes\n\nYou probably won't like this game if:\n- you need state-of-the-art graphics and staged stories like in Mass Effect\n- you expect without exception a Fallout 2.5\n\nYou have bit less freedom than in Fallout 1 & 2 but much more than in Tactics. The turn based combat offer many options but doesn't complicate things (think of XCOM:EU/EW, when it comes down to simplicity; not much micromanagement) so it keeps up the pace and therefore the fun! Combat can also be really hard on higher difficulties since there are some medical conditions you can get (e.g. concussion, blood loss, etc.) much more frequently than in Fallout 1 &2 (it was very rare to get hurt in the eyes, legs or arms). While the combat and interface mechanics are simple there are a lot of options, skills and abilities, e.g. to spot a trap on a door you need to activate your skill "perception" and it must be high enough. Spotting a trap is one thing but disarming is another thing that require the specific skill. In Fallout there were some skill with little or almost no use like Science but not so in Wasteland 2. Every skill you can learn can be used and some skills that seem irrelevant at first might even used in the first hour (like repairing toasters!).\n\nDo you know the tactical RPG The Fall: Last Days of Gaia? If yes think about Wasteland 2 like a next gen and well crafted and balanced version of The Fall (and Fallout Tactics). Everything just works, quests which appear pretty straight forward and easy at first may open up and get more complicated or leads you further than you have expected (think about Vampire: Bloodlines or The Witcher 1) The German version has some troubles with the translation here and there (few parts are poorly translated or not at all) so this may apply to other languages then English, too.\n\nThe soundtrack does really make you think you're in Wasteland 1 or Fallout 1. It's just well fitting and while depressing it really makes you enjoy and recognize the soundtrack deliberately.\n\nI wish there were more customization options for the character creation but you can use custom portraits like back in the old days of Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate. Since you probably use a camera angle with further distance it's not a big problem.\n\nThe price for this game retail is 30 bucks and for 40 you'll get the Ranger Edition in an amazing looking box with nice additional physical content (plus the Soundtrack from Wasteland 1 and 2). So you get more for your money than with many other triple A titles nowadays, physically and virtual.","September 20, 2014","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thankfully, I was proven wrong. I picked up the game for 40 dollars and so far it has been worth every penny.\n\nGameplay-\nThis isn't a game that holds your hand every step of the way, often times you need to think about what you are doing or saying (dialogue) and if you mess up it might give you an undesirable result. Personally, I enjoy it since I feel like everytime i go anywhere new there is a chance to find some need little tidbit or item that normally would not stand out.\n\nCharacters-\nWhile it is unusual to find an RPG these days that allows the creation of a party (only other one i can think of is might and magic legacy), it provides an opportunity to make characters specialize in different fields. For example, I have a hand to hand bruiser that has meathead skills (break, hard ♥♥♥ and mechanical repair (not meathead but the best i could do)). Then another character has sniper computer science and smart ♥♥♥. Another cool aspect is that you can assign characters religion, nationality and even their favorite pack of smokes- who knows maybe there is a little easter egg somewhere if you have a jewish asian etc. Also there are optional companions along the way, which can add 3 more faces (max) to your party.\n\nCombat-\nBeing as it is turn base, it takes patience, but at the same time it allows the methodical approach. A lot of people don't like weapon jamming (requires an action similar to a reload), but i like it considering it adds more variability. If you have like Classic Turn-Based combat then you will enjoy this.\n\nLoot-\nI dont like how treasure was dealt with in this game. I find myself normally picking up heaps of junk or 6-7 of the same crappy gun i've been using. It also seems a little odd that there is such an abundance of ammo in an apocalytic wasteland. There are also some hidden items that can be turned into npcs for rewards, so keep an eye out!\n\nThe World-\nThe game utilizes a travel mechanic that places the part on a "board" in which they have to travel to different locations all the while you can be attacked by raiders and be mindful of your water supply. As for whether the game is open ended or not, I would say yes to an extent. Even though there are optional side objectives, the path always leads you in the direction of the mission. It is similar to the Mass Effect Series as both have the option for exploration and side missions, but the story missions are required to advance.\n\nOverall-\nHave you played Divinity: Original Sin (check)\nHave you played Shadowrun Returns (check)\nHave you played Fallout 2 (check)\nDid you like any of them (check)\nThen you will love this (check)","September 20, 2014","true","80.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The player controls a squad of Desert Rangers, whose mission is to protect civilians and maintain law and order, but now an army of robots want to wipe out Humanity, and its up to the Rangers to stop them. I never played the original Wasteland, but I'm a massive fan of RPGs, and I certainly found alot to enjoy in this game.\n\nCombat is turn based on a square grid, with each action such as moving, firing, reloading and healing costing ability points, similar to Xcom or Shadowrun. Its very tactical, and you also have to pay attention to factors like cover, line of sight, weapon range and friendly fire. The maximum party size is seven, four of which are created by the player, and the others have to be recruited as you progress through quests.\n\nThere is a wide variety of abilities to put points into when levelling up. You can use several different types of guns and melee weapons, but also non-combat skills including lockpicking, safecracking, computer hacking, trap disarming, machinery repair and more. These skills are very useful because many quests can be completed in multiple ways, by finding alternate routes to enter a building or unlocking extra dialogue options.\n\nThe story is really good and there are lots of interesting characters and groups. From drug gangs to slavers and religious fanatics, there's always somebody more crazy in the next town. Many quests involve a conflict between two or more factions and the player has freedom to choose who to support, but you'll rarely find an obvious "good guys" faction, more often its a case of "which is the lesser evil?". Dialogue is mostly text based, with only the major characters being voiced, but its all well written with lots of dark humour.\n\nI didn't encounter any game breaking bugs, but occasionally I thought certain quest progressions could have been better. Like the time I drank from a water well, got infected with a disease, and used a normal inventory item to cure myself. Later I found the town's doctor, who asked me to investigate why the people were getting sick. I didn't have any option to say "dude, its your well". The only way to progress the quest was to travel to another town to find a special microscope so the doctor could check out some samples, and discover what I already knew several hours of gameplay earlier.\n\nI also didn't like that inactive companions didn't seem to gain XP. One of my earliest recruits was kind of annoying, constantly complaining about literally everything, so I wanted to ditch him. But every new recruit I found after that was several levels lower, and I didn't want to be weaker in combat, so I was stuck with him.\n\nExcept for those complaints, Wasteland 2 is a really great game, and I definitely recommend it to RPG fans, although genre newcomers would be better off starting with something less complex. It took me 68 hours to finish and I didn't complete every side quest, which is excellent value for money at full price.","January 31, 2015","true","68.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has the dark humour and post-apocalyptic setting of the Fallout series, with the punishing, perma-death combat of the XCOM series.\n\nThe graphics aren't amazing, but they're adequate for the game style. The music is atmospheric, the writing is fun, and the voice acting is hit-or-miss.\n\nThe gameplay is great for people who like this sort of turn-based squad combat. All the usual elements are here: objects in the environment provide cover, hits are percent-based, and actions cost AP to execute, which replenishes each turn.\n\nMy only real complaint is the navigation on the overworld map, which seems like a cop-out from making an interesting overworld. Whenever you aren't in an encounter area (random encounter, dungeon, town), your party is represented as a marker on a huge map of the American Southwest, which will slowly move toward your destination in the way Indiana Jones travels-- a line drawn on the map.\n\nIt's fun to create characters, and the combat is challenging but rewarding.\n\nWell worth the purchase price.","January 31, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an old school isometric RPG, and it's excellent.\n\nIt has it's flaws, but overall they don't undermine the experience, the worst I could say about this game is that there are some balance issues, and there are elements of the game that feel rough and unfinished.\n\nI think it suffers from kickstarter-itis .. where a developer seeks a budget on the KS platform, achieves or exceeds it, then works to that budget.  Back in the day, a company would outlay their own capital and not make money until the product was released, now kickstarter covers development and profit goes into someone's bank account.\n\nThe problem with this (understandable) model is that there's not a lot of room for stretch and polish.  You either wildly exceed the kickstarter or you don't - and if you do, let's face it, there's probably a bit more of a 'loose' approach with project management and a higher budget for chicken chow mein.\n\nI think there are functional elements of the game that should have been deeper, and there are story-telling elements that fell onto the 'nice to have but not essential' list and got cut.\n\nIncidentally, I haven't finished the game yet, I'm about 75% through (I think).\n\nHere's my view on the Good/Bad\n\nGood:\n- graphics and theme are nice\n- world map and random encounters makes you feel 'there'\n- radio chatter from different factions is immersive\n- background lore (the rangers, their character, their personalities) .. all good\n- combat: for the most part is satisfying and tactical\n- story: although contrived in places, overall the storytelling pulls you in and holds your interest\n- conversations and character writing is good for the most part (but also a missed opportunity)\n\nBad:\n- weapon balance has some very bad decisions, energy weapons in particular range from OP in some situations to useless in others.  I say balance, but I don't really care too much about balance, what bothers me is some of the weapons are balanced is .. well, not logical and doesn't fit into a consistent and realistic universe\n- Skills & Attributes: for me a real missed opportunity, they disconnect.  Example, Charisma doesnt effect conversations.  Seriously.  There's no randomness or discreet skill impact on conversations, just gatekeeper skills hardarse/intimidation, smartarse/logic, kissarse/charm .. and those skills are just numbers.  Likewise the balance of stats and skills is not really intuitive and clever in it's design, I guess in a way the game suffers from being compared to Fallout 2 in that regard.\n- Contrived/Illogical writing:  there are some key points where the writing is a bit .. contrived.  No matter what you do, it's pre-ordained that the outcome will lead you from A->B->C, doesnt matter if you're evil or good.  If I were to analogise with pen&paper roleplaying, it's basically having a GM who can't 'think on their feet' .. the underarching story should be invisible, it should feel like you have total freedom and YOU (the player) are calling the shots .. instead, there are a few key points in the story writing where you feel more than a bit led by the nose (worse, there are some points where you only have a couple of options and those options don't allow for wide variations in character, one specific example you have 3 options to respond to a challenge from your CO, and each of them forces you to lie.\n\n\nOverall, I give the game a solid 8.5 / 10 golden jabberoos.","February 1, 2015","true","286.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But like always there is one big thing what the developers have messed up really bad.\n\nThere are many Recruitable NPCs who are too squishy concerning their attributes and skills. Some RNPCs (or even everyone?!) don't have the same amount of attributes like your selfmade characters. Why?! I don't know... Furthermore their attributes don't fit to theit skills.\nAnd another point... There are still too less RNPCs. Before starting a game, I figured out how I want to play the game. I've read on some community-sites, that you should match your selfmade NPCs with the RNPCs who are waiting for me in the wastelands.\nWith the given RNPCs I am not able to play the game as I want, not so satisfying. There are always some skills missing I'd like to have in my party. For example I'd like to have all three speech kills (Smart ♥♥♥, Kiss ♥♥♥, Hard ♥♥♥) but then I don't have enough skill points to spend on other important skills.\n\nI hope there will be a patch who changes it.\n\nThe combat system could have been much more interesting. It only contains very basic stuff and in most cases the AI isn't very smart. Sometimes enemies are looking for cover but it happens very often that they stand in front of you with no cover. Melee fighters are always rushing to your party, even it is very obvious they won't survive it. Enemies with pistols are also quite stupid. They run to you and try to shoot you, even if you have more guys alive. Riflemen and snipers are smart and take cover and try to get higher positions than you.\n\nAnyway, it's a good RPG with many choices and possibilities. I'm playing it currently on Ranger-Difficulty (3rd difficulty of 4) and I must say, it's still pretty fair. Combat is challenging, but you always find enough equipment to patch your guys up.\n\nThe atmosphere very good, most RNPCs have unique dialogues which are quite funny. All the descriptions you get during the game are also so good. There is very much too read, but it's worth the time to spend with it.\n\nSo the points which deny a "very good" or "excellent" are:\n- too less RNPCs\n- RNPCs with bad attributes and skill which are not matching the given attributes\n- just basic combat system\n- "bad" AI (for melle and pistol fighters)\n\nOh, and on ranger difficulty you don't want to miss your outdoorsman-skill. :)","December 28, 2014","true","64.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The problem is that you have to avoid radiation and check your water levels so you dont die of thirst or radiation poisoning. while that may seem easy it can be pretty annoying to have the shortest route blocked by radiation and to take a detour means that you have to waste all your water and you end up with a dehydrated and tired group walking into an encounter. The encounters on the map are about as annoying as pokemon, imagine walking through a big grass field for an entire game of pokemon, imagine how many encounters that would be. EXACTLY! Besides those issues the world map is very well done and contains many other things to find like travelling merchants, treasure and watnot.\n\nThe encounters are completely random, but most of the time you'll just be fighting either, bandits, animals, etc... but for the others it can be things like merchants, towns etc... so you get the point of encounters.\n\nThe character leveling up system is interesting, at the start of the game you can either pick from a list of default characters or customise and create your own. it gives a pretty balanced set of skill and ability points to start you8r character on a certain playstyle. At the start of the game it will provide ytour characters with starting weapons based on their skills. To level up simply get enough XP and then use your radio(explain later) to call command, they will says soemthing like  "CONGRATZ YOU GET A PROMOTION" then you get the appropriate ability points to use one your character(s).\n\nThe Radio is a unique part of the game, you use to pick-up sidequests, recieve calls/updates from command, and get issued field promotions. you will just get random transmissions, important dialoge and other watnot from the radio, also the frequency changes by itself so you dont need to worry about that.\n\nCombat is much like certain classic games, your characters initiative skill determines what order your turn is in, and works as a top down turn-based rpg. all of your actions require Action Points so it's important to conserve them, any excess points will be carried over to the next mission.\n\nnot gonna talk about the storie because spoilers mate GO PLAY IT YOURSELF!\n\nso yeah...\n\n9/10 would kill a raider again","January 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Buy when on sale for under $20.\n\nPro:\n+ Post Apocalypse setting\n+ Lots of decision trees, dialog options\n+ Multiple ways to complete an objective\n+ Interesting story (bringing law and order to a place of total anarchy)\n+ Decent number of quests (about 60-70)\n+ Nice unique maps\n+ Dismemberment, melting on some kill shots\n+ Easy to use UI\n+ Humor and funny references especially of the 80’s throughout.\n\nCon:\n- Lacks the immersiveness of 1st person viewpoint games  (Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3)\n- Can’t interact with most of the environment.  Almost all building entrances are blocked and using explosives won’t change that.\n- Poor AI – just set up an ambush point on a map send out a meat shield to draw the enemies and kill them as they approach.  Works almost every time.\n- Explosives so overpowered in combat.  They never miss even if your character doesn’t have a single point in explosives. Give meatshield a ton of STR (which equals HP).  Have enemy mob him.  He runs out then toss grenades.  Battle won. Rinse. Repeat.\n- Game maps are fairly linear (except for Titan Canyon)\n- Dull weapon/shooting animations (just one animation for all weapons)\n- Non realistic skill (Toaster Repair (really!!))\n- Poor stat optimization.  Intelligence > all.  Many stats just not important.\n- Too many skills focused on just opening containers (open lock, tumbler, alarm, trap, perception) since you have to divide up skills amongst players to max them all quickly it means switching through multiple players just to open a container.  Pretty poor design.\n- Every container is either trapped or has an alarm attached to it (or both).\n- Few locations (Less than a two dozen maps in the AZ and CA zones)\n- RNG on skills is not even close to what is listed.  50% chance of success really means 10% chance of success at most.  Use PF9 and PF11 constantly can waste 10 minutes opening a chest/safe not very enjoyable.\n- Easily broken quests. Lots of reloading to complete a quest.\n- No mods or modding community (lack of replayability)\n\nNote my playtime means nothing as I have a small child now and often have a game running/paused on one monitor all weekend even though I may only play 15 minutes every couple hours when I have a few minutes to relax.  Probably only spent 25-30 hrs actually completing the game.\n\nIn general if you are a huge fan of Post Apocalypse games like me then you will enjoy this game.\n\nNot too many bugs in the game just a few like:\n- Examining ground that says something is buried but not allowing you to use a shovel or any other skill on the ground.  This happened 3-4 times.\n- Trying to save after visiting a travelling merchant to offload junk.  Get a message saying “you are in combat and can’t save at this time”  Guess the merchants don’t like the deal they received hehe.\n- Memory Leak (At least when you pause the game for 2+ hours and then unpause the game it moves slower than molasses. It’s a pain if you forgot to PF9 before hitting pause. (Use a liquid cooled Alienware rig as my main gaming machine and it’s a beast so they lag/stutter and huge decrease in frame-rate is due to a memory leak).\n\n\nThough please note that it is not even comparable to Fallout: New Vegas with its fully interactive environment, open world, 1st person view, great soundtrack, number of factions and locations but for a budget/on sale game this is something to enjoy for awhile.  Still not sure why all the most valuable items (skill books) in a post apocalypse world would be stored inside toasters.  Also be sure to PF9 before using any skill then PF11 when it fails will allow you to open every intractable item in the game.  Also press “Z” a lot to find all intractable items.\n","April 9, 2015","true","135.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the FPS updates of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were great in their own way, inExile's Wasteland 2 is the true "successor" to Fallout's vibe and gameplay.\n\nThis makes sense when you realize the Fallout universe was created as an IP-claim-avoiding homage to the original Wasteland.\n\nMany of the great people that worked on Fallout 1 & 2 have returned to make Wasteland 2, including great work from Chris Avellone on writing and design and the return of Mark Morgan's beautiful ambient music.\n\nIt's worth noting this is game is thematically dark, with far less of the goofy humor that started to undermine the Fallout series. There's swearing, sex, drugs, lots of graphic violence, and many, many morally ambiguous choices.\n\nI haven't even finished the game yet, but I am already planning a second trip through the wastes.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Fallout 1 and 2, Torment, Baldur's Gate, and post-apocalyptic fiction.","October 1, 2014","true","103.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat is a good mix of tactics and gear dependency and overall is very satisfying. When an enemys weapon jams just as he is about to kill one of your characters is exhilarating.

I loved the game from the start, and actually wanted to support Brian Fargo.\n\nIt was a great experince playing the beta to the finished verison. Of course any major patch would break your saves, but it's that type of game where you want to restart a few times anyway, more so to play with your Characters stats.\n\nI will say a lot of people have wrote about the game not being very tatical. There is some truth to that, there aren't too many cases where you can strage your characters for a fight, most encounters are just a straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest. A couple of hours just exploring the wasteland and looting will turn you into one tough ranger.\n\nIn the start of the game it seemed like there would be a lot of choices that would directly effect the game. Basically there is only one major choice to be made in the game and really only effects which character your going to pick up as a side kick.\n\nSome of the weapons don't hold much value, such as rocket launchers. Generally before you can use one the baddies are  on top of you already, or it's just not worth using. But it's interesting that you do have to have  players who are better with riffles than lazer weapons, which is part of the tatical portion of the game. Basically each Character should be very well rounded with two different weapons, more so till about 30 hours into the game. You can't have everyone using the same ammo.\n\nHalf the game takes place in AZ and the other half in CA. CA is interesting because things just get very strange. In any post nuclear war game youe expect raiders and mutant frogs, but crazy nuns? I wish the AZ portion of the game had more of the odd ball encounters you ran in during CA. The Characters in CA are more interesting as well as the plot.\n\nWhat I don't understand is the water movement system. In the first half the game you need to refill your canteens which isn't a big deal. In the second half, the concept just stops. It's minor, I'm not sure why I'm even bringing it up but it seemed like a major portion of the game but slowly got scaled back.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game, like fallout you play for the story and the ride, not so much the end result. It does have a lot of replayability, but as I said I played it from beta which meant I had several restarts. It does let you import your characters that you have progressed through out the game when you finish.\n\nA lot of the skills overlap, and there is more than one way to open a door generally.\n\nI paid 60 dollars for the game and got a little over 230 hours of pure enjoyment of the game, it was worth every penny. I just hope they make a wasteland 3 or a DLC to the game.\n\nOne thing they should add is being able to make your own rangers at your base even after you started. I think that would be a fun concept.","February 18, 2015","true","230.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have completed the beta part of the game and it is all I could have hoped. It has a great storyline, the dialogue is good, and the choices you have to make can be damn hard at times. This is not one of those RPG's you can just flip through the dialogue, sometimes doing that will make you miss out on options that aren't obvious (or trap you into fights you could have avoided).  The combat is tactical squad warfare and well designed for the most part. I have noticed sometimes the enemies do stupid things but mostly they try to kill you.

Same with the textures, if we where all playing pc games on say on the first xbox's hardware it would be acceptable but its 2014. I really hope that the art end of this game is not done yet in terms of improvement. But I am guessing its about as good as its going to get visually.\n\nThe other very limited weight/carry capacity, you do your first set of missions up to the first radio tower,  all of your inventory spots are about full, by the time you make it to the second tower your way overloaded, and a town/vendor to sell to  is far far away... and requires you to go though a radiation field, or go way out of your way around it, if you happen to get into a fight guess what you will pick up more stuff that you really have no room to carry. Hopefully the devs can find a solution to this.\n\nOverall great game, but it has many areas of improvement needed, from clunky controls, low polly assets that are almost waving like they are made of water when moving. To the tiny annoyances of inventory and not having a way to offload your loot at more locations besides out front of the ranger station at start of the game.","June 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Once your spotted (and you will be at a very long range usually)\nevery enemy near the one who spot you will enter combat. That part is okay i guess, because if you get spotted by an enemy human guard IRL i guess he would scream for help and the other would still be coming because of the gunfire.\n\nBut usually there is huge open areas which are impossible to sneak through without taking a totally different way which anyhow leads up to a combat situation just from an other entry point.\nSo forget about playing sneaky because there are no stealthboys in this game.\n\nAnd also the hit ratio seems messed up (or im just really unlucky).\n\nQuesting:\nI have really enjoyed the quest, its no pointing fingers in this game. You just get a general tip of the whereabout of whatever you'r searching for. It's no arrow pointing you exactly to the location to go. Which is really nice.\n\nIf you do the "right" thing in a questline its a huge chance you end up with better supplies and another follower to your party (which is always nice because combat is unforgiving, if you play on normal or ranger difficulty).\n\nLots of random loot you find will be of interest to various NPC's throughout the world (not the junk items, altho it says in tooltip that you never know who might be interested in a junk item. Still haven't found any use of em)\n\nWorld:\nLike many others said before me, its too much space with not enough content. And too many preset combat situations when walking on the map from zone to zone.\n\nBugs: With the most recent patch i havent encountered many. Just one where monk suiciders go through stairs and walls.\n\nOverall: 6/10 Lots of fun but without enough depth to satisfy you'r RPG experience. Too much sloppy work on character development (like there are only a few of your party members on whom you can customize pants, jacket and hat) Many of them got just preset apperance.\n\n","February 24, 2015","true","129.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Honestly, with all the crowdfunding games that under deliver, WL2 actually caught me by surprise with simply how much many locations and situations there are to discover.  This is a complete and well thought out game.\n\nStory wise, there are a lot of choices to be made among the ruins of the old world and the game excels at showing you the consequences of those decisions.  There is a location that became so story rich, I had to actually stop and think about the multi-layers of intrigue before acting on anyone’s request for help because the ramifications affected so many other characters.  (to be fair, this section was so involved that I found my trigger-finger itching for some combat but it was well worth it when it came)\n\nI also found the game mechanics deep and leveling characters was very satisfying.  There’s a ton of skills and your characters become focused on specific builds – one will be your safecrack/lockpick/alarm disabler and another might be your expert in assault rifles and demolitions – but I never felt limited when customizing.  What is equally surprising is that all skills come into play at some point and you are never required (mostly) to have a certain skill to progress through the main storyline; you always have options.\n\nAll in all, a great time.

I had really high expectations for this game but I really can't recommend it.  I wanted to love this game, I mean really LOVE it like I loved Fallout 2 or Jagged Alliance 2 or Morrowind. And I tried so hard to overlook the flaws I saw because damn it, I was waiting for this game over 20 years and I wasn't going to let some nittpicky BS stop me. But unfortunately all the problems I kept encountering just kept building up on each other until I pretty much gave up. Some of these problems are as follows:\n\nThe combat is shallow and lacks any sort of tactical feel despite being turn based; You rarely have a need to move your characters and most battles can be won by standing still and spaming attack or maybe toss a grenade. You can crouch or use a headshot but there's no real advantage that I notice to even bother with these moves.\n\nThe missions all seem half finished; apparently it's "hand holding" to ask for any sort of clue as to what you need to do or even why you need to do it. And all of the quests have multiple ways to "complete" them but if you're looking for multiple ways to complete them in a manner that the devs wanted you to in order to "win" the game then you'll need to rely on online guides because those solutions require an extremely linear path to be followed. And by "win" the game I mean by having the optimal completion where everyone you encounter was happy with what you did. Those endings are there but as I said they're not very easy to figure out.\n\n"Conversations" with NPC's are nothing more than triggering the next bit of dialog by clicking on the keyword; there's no branching at all and you're really not interacting with NPC's in any meaningful way.\n\nCharacter creation is also an oddity since it breaks the norm in most RPG's by having skills act completely independant of  attributes; ie charisma has no effect on your characters conversation skills or barter.\n\nAnd lastly there are some really bad bugs that have caused me to lose a lot of game play time; there's 3 quick save slots for a reason and you should be sure to use them.\n\nThere's a lot to like here but I'm not going to sit here with a "pros and cons" list because I figure a lot of people are like me: if I'm thinking about buying a game I'm pretty much sold on it already and what I need to know is the bad stuff. Now none of the stuff I said above is so much that it's caused me to hate the game but it is enough to make me wish I had held off and waited for more reviews instead of buying it day one. $14.99-$19.99 is probably a good price point for this game but $40 is too much for what you get.","October 16, 2014","false","78.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I loved the game from the start, and actually wanted to support Brian Fargo.\n\nIt was a great experince playing the beta to the finished verison. Of course any major patch would break your saves, but it's that type of game where you want to restart a few times anyway, more so to play with your Characters stats.\n\nI will say a lot of people have wrote about the game not being very tatical. There is some truth to that, there aren't too many cases where you can strage your characters for a fight, most encounters are just a straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest. A couple of hours just exploring the wasteland and looting will turn you into one tough ranger.\n\nIn the start of the game it seemed like there would be a lot of choices that would directly effect the game. Basically there is only one major choice to be made in the game and really only effects which character your going to pick up as a side kick.\n\nSome of the weapons don't hold much value, such as rocket launchers. Generally before you can use one the baddies are  on top of you already, or it's just not worth using. But it's interesting that you do have to have  players who are better with riffles than lazer weapons, which is part of the tatical portion of the game. Basically each Character should be very well rounded with two different weapons, more so till about 30 hours into the game. You can't have everyone using the same ammo.\n\nHalf the game takes place in AZ and the other half in CA. CA is interesting because things just get very strange. In any post nuclear war game youe expect raiders and mutant frogs, but crazy nuns? I wish the AZ portion of the game had more of the odd ball encounters you ran in during CA. The Characters in CA are more interesting as well as the plot.\n\nWhat I don't understand is the water movement system. In the first half the game you need to refill your canteens which isn't a big deal. In the second half, the concept just stops. It's minor, I'm not sure why I'm even bringing it up but it seemed like a major portion of the game but slowly got scaled back.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game, like fallout you play for the story and the ride, not so much the end result. It does have a lot of replayability, but as I said I played it from beta which meant I had several restarts. It does let you import your characters that you have progressed through out the game when you finish.\n\nA lot of the skills overlap, and there is more than one way to open a door generally.\n\nI paid 60 dollars for the game and got a little over 230 hours of pure enjoyment of the game, it was worth every penny. I just hope they make a wasteland 3 or a DLC to the game.\n\nOne thing they should add is being able to make your own rangers at your base even after you started. I think that would be a fun concept.","February 18, 2015","true","230.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Please keep in mind it is Wasteland and NOT Fallout. If you had to compare then it is more like Fallout tactics had a kid with Fallout 1 bec. the combat is very important. It is also a turn based combat so if you come thinking Fallout 3 style you will be very sad.\n\nOK. As for combat overall I love the feel, but i HATE that there are no formations. Please after all the blepping patches and it is still not here!! This really really needs to be in the freaking game. Really. Having to set up each of your people before a touch combat starts manually is a pain. The fact that combat is fun lessen the annoyance. But it still is there.\nOk rant over.\n\nPros for me: 1) Story is pretty cool; not too cheesey and has some ploy twist. 2) Combat is fun once your start with laods of weapons 3) Skills matter. What you pick can change the way you access your goals and items.\n\n2 main cons for me: 1) No formations 2) I wish I I could really be more "evil" in my second playthrough. You can sort of I guess, once you get to Hollywood, but that does not play out. I wish it had more of Fallout New vegas style ending (pick 1 of 3 sides), but that is just me.\n\nOverall the cons are small issues that kinda stick in your teeth, but the Pros are nice juicey big ones that make your mouth smile and yell at your computer when you woop some a%$.\n","March 16, 2015","true","220.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like Shadowrun I would highly recommend this to you. Especially if you like the Fallout series because the RPG element in this game is pretty much similar. Think Fallout meets Shadowrun.\n\nAnyway, before you do start the game, if you're familiar with Fallout, like in Fallout, do some research about stat gains and what it gives, and how those stat gain affects your gameplay so that you know what you can cap early on. Same goes for your skills. Except that when concerning skills, you would wanna check up on what skills are commonly needed in the wasteland to survive. Otherwise, you're going to dislike the game even before you're halfway through with it.\n\nMy only issue is the formula derived for chances because it seems pretty wonky. For example, most of the times something which is  91% and above and your 1% of critical failure, you would expect it to pass without a critical failure. At most you'd expect just a failure, if not at all. But from what I noticed, it seems this game's chance formula is failure baised. Because even if a high passing rate with 80-90%, critical failure when opening doors and unlocking stuff are pretty damn common for a 1% critical failure.\n\nHowever, if you can live with that issue, then by all means GET THE GAME ALREADY!","March 13, 2015","true","47.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A solid 5/10 "you tried" for inxile's kickstarter game. It's a functional tactical RPG that doesn't do anything horribly wrong, just... rough. Combat tends to be a stand-and-shoot affair. Cover is sparse and inconsistent; X-Com this isn't. Every map in the game needs a thorough rebuild of the combat grid. Level design is half-♥♥♥♥♥ and feels incomplete on all but the Ag Center map, which is what they put together to showcase the game six months ago, so of course it got three times the effort. ... still horrible about cover, though.\n\nEquipment balance is all over the place. Entire weapon classes that do jack-all (smg, lookin' at you), and assault rifles that out-range and out-hit most sniper rifles. And of course, a separate skill for every minor weapon type rather than classes of weapon (three different melee skills). But then bafflingly, no skill at all required for explosives, rocket launchers, etc.\n\nCharacter design is limited and ugly, with no cosmetic appearance for armor. And it's almost insulting how so many of the unique appearance items like "top hat" or "chef's cap" have generic models if you put them on a female character. Women too hard, guys? Echos of Ubi here. You can even see it in the character creator, too, where it seems like you have to double-click to move to a new appearance, but you're really just cycling through identical options that look unique on guys. Skill bloat runs rampant, with things shoehorned in to force replays. Three different conversation skills? Really? FIVE different "open the box" skills? C'mon.\n\nAnd despite it all... I've had a fair bit of fun. The game has its frustrations, sure. It's a bit disappointing after all the excitement. But that's Kickstarter for you. In the end, there's a lot to enjoy, and that doesn't have to be drowned out by the flaws.","September 30, 2014","true","26.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

But like always there is one big thing what the developers have messed up really bad.\n\nThere are many Recruitable NPCs who are too squishy concerning their attributes and skills. Some RNPCs (or even everyone?!) don't have the same amount of attributes like your selfmade characters. Why?! I don't know... Furthermore their attributes don't fit to theit skills.\nAnd another point... There are still too less RNPCs. Before starting a game, I figured out how I want to play the game. I've read on some community-sites, that you should match your selfmade NPCs with the RNPCs who are waiting for me in the wastelands.\nWith the given RNPCs I am not able to play the game as I want, not so satisfying. There are always some skills missing I'd like to have in my party. For example I'd like to have all three speech kills (Smart ♥♥♥, Kiss ♥♥♥, Hard ♥♥♥) but then I don't have enough skill points to spend on other important skills.\n\nI hope there will be a patch who changes it.\n\nThe combat system could have been much more interesting. It only contains very basic stuff and in most cases the AI isn't very smart. Sometimes enemies are looking for cover but it happens very often that they stand in front of you with no cover. Melee fighters are always rushing to your party, even it is very obvious they won't survive it. Enemies with pistols are also quite stupid. They run to you and try to shoot you, even if you have more guys alive. Riflemen and snipers are smart and take cover and try to get higher positions than you.\n\nAnyway, it's a good RPG with many choices and possibilities. I'm playing it currently on Ranger-Difficulty (3rd difficulty of 4) and I must say, it's still pretty fair. Combat is challenging, but you always find enough equipment to patch your guys up.\n\nThe atmosphere very good, most RNPCs have unique dialogues which are quite funny. All the descriptions you get during the game are also so good. There is very much too read, but it's worth the time to spend with it.\n\nSo the points which deny a "very good" or "excellent" are:\n- too less RNPCs\n- RNPCs with bad attributes and skill which are not matching the given attributes\n- just basic combat system\n- "bad" AI (for melle and pistol fighters)\n\nOh, and on ranger difficulty you don't want to miss your outdoorsman-skill. :)","December 28, 2014","true","64.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The problem is that you have to avoid radiation and check your water levels so you dont die of thirst or radiation poisoning. while that may seem easy it can be pretty annoying to have the shortest route blocked by radiation and to take a detour means that you have to waste all your water and you end up with a dehydrated and tired group walking into an encounter. The encounters on the map are about as annoying as pokemon, imagine walking through a big grass field for an entire game of pokemon, imagine how many encounters that would be. EXACTLY! Besides those issues the world map is very well done and contains many other things to find like travelling merchants, treasure and watnot.\n\nThe encounters are completely random, but most of the time you'll just be fighting either, bandits, animals, etc... but for the others it can be things like merchants, towns etc... so you get the point of encounters.\n\nThe character leveling up system is interesting, at the start of the game you can either pick from a list of default characters or customise and create your own. it gives a pretty balanced set of skill and ability points to start you8r character on a certain playstyle. At the start of the game it will provide ytour characters with starting weapons based on their skills. To level up simply get enough XP and then use your radio(explain later) to call command, they will says soemthing like  "CONGRATZ YOU GET A PROMOTION" then you get the appropriate ability points to use one your character(s).\n\nThe Radio is a unique part of the game, you use to pick-up sidequests, recieve calls/updates from command, and get issued field promotions. you will just get random transmissions, important dialoge and other watnot from the radio, also the frequency changes by itself so you dont need to worry about that.\n\nCombat is much like certain classic games, your characters initiative skill determines what order your turn is in, and works as a top down turn-based rpg. all of your actions require Action Points so it's important to conserve them, any excess points will be carried over to the next mission.\n\nnot gonna talk about the storie because spoilers mate GO PLAY IT YOURSELF!\n\nso yeah...\n\n9/10 would kill a raider again","January 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The funny thing is that the mediocrity of Wasteland 2 reminded me how great Fallout New Vegas was and I finally finished my walkthrough of that game, rather than continuing with Wasteland 2. Both games attempt the same thing in so many ways, but Fallout just does it better. The writing, the quests, the immersiveness... Even though I actually prefer isometric RPGs to Fallout's ego perspective, Wasteland's implementation of it has a wide variety of shortcomings. The world feels much more static because environmental objects cannot be manipulated, the different areas are much smaller in size, and the overall level of interaction is much lower.\n\nOther downsides to be aware of:\n- AI is very dumb\n- Percentage based skill checks lead to a lot of reloading (it probably would have been better to have a binary 100% or 0% chance).\n- Balancing of different weapon types is off (melee based characters seem weak, assault rifle beats everything)\n- Battles are not tactical enough (more types of cover would have been nice, more firing modes, more environmental interaction, better system for explosive weapons)\n\nIn spite of all this critique, I enjoyed the "classic" feel to the game and the very post-apocalyptical setting that inspired the original Fallout.

While the FPS updates of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were great in their own way, inExile's Wasteland 2 is the true "successor" to Fallout's vibe and gameplay.\n\nThis makes sense when you realize the Fallout universe was created as an IP-claim-avoiding homage to the original Wasteland.\n\nMany of the great people that worked on Fallout 1 & 2 have returned to make Wasteland 2, including great work from Chris Avellone on writing and design and the return of Mark Morgan's beautiful ambient music.\n\nIt's worth noting this is game is thematically dark, with far less of the goofy humor that started to undermine the Fallout series. There's swearing, sex, drugs, lots of graphic violence, and many, many morally ambiguous choices.\n\nI haven't even finished the game yet, but I am already planning a second trip through the wastes.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Fallout 1 and 2, Torment, Baldur's Gate, and post-apocalyptic fiction.","October 1, 2014","true","103.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevenfiftysix/recommended/240760/","sevenfiftysix","SevenFiftySix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevenfiftysix/","81 products in account","Harsh and unforgiving. That applies to the hostile wastes of the irradiated American Southwest and to this game on moderate or higher difficulties. Its style may be rough for those who haven't played the older "tough" RPGs, but it's a nice change of pace from the current "hand holding" style of most modern RPGs. Actions have consequences, people will die, and you can only do so much to stop it.\n\nYou start by forming a squad of 4 rangers, selecting their skills and attributes. There are a couple dozen skills which makes your choices at this stage a bit difficult and I'd suggest you check out a community guide to them before diving in to help make sense of it all. If you'd rather NOT spend a solid hour develpoing a team you can use presets, but come on, we all want to make our own people in an RPG right?\n\nCombat takes place on a grid and is turn based with cover similar to xcom, the positioning of your people even before battle will be the difference between life or death in some situations. If you've not modified your weapons with weaponsmithing they'll jam, and you'll run out of ammo quickly on harder difficulties if you don't stock up at base every now and then. You'll need at least one dedicated medic/surgeon in the team and keep their supplies well stocked too, nobody wants to leave their partners bleeding out in the wastes because you forgot to pack extra bandages.\n\nAs of now (patch 1) it's still rather buggy in the second half of the game. Save often and in different files just in case. It's certainly playable, but some odd issues may cause you trouble if you've not saved more than once in the past 5 hours. The graphics aren't the best, but if that's what you're worried about then you'll probably want to play something else anyway. At the moment there are some odd things missing from character customization like no male gas masks. The camera occasionally bugs out in combat which makes it difficult to target enemies but it usually fixes itself by the next turn.\n\nThe story continues after Wasteland 1 but it's not required you understand the first game's plot to start the second.  Years ago the rangers killed a robotic menace, but now strange things are happening which seems to have something to do with their past enemy.  Simple enough. The main story takes a couple turns but nothing huge or shocking, though there are a load of sidequests and characters to spice things up as you move along. The content shifts back and forth from dark to goofy quite a bit which may be off putting for some, the game contains more outdated "real world" objects like Furby and Betamax than similar games (*cough*fallout*cough*). If you want a purely dark and gritty story, you won't find it here. If you don't rush through then at minimum you'll put a good 25-35 hours into a single runthrough and still miss something here and there.\n\nIn short, I dig it. If you're into this sort of thing then you'll probably dig it too. Just don't expect the big red button to do nothing when you push it.","October 6, 2014","true","105.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is the successor to the grand father of cRPGs, the spiritual father of FALLOUT...This is Wasteland 2!\nThe game is still in beta (or early access, what ever you want to call it). It is also still suffering from optimization issues, bugs, and clunky game design.\nHOWEVER, these things do not hinder the game. In its state, is is solid, and plays very well. It feels like a true port-apocalyptic game, and it can definitely stand up to FALLOUT of STALKER. The story telling is wonderful, combat works and feels great, the atmosphere is just perfect, there is a bit of humor and secrets, many new and unfamiliar enemies, andTONS of customization. You can tactically set up your team and develop them as they level up, or you can build your own character from the ground up. It is just overall a well done project.\nIt is still being developed, and new updates will be coming out for it. The UI will be fixed, it will be optimized, much more will be added...and in the end, this wonderful, promising stone will be polished to be one of the greatest cRPGs done.\nI know, the price tag is a little steep. But, if you are willing to buy it, and if you are willing to put up with a (currently) incomplete game, and if you are going to commit yourself to giving back to the devs, then it will be a worthwhile purchase. Additionally, this is a great game if you loved FALLOUT (esp. the first 2 and tactics) and Wasteland.\nShould you buy it? It depends, you might not want to, and you are certainly not being forced to. But if you do, know you are contributing to a constantly developing and promising sequel to a beloved game.","February 4, 2014","true","44.6"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","1"

Buy when on sale for under $20.\n\nPro:\n+ Post Apocalypse setting\n+ Lots of decision trees, dialog options\n+ Multiple ways to complete an objective\n+ Interesting story (bringing law and order to a place of total anarchy)\n+ Decent number of quests (about 60-70)\n+ Nice unique maps\n+ Dismemberment, melting on some kill shots\n+ Easy to use UI\n+ Humor and funny references especially of the 80’s throughout.\n\nCon:\n- Lacks the immersiveness of 1st person viewpoint games  (Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3)\n- Can’t interact with most of the environment.  Almost all building entrances are blocked and using explosives won’t change that.\n- Poor AI – just set up an ambush point on a map send out a meat shield to draw the enemies and kill them as they approach.  Works almost every time.\n- Explosives so overpowered in combat.  They never miss even if your character doesn’t have a single point in explosives. Give meatshield a ton of STR (which equals HP).  Have enemy mob him.  He runs out then toss grenades.  Battle won. Rinse. Repeat.\n- Game maps are fairly linear (except for Titan Canyon)\n- Dull weapon/shooting animations (just one animation for all weapons)\n- Non realistic skill (Toaster Repair (really!!))\n- Poor stat optimization.  Intelligence > all.  Many stats just not important.\n- Too many skills focused on just opening containers (open lock, tumbler, alarm, trap, perception) since you have to divide up skills amongst players to max them all quickly it means switching through multiple players just to open a container.  Pretty poor design.\n- Every container is either trapped or has an alarm attached to it (or both).\n- Few locations (Less than a two dozen maps in the AZ and CA zones)\n- RNG on skills is not even close to what is listed.  50% chance of success really means 10% chance of success at most.  Use PF9 and PF11 constantly can waste 10 minutes opening a chest/safe not very enjoyable.\n- Easily broken quests. Lots of reloading to complete a quest.\n- No mods or modding community (lack of replayability)\n\nNote my playtime means nothing as I have a small child now and often have a game running/paused on one monitor all weekend even though I may only play 15 minutes every couple hours when I have a few minutes to relax.  Probably only spent 25-30 hrs actually completing the game.\n\nIn general if you are a huge fan of Post Apocalypse games like me then you will enjoy this game.\n\nNot too many bugs in the game just a few like:\n- Examining ground that says something is buried but not allowing you to use a shovel or any other skill on the ground.  This happened 3-4 times.\n- Trying to save after visiting a travelling merchant to offload junk.  Get a message saying “you are in combat and can’t save at this time”  Guess the merchants don’t like the deal they received hehe.\n- Memory Leak (At least when you pause the game for 2+ hours and then unpause the game it moves slower than molasses. It’s a pain if you forgot to PF9 before hitting pause. (Use a liquid cooled Alienware rig as my main gaming machine and it’s a beast so they lag/stutter and huge decrease in frame-rate is due to a memory leak).\n\n\nThough please note that it is not even comparable to Fallout: New Vegas with its fully interactive environment, open world, 1st person view, great soundtrack, number of factions and locations but for a budget/on sale game this is something to enjoy for awhile.  Still not sure why all the most valuable items (skill books) in a post apocalypse world would be stored inside toasters.  Also be sure to PF9 before using any skill then PF11 when it fails will allow you to open every intractable item in the game.  Also press “Z” a lot to find all intractable items.\n","April 9, 2015","true","135.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It gets a thumbs up for the story and writing but just barely.\n\nPossibly the biggest disappointment for me in 2015, even though this is still a B- game over all.","April 15, 2015","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's too lackluster and has a few major issues. It plays fine, and I will probably continue playing it even after I write this, but there's two main issues at the time of writing.\nThe first being off is the god for saken prison. Ran by raiders with no redeemable factors that turn people into slaves only be disguising them as workers. They do nothing good, everyone that you come across will say you can be the savior, march right up to the leader, and kill him, simple task, right?\n\nApparently not, once you get there you run into a plotwall. Two turrets at 4K health each(To put that in perspective, 20ish hours in my characters only have 125ish health). Okay, fine, just bring out heavy weapons. Wrong again, they have a stupid high intiative, and a stupid high amount of action points. They fired 5ish times each, doing 300 damage per bullet. Good luck getting your party through that.\n\nEven if you *DO* manage to kill the turrets, there's apparently accounts of impossible-to-defuse landmines that 1 hit kill party members.\n\nWhy is this happening? I'm not sure, but if I had to guess, one of the team members working on wasteland felt so proud of their plot twist they decided to make sure everyone can only expirence the plot twist like that. So you just have to go 'welp, i know these guys beat and enslave you, but hes's got deus ex machina backing him so we can't do anything till the game says so'\n\nThe other issue is just hour 10ish. It becomes out-of-ammo gun-jam simulator. You won't have enough ammo to get into skrims, or if you do, you'll be cutting it close and it'll just be fustrating. Then when you do have ammo, your gun jams. A lot. I'm not sure how complex a double barrel shotgun is, but i'm pretty sure it's not prone to the amount of jamming it got.\n\nNow for the nitpicky stuff. Somethings just outpace your levels, but that's fine, maybe I shouldn't be rushing through the content as fast as I was. Another issue is just not being able to interact with the world. There's a girl who's (perpetually) dying, constantly groaning into your radio, asking for some one named Elroy. You can find her, confront her. But even if you're the best doc of the entire world, you can't help her, only shoot her. It may sound super nit picky, but not even given the illusion of choice sucks. I couldn't try, I could only mercy kill.\n\nThere is good htngs, the game is close to being a perfect masterpiece.\nCombat is actually alright, atleast mid game. Things start getting faster, combat is quick but a bit tactical. It could benefit from a few small tweaks. Flanking, some more cover options, and a change to friendly fire calculations(Not as bad as fallout 2. Damn it Sulik, give me that gun.)\n\nThe characters are alright, followers feel human as they comment on the scenery and situation where applicable, instead of being a silent moving turret. They have their flaws, they have their benefit, but not so much so they become a god send or dead weight.\n\nOver all the game feels... unpolished. It feels as if I'm playing in a beta, which I'm not. If it gets changed, or the mod tools get released, I'm sure this game could be something fantastic. But at the moment it's simply okay.","January 1, 2015","false","37.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Relatively boring battles/gameplay. Decent sound and graphics, but limited customization and very ugly character models.  Would have fared better without the high expectations from the kickstarter. Close to a positive recommendation, but not quite: 5/10.\n\nThe sequel to the inspiration for Fallout... talk about high expectations. Add to this the fact that it was a super-successful Kickstarter project that promised to put the creative people back in charge of their own projects, and it's easy to see why so many hopes for the future of PC roleplaying rest(ed) on this game. I found it somewhat disappointing in many details small and large, unfortunately. Would I have liked it without the hype? I will never know. Does it matter for this review? No. A game that carries so much baggage needs to be reviewed with it in mind.\n\nStory/World:\nMeh. As so often, it is difficult to say anything without too many spoilers. The world is an... interesting place. Unlike Fallout, it places less emphasis on realism and does not take itself too seriously, allowing for some weird and fascinating factions and places, which are fun to explore. Unfortunately, while there are some gems, the size of the world means that no place has much depth and really catches your heart. Did I feel at home and connected to Ranger Citadel? No. Did I care that a lot of old acquaintances showed up, helped and died in the final battle? No. Did I really care for the epilogues for the places I had visited? No. So: While the game presents a varied and interesting world, it failed to pull me in.\n\nAdditionally, they sat a bit heavily on the predecessor (old characters, old locations, old stories that are repeated again and again) which I did not play, making it hard for me to get invested.\n\nDialogues were a mixed bag as well. Some good, but also a lot of repetition of the same pieces of information over and over again.\n\nThe roleplaying came down to a handful of choices (Do I help this person? Which of those two factions do I support?). My characters lacked, unfortunately, a character.\n\nThe main story is actually very short. Weird robots show up. Now go and fight them. It's nice and consistent, without plot holes, but the ending  not only digs out the Big Bad from part one, but also uses the Terminator reasoning for the nuclear war, which seems lazy.\n\nSound:\nNice enough, but could have been more varied.\n\nGraphics:\nI usually don't care too much about graphics, but some things really disturbed me here from the very beginning. Character models are ugly. What's more, there are a very limited number of character portraits, all of which are used as NPC portraits as well, so you quite often have two identically-looking people talking to each other. Finally, the descriptions of characters in the world very often don't match their portrait at all. Takes me out of the story.\nThat said, the maps are done with great care and are quite beautiful.\n\nGameplay:\nYeah... that was what almost made me give up on the game in between. There are a few minor things that bugged me (area map is a screenshot, allows no notes, shows no locations), but the big thing is the combat. This is where you spend most of your game. But the combat is pretty damn boring: There is a basic cover mechanic, but many places in which you will find yourself starting battles are devoid of cover at least for your group. Thus, many battles end up being about choosing who to shoot. Throw in some small-ish things like unclear sight lines/weapon ranges especially when the battle goes over two levels and the whole affair becomes less an intricate chess game between you and the (mediocre) AI and more a tedious excercise in mopping up without using too many resources.\n\nThen there are the crates. And the safes. And the holes. And the toasters. Everything wants to give you items, which are absolutely necessary in the beginning and absolutely superfluous in the end. But if you're anything like me, you will STILL open the next safe - just in case of the very occasional plot-relevant item. Makes the game go even slower and becomes, at times, an excercise in quick-saving and quick-loading.\n\nFinally, while the game throws loads of skills at you, there is no deep character building here. One weapon skill, one auxiliary skill (or three for the skill monkeys) per person, done.\n\nIn summary, while the game amused me and made me smile at times, it did not make me think and it did not make me care for its world or characters. At least one of those I expect from a roleplaying game. Thus: Not recommended.\n\nAddendum: Reading it again, this review sounds exceptionally negative. It wasn't really meant to be; most of the issues I mentioned bothered me, but not as much as in other games. It's just that a lot of things that don't bother me too much add up to make this game pretty mediocre - maybe 5/10.","January 15, 2015","false","131.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabrial/recommended/240760/","gabrial","Gabrial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabrial/","292 products in account","Right well... how to describe this game?\n\nIts very much a spiritual sequel to class Fallout games people might better know than the original Wasteland its self.\nYou can create 4 party memebers(also able to recruit upto two more as the story progresses) stats are all important and in a way you want to have every skill in your six man party as you loose out a lot missing any. Lots of role play choices, some morality plays and a fair bit of humor. Story is engaging but slow as you can do alot out side/along side the story and it is of the classic grand scale of the best isometric RPGs but that is an issue for some. It has Honey Badgers but they are unrealistic in so far as being killable, so a small mark up and down there.\n\nNow i'm over the twenty hour mark i'm still enjoying it, trying to do everything and find some treads from a robot to bust open a bunker, the lack of stealth to correctly setup an ambush exactly as i want is tough some times, but outside of that complaint game play is balanced and intresting. My knife weilding mexican is effective in meele while my assault rifle weilding Ms Deth may be higher damage the ammo she chews through can be a little short at times this balance feels just about right.\n\nAll in all a good rounded RPG that'll probally take 40-60 hours by the end with maybe a second play through, recomended for man, Badger or Robot.","October 2, 2014","true","21.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
