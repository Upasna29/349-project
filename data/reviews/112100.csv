Until recently.\n\nMany of the "recommended" reviews here are from people who spent a very, very short time playing Avadon. Had I written such a review when I was only a couple of hours into the game, it would have been positive, too. It was very fun at the start... but then it became profoundly NOT fun.\n\nYou see, early on, you have a couple of quests and a couple of locations. You have various characters, you find items, battles are nice, you get better loot, your characters work in synergy... And then the game suddenly becomes a chore. Quests pile up. The quest texts never get updated. There are no indicators anywhere about the people you need to visit or return to. No indicator of what you need to do. I spent a lot of time going around and talking to people, only to find out that a quest isn't over. The loot doesn't scale up. Your damage doesn't scale up. And the game difficulty (I played on "normal") suddenly switches to "most frustrating game ever". You die. You die a lot. You are too weak. You need luck with the RNG, and you need potions and scrolls in greater amounts that you can obtain. Your abilities are on a large cooldown. Again, not enough potions to alleviate that. To add insult to injury, you spend vitality on abilities and vitality *does not recharge by itself*. You need to basically go back to the Avadon fortress on a semi-regular basis. There's no real quick-travel system, so every time you want to do that, you're looking at about five wasted minutes.\n\nAbout 15 hours in, I seriously contemplated quitting right there and then; but I said to myself "you spent more on this than on many other games, so you NEED to finish it". I had a quest to follow a warrior into the woods and clear out some spiders. "Some" turned out to be about four nests of four to five spiders each. They were teleporting spiders which cast corrupting spells and thus did a lot of damage-over-time. Took me an hour to finally win that sidequest. Okay, I said, this is one of the harder battles; let's continue. Then I found what was an almost unbeatable Shade. Somehow managed to get that done as well. Then I found an evil Drake that spawned minions *and* mind-controlled several tough soldiers (EDIT: forgot to mention that it was HEALING those soldiers, so every time you came close to killing one, it would be healed to max HP; repeat 4-5 times, while your characters die and you've spent all of your potions). That... that was unbeatable, and it was the turning point at which I resorted to cheats: bumped my characters to level 30, then constantly used healing, shields and ability cooldown reset.\n\nI gave up on the sidequests. I have no idea where I found most of the people and what I needed to do next (again - the quest system is extremely rudimentary and doesn't tell you anything). Even with constant cheating, it took me a total of 40 hours to finish the main story line.\n\nDisregard the "recommended" reviews, honestly, and check the achievements:\n\nOnly 1/3 of the total number of players met a certain NPC called Redbeard, and that happens *very* early into the game.\n\nOnly 1/50 (a measly 2%) of the players finished Avadon. Two percent. Wow.\n\nYou see all those <40hr reviews? Yeah, they recommended a game they never finished. If it's so fun and great and awesome, why did they stop playing? Because of the issues I mentioned here. Let's not even get into "OMG BEST GAME EVER!!11" reviews from people with 1-5 hours in.\n\nSkip this. Honestly. Even if you get this in a bundle, it's just not worth playing. Get an RPG that's actually fun.\n\nIf you *do* feel masochistic and try to play without cheating, I'll give you a tip: in this game, Dexterity rules. Get it to a minimum of 25.\n\nHighly not recommended.","March 27, 2014","false","40.1"," 364 of 467 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","364","467","11","16"

I'm ashamed that I didn't know about these Spiderweb titles previously.\n\nGather round me children, for there's a tale I'd like to share.  Once there was a time when video games entertained the player an immersive story and provocative challenges that kept you playing for hours.\n\nI've never liked the term "dungeon crawler".  To me the crawler part implies slow which let's be honest, is generally associated with boring in the world of books, movies and video games.  When was the last time you couldn't wait to dig in to a slow book someone recommended?\nSo when I saw that genre ascribed to this and other Spiderweb titles I dismissed them pretty quickly.  I didn't feel like click-spamming my way through another shallow DC chasing the next-best weapon for hours on end - mindlessly racing to the next waypoint, only taking breaks to managing a mountain of gear (/cough...torchlight)...\n\nSo as I was browsing my games library through titles I'll never get to and I barely recognize, the term "turn-based" caught my eye.\n"Turn-based"...dungeon-crawler?\nNow that's a name I"ve not heard in a long time.  A long time.\n\nI must have played through "Planescape: Torment" three times since it's release.  The same can be said for "Fallout 1/2".\nI can't chalk up their awesome replayablility to nostalgia any more.  These are simply incredibly entertaining titles and the reason I've played them all so often is that nothing after (to my knowledge) ever properly took up where they left off.  Well that was until I discovered this game.\n\nThis game, like Planescape and Fallout 1&2 focus on story depth, simple, intuitive UI/game mechanics, and challenging "strategic" (yet simple) combat.  I don't mean simple as in "easy", I just mean you will very quickly become well-versed your battle playbook and the challenge lies in making good decisions as it is turn-based.\nIf you're familiar Fallout 1 & 2 or Planescape Torment then to put it simply this game is very similar to those but in a classic fantasy setting.    It's also a nice reminder of the days when RPG titles didn't hold your hand every step of the way.  The quest descriptions are clear, but the objectives are kept broad enough keep the players guessing as to how exactly to complete them.\n\nCombine all of the above with perfectly classic "if-it-ain't-broke" fantasy RPG elements and you have this surprisingly impressive game.  I can't recommend this title enough for old-school PC nerds like myself as well as newcomers.\n\nI could go on and on but I gotta get back to the game.\nI give it 2 ogre-thumbs up","December 13, 2014","true","100.6"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","57","60","4","1"

That's pretty much true of everything they put out. The big changes to the formula are: a new world; a significantly more linear progression than most of the other entries in their lineup, a class-and-skill-tree approach to character builds, and party members who are fully fledged NPCs that contribute insights and dialogue throughout the plot as you move through it, can be spoken to between missions, and have their own side agendas you will have to deal with.\n\nThe new world is an intriguing fantasy setting where five disparate and feuding lands have banded together in a defensive pact against pirates, invading empires, marauding humanoids and dragons, a blighted magical corruption, and other exterior threats. The pact is held together by the dictatorial enforcement of the Black Fortress Avadon, and they maintain a network of spies and enforcement agents to ensure compliance. The fairly unique conceit of this particular entry (and who knows, perhaps followup games in the series) is that you play Hands of Avadon, sent to enforce the laws of the pact and defend it from threats within and without. This gives you rather more authority and a much more fearsome reputation than your typical band of wandering adventurers, and this is used to good effect throughout, although alas you still have to contend with buying your own supplies, a tired RPG trope that seems even more out of place in this context (though they do attempt to explain it).\n\nThe linearity is somewhat unfortunate, but things do open up as you gain access to more of the areas and return to zones on new missions, and most of the sidequests can be done at your leisure. Still, the flipside of linearity is that you're always being sent into challenges that you should be equipped to handle, and it's always clear what you're expected to do next, neither of which are guaranteed in more open formats.\n\nI am personally a big fan of Avadon's approach to skills and classes. I find the structure of new ability at rank 1, additional effect(s) at later ranks, and unlocking a secondary ability at a late rank very rewarding and I never feel like my points are wasted or that I have to save points from level to level just to advance at all, which have been issues I've historically had with the more freeform skill approach earlier Spiderweb games took (and other games with skill systems, for that matter). And Avernum in particular suffered from boring fighter syndrome where spellcasters got huge suites of spells to cast for a varied combat experience and fighters...got to hit things. Not here. The Blademaster class even passively is a blast, with heavy passive investment rewarding cleaves, a hilariously effective level of hit prevention, and the chance to riposte, curse enemies, or begin regenerating  if hit, and then on top of that gets group buffs and debuffs and attacks with additional secondary effects. The Shadowwalker hurls shurikens, teleports around, throws pots of acid and smoke bombs, backstabs and poisons, and is a huge fountain of damage in general.  (Needless to say, I was pleased when the Avernum remake cribbed from this system, albeit in a more Avernum-y way.)\n\nAs for the NPCs - there's one of every type, you get them all pretty nearly immediately, they stay levelled with you even if you're not using them, and they all have interesting personalities and backstories. I've never been a huge fan of the "party too large for everyone to simultaneously adventure with you" thing, but this is about as good as it gets considering that.\n\nSo all in all, another classic RPG. It's not quite as old school as previous series from Spiderweb, but the deviations from that formula mostly are in the vein of improvements in RPG design, in my book, not stepping away from the core appeal.","November 29, 2013","true","47.9"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","0"

Except better: no swapping floppy disks or CDs! But it makes me a little sad to say that it feels like a chore to play.\n\nVisually, Avadon exists in a 1995 timewarp: Better looking than the SSI "Gold Box" D&D RPGs, but not as nice as the Baldur's Gate era games from Bioware/Black Isle.\n\nBut Avadon isn't so concerned about appearances. What makes this old-looking game work in 2013 is how fluid the experience is. It looks dated, but it streamlines gameplay, and adds modern features like skill trees, and the ability to scale the game difficulty if you want to move more quickly through the game's difficult bits. And your character speeds around the screen! No more waiting as your party trudges around the map; this game respects your time, as your characters hustle around in loose formation.\n\nBut this fast game pace brings me to the part that I don't like. Avadon is big on prose, like RPGs used to be. Avadon makes up for its stick-figure graphics by providing rich, descriptive storytelling. There's a lot of reading to be done, and no voice acting. So far, so good.\n\nBut in Avadon, your character moves so quickly from encounter to encounter, you find yourself reading constantly. There's no break. It's like reading a book. Frankly, I find myself resenting how much reading this game is asking me to do. And I kept nodding off as I was playing.\n\nBaldur's Gate was probably a 80 hour game. Avadon makes me wonder how much of that time was just trudging around on the screen, revealing the dark parts. Walking from place to place. The pace was slow, but maybe that was an intentional break from all the reading we were asked to do back then. Walk a little, fight a little, walk a little, read a little. In Avadon, it feels like read-run-read-run-read-run. So... much... reading.\n\nI recommend Avadon, because I respect how fine of a job Spiderweb has done to streamline old game mechanics, while still maintaining a flavorful, old-school feeling. And the story's good! But bring your spectacles; you're going to be doing a lot of reading as you play.\n\nOn a related note, I recently purchased a pack of classic Bioware RPGs from GOG.com. I plan to go back and finish the games from that era that I never played -- Baldur's Gate 2, Icewind Dale. I look forward to seeing how I feel about playing these games 15 years later. Will the pacing feel better than Avadon? Stay tuned to find out.","November 12, 2013","true","7.5"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","55","72","0","0"

What the writing lacks in concision it makes up for in quality.  The RPG gameplay is engaging, if not a bit OCD-inducing. My major gripe with the game would be the repetitive ambient sounds used in place of music, but that mostly comes my having previously played other Spiderweb Software games that also recycled these sounds. Still, though, the gameplay and player-influenceable story are more than enough to make the game worth playing on their own.\n\nEdit: after reading some of the other reviews, I should mention that I'm playing on Casual (not ashamed to admit it), so I'm not really experiencing some of the difficulty-related complaints that others are. Pretty much the only difficulty-related thing I'm running into is that I don't really have a chance to use up my consumables fast enough on Casual, so I probably waste more time managing my inventory than I might on a harder difficulty.

I bought it with 75% off, but I wouldn't recommend it. Only Linux users may find some value in this game. Windows users should pay GOG[www.gog.com] a visit and get some really classic RPGs. Why, you will ask. Let me explain:\n\nThe Good\nThe story about the Black Fortress that ensures peace in The Pact by bringing evils foes to justice really appealed to me. There are interesting characters, lots of background information and quickly I found myself playing for hours without even realising how much time went by. Thanks to unique boss fights, combat never gets too repeating. The skill trees are also easy to comprehend. Last but not least, the absence of question marks above NPCs to indicate aviable quests, whose destinations are not marked on the map, made the whole thing a bit more realistic. Just once or twice I wasn't 100% sure what to do, but in the end it became clear.\n\nThe Bad\nSome fights are unbalanced and almost impossible to win. I played on "normal" difficulty, but I still had problems from time to time. You often get the feeling that the AI is cheating; they have so many more action points to spend every round, but your characters only manage to use one or two skills at most. Futhermore, skills that stun or immobilise your characters are in some cases so fatal that you can only watch your party die without being able to do anything. The dialoques with average NPCs never really matter; you can make them angry, so that they abort the conservation, but when you talk to them once more, everything's fine again. Only selected NPCs "listen" to what you have to say. Another major annoyance are the traders, whose inventory never replenishes. Bought all lockpicks? He/ she won't get new ones to sell...While playing you will end up with many locked doors that couldn't be opened. Some of them are even quest-related, which means you are not able to complete certain ones. Equipped items never change the appearence of the characters. So even if you gained the best gear you can possibly get, your party will always look like it just left Avadon for the first time.\n\nProbably, there are even more things that ruin Avadon: The Black Fortress, but these were the ones that bugged me the most. However, it's not a bad game at all. It's just not for everyone and there are much better alternatives out there.","May 11, 2014","false","50.9"," 81 of 118 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","81","118","0","3"

I personally am not a fan of turn based combat, which is the reason I eventually gave up on finishing the game.\n\nVisually and audibly, the game is nothing to write home about, being made by one person it is understanable and they are functional enough not to detract from the game in any major way.\n\nGameplay in my opinion is bland and uninspired, the turn based combat is quite slow and you are often faced with trash mobs that make the game stutter along at a slow pace. Later battles are frustratingly difficult, as you have to spend a long time clicking through the turns before you sometimes realise you haven't a hope of winning and have to reload. I eventually got sick of trying to beat a particular fight and called it quits.\n\nWhere the game shines is in its writing and story, I really enjoyed pouring over the descriptions of locations and the characterisation is pretty good in the people you meet. I find it a shame I couldn't bring myself to finish the game because I would have liked to know what happens.\n\nSo I will recommend this game to people who are into old school turn-based cRPGs, but if slow pacing and turn-based combat make you yawn you might want to check elsewhere.","October 18, 2014","true","24.6"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

If you get stuck, or find it too easy, you can adjust the difficulty in game.  I'm at 40+ hours at the time of writing this and I think I'm (maybe) half way through, so there's plenty of content for your money.

The levelling gets boring and the combat tedious as every enemy uses special abilities every round to increase the difficulty. This is just annoying and slows the game down to a halt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/112100/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Graphically, Avadon is very basic and quite primitive. The sounds also bear this same basic style, with the only music you will hear being from the main menu. All in-game sounds are done adequately though. You will hear your enemies roar and groan, coins, equipment, magic, and all other sounds you may come to expect from a fantasy setting. You should expect to do an immense amount of reading throughout the game. Because of this, the overall gameplay experience seems notably slow paced. While the story and gameplay are rudimentary, Avadon does flow, and there is fun to be had with the turn based combat, item looting, and enhancing the members of your party. Mouse clicking gets severely unresponsive as you play, causing the user to click each action three times or more. This is a major problem. To correct this, all one could do is play the game fresh from a system reboot. Within ten to fifteen minutes after the reboot, the mouse clicking and performance problems will return and stay. Very slowly, the game becomes more interesting and more challenging. The way quests are completed is somewhat awkward. You must go back to the exact place where the quest originated from, and go through the NPC dialog, exclaiming that whatever deed has been done. This would be okay if the map marked where these places are located, or where such NPCs are, but map markings are far from complete. Some quests are so ambiguous, that I found no other way to complete them other than looking at maps made available online. Several of the quests were created in such a way that they nitpick the player into minute details that are very difficult to discern. Avadon seems to drag itself most of the way, mostly because of its slow pace and repetitive game play, but also because of its drab visuals and minimal sounds. Some enemies can be challenging, and interesting to fight against. The variety in creatures is not expansive nor creative, but Avadon manages to keep the encounters enjoyable. The boss battles are difficult, exciting, and fun. The way abilities, spells, and vitality work together is both fair and balanced, providing for an appealing strategy between the usage of weapons and the rest of each character's repertoire. Ultimately, you will become acquainted with your character's powers, and you will eventually appreciate the game's subtle entertainment. The storyline is not very imaginative, nor is it very absorbing. It is conventional in every way imaginable. Also, once you defeat enemies located in a certain area, they will not respawn. Some of the keyboard shortcuts only allow you to activate their respective windows. Pressing the same keyboard shortcut does not deactivate the window. This is minor, but it is still a problem nonetheless. The quests are varied, but feel repetitive in execution. This is mostly because the environs and enemies look very similar from one to the next. Some of your adversaries are so arrogant that you will hate them and enjoy being the reason for their ultimate demise. The most rewarding part of Avadon involves leveling up your characters, equipping the discovered loot, and enhancing their specific abilities. The game often causes serious temporary problems with Windows if you Alt-Tab out of it. Performance issues are borderline ridiculous for a game with such a minimalist design and coarse implementation. In addition, the developer programmed the game to change the speakers' settings in Windows and not return them to the setup it was originally saved to. This is totally unacceptable. The performance problems in conjunction with the other developmental issues is proof of clearly awful programming, or at the very least inadequate porting from the original Mac version. There is basically no creativity whatsoever in Avadon. Every aspect of the game has been done before, for PC and consoles, even in the 80s. After a long while of repetitive, bland, and lackluster gameplay, you will hope for the game to end as soon as possible, but it doesn't. Avadon is clearly 50 hours too long. Much could have been condensed to save players from the tedium. After withstanding the exaggerated amount of hours, the final battle is incredibly frustrating, boring, and poorly implemented. In the end, I decided to quit trying and take a different dialogue path to complete the game. It is that bad. If you would like to read about how poorly designed the final battle is and how much players have complained, peruse the official forums. You won't have anything spoiled, as the ending could have been foreseen from the first half hour of play. This is all quite unfortunate. The finale left me with a feelings of time wasted and disappointment. I understand that the game was designed by one person, but with independent developers often excelling the multi-million Dollar studios, there is no excuse for poor execution anymore.\n\nAvadon: The Black Fortress is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","76.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

I sincerely can't remember when was the last good turn-based RPG released, but the Avadon games are certainly refreshing the genre.\n\nGreat story, lots of interesting dialogue and a lot of great lore are the name of the game with Avadon.\n\nThe story, while underwhelming at first, picks up after you complete your first mission in the lands of the Kva, and the fun doesn't stop until the end, all accompanied with epic, strategic battles that really have you figuring out a puzzle than simply rushing ahead if you play at a nice pace of difficulty. Most of the side missions all add a lot of life to the world and really make you want to play them and forget the main quest...most of the time.\n\nCombat is simplistic at its core. yet very subtle in how it chooses to show its difficulty. You pick from your team two members for each mission to assist, and they all have their unique and very intriguing differences that force you to take your time in choosing them before each mission. You all take turns to move and attack, and all the different patterns for each battle is pretty unique and makes for interesting battles every time you think about reloading!\n\nThe graphics, while simple in nature, are all very well done, and fit well with the overall theme and are nothing to scoff at for any hardcore tbRPG gamer.\n\nI can't recommend it enough for people who miss Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and similar games.","November 12, 2015","true","52.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You choose a character for yourself, and soon enough will start to build a band of like-minded individuals to go out on quests together.\n\nThe gameplay itself is isometric, and very fluid. The graphics, however, are not what makes this game -- it has never been so with Spiderwebsoftware. The real deal here is the plot, the story, the characters, and the (ironic) humour that you keep running to from time to time.\n\nThe skill-system and leveling is also very interesting. Unlike in most games that include classes like warrior, rogue and wizard: the warrior-class isn't left up to just pure hack 'n slash. Every class has their own special skills and abilities that they can use in combat (and a few skills that can be used out of combat, such as picking locks). It is very much a thinking man's game.\n\nThe one critical thing that is left to say is that this game is sometimes very strict in how it handles quest-advancement; it is very much a necessity to read the quest descriptions and not simply run from place to place mindlessly. (Fortunately if you get stuck you can go to Spiderwebsoftware's webpages and look up the official forums, there are a lot of thorough FAQs and helpful people willing to answer your questions.) All in all the game is very inspiring and unique, with every map and town hand-crafted by none other than Jeff Vogel himself.\n\n5/5, a must buy if you're into isometric RPGs, with a compelling storyline and good combat system.","February 18","true","30.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You don't have to mind positioning of your character or the use of consumables much, but both becomes more important the more you progress.

Attacks that did ~80 damage to the previous boss now do at most 14 damage to him. His health bar hasn't moved a single pixel in the last twenty minutes. And the kicker? I've been using the cheat codes every single turn. Pretty much have to, the boss gets 5 actions most turns which he uses to apply conditions to all 3 party members. He keeps magically yanking his own soul out to create golems that make him completely immune to specific types of damage. Have to spend 2-5 turns smashing the golem before being able to touch him and most hits are registering damage in the single digits.

That being said, I'm not writing for upvotes, I just want to make a few things clear; this isn't the type of game/genre I usually like. I played it shortly, didn't personally enjoy it, and thus, can't recommend it. So why am I writing a review on a game that wasn't made for my tastes? Because I played it, and I'm recording my thoughts.\n\nIts audience is likely a niche one, fans of the old-school isometric RPGs of the 90s will feel relatively at home with good graphics, some modern gameplay mechanics, but that's about as far as it goes for me personally. No music, clunky, jerky movement and animation(if any at all). Walls of text constantly pop up in my face, which I wouldn't normally mind except none of it was interesting; the characters, the setting... and the controls just make me feel limited. The premise seemed alright, a fortress feared by all destined to put a stop to a warring world, but lack of customization or character depth led me to find nothing about the game worth being drawn into.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself seems solid, and definitely nails that oldschool RPG, and I give it credit for (i believe) one guy doing it all, Avadon just hit no buttons for me with its lack of atmosphere, characters, story or art.","January 8, 2014","false","0.4"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","26","53","0","4"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 13\nAvadon: The Black Fortress\nPurchase Date: 1/11/2013\n\nI'm always reminded of the old Ultima games whenever I play a Spiderweb game. In a sense, you could call the graphics retro, but not in the pixel art style that you see a number of new games using.  Rather, everything is drawn as a 2D set of tiles, but in an isometric view to give a sense of depth.  The style will feel very familiar to anyone who has played games like Ultima, or the original Fallout.\n\nAlthough the graphics could be called simple, the presentation in Avadon offers a lot of depth.  Rooms contain a lot of small details; pictures hang on the walls, fire-pits burn with animations of smoke rising above, characters wear different styles of clothing.  There's enough repetition to see the game is tile-based, but nothing feels cookie-cutter about the presentation.  Not everything can be interacted with, but Avadon helpfully highlights things of interest when mousing over them.\n\nAs I start a new game, I get to pick from a set of 4 characters, with each character being a different class.  These classes roughly correspond to the Fighter, Thief, Wizard, and Priest archetypes that I see in most games.  I selected the "Shadowwalker" class which is the one most like a thief.  I wasn't able to customize my character at all, except for changing the default name.  After selecting a character, the game asks what difficulty to start with, but this can be changed later in the game.  I decided to go with casual to start with.\n\nWith my initial selections out of the game, I am presented with the exposition dump explaining my background and current situation.  Whereas newer games would introduce this in the form of cutscenes, Avadon uses a series of static images with text.  If reading a lot of text sounds like a turn off, then I would definitely recommend staying away from this game.  Avadon is a role playing game inspired from a simpler era where not everything was voice acted.  Avadon's story is meant to be read, not heard.\n\nAvadon: The Black Fortress is so named as it is the starting point of the game, where my character is being sent to serve.  After the introduction, I start out in the courtyard, where the game's tutorial of sorts kicks in.  It's not really a formal tutorial, but rather a series of hints displayed at the bottom of the screen.  These hints clarify things like how to move around and interact with people.\n\nThe game also provides a mini-map which sits in the top right corner of the screen.  Clicking the Tab key will provide a larger view of the map.  One word of warning, the game will display various modal dialogs, and the map itself is in a little window.  One might expect to be able to move these around, but everything in the UI is static.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen are a series of icons for performing actions.  The icons on the left are a set of static actions and menu items, while the icons on the right act as hotkeys for slotting spells and items.\n\nSoon I am interacting with my first NPC.  Conversations are fairly basic, with a block of text followed by a set of response options.  I get the sense that the conversations aren't very dynamic.  While I had a choice in responses, I suspect other than a slightly different block of text in return, the same thing would happen regardless.  It's highly possible though later in the game the conversations become more dynamic.\n\nThe game doesn't waste any time getting into the first combat.  Given the presentation in the game, it's no surprise that the combat is turn based, with characters moving around on a grid.  Combat works much like one would expect, with options for a basic attack, using an item, or if playing a spellcaster, the ability to cast spells.  It's all pretty basic and easy to pick up.\n\nThis brings me to what I appreciate the most about Avadon.  While Avadon wants to emulate the kind of role playing game that came from the 1980s, it manages to do so while remaining completely accessible.  I've gone back and played some older games that have not aged well, not because of simple graphics, but rather the severe level of difficulty and usability issues.  Avadon provides that bit of nostalgia, while remaining a fun game.\n\nAvadon isn't a game for everyone, but I definitely appreciate that games like this still get made.  This definitely gets my recommendation.","June 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

More than exceptional writing, scripted events, lots of tense battle situations, and plenty of loot. You need to get past the initial part of the game to get to the good stuff, maybe an hour or so of getting your quests and companions, and then you are right in the middle of your first dungeon.\n\nI'm enjoying the story and the battle system. The battle system is grid-based, with a certain amount of action points to spend. The trick is learning how to exploit the grid and fight above your level when you get caught in a quest at the wrong time.

Crispy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974281429/","246 products in account","I was skeptical at first, but this is a really neat throwback.  The isometric graphic style reminds me of Ultima Online, but they're way crisper and look really clean.  The game runs smooth.\n\nWhile the combat is turn-based, you're only stuck in those turns while in combat.  This means that you can wander around exploring and looting in real time but once you close to an enemy's proximity you switch to combat mode.  Even in combat it doesn't get overly complicated, which can be a tad disappointing, but it also allows the combat to be much faster paced than what you'd find in other turn-based combat games.\n\nThe storyline is engaging and interesting, and there have been many instances of dialogue that break the mold on RPGs only hours into the game.  No spoilers, but one example I could offer was talking to the warden of a prison and hearing him explain that treating the prisoners humanely and never torturing them was his policy.  There isn't a lot of cookie-cutter copy/paste generic archetype character development in this game, which is extremely refreshing.  I don't know how many RPGs I've started as a kid in a village that leaves to go fishing only to come back and find said village burned down, parents dead, princess / girl next door kidnapped, crystal stolen, etc.  This game makes an attempt to stray away from all of that when it can.  Even the flavor text seen when inspecting NPCs has had a good deal of thought put into it.  Another thing that's truly great is upon entering a new area you'll randomly get a written description akin to the old text-based games that helps flesh things out.\n\nI've read that this game is long, and I'm talking Ultima 7 long, which is daunting, even off-putting, but in some ways it's refreshing.  These guys seem to have put their time in and this game feels like it would be right at home on the shelf next to any title in the Ultima series.  Even your NPC buddies that group up with you will randomly stop you to talk about things on their mind, so they don't feel like lifeless dolls filling a job requirement.\n\nIf I had one gripe, (I'm only allowing myself one because I'm still really early into the game) it would be that the characters don't change outfits when equipping new gear.  From a resource standpoint it makes sense... in a way.  You can have thousands of items and only a few outfit "classes" of graphics per each character, which makes sense for games like this made in 3D, but to have absolutely no changes at all in an isometric 2D game is a little disheartening.  Because of this you tend to overlook the icons of the new gear and find yourself only reading the stats, something I hate in an RPG.  I don't like items that boil down to numbers, plain and simple.\n\nOverall it's a great buy and a rare find in this day and age where the majority of RPGs concentrate on action and graphics while letting the story slide.  Seeing this game's Steam page initially made me cringe and recoil from the connotation of similarities to all the generic crappy RPG Maker games out there, so I wasn't expecting much, but honestly the more I play this game the more I'm blown away by it.  These devs show that going retro doesn't mean the story goes retro with it.  This isn't some 14 year old kid's weekend project made as a free Android app.\n\nCheers.","March 11, 2014","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974281429/recommended/112100/","76561197974281429","W. Crispy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974281429/","246 products in account","I was skeptical at first, but this is a really neat throwback.  The isometric graphic style reminds me of Ultima Online, but they're way crisper and look really clean.  The game runs smooth.\n\nWhile the combat is turn-based, you're only stuck in those turns while in combat.  This means that you can wander around exploring and looting in real time but once you close to an enemy's proximity you switch to combat mode.  Even in combat it doesn't get overly complicated, which can be a tad disappointing, but it also allows the combat to be much faster paced than what you'd find in other turn-based combat games.\n\nThe storyline is engaging and interesting, and there have been many instances of dialogue that break the mold on RPGs only hours into the game.  No spoilers, but one example I could offer was talking to the warden of a prison and hearing him explain that treating the prisoners humanely and never torturing them was his policy.  There isn't a lot of cookie-cutter copy/paste generic archetype character development in this game, which is extremely refreshing.  I don't know how many RPGs I've started as a kid in a village that leaves to go fishing only to come back and find said village burned down, parents dead, princess / girl next door kidnapped, crystal stolen, etc.  This game makes an attempt to stray away from all of that when it can.  Even the flavor text seen when inspecting NPCs has had a good deal of thought put into it.  Another thing that's truly great is upon entering a new area you'll randomly get a written description akin to the old text-based games that helps flesh things out.\n\nI've read that this game is long, and I'm talking Ultima 7 long, which is daunting, even off-putting, but in some ways it's refreshing.  These guys seem to have put their time in and this game feels like it would be right at home on the shelf next to any title in the Ultima series.  Even your NPC buddies that group up with you will randomly stop you to talk about things on their mind, so they don't feel like lifeless dolls filling a job requirement.\n\nIf I had one gripe, (I'm only allowing myself one because I'm still really early into the game) it would be that the characters don't change outfits when equipping new gear.  From a resource standpoint it makes sense... in a way.  You can have thousands of items and only a few outfit "classes" of graphics per each character, which makes sense for games like this made in 3D, but to have absolutely no changes at all in an isometric 2D game is a little disheartening.  Because of this you tend to overlook the icons of the new gear and find yourself only reading the stats, something I hate in an RPG.  I don't like items that boil down to numbers, plain and simple.\n\nOverall it's a great buy and a rare find in this day and age where the majority of RPGs concentrate on action and graphics while letting the story slide.  Seeing this game's Steam page initially made me cringe and recoil from the connotation of similarities to all the generic crappy RPG Maker games out there, so I wasn't expecting much, but honestly the more I play this game the more I'm blown away by it.  These devs show that going retro doesn't mean the story goes retro with it.  This isn't some 14 year old kid's weekend project made as a free Android app.\n\nCheers.","March 11, 2014","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

More than exceptional writing, scripted events, lots of tense battle situations, and plenty of loot. You need to get past the initial part of the game to get to the good stuff, maybe an hour or so of getting your quests and companions, and then you are right in the middle of your first dungeon.\n\nI'm enjoying the story and the battle system. The battle system is grid-based, with a certain amount of action points to spend. The trick is learning how to exploit the grid and fight above your level when you get caught in a quest at the wrong time.

The graphics are a little rough around the edges, but they have a unique charm. The story and choices that you make which have a lasting impact on the story branches available to you is really good. Characterization is not quite as good as, say, Planescape, or DAO, but still pretty good, you do get a feel for your companions and their unique personalities. I am probably only about 10 or 12 hours into this game but I've played it on a few different platforms at the same time, and I can verify that what class you choose and the companions you choose to take along with you can dramatically change the game play and even the story to some extent (choices available to you). I like the skill tree, it makes it so that even if you decide to be a shaman and also take the NPC shaman with you, you won't be carbon copies, you can be two distinctly different types of characters with their own role in the party dynamics. While I have not beat this, I've gotten far enough to easily recommend this to anyone. Besides, there is a free demo if you want to spend an hour or so to see if it is your bag.\n","February 10, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Since it's an indie game, it has no problem ignoring the first group while catering to the later. It's an homage to the old "gold box" style from SSI in the 80s so there's nothing exactly innovative, but there really isn't supposed to be. Spiderweb Software unabashedly makes the same game over and over - Avadon, Avernum, Blades of Exile (Realms), Geneforge, Nethergate - focusing on the narrative instead of the system...so really, it's akin to what SSI did with all their Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk properties. Anyone who plays D&D will enjoy the long text boxes, the inventory management, the grid based battle rounds with the same "token" characters (literally) used over and over.

In order to complete some quests and parts of the story I did have to use a general game over view guide and codes easly found on the internet.

Compared with Avernum, you will have a party made of your own character as well as predesigned characters with their own background (so this is a bit more like Baldur's Gate games, while Avernum is more akin to Icewind Dale).\n\nSinnce storytelling is what I look for in a game, I'd definitely recommend Avadon to diehard CRPGs fans.","January 3, 2015","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Things that look like they should block your shot don't .   This is the worse tactical rpg I ever played.\nThe spell/power system is just bad. In most battles you get to use a skill once. Mind you I didn't finish the game after 118 hours so maybe you can use abilites more than once after you hit 119 hours.  Note I know the game is only 45 hours or so.  My play style might have made my characters way overpowered. Still combat was rather boring.\nThere wasn't enough RPG in the game. There were a bunch of times the dialog options were lacking or just didn't matter.  There is no point to having multiple choice questions if 90% of the time the choice doesn't matter.\nThe loot system is very bad. Early on I got some good gear.  I used the same gear for about 95 hours because I never find better stuff.   Most of the loot I find is just junk\nThe interface is functional but bad. I can't pick something up without it going into my bag. This is a problem when I wanted to put it in my quick slot. I should be able to grab it from the ground and drag it to where I want.\n\nI'm done with this sieres but I might play some other spiderweb games.  Like I said I liked Exile.

Make extensive use of consumables on higher settings.","December 1, 2013","true","118.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it really really could, if it had been polished more.\n\nThe combat system is technically balanced and reasonable, but comes across as slow and plodding.  You have to sit through the entirety of every attack animation followed by a brief pause, for every action any character takes, before it will load the interface for the next character's turn -- which isn't so bad, the first hundred times you see the basic attack animation.  Combat also activates too soon, a lot of the time-- it can take several turns of walking before anyone is in range; and that walking may take you far out of your intended travel path...and into line of sight of more enemies, that can repeat the process.  It can also be difficult to tell at a glance whose turn it is, until you figure out what to look for, and sometimes the hitboxes of tightly grouped combatants overlap a bit (making it hard to select the right one).  Previous games also had a significantly more varied spell list -- the list has been easily halved, although the list of abilities for mundane combat characters has grown noticeably.  In short, there is nothing cripplingly wrong with the combat in this game, and it CAN be interesting and fun (particularly against named unique enemies) -- but it could have been so much better, so easily.\n\nThe game's story centers around being a new member of the secret police for a dubiously moral authoritarian medieval city-state, which keeps the peace for an alliance of five nations.  Which is excellent and unique.  All the characters are interesting, dialogue is interesting, and I will play this thing through to the end to see how it goes (..and then again with a ninja or sorceress; so I will have enough lockpicks to get through all the locked doors this time).  Unfortunately, that good dialogue and the interestingly-designed quests that go with it happen to be implemented as poorly as the combat system.  In one case, the only way to destroy a piece of evidence is to go talk to the local captain of the guards about it (and not the spymaster for your kingdom; only the local guardsman will do), and after bringing it up, choose "Never mind. [destroy evidence]".  How are you supposed to find that option, unless you've already decided to turn the evidence in instead?\n\nThe quests in this game are far, far too easy to break; and I find myself enjoying the story not because of their craftsmanship in game design...but in spite of it.  Even with that caveat, I can't deny that I AM largely enjoying it, and particularly the fact that even though they force too many situations to boil down to simple binary choices, it's often not "right" vs. "wrong".  It might be tradition vs. cultural innovation, freedom vs. security (vs. duty), or even just choosing whether or not to accept someone's offer to surrender/ flee.  ..I'm finding that a lot of my choices get overruled though, with circumstance forcing everyone into how the narrative WOULD have gone if I'd chosen the other way.  I'm not sure if this is a magician's choice scenario, or just bad luck on my part.  In any case...\n\nIf you want to play the secret police of a medieval magical mind-break-the-prisoners authoritarian citystate, with free reign to just do whatever you want to anyone you want, a reasonably complex and realistic political climate, and turn-based combat that is fine but slowish, give Avadon a try.  ...but expect to experience the story as they laid it out (with occasional breaks for mass-effect style Paragon/Renegage options), rather than actually control your path.","December 13, 2013","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have finished it before.\n\nAvadon is an old school RPG, which means two things to keep in mind: 1. the combat is based on strategy, and 2. there's a lot of writing -- the game even describes the scenes you find, to make up for the lacking graphics. I'll elaborate on both of those.\n\nThe combat. It's turn based, so there's no rush. Take your time, think about your next move if you need to, and be efficient: no going forward to meet an enemy that's coming at you anyway, use that move to attack with your ranged weapon. The enemies are limited, so you won't be able to grind for levels. That said, the levelling system is quite a bit easier than older games of this developer -- there are four very defined classes, and you'll be able to choose your next abilities without too much time spent studying the possibilities and planning, making for a somewhat less stressful experience, in my opinion. Something to keep in mind: bonuses to probabilities make quite a difference.\n\nAs for the story: that's the focus of the game. You aren't here exclusively to combat enemies or plan the perfect warrior or finish the quest, you're here to read about a world and its characters. If you don't like to read much while you're playing, this isn't a good game for you. The story isn't action-based, either. It's a politically driven story, and your quests involve not saving the world, but keeping an empire stable and functioning. Of course, shades of grey and moral relativity abound. It's also an opportunity to get to know the characters in your party. They are well written and quite fascinating as a whole, representing distinct cultures of the fractured empire.\n\nIf you're just dipping your feet into this genre, and the story sounds interesting, this is a good game to start and see if you enjoy. If you do like this genre, this is a great story and the strategy is challenging enough. Also to keep in mind is that the whole game was written and coded by a single person, which is quite impressive indeed.","January 1, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As always, the graphics aren't a stellar explosion of high-res textures and models, and the gameplay is nothing revolutionary, but that's not why you play a Spiderweb game.\n\nHere's why you DO play a Spiderweb game, and this one in particular: thought-provoking story. You are a newly minted Hand of Avadon, sort of a fantasy-RPG FBI agent, who shows up at the eponymous Black Fortress immediately after the first- and only- successful attack on the institution itself. As the story progresses, you have to navigate a story that pokes at the idea of absolute power, government surveillance, bureaucratic corruption, diplomacy, and the Big Question: "How much security do you give up in the pursuit of safety?"\n\nAlso, you hit things with your sword. I guess.\n\n10/10.","May 23, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess you can say it opened the floodgates for a whole other realm of RPG gaming (hours have been lost, with even more still to vanish; time well spent!) at the time I was still being a great fan of RPGs all around (got heaps of them, even more now!!!), I picked up Avadon with caution, knowing that for it's price it wouldn't be a graphic breaking game.\nI'd never even played a Spiderweb Software game either, for that matter, and it was an interesting experience.\n\nThe first thing I was surprised about was the epic soundtrack at the start. Unfortunately, this epic piece is the only real piece of sound in the game, plus some old audio files of swords swinging and animals growling, etc.\nThe first mission sets off the story well, and so far, having not completed it yet, it is a good story.\n\nThe graphics, as stated earlier, are nothing to go around shouting about. But they get the job done, and the writing is excellent, and though perhaps slightly less words are needed to state what exactly is going on, it feels mostly spot on. Even the side missions are fleshed out. They aren't (from my experience) about going around *kill X giant dingbats* and return to quest giver. The people have real problems.\nUnfortunately, with said problems, come in game problems. The journal system is very poor, and records barely anything except the beginning and end of a quest. This becomes infuriating as many people ask you for help, and you jot down things in your journal, and eventually you become lost as what to do next, when you are part-way through one quest and stop to do another close by.\nThe combat is fine, with just the right amount of weaker foes spread between harder fights and opponents. It's a turn based, grid battle, but the grids need to be larger, as I clicked on the wrong thing, meaning a character fell in battle.\nAll in all, this game is recommended. If you are undecided, try out the demo. If you are a fan of RPGs, I am telling you now, this is a great game.","March 11, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't anything new or amazing or complex, but it works. It's turn based, but you your attacks don't miss 3 out of 5 attacks. And you don't see hit chance, so you don't see your 97% hit chance attack to fail. The tempo is nice, it's not too slow. There are only few archetypes of enemies but each and every one of them has a lot of more advanced versions, which is quite nice. There is a nice number of skills and consumables you can use in fight. Using skills depletes your vitality. You have nice pool of it for a mission, but the with the rising number of hard fights, your vitality pool will go down. Your vitality refreshes once you get back from a mission, or you can use consumables. I didn't use them so far, because I like the tension. Is like being in a dungeon in BG, half dead, in desperate need of sleep but there is no place for that. This approach leaves out the boring sleeping part but keep some sort of tension.\n\nThe item progression in the first 15 hours or so was great, new better items every few minutes. I was waiting for my character to level up so I could use them and I really liked the waiting. And thinking about which one to choose (you can equip only armor with certain weight, it's strength dependent). But after that it slowly crawls to stop.\n\nThe character progression is really basic. You have four attributes and few active and passive skills. The number of skills isn't a problem, but the prerequisites are a bad idea in my opinion.\n\nAs far as role playing goes, it leaves a lot to be desired. There aren't many opportunities to form your characters, to make choices. And I've read that the story is good but I don't see how. You are in your base, you'll receive a quest to go somewhere. You are out there for few hours and get back. You'll read few phrases which will "advance" the story and then you are out in the field for few more hours. I find it too divided and without any flow.\n\nIt's certainly a nice game. The 30 hours I've spent in it so far were enjoyable. But it started to be boring and I'm not sure I'll go back to it.\n\nI can recommend it. It's certainly a better game than most out there.","April 12","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your vitality refreshes once you get back from a mission, or you can use consumables. I didn't use them so far, because I like the tension. Is like being in a dungeon in BG, half dead, in desperate need of sleep but there is no place for that. This approach leaves out the boring sleeping part but keep some sort of tension.\n\nThe item progression in the first 15 hours or so was great, new better items every few minutes. I was waiting for my character to level up so I could use them and I really liked the waiting. And thinking about which one to choose (you can equip only armor with certain weight, it's strength dependent). But after that it slowly crawls to stop.\n\nThe character progression is really basic. You have four attributes and few active and passive skills. The number of skills isn't a problem, but the prerequisites are a bad idea in my opinion.\n\nAs far as role playing goes, it leaves a lot to be desired. There aren't many opportunities to form your characters, to make choices. And I've read that the story is good but I don't see how. You are in your base, you'll receive a quest to go somewhere. You are out there for few hours and get back. You'll read few phrases which will "advance" the story and then you are out in the field for few more hours. I find it too divided and without any flow.\n\nIt's certainly a nice game. The 30 hours I've spent in it so far were enjoyable. But it started to be boring and I'm not sure I'll go back to it.\n\nI can recommend it. It's certainly a better game than most out there.","April 12","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story goes on for quite a while. So much so that I have never actually beaten the game. But seems to be many possibilities to explore.\n\nThe art may be more simple than other RPGs out there but it works well. The interface look-and-feel could use some work though.\n\nI had fun, even though I never finished the whole game. I doubt I even made it half way through. So if you enjoy a game with a long story and lots of areas to explore, I believe this could work for you.","May 13","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of this felt fairly flat to me, which I'll cover a bit more in the later portions.\n\nMy 3 Hours with the Game: I began the game by choosing a name and class for my character. I went with Orrin Hatch for a name, and chose a class that I figured was basically a ninja/thief archetype. I was then treated to some basic info about the setting, and sent to a castle to begin my duties. Below is a screenshot showing my character, the inventory, and the approach to said Castle.\n\nUpon arriving in the castle, I was blown away by the ability to just wander around, pick up random junk, and engage in brief conversations with people throughout the sprawling grounds. Before long, I was assigned a sort of tutorial dungeon crawl, which entailed going into the castle dungeons, and looking for dangerous escaped prisoners. There, I got to see the way the systems of the game come together for combat, etc.\n\nThis is an isometic, top down dungeon with tons of stuff. It was fairly fun up to a point, but I found it to break down into mindless backtracking, and easy to forget objectives. The dungeons sprawl a good deal, which is fun from an exploration standpoint, but gets to be a bit tiresome due to the map feature, which merely brings up an overlay. Additionally I found that there was a lot that just didn't land, including dialogue, and inventory management stuff. It took me until hour 2 or so to realize that stuff would fall on the ground, and the method for picking it up is opening the inventory and grabbing stuff from the ground. I'm used to other games, and was too lazy to actually read the manual, so this is on me. Additionally, I found that with dialogue, the writers often seemed to want to tell me things instead of showing me things with the writing.\n\nCombat was fairly fun, and felt like taking battles from 3.0/3.5 era D&D, grid and all. Early on, the battles seemed fairly flat and a bit too easy, but as the game progressed a bit, I found a decent variety of monster abilities and tactics that kept stuff interesting. All in all though, I think the combat from other games may have spolied me a bit too much. I kept wanting this to feel as dangerous as Darkest Dungeon or Wasteland 2, but only in one of the many battles I fought did I feel any sense of doom.\n\nMy highlight:I had the most fun with the game once I made my way out of the castle and it's immediate surroundings and took a portal to Kva, a desert region. There, I had the mission of chatting up a dragon, and dealing with it's goblin/whatever ugly intelligent being problem. There, I felt like I was starting to get a sense of the fairly interesting political situation of the game, and the way a world like this might actually work. Also, as an old Baldur's Gate fan, I definitely enjoyed the sort of adventuring that just comes from wandering around while you have actual missions to complete, stealing stuff, etc. Plus, I got to do some super-tropey D&D style stuff, like killing rats/goblins, and talking to a fairly tiny dragon who lives in a magma chamber.\n\nThe exploration was fun, and made it clear to me that there's a lot more to this game and story. If it hadn't been for that section, I probably would not be recommending it. But now I can see the potential.\n\n\n\nMy verdict: I don't love this game due to some of the presentation issues and the flat feel, but I could see getting sucked in. I'd give it a qualified recommendation for folks who were very into BG, Fallout 1/2, etc., with the caveat that character creation is far simpler, and there is less of a sense of danger, at least in the portions that I tried. Another plus for this game is that I can imagine it would probably run really well on an older machine, or a laptop without a ton of resources.\n-Jon\n\nPS: I won't be reviewing Avadon 2:The Corruption at this time, for fear of spoilers. As a result, the next game on my docket is Betrayer.","April 17","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't anything new or amazing or complex, but it works. It's turn based, but you your attacks don't miss 3 out of 5 attacks. And you don't see hit chance, so you don't see your 97% hit chance attack to fail. The tempo is nice, it's not too slow. There are only few archetypes of enemies but each and every one of them has a lot of more advanced versions, which is quite nice. There is a nice number of skills and consumables you can use in fight. Using skills depletes your vitality.
