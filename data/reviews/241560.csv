The Crew... I honestly was dying to get this game, and I dropped the $85 for the gold edition. I figured since I loved racing games to death that this would be the perfect fit for me. But boy was I wrong. I do have a lot of fun on it but beware, the car physics are horrible and the map is sub-par at best. You get this hype from looking at the game that it's going to be awesome with a gigantic map and tons of cities to drive through but then you get in and BAM, there's only 2 cities that are slightly like 10% close to the historic scale of it, and those two are LA and New York. The problems with those are they take up 1/4 of each region they're in. West Coast: 75% nothing, 25% LA. East Coast: roughly 40% New York and 60% Hills and forests. The handling in the game is sub-par too, which I kinda braced for knowing it was on a havok engine. But when you really get into it it's one of the single most disappointing things in the game. Most of the cars either handle like you're steering them with your feet or handle like you crank the wheel over on each turn even if you're trying to only follow slight contours in the road.\n\n+The cars are nice\n+The map is still nice despite the major lack of any cities between New York and LA\n+Bonneville Salt Flats is acutally made to a barely historic scale (only for the speed area)\n+Street cars handle pretty well\n+Circuit cars are hilarious\n+Circuit Silverado\n+HUMMER\n\n-Miserable offroad physics because of the vehicle flipping limitations, Raid car physics leave a lot to be desired\n-crash cutscenes are the most annoying things ever and tend to take ~15 seconds to go away\n-Missions are subpar at best\n-Campaign is linear and not even racing\n-some of the fastest cars in the game are some of the slowest performance cars (Koeniggsegg Agera R: 279 mph fullstock (amazing buff), and 219mph level 1299 perf tune. Real/recorded top speed: Nowhere near any of these at 263mph)\n-Between LA and New York the cities are horrible and very half ♥♥♥♥♥, 90% of the giant cities that rival LA are just represented as small towns (Dallas, Washington DC, etc...)\n-A lot of major cities aren't even represented in the game (Houston, Phoenix, Glendale, Palm Springs [I know it's in the game but that's like one house, palm springs is a pretty nice place], Denver, etc..)\n-The game feels like minimal effort was put into it.\n--Crashes every 1-3 hours, usually during something important like the end mission or a skill\n--Graphics depend too heavily on shaders and shadowing, not real effort and modelling skills.\n-Cops are kinda annoying but really not bad any more, updates changed the police and made them hilarious golf balls for Hummers.\n-Tuning the H1 to Raid spec is horrible because it tunes it like a gas engine. The Duramax LLY diesel tuned to 600hp on a would NOT have only 700lb/ft of torque, it would EASILY be in the 4 digits (around 1,150ft/lb) for torque and it would be unstoppable. Work on diesel engines, then it gets my vote (granted it's an extremely small gripe because I still love the H1 to death ingame)\n-Mapping is horrible, around Black Mount there are patches of trees floating 5 feet off the ground and trees growing in the middle of the train tracks that the train just drives through, and in New York the storm gutters in the tunnels underground have no collision meshes and your wheels get stuck underground if you hit that area.\n\nMy personal thoughts on this is they should put it as an early access game, not a full release game. This release is just.. For lack of better word, it's just not good, it's an incomplete game marketed as a full game.\nIf they announce they have no plans to do any major revamps I would never recommend this to any of my friends. All in all, The Crew pretty much turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be, and that is just another overhyped game that isn't worth the money, destroyed by Ubisoft forcing the game developer to cut a lot of corners and release a broken game\n\nEDIT: My view of the game went up a lot with the addition of the Mini with a circuit tune and a Ford Focus with a Raid tune (the 2 funniest cars in the game now) There were plenty of updates after that but I have neglected to mention them, but it's still not worth paying the full price for, anyone interested should get it while it's on sale.\n\nAnother edit: They fixed a lot of the AI issues, the races are extremely easy to win now if you play your cards right. The cops are like golf balls for Hummer golfing.\n\nStill not worth the price tag, though.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nThe game is getting better but it still leaves much to be desired.\n\nEDIT: 1/27/2016 Also since Wild Run released the game WILL NOT run AT ALL for some reason.","January 3, 2015","false","184.4"," 1,401 of 1,605 people (87%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","87","401","1","138","49"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromfell/recommended/241560/","chromfell","Chromfell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromfell/","153 products in account","Over time and what not, Ivory Tower corrected some of the issues. Corrections are written in italic after each section. Enjoy reading!\n\nAfter more than 70 hours of playing this, this is what I observed:\n\n"RACING-MMO"? Announced as an Massively-Online-Multiplayer-Game, a single Session only holds 8 Players. ALSO: Uses NAT-Connection system. A player who is not in your region won't necessarily be able to join your session. The Crew (Steam Worldwide)? Yeah, sure.\n(April 2015: They improved matchmaking, merged PvP-Lobbies and improved game hosting, it's basically faster now. No other sewere issues were changed online-wise.)\n\nCARS: This game holds a breathtaking amount of 27 cars + DLC cars. And they are not even available in every spec. Test Drive Unlimited 2 had 130, for comparison. They also handle next to nothing realistic. Muscle cars have better grip than a BMW. RWD, FWD or AWD? No difference either.\n(March 2015: Handling SEVERLY improved, more and more specs got/get added every month. April 2015: More specs added, Raid DLC pack added.)\n\nENVIRONMENT: Pretty neat. Animals. People. Cannot be touched but still a nice additon (That's Ubisoft Reflections for you there --> Driver:SF). The Map is huge and even after 40 hours of normal play time you wont even have it explored half-way. Environment is a huge plus here. Very good. 7.8/10 because there's too much undetailed water.\n(March 2015: Water updated, better reflections, realistic depth effects and more natural colours.) Yes, I am seriously criticizing water. It looked horrible back then, believe me.\n\nTUNING: Well, yes. Better than Rivals. Not as good as Underground 2. It's not bad compared to other recent racing games and you can tune your car just enough to be "individual". Severe Lack of stickers.\n(March 2015: This game is OVERFLOWING with a giant variation of stickers!)\n\nAI AND POLICE: THE RUBBERBANDING IS REAL. Ivory Tower SERIOUSLY managed to make a rubberbanding system 1299 times WORSE than EA. It doesn't matter if it's a Crown Vic, F-150 or Corvette. Cop cars have astonishing speeds of up to 250mph (400kmh), weigh about 30 metric tons and can seemingly drive through traffic, other cop cars, YOU if they want to, and can make objects in their way such as fences merely DISINTEGRATE. Also, if you're too far away, they just fly to you. Really neat. It's impossible to outrun a bunch of Lexus Sedans with a high-end Ford GT. The cops either keep up with you for 20 minutes straight or magically stop chasing you after 10 seconds. Sometimes they jump. Sometimes they fall through the ground. But most importantly, a CROWN VICTORIA can just BRAKE and STOP in front of a HUMMER H1 WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY STOPPING THE 4 TONS HUMMER H1 IN UNDER A SECOND. Oh, and the cops bust you in like 3 seconds. Also: If you're under 30mph, you've got next to no chance of escaping the cops.\n(March 2015: weight-Issue corrected! Police cars weigh about 1.5 tons as they should and you are able to escape them too, pursuits are A LOT more fun now. 3-second-bust not changed. Disintegration and teleporting still exists too.)\n\nIN-GAME-MONEY: Not enough. There's just not enough. Everything is overpriced, the game is almost dragging you towards its microtransactions. 40000 Crew Credits for 6$. You're not even able to buy a car with these 6$. 40000 is nothing. You can buy 4 good vinyls with that. Stickers.\nALMOST. THEY ALMOST HAD IT. IT WAS OKAY FOR LIKE A MONTH AND NOW THEY CUT THE FACTION REWARDS BY FRIENDS IN HALF. RIDICULOUS.\nApril 2015: YOU GET EVEN LESS NOW! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!\n\nCONNECTIVITY: As I mentioned before, terrible. NAT-based. Lag Simulator 2014. There's a pretty high chance you can not play with anyone outside of your region, depending on your NAT-type.\n\nSERVERS: Ubisoft\n\nGRAPHICS: Pretty good...? Textures not too great, and I'm not talking about the world. Your characters jacket looks like it's from Just Cause 2. No mirror reflections in first person mode. Alternate graphics in first person mode, increasing SSAO. Might cause frame drop on older graphics cards. Framerate absolutely awful compared to other games. Distant textures --> Assassins Creed: Unity. Texture filtering? Not really.\n\nThis game is still unfinished.\n\nIGNs 6/10 is completely justified.\nPolygons 4.5/10 is still justified.\nMy rating below based on my listed points in this review:\n\nMMO-Aspects: 4/10\nCars: 6/10\nEnvironment: 9/10\nTuning: 6/10\nAI and Police: 2/10\nOnline Features: 3/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nOverall: 5.1/10  (This was the initial release score I gave The Crew)\n6.2/10 (Early March 2015)\n5.4/10 (Early April 2015)\n\nAs you can see, the score didn't really improve much over time.\n\nThis game is in the Top 3 Worst Releases Of 2014 in my opinion.\nThey are all Ubisoft. How depressing.\n\nAnd yes, I'm kind of still playing it after writing this (negative) review. They continue to add more content (that should've been here by release but whatever) so that kinda keeps it going. Will edit each month or so.\n\nI LIED. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS ANYMORE.","December 14, 2014","false","86.6"," 748 of 875 people (85%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","85","748","875","20","27"

Instead they took the cheap way out and its more frustrating than fun. It is not an MMO. They intend to  fix the problems but this is just another game that follows the disturbing trend of releasing unfinished games for full price then slowly fixing it to be what it should have been. I wish i could get a refund and spend the money once I  see a REAL COMPLETE game but i guess i just have to hope they actually do what I paid for.\n\nEDIT: Please remember the history of the game that when i wrote this review it was a buggy mess, there have been updates and changes to it but I for one am finished with this game for now.","January 6, 2015","false","125.5"," 539 of 658 people (82%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","82","539","658","32","7"

It's almost like it wasn't even meant to be a driving game. Next, The Crew also has a story - though at times it's ridiculous and worse than Tommy Wiseau's The Room. And throughout that story, you're going to notice one little fact:\n\nThe Crew is not a racing game.\n\nIt's a game about driving from spot A to spot B under time pressure, or escaping the police, or winning a race to settle things down with your evil leader enemy rival who just wanted to kill you, but then thought it'd be better to just try to race together.\n\nYou're just going to repeat the same missions over and over again, with the game giving you different reasons to do so each time. For example, why don't you go crash into 80 randomly sitting boxes because you want to ruin some evil guys' delivery plans? But then, half an hour later, you could also crash into 80 randomly sitting boxes again because one of them is guaranteed to contain evidence you need to stop some evil guys' plans.\n\nBut when the time comes and you get a mission where you have to race your opponents, now that's the time to realize that it truly has nothing to do with racing. No matter how good you are, the other cars are always going to stick to your back. You can be awesome for the entire race, but they're always going to be right behind you. Then you make one little mistake (or a school bus spawns right in front of you) near the end and your race is ruined.\n\nAs a little bonus, The Crew also features microtransactions.\n\nDon't get me wrong - it has the potential to be fun if you're just looking to drive around with your mates and don't care about how the car feels. But the game honestly sucks for everything else apart from that.","December 23, 2014","false","30.2"," 961 of 1,211 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","961","1","23","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawrlex/recommended/241560/","rawrlex","Rawrlex ♥ Meowlex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawrlex/","3522 products in account","Well, that was The Crew...\nAfter about 42 Hours ive seen the most things, beat the Campain and most of the Challenges.\n\nI bought "The Crew" with Hope for a Game that would be as entertaining as "Test Drive Unlimited 2".\nIf you played that before, you will notice the similarity, many parts of TDU2 are also in The Crew.\nSounds good right? No, not at all.Short Pro+Contra List on bottom of the Review\nWhat they both have in common is for example that the Police Cars are either always faster than you, regardless if you drive 100 km/h or 300 km/h or give up after 100 meters for no reason at all... Also the AI and Catch-Up-Systems during Races are equally bad.\n\nOther than that,\nTest Drive Unlimited 2 had probably over 130 different Vehicles, from many different Brands\nThe Crew has maybe 40? (Until Ubisoft will add more DLC Cars for extra $$$)\n\nIn Test Drive Unlimited 2 you had 1 small and one big Island as Gaming Worlds, Ibiza and Hawaii.\nThe Crew offers 1 Map, a minature version of the United States.\n\nWhen the Servers at Test Drive Unlimited 2 are down, you can keep playing your Savegame in Offline Mode.\nWhen the Crew Servers are down, you cant even Launch the Game.\n\nTest Drive Unlimited 2 offered a lot of things to do, you were able to go to a Driving School before races, to make Racing Licenses, to buy Houses, Cars, Bikes,Furniture for your Houses, you were able to customize your Avatar with clothes, Haircuts, Makeup, Accessoires. Also there were more design options for the Cars as well.\nIt was possible to go to go into the Houses, walk around, similar to "The Sims". You could visit other Players homes, take Photos, there even was a Casino where you could play Blackjack, Poker, Slotmachines with other Players... and a few other things.\n\nThe Crew doesnt offer much, dull and short Story Races, there are nice Cutscenes, but the Story itself is rather dumb.  There are also PVP events where the fastest Car always wins, nevermind how bad the Driver is..., Fraction Missions, Skillchallenges, Sightseeing and not really many customization options.\nBUT: At least you will have fun here, when youre able to drive around the Map with a Friend!\n\nWhile i played The Crew, i often asked myself how awesome the Game could be, if it was also developed and published by Atari and Eden Games.\nUbisoft delivered, as expect, another Game that feels unfinished, like they stopped the developing Process at the Late Alpha Stage and just published it to cash in, for next Years "The Crew 2"?\n\nFor example, you sit inside your Car, the Driving Mirror and Side Mirrors dont show anything, They are just grey.\nSame goes for the Racing Wheel Instruments. They were supposed to show Speed, Gear and RPM, but they also just show you a fantastic grey bitmap.\nOnly a few Cars have an Animation for a Gearshifting Character. Inside most of the Cars, the Avartar just keeps his Hands on the Steering Wheel and the Gears shift magically.\nThere are probably a few more little annoyances, but those points are already unnecessary\nI would expect that from an early 2005 Game, but not from a 2014 release.\n\nThe Things i liked about The Crew,  were the incredibly detailed surroundings.\nYou see NPC's walking around, like a beggar moving his belongings in a shopping cart, Prisoners knocking stones in front of a Prison, Planes and Helicopters flying around ... and many more realistic Daily Life Events.\nThe Map is filled with Wild Animals, they move a bit strange, but are still a nice addition.\n\nAlso the Animated Sky looks really nice.\n\nWhat else is left to say? Yeah. The Cars.\nWhile Test Drive Unlimited 2 had a very good balance and Car selection, The Crew's Cars are very unbalanced\nThe Crew got a bunch of overpowered and ugly (My opinion, yes.) American Muscle Cars.\nThey look like they weight 5 tons, have the aerodynamic values of a Brick Row House, but got a surreal good handling and can easily outrun a Lamborghini.\nThats just plain dumb.\n\nBesides that, there are a handfull european and asian Cars. But yeah they are the minority in this Game.\n\nThe Handling of the Cars alltogether is good, mostly. The Handling of the Offroad Vehicles can be very frustrating.\nFor sure this wont be any fun playing with Keyboard and Mouse.\n\nPro and Contra for the Lazy People:\n+ Very detailed environment (Working NPC's, a lot of Wilflife,,...)\n+ Better Graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2\n+ Detailed Leaderboards and Statistics for everything\n+ Good Car handling and controls, with a few exceptions.\n+ Open World, you can drive wherever you want\n\n~ Servers are down for Maintenance regulary, and when they work, it can happen that you still dont see any other Players.\n\n- - Uplay Launcher\n- Sometimes the "Play with Friends" Option works, other times it doesnt work at all.\n- No Offline Mode\n- Rather small Fleet of Cars\n- Unrealistic Engine Sounds\n- Missing Animations for Cockpit Mirrors. in some Cars also for Gear switching and Steering Wheel Speedometer, non funtional Indicators\n- No possibility to add your own Music\n- Boring and monotonous Storymode, Races are too short.\n- Not many Customization Options\n- The Crew was announced as a "Car MMO", but there are only up to 8 People in one Session.\n- No changing weather conditions (Except of Snow in the Mountains.)\n- Microtransactions\n- The Cars look great, but some of the textures of trees,bushes,... and the water look rather bad.\n\n\nAll together i would say, "The Crew" has nice looking Cars, but it isnt the big next Generation Racing Game that was announced and promised.\nIts good for cruising around with Friends (If youre lucky enough to get a connection..) , to find out a few things about the United States, but in the Main Category "RACING" it lacks a lot.\n\nYou can pick it up when its on sale for 20 Bucks, its not a completly bad Game but i can not recommend it for the full Price.","December 6, 2014","false","52.1"," 1,271 of 1,617 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","271","1","5","105"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshua_Benson/recommended/241560/","joshua_Benson","Joshua Benson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshua_Benson/","131 products in account","Alright, here we go... Take your time reading this. If you are still confused whether to buy this game or not, go ahead and start reading. "TL; DR" may occur. Scroll down to the "Verdict" and “Pro & Con” to see my final words.\nThis game is still reasonably okay, what's with everyone? Let me explain why this CAN be a fun game:\n\nWhat they have been expecting was this game to be as super as it was marketed; like those people that claim that have never heard of hype-trains before. But the core element of the game is enough. This game has a bunch of minor flaws that e.g.: Microtransactions, and deceptive speed perception.\n\nI can satisfyingly say that as a sim racer (mostly playing Assetto Corsa, GSCE, rFactor, Project Cars, etc.) this game is a decent arcade racer that allows me to use my G27 wheel with good FFB (for an arcade game) in a cockpit camera (yes, the driver is only turning 180° of the steering wheel, but you can use your full 900°; just like in DiRT Rally). 'Been playing this game co-op with a friend, driving for 8 hours STRAIGHT through the U.S. Of A. and we are still not done with discovering, not even at the slightest. AND, bugs are mostly gone... (or reported ones I have not encountered, yet).\n\nWhat I have been determined to do was:\n\n-- driving to explore,\n-- to have fun with friends escaping the police,\n-- and driving a few races here and there;\n\nLet me tell you... it is good at that.\n\nWhat? ...\nYou expected this game to be an ultra realistic driving game with an open world just because you read "simulation" in the tags on the store page? -- Yeah, with expectations like these you are wrong here, entirely. Yes, cars may drive sluggish with a gamepad, but I cannot confirm that entirely. It might have been the assists, an older version, or their own gamepad (again, I don't use a gamepad, I stick to a wheel). BUT, what I can confirm is that driving fast seems to be visually slow (for me only when I drive with the rear camera views). Although, that feeling stops when I change the view to the hood or cockpit camera. Don't think I'm trying to command you to now play the game in cockpit view (because that is personal perspective), but to try it out at least, or accept that the game's visuals are deceptive. You may compare this game with Test Drive Unlimited 2,\nI can already hear that you are screaming out loud that TDU 2 was a good. Sure, these two games are extremely similar:\n\nA galore of land to explore (it is not 100% accurate to the USA, but WTF, the game is still HUGE),\nMultiplayer that had you roaming with others,\nor even competing in challenges with 'em,\nit allowed customisation of your car,\ncop chases,\n\nDon't compare this to Project Cars (or any other try-hard sim-cade/sim) for example...\n\n-- This game just lacks the physics,\n-- Project Cars has the sole purpose of organised racing (the game is not about street racing, ramming, and cop chases),\n-- and a career that has no background whatsoever.\n\nDo you smell something fishy here? I do, let me tell you:\n\nThe game is not a "10/10 best game ever", but this is a decent game, it has potential that it builds upon. People have to distinguish between this and the "hyped-up version of this game (the one on E3). Yes, Ubisoft has failed at that part; miserably. Bragging with their "revolutionary new MMO racer", though, in the end it just being "vanilla" -- but a good one at that! The game also had huge bad mouthing due to the epic-failing AC Unity and WATCHDOGS.\n\nAdding microtransactions to your game whilst being an AAA is never a good idea, I agree. But the thing is (unless it is a car you really want) you can buy it for about 2 bucks, it is not that much. You are also given 100.000 CP (Premium currency) at level ten to buy yourself a bunch of cars (three at least). There are not that many cars to buy when it comes to cars that have to be bought with real money. With the "Wild Run Expansion" that is to add even more content (Drift cars, Dragsters, and Monster Trucks) there is actually something to enjoy again soon, this may also incentivise portions of the community as well.\n\nGraphics are looking well, the game runs at Ultra settings with 60 FPS (R9 270x Sapphire and i5-3470 @3.20GHz multi-core); only Anti-Aliasing is reduced to FXAA. The sounds of the cars are just as good as they were in TDU 2, might even compare them to DiRT Rally. The Crew should be regarded as a successor to the TDU series, for Atari has faded away due to bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nOkay, now let’s talk pro and con:\n\nPro:\n-- The Crew offers a huge map to explore\n-- Cop chases\n-- The body of a car is highly customisable\n-- Each car has a number of different setups e.g. “Performance”, “Dirt” or “Street”\n-- Easy to acquire performance parts [a lot of them]\n-- Grinding is almost non-existent (just play the game; you’ll see)\n-- A demo that allows you full access for two hours\n-- The faction system keeps you busy after the story\n-- Amazing sound for an arcade-racer\n-- Much longevity to it if you are into the aforementioned activities\n-- Good graphics\n-- (The Wild Run Expansion will feature a complete graphics overhaul)\n-- Fun cruising with friends\n-- AI is of little focus; the focus only lies in the cops\n-- Finding new players\n\nCon:\n-- The speed indicated seems to be exaggerated (for most people)\n-- Physics (mostly when falling from a cliff) are way too sluggish and heavy\n-- Visual tuning is limited e.g. colours, vinyls.\n-- You can only select from a pattern of vinyls, not individualise\n-- Gamepad controls/Keyboard controls have been reported being “icey” and “skatey”\n-- AI is just… “meh”, it sometimes speedhacks just like in MW, Carbon, etc.\n-- AI is of little focus; MMO.\n-- Finding new players\n\n\nVerdict:So, again, if you look for a challenge against AI (like Need For Speed MW, Carbon, Underground), a fantastic story and crews around everyone that battles each other in The Crew this game is not for you. But there is still a thriving PVP mode, an amazing Faction system that keeps you playing after the Story. You will struggle with the AI being just bad at driving and sometimes pushing you off drastically. But if you are looking into a long (sadly cliche) story with nice coop missions, have interest in cop chases, driving about with friends, competing against your friend, aka. "roaming in a racer" You should ONLY get this game on sale, don't pay 60$, it is not as good. This game has just been marketed falsely… But c’mon, how many games offer a demo such as great as this one to showcase its potential? Get the demo and judge it for yourselves.","July 19, 2015","true","37.2"," 219 of 260 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","219","260","15","0"

As far as I know, there's a huge difference between the bronze and golden part, and if you will be able to purchase all the golden parts with real money, there WILL be a huge difference between those who do not pay and those who do.\nI'd really ask ubi$oft to make the microtransactions available ONLY for COSMETICS, just like on all other games on interwebz (Dota 2, League of Legends, Team Fortress 2 [HATS!], and so on. I'm pretty sure you will gain a lot from those cosmetics (people won't mind if you add a 30$ cosmetic item that will have "unusual" effects, such as leaving some kind of light trail, etc) and players won't actually hate you because you released such a nice game but ♥♥♥♥ed it up in the end with P2W system.\n\nEdit 1: I'm not sure if there's anything else to be done after you hit the level 10 cap. Any other missions you complete will give you bucks BUT not xp. Also the parts you unlock are for level 15+, so I find it kinda useless (for now). Does anyone agree, at least in the next closed beta, to raise the level cap to 20? It takes about 2 hours to complete all the story quests and get to level 10.\nIf you want to actually do something to earn you stuff, try find all the 20 parts of certain cars that will unlock you some really awesome vehicles, with good stats too as well.\n\ntl;dr: play game 10/10, ubi$oft plz no microtransactions on performance parts, raise level cap 20, ty.\n\nEdit 2: I made a poll about microtransactions, please vote: http://strawpoll.me/2428839","August 25, 2014","true","20.5"," 821 of 1,077 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","821","1","0","60"

They locked the controls customization and they expect every player out there to play with the d,i,l,d,o controls they have assigned. .. nope, i can't do that. I've been playing for over 10 years with the layout I like to use, it's like telling Formula 1 pilot to jump into another F1 that is not setup for him ... uncomfy seat, pedals in wrong place ...etc.\n\nJust not happening, I'm no longer playing or supporting this game. Something as small as locking the controls can destroy the game. GG ubisoft ... as expected they don't have much brain nowdays. Why would you even include "controls customization" if you can't customize? I mean some stuff works, but some stuff is locked, the locked part is VITAL to me and it cannot be changed, very bad. Useless game, hope they go bankrupt.\n\nAlso new update made grass look like out of a cartoon. Speaking of online, it's very bugged. When trying to play with friends, it keeps disconnecting and friends keep disappearing on map, you see their name, but not the car or they disappear completely and then it complains that "can't join session" or some other bs like that.\n\nOn top of all that, at some point entire coop and PvP was unavailable and Ubisoft was blaming steam servers for this, how can it be STEAM servers, if this is a 3rd party game? It doesn't even run on steam, you can purchase and download via steam, but servers are hosted by Ubisoft.\nUbisoft is very bad and untrustable company, they lie and deceive and scam.\nThey show you one thing, but release something completely different.\n\nAlso savegame is 100% server sided, If it corrupts (which it does sometimes), then only way to fix this, is to contact ubisoft support and it takes them 1-3 months to reply to tickets. I was literally stuck for 3 months, because my savegame was stuck on loading and their support took 3 months to reply (not over reacting, literally 3 months).\n\nConcept is nice, map is huge, but entire game is very badly executed and nearly no support, Ubisoft is money greedy company and all they care about is money, they don't care about gaming experience. I don't recommend this to real gamers, it might look like a cool game, but after bit of playing it gets' very irritating and frustrating to deal with bad support and all those bugs and glitches.","November 17, 2015","false","165.6"," 182 of 220 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","182","220","10","1"

For me that is the best possible thing, because I loved those games and I am not a fan of where that franchise is at the moment.\n\nStory - The story will immediately bring you back to the NFS stories. While it isn't the most original, it fits what the game is. the cinematics don't look bad, but the cut scenes after almost everything you do can be a little annoying. You can skip them though, which is of course a good thing.\n\nThe driving mechanics are more arcade style, but it still has a realistic feel to it for those who like that. I like to switch between over the top and in the car camera, and I will say they did a good job with the in the car detail.\n\nThe controls are great, even with a keyboard and mouse if you're a fan of that mode. From what I have seen both controller and wheel work great with this game. Personally I prefer controller, but might be looking to get into a wheel if I find myself playing it a lot.\n\nThe world. It took me 14 minutes to get from Chicago to New York City. That is a long time considering I was driving around 140 the entire time. The world is huge, I am a little upset that they didn't even think my homestate of Connecticut was important enough to put on the map, but hey I can forgive them. During the beta I ran into many players and was invited to their crews as well.\n\nMissions. The most fun mission that I took part in was I believe called a Raid. Myself and two other players had to chase down an NPC and take them out. We were in our street cars and the target was in a raid vehicle. Even with strangers this was fun, so I know it will be a lot of fun with friends. The regular races are fun and challenging, the maps are of a nice design, but if you are someone who doesn't like racing with traffic around, you may want to only race when it is an evening time. Yes, the population follows the time, if it is afternoon or rush hour there will be tons of traffic, if it's night time there will be almost none. I crashed a lot and I feel like I am a good driver in these types of games, trying to avoid crashing is part of the fun though of course.\n\nOther players - For the most part the other players that I ran into were pretty cool. However you always have to beware of those players who are only out to troll you. They will just ram you for no reason and stuff like that. One thing I liked about the game was that it announces who the most wanted player online is. I'm not sure how the servers work for the game, but it's a nice feature to see and maybe even strive for.\n\nCustomization - Since it is still beta there wasn't much customization. There were maybe 5-10 choices for visualization except for right and left fenders, also not sure about stickers since I didn't use them. The choices that were there were nice and shows that we have some cool options coming in the future. There were no performance options yet, but you gain some from completing missions that give bonuses and increase your car level.\n\nAll in all I think the game looks and feels very promising. With Need for Speed going into the more Realistic/Exotic car with no customization field, this game looks to take its place. The game to me feels like it will be a lot more fun with friends, but can still hold it's own solo or with friends you meet through the game itself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. I hope you enjoy it and I hope to see you on the track.\n\nIn its current state and with the promise of all the additions that will be available at release I will give the game a 7/10 for now. Once the game releases I am sure that will go to between 8-9 in the racing genre.\n\nI am seeing a lot of complaining about the length of the beta. You don't have to pre-purchase. You made the choice to do it, so try to keep complaining to a minimum. Second, there is a way to change the 30FPS problem, you just have to do a bit of research. I didn't do it myself but a streamer that I was watching did, and some in his chat also.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FistaCuffLinks/recommended/241560/","FistaCuffLinks","FistaCuffLinks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FistaCuffLinks/","100 products in account","If you get TL;DR syndrome then skip down to "Verdict of The Crew" but I encourage you to read the specifics so that you can accurately judge if this game is right for you.\n\nFirst Rule of The Crew:      - Do  NOT  buy this game unless you have a human companion to play it with! As many others have probably stated, hardly anybody plays this game online; the servers are ghost towns. The players that are online in this game, based on their driving style, are probably around 10-13 years of age (offense only mildly intended if you are of that age range). It is not uncommon for an online driver to see your car and immediately attempt a T-bone maneuver. Therefore, if you are seriously considering purchasing this game, make absolutely sure that you have a friend to play with online so that this game can begin to live up to the expectations we all had of it.\n\nPremise of The Crew:      - The Crew was designed to be an MMORG (Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Game), which in concept is absolutely brilliant! In execution, however, The Crew has fallen short due to empty servers and a bug-laden open world. It cannot be denied that the premise of this game is one of the best of all time, but it seems that the makers of The Crew lacked the man-power in their programming teams to make this work well.\n\nAccolades of The Crew:      - The Crew is one of the most fun games I have ever played! My friend and I would meet online regularly to do missions together, rank up our cars together, take on challenges together and our favorite - drive in the open world together. In terms of sheer enjoyment for a racing video game, The Crew has to make the Top 5! (...when it's working...)\n- The Crew has a  massive  open world map! The map is probably about a 20:1 scale map of the United States; the map is by no means cartographically accurate, but the major landmarks and cities are there. Everything is down in scale (similar to Midnight Club: LA or the GTA games), but that doesn't mean that the world doesn't feel humongous! It is a daunting task to think about driving from Miami to Seattle, or LA to Niagara Falls, but as one who has done it, there are few things more exciting! There are many little easter eggs on the map to find in addition to the hidden objects and challenges that make simply driving around in the open world interesting and fun.\n- The Crew has a fairly large list of cars that are available in the game and all of the cars available look great in the game. You can customize your car with different body sets, colors and stickers to make your vehicle one of a kind. The cars also handle pretty well all things considered; The Crew is definitely not a simulator when it comes to driving but for an arcade style racer the car handling is more realistic than it could have been. It should be said that by the time you beat the game and level up your first car to Level 50 parts and a 1200+ rating, however, you  will  have a favorite car or two and for the most part only drive those cars.\n- The Crew has pretty decent graphics too. I have found myself taking screenshots of the scenery, much like I do with Skyrim, because the world really does look great! Of course, the world looks better at 60-80mph than it does at 180-200mph, even with the best GPUs, but that's to be expected.\n\nComplications with The Crew:      - This game is buggy. There is no simpler way to say it. And there is no denying it. My friend and I have constantly been thwarted by programming issues within the game. During open world travels we will inevitably come across at least a major bug or two every 30-60 mins. Some of the worst, especially since the new expansion has come out, include (1) infinite loading screens, (2) game freezing during fast travel, and my personal nemesis - (3) the road/world disappearing in front of you [this bug has an relatively easy fix - just open up the map and quickly exit out again, but it is annoying nonetheless. It is also potentially game breaking when you are in a mission or co-op event when the open world map is not accessible.] There is no way to enjoy The Crew without experiencing bugs. Maybe if there were more people online the makers of The Crew would be inclined to fix them, but since there are not, you just have to deal with them. This creates a Love/Hate relationship with this game.\n- The AI in this game is... wonky, to say the least. For missions/co-op events or in police chases, the AI seems counter-productive (as opposed to challenging) and even vengeful at times. Rubberbanding  definitely  occurs in these types of events and should be expected (heck, sometimes I think they designed it that way just so that you  NEED  a crew playing with you). In the open world, expect AI driven cars to suddenly swerve in front of you, especially if you are going 200+mph. If there were any corners cut in the programming of this game, I would think that they were cut in this AI department.\n- If you do end up convincing a friend to buy this game with you so that you can play it together, then you should also know that forming a crew in the game can be difficult at times too. It is normal for my friend and I to spend 15-30 mins trying to get into a crew together and forcing the game to put us on the same server. Game restarts should be expected, and it should also be noted that The Crew doesn't always play nice with Steam's voice chat (probably because it's a Ubisoft game and uses UPlay. **As a side note though, I have not had as many issues with Uplay as I have had with other games they put out**).\n\nTips for The Crew:      - Many others have said it on forums and discussion boards, but this game  NEEDS  a multiple waypoint system. The gigantic map is just begging for one! It is very frustrating to try and create driving routes and races with your crew/friend with only one waypoint to lay down. Honestly, I am very surprised by this huge oversight!\n-  Along with that, this game would be vastly improved if there was a community based Player Created Races/Challenges feature. Since open world driving is the best (and most advertised) feature in the game, having a community of racers all creating their own races/routes/challenges would add content and excitement to the game.\n\nVerdict of The Crew:      - I have put over 80 hours into this game and about 70 of those hours have been genuinely enjoyable! Open world driving is by far my favorite activity and with the help of my friend I have come up with several fantastic driving routes that are always a blast to drive! There is no other game quite like The Crew and my heart wants everyone to buy and enjoy this game.\n- The remaining 10 hours I have spent in this game, however, make it so that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for the $30/$40 listing price. Even on sale, if you  don't  have a friend to play this game with, I would  highly  recommend that you stay far, far away! But if you do have a friend to play with, I would want you to seriously consider the issues presented in this review and weigh them against your desire for this game:\n(1) If there is any hesitation, then spend your money elsewhere.\n(2) If there is still excitement and a "devil-may-care" attitude, then all I can say is, "Good luck!"","December 23, 2015","false","93.5"," 78 of 88 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","78","88","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BioVenomJohnny/recommended/241560/","BioVenomJohnny","Le Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BioVenomJohnny/","58 products in account","After around 40 hours of playing, I have completed the story, yet there is so much replayability since the map is amazing. But I will discuss what I think are the pros and cons and possible improvements of the game.\n\nPros:- Loading Screens are replaced with cinematics and statistics/parts. Using an SSD, these load time seems very quick.\n\n- Huge World Size/Map, the large map with the amount of detail put in is incredible, each area feels representative and visually stunning. This by far is the best part of the game. You can even zoom right into the other side of the map, and see LIVE details. Even sitting on the opposite side of the world map.\n\n- AFK Cinematic, when AFK your screen goes into different camera angles around your vehicle, with the terrain and weather affecting it.\n\n- 5 Base Car specs, These being Street, Performance, Circuit, Dirt, and Raid. Each with their pros and cons. Myself I prefer Circuit and Performance. These specs determine where and how you drive. (Expansion adds Monster, Drift, Drag)\n\n- Day/Night Cycle. During the night, everything feels different, yet good. The night time scene can be as visually stunning as daytime.\n\n- Customization, the customization in parts, colours and stickers. Are very good. You can even customize your interior. This allows people to make their car look the way they like it for each spec.\n\n- Exploration, as there are so many places to go, plus the incentives like hidden car parts, and landmarks, it feels like you always have something to find. Plus you cannot FAST TRAVEL to places you haven't explored on the map.\n\n- Arcade-like, yet realistic. It is a fine line between the two, but The Crew seems to have found a nice balance. With destructible (yet respawnable) gameworld. Crashes are of course nowhere near as deadly, but damage to the car happens and is visible until repaired.\n\n- Factions, you can choose between 5 factions (eventually) each allowing you to represent them in faction races and events. Earn reputation and you can earn more in-game $$ too.\n\n- Coop/Friends - Playing with up to 4 friends is great, especially how every race/mission/skill has its own leaderboard. Competing against your friends score is a great incentive.\n\n- Price, I purchased The Crew whilst it was on Holiday Sale (50% off). so it felt very valued for the time spent. The retail cost seems fair, however. As there are at least 30 hours of missions. + Countless hours worth of skills/exploration/PVP/factions etc.\n\n- Public Transport, If you do not want to drive from New York to Discover Los Angeles (for example), you can take a train or airplane, as a sort of paid fast travel. But I recommend just driving.\n\n- Skills, along every route and dotted everywhere along the map, are skills. These are objectives to earn parts for your car and compete against your friend. Makes the trip more enjoyable when every 5-10 minutes you can do some weaving (Slalom) for some fun, and parts. (If you're good enough).\n\n- Police Chases, cause enough destruction around a surveyed area, and you get some police chasing after you. Get caught and pay a HEFTY fine.\n\n- Vehicle Stock. There are over 50 in-game purchasable cars, each able to be specced out in different ways, some being able to be specced in most areas.\n\n- Driver cam. Seeing the interior and the world as it would be, LOVE IT.\n\n\n\nCons:- Cinematic Bugs, especially annoying since the cinematics are stunning. Having the audio completely drop out is really annoying. Even after replaying it at HQ, it still doesn't work. Having to replay the cinematic on youtube to hear it is not good. Also, a few times my car would flip over in the cinematic.\n\n- Locked to certain specs for races. I would like to compete against AI/friends using whatever car I want. But races will lock you to the SPEC. I think the route would balance what would be recommended vs what could be used.\n\n- Wild Run coaxing. Seems a bit pushy. Game starting screen, WILD RUN. Map spawn location. WILD RUN event. Certain skills (long jump etc) only achievable in drag car (WILD RUN). Want others to join you in missions (Look for crew) WILD RUN. I would like to see these features changed so that they less invasive, and more tempting rather than pushed you on. And for the price, Wild run is NOT worth it.\n\n- HQs / Tuners, most have the same background/area, some dingy commercial garage. Would like to see these being different and representative of the area.\n\n- Voice acting, it is not synced at all, and for some reason, they often call (Alex) 'kid'. Even if Alex is a middle-aged man. Pretty weird.\n\n- NO Cross Console compatibility. Cannot play with my console brethren.\n\n- PvP unbalanced. Vsing People 500pts above you. Lambo vs Mini Cooper.. Come on.\n\n- Perks should be removed completely, add the bonuses as standard when unlocking your allies.\n\n- 'Dumb' Smart Loot. Lvl 50 in a 600 pt car gets the highest score, better give him a bronze Lvl 25 part?? A lower score would have given me a better part.\n\n- Notifications on Old Parts. Seeing I have a new Lvl 25 bronze part for my platinum specced car when I visit the workshop is a bit annoying.\n\n\n\n\nImprovements:- Public Transport. Allowing the player to BOARD a train, or AIRPLANE, and visually see the map around them as they journey across.\n\n- Missions. Missions/Faction Races could be improved to be more rewarding. The 4hour race should have a way better reward then the 2.5hour race. A bigger REP or $$ Bonus would be nice. Also more of them. It is really simple to make them as the map is perfect. Just put a marker from A to B anywhere on the map.\n\n- Character Customization. Customization of 'Alex' would be great especially in the open multiplayer world. The Same change of clothes the whole game, does this guy even shower?\n\n- Music/Radio. More stations/music lists. It seems they are repeating quite frequently.\n\n- Test Drives. These should be like a normal test drive, drive wherever you want. Pay for damages. I do not like being limited to the small area (test lap) around the city the dealer is in. I would like to go to the track to be able to dry these cars out etc. There could be a % BOND of the Car Price that you have to pay before getting to drive it, and if you damage the car you end up paying for it later, like those A >  B missions that penalize car damage.\n\n- Car Specs. Having cars limited to 1 or 2 specs is not realistic. As most Perf cars could be Circuit cars and visa versa. Also, these should be visible to see what it would look like BEFORE purchasing.\n\n- Cross platform. Cross Console compatibility.\n\n- Removal of spec specific races. Or adding races that you can choose. Prefer the later option.\n\n- Random Vehicle Customization at DEALERS. Having it on purchased parts at the HQ is good, but being able to randomize what the car could look like at the tuner would be ideal.\n\n- Customization Lock options. Like the colour/shape (for example), should be able to lock those options.\n\n- AFK Cam, Toggleable On/Off and a smoother, slower shift in camera angles, over the Jumpy random camera angles. Also removal of the BLUR effect when in this mode.\n\n- Removal of 'Updating Content' loading. When alt-tabbing. Especially in borderless mode.\n\n- Controls. WASD STANDARD for speed etc. Who the hell uses arrow keys? Having everything on 1 side is easier. Lucky you can rebind them.\n\n- Scrapping Parts. Should be a lot more rewarding, and possible in the workshop.\n\n- Ragdoll effects on animals and people. If you hit them, you should probably see them go flying, instead of clipping through the car. A solid quick vibration would be a nice touch, for the real immersion.\n\n\nConclusionAs usual, there are a lot of things that could be improved,.but I do highly recommend this game. Not only for racing, but for exploration.\n\n(If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!)","January 6","true","51.6"," 90 of 110 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","90","110","0","0"

And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.\n- The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.\n- Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;\n- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.\n- Cockpit view:\n- When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.\n- In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;\n- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down.\n- Some of the game physics are just out of this world:\n- You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.\n- You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;\n- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.\n- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.\n\n(...)\n\nAnd there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to "farm" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.\nBecause you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.\n\nShould you buy the game?\nYes/No.\n- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.\n- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this.\n\nTo me this was the most expensive "early-acess" that I've ever bought.","January 13, 2015","false","152.3"," 175 of 239 people (73%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","73","175","239","21","5"

No problem, you however won't stop being sideways\n3. The game at points forces you to use sub par spec cars because "story" which are usually just time trials with an annoying npc yelling at you\n4. PvP is waiting in a queue to never getting into the game\n5. co-op is just two people suffering through a race and most the time even if someone pulls up next to you in the same race they'll just ignore the co-op request\n6. Overly expensive cars with arbitrary limitations on what can and cannot be certain specs\n7. Raid spec activities are just awful\n8. car spec designs are generic and the for purchase asthetics don't fix much\n9. If you do manage to find someone in co-op then the lag shows up pretty bad\n10. world is flat and uniteresting until cars randomly pop in and you crash\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying this game don't do it.

have written too much, please click HERE[puu.sh] or HERE(doc)[puu.sh] for the full review\nThere is a summary at the end if you are too busy to see through the whole review.\nAnd just a kindly reminder, there is no R-35 in the game yet.\n\n-------9/1/2015-------\nPatch released at 7th\n+ Car fix\n+ Better connection\n\n- No fix on AI\n- Faction War still meaningless\n- Still no rear mirror\n- Little more bugs\n\nBetter than before but not enough\n------------------------\n\nHate to say it, but if you are not a big fan of a free-roam racing game, don't buy it at this moment\nAlthough I am not recommending this game, this doesn't mean I don't like this game, as you see I have thrown more than 100 hours in it\n\nThe Crew was a good game for people to driving around the states, it still is, but with tons of flaws atm.\nStill, I should start on the good things first as some of you may still interested in the game.\n\nAt first, It has a biggest map for a racing game I ever saw, even I have spent more then 100 hours in the game, I still have about 1/4 to 1/5 of the map is undiscovered.\nIf you only drive to explorer the map and not doing missions, it should take you at least 12 hours, as you can drive 3-4 hours in a starting car just driving a lap of the border.\n\nThe game also provide various terrain and environment, with landmarks for players to enjoy and explorer freely.\nIn some of the story mission, it will even provide some environment effect like fireworks or plane flying over your head which is quite stunning when you see it first time.\n\nThere are 5 specs for cars: Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid, Circuit\nFor Street, Dirt and Perf, there are parts to let you to customize the cars, like front bumper, hood, rear wing, etc.\nJust be aware not all the car has all 5 spec.\nThe interior of the cars are quite detail and you are able to customize the color of it in most of the cars.\n\nThere are also different activity like skill challenge or limited period mission that may keep you playing.\n\n\nBad things\nFirst of all, lack of cars, there are only 40+5(wreck) cars if you are not buying the season pass, also, there are no Audi, Toyota, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Honda, Hyundai, Vovle and more.\nAnd for each brands there are only 1-2 cars.\n\nThe handling are not realistic like GT series, it is acceptable but you may feel strange for the first few hours.\n\nThe things that can be driving through are also uncertain, you can drive through some fences in cities, and bounce off with others.\n\nThere are no technical tuning in this game, like suspension modification, angle of tires, etc.\nThe only thing you get is upgrading the equipment directly.\n\nThere is no rear mirror view when you are in interior mode\n\nThe mechanism of automatic transmission is flawed (Details in Full review)\n\nThe difficulty of this game is very hard in different aspect and it is not adjustable.\nFirst, the Rival AI's car can be insanely fast, they will not slow down by environment unless crash.\nFor some casual driver with the staring cars, it is very hard for them to catch up.\nAnd with the auto catch-up system, even if you are good at driving and lead the whole race, you make one mistake and you will be overtake then lose.\n\nYou can invite other players to the mission to try to decrease the difficulty\nBut the problem is you will need to wait for the game to connect to a random session before you can invite players you don't know\nAnd with a maximum 8 people session, there is very hard to find one who actually willing to play with you\n\nAbout the police chase, first, the police is as fast as rival AI's car in missions.\nThey have a circle radar around them instead of a cone vision which should be able to block by buildings\nThe police heli can see through the tunnels\nMost ridiculously is that if you go too far from the police cars, the police car can spawn anywhere near you, and sometime in front of you\nThis make you need to maintain an approximate distance that their radar cannot catch you but no police car will spawn\nTo escape it should be always as fast as possible, I don't know why they need to make this system so counterintuitive\n\nThere is some perk in the game which can actually increase the handling, acceleration, speed, etc. in the game\nWhich mean even with a same car, a LV50 player still have a big advantage compare to a LV1 player, if the LV1 player haven’t bought any perk points using credit which can be obtain by paying real money.\n\nCar level nearly mean everything, especially when doing story missions with others.\nWith my 1200 lv cars, I always outrun the guy who invited me to the coop mission in his/her first time attempt.\nIn my experience, the higher lv car you have, the higher position you will get in PVP.\nAnd to get a car over 1000lv, you will first have to reach 50 lv at your character\nWhich mean you will have a big disadvantage before you reach 50 lv\n\nIn this game there is a faction war system but meaningless\n\nThe stability of the session can be very unstable\nWhen you are in a crew, you select a mission and invite you crewmate, you can end up with your crew member playing the mission themselves and you get a forever loading screen\nSimilar things happen when you select public PVP lobby, you will be the only one who get into the lobby and your crewmate will continue finding a lobby.\nSometimes you crew member will not appear in your screen even when you are beside of him/her.\n\nPVP sessions also contain connection problems\nSometimes when other player in your session have a unstable connection, the game will pause for 5 seconds\nwhen the player have a really bad connection, you game can have more than 10 times pauses, which is extremely annoying\nsometimes you can also getting left behind at the starting line when people already racing in front of you with about a hundred yards away\n\n\nThis is a nice racing game, and for some people it is still a masterpiece\nbut it is also nearly the worst racing online game ever, don't even know why they make the MMO feature as a selling point\nThe slogan of this game is "Never Drive Alone", but for me it is like "Never Drive Alone If You Want To Suffer"\n\nSummaryPros\nHuge map for exploration\nMany customization for some cars in some spec\nDetail and customizable interior\nBeautiful and various environment\nEnvironment effects in story missions\nDifferent activities that keep you playing\n\nCons\nLack of cars\nNo technical tuning\nHandling/Physics are not realistic\nFlaws in automatic transmission\nNo rear mirror\nDifficulty is overall high and not adjustable\nAI cars will not slow down by environment\nMaximum 8 people session make players hard to crew up\nPolice chasing system is stupid and annoying\nPerk system can provide unbalanced advantages\nLV of cars nearly mean everything\nFaction War system is totally unfair\nForced online with the server is unstable\nGame statistics can be messed up by the game/server\nUnstable connection among friends/crew member and to the sessions\nPVP connection problem\nBad avatar system\nVarious Bugs\n\nMixed\nToo much uncertainty on the road\n\nRecommend to buy it if you\nLove free rome style racing game\nHave friends to play together and can tolerate to any possible fail from the server\nLove customize your cars and show off\n\nNot Recommend to buy it if you\nCares more about realism of racing\nAre a casual driver and consider this game as a single player racing game\nDon't want to use tons of times to climb the ladder (Cars LV, PVP, Faction)\nWant to drive cars that doesn't exist in the game (find the list on the internet)\nWant to race on 1:1 scale circuit\nHave a bad

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkhadi/recommended/241560/","arkhadi","Arkhadi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkhadi/","430 products in account","Edit (4/25/2015) : They added a few new cars and some specs, fixed some bugs and managed to improve the main menu with a slideshow and the online matchmaking with a merge-all lobby system. Perhaps it's enough of a change for you to enjoy this game? Me, I checked and played the 'new' content for a few hours and unninstalled it again, personally I can't find any improvement worth a buyback into this game since my gripe is the terrible driving mechanics alongside the bad physics. I remain true to every word I wrote in this review.\n\nI had high hopes for this game, I played the betas, followed the forums and pre-ordered it. Then I forced myself to like it and play it even after I was completely frustrated by everything I'm about to say.\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE AND/OR PRICE TAG.\n\nBefore the ugly : THE CREW is not a complete mess, there is the possibility of having a great amount of fun playing this game depending on what kinda of player you are. One thing it gets right is the map diversion. Every spot, every city or zone as they say, has it's own feeling and design, it's unique, and driving around the map with a friend is sure entertaining. but that's it. if you're not the person who enjoys cross country trips or american cars, there is not much for you here.\n\nEntitled as "MMO CAR-PG" but you can't develop your character, not a single aspect. In theory, every player has the same exact character, solution? Let's hide other player's driver. and that's it. Let's say you play against remote controlled cars, for immersion's sake. you CAN'T call it an mmo, without character development, the best you'll get are perks, nothing really groundbreaking. but we have cars, don't we?\n\nThere are 30~40 cars and all of them seem unfinished, except for the first ones. because you know, "first impressions are always the most important". the first five cars have all the specs available, street, dirt, performance, raid and circuit. other cars usually have 2~3 specs only. so you wanna go crazy off road with that expensive car? too bad. also, most cars are American, so no luxury here. what's most stupid is the unbalanced performance cars have, the starter vehicles run faster then the most expensive car in the game.\n\nBut driving gets better as your car and player level increases, right? No. That's an excuse for the handling in the game. It doesn't get better. I have 1299 ( Max level ) cars and with assistance off, they just don't grip on the road as the default low level mustang does. With assistance on, it's just "drifting". The crew should have stayed as a street racing game only, the street tracks are okay, the handling on street is OK. but when it goes off-road becomes soap ( and not in a good 'Dirt game' way of soap ), on circuit the game just doesn't have enough decent physics to feel solid, and while climbing mountains with raid spec... I wish you good luck trying not to roll 900º in the air after hitting that small rock. this game is unpredictable thanks to it's physics, you never know how is your car going to react to crashes so expect for the worst and try avoiding collisions. worth adding : some elements break, some doesn't, and in this game this is not okay because when someone tries to cut their way trough some houses, the fences breaks. When you're doing the turn on a corner, well, the fence it very likely to be the most solid virtual object you'll ever find.\n\nProgression is BROKEN, I had to try various missions at least three times due to disconnects that WIPED my progress, my statistics are currently like this " main missions complete : 167% ", and the rewards are ridiculously unbalanced. Let me explain this : I leveled from 1 to 50 in ONE DAY AND A HALF doing no more than 60 PvP matches, 10 or so story missions and some exploration. Yes, I reached maxed level on an MMO in basically a day. It gets better, I was being rewarded 16k bucks every time I finished first on a PvP match, and when you are disqualified because you couldn't get to the finish line in time, well, TAKE THESE 16K BUCKS ANYWAY. You just know they didn't really put any thought into the game's progression when all it takes from level 49 to 50 is 2 races in 10 minutes.\n\nThe customization feels incomplete, some categories are there with no parts to purchase for you car, get used to the "No part available in this category" message. the stickers are single color only and there isn't variety among those, expect to see everyone using the same 2 flame stickers or racing stripes. the real car performance parts are available with a grind of challenges after level 50 which is not very cool given the insane difficulty of some challenges, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how fast your car is...\nAI CHEATS, it goes off track and spawns in front of you, It rams you constantly and the Catch-up is ridiculous. there are some gifs on Polygon's review of the crew if your interested.\n\nThe story is not good, you bounce trough one generic dialog to the next and I couldn't connect to any character of this game, I couldn't care less to be honest and not skipping cutscenes was a challenge at times. At the end of the main story you are rewarded with a mix of every CGI they made for the game, which felt very very lazy.\n\nAnd I could go on, there is the server instability problem, the always online "DRM", the NAT problem that causes online atrocities, the lack of mirrors promised by launch, no weather system, the "crew joining different lobbies" bug, the "Hitting someone back at 20mp/h and flying like when hit by a giant on skyrim" bug, the "I regret the money I spent buying this game" case and the first time I actually emailed steam support to ask about their refund policy.\n\nI'm frustrated. I just wish I could go back to those TDU2 Times.\n\ntl;dr\n\n+ Every area is unique and has it's own feeling.\n+ Driving with friends can be fun\n\nEdit (4/25/2015) :\n- A 2014 Racing game Lacking mirrors, promised by launch\n- Server instability, constant disconnections and progress Wipes\n- AI CHEATS\n- Incomplete customization ( Specs were added )\n- Not a great amount of cars ( Cars were added )\n- Unbalanced car performances\n- Terrible car handling\n- Physics make for an unpredictable game\n- Broken progression system\n- Broken statistics system\n- Unbalanced reward system\n- Outdated graphics ( They fixed DoF at some camera angles )\n- Fake car engines\n- No photo mode\n- Cliche, generic storyline\n- Only 7 players on Screen\n- Season Pass could have been part of the game\n- TERRIBLE Online pvp lobby system ( Now fixed )","December 16, 2014","false","67.5"," 220 of 314 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","220","314","3","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeales/recommended/241560/","Zeales","Zeales","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeales/","438 products in account","Wild Run Update: WR is out and after a few hours with it I can safely say that literally none of the concerns I have stated below has been fixed, in fact the game has gotten noticeable worse including, but not limited to:\n\nThe new vehicles included in this expansion are even more expensive in the in-game money/real life bought money conversion. While a high-end car would set you back roughly 15-20 euros/dollars(!) in the original game, the new high-end cars will be over double that. You're looking at almost 40(!!) euros/dollars for a single car and that is without any upgrade which will easily be another 20 euros/dollars if you don't have 3-4 hours to grind the in-game money for it! Also they included something called "Smart loot" which instead of having you travel around to certain areas of the map for challenges, you can now instead just do the same challenge over and over and over again for 5 hours and eventually you'll have your fully upgraded cars. The new extreme modes, monster trucks, bikes and drifting are essentially gimmicks that will be fun for roughly an hour.\n\nThe idea around The Summit is on paper a good idea but the execution of it is probably one of the worst ideas in a while. I could go into why at lenght but just know that unless you are ready to spend several hundreds (Yes, no joke) of hours in the game, it will leave you feeling unfulfilled and that you've wasted your time because The Summit requires you to compete against other players and only the best gets rewarded properly. I could go on and on and on, with how the side walks in the game are now actual edges that will make you car fly randomly or how drifting is 90% like driving in the snow in the vanilla game or how the game is so poorly optimized that the wet roads will make your computer stutter (Even on a 980 Ti!) and how the graphical update overall is a complete disappointment and the thousand other things I haven't mentioned.\n\nI'm going to have to stop writing here as I realize the more I think about it, the more I am actually going from thinking that the game was an okay game to directly hating it and regretting this purchase full stop.\n\nThe Crew and The Wild Run could've been so much more but instead we got this...\n\n\nOriginal game review:\n\nI tried being positive about this game, but in the end I can't justify it from a gameplay perspective. I like exotic cars a lot which is what has kept me at this game for so long, but I doubt a lot of people have my level of "addiction" to exotic cars to justify it and end up disappointed in the game. Be aware that this is an arcady game, so if you're looking for a realistic simulation game, this is not it.\n\nThe traffic is poorly implemented so if a player in your session has a bad connection, the traffic will swerve left and right and it will be hard to overtake.\n\nThe max number of players in a FreeDrive session is capped at 8 which in 2015 is hilariously low for a game so heavily focused on multiplayer. In addition to that, you have no control over what session you end up in. And that is without going into the required always-on DRM that will eventually happen to kick you out of the game (That is a promise) that will set your progress back 5 to 45 minutes.\n\nThe graphics are mediocre and everything in the world except player cars looks like something that was made in 2010. The sound is bordering on the ridiculous (Sorry UbiSoft, but a Koeniggsegg does not sound like a BMW with a custom exhaust) and the forced disconnect if you are AFK for 10 minutes (You are returned to the start Splash screen, not even disconnected where you parked your car before going AFK) gives this game a overall poor immersion.\n\nThe price decrease came too late and the game population has sort of fizzled out - That being said, it was briefly revived by the announcement of the upcoming expansion pack and the 2 hour trial. A trial that was poorly implemented. When you play the trial you meet people which makes this game a lot better, but by the end of the trial people are straight up disconnected with no chance of saying anything to the other drivers the person was driving with - The only way around this is to add them to your UbiSoft friendlist - But good luck remembering the names of the players!\n\nThe game gets grindy real fast. The laughable short story does not reward you in any way towards a full upgraded car, nor does it provide you enough cash to have an acceptable level of cars with upgrades. The game essentially forces you into buying in-game cash for real money to a gross extent. 20 euros will roughly be the equivalent of 5 hours of gaming.\n\nSpeaking of Euros, having encountered a bunch of Americans in the game they have proudly told me that they pay in dollars instead. In UbiSoft's world 20 euros = 20 dollars.\n\nIf you ignore all of the above and you spend the 30 euros/$30 just to cruise around and complete the main story the game is fine.\nHowever, if you know cars you will cringe. If you're a completionist you will burn out fast as the game has Tetris levels of variety in gameplay.\n\nWith all that being said, will I continue to play it just for cruising around in the single car I spend 15 hours to upgrade fully? Yes, I probably will.","July 28, 2015","false","137.8"," 103 of 142 people (73%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","73","103","142","14","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/241560/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","The Crew is a multiplayer always-online arcade-racer set in a huge open world which is a condensed version of the United States. It was designed by many of the same people who created Test Drive Unlimited, so it can effectively be thought of as TDU 3. It contains many of the same features, but not all (no houses or shops).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/CBYh4vPmH2k\nI think many people are unfairly critical of this game, and are failing to appreciate the best feature, the huge open world. In reality, the world area is only around 5000 sq km (about a quarter of the size of Wales), yet that's still a huge size for a game world, possibly the second largest open world racing game (Fuel is over twice as big). Road wise, there's 10,000 km of roads, 10 times as much as in the first TDU game, so that will take a long time to explore properly. But it's not just the size of the world that's impressive, it's the attention to detail and the huge number of landmarks. It's extremely well designed.\n\nThe USA is not only condensed, but distorted, some areas are much larger than others. This is necessary since if everything was to scale, every city would be a tiny village. Instead, the biggest cities are made much larger, as well as features like the Grand Canyon, while less interesting areas are shrunk in size. The result is greatly distorted, but it feels really good to drive around, and I believe it does a good job of representing the "highlights" of the USA in a way which suits a computer game very well.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vNx4FtHofwU\nMany people have complained about the horrible car physics. I was a bit shocked at this too in the beginning, but it turns out that the early cars handle badly by design, and get much better as you upgrade them with parts. The few cars I've tried from the DLCs handle much better. It also takes a little while to tweak your wheel or controller settings to get it to feel good, but it's worth the effort.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/KksGtk6F-i8\nApparently rubber banding is also a problem in the game, although I did read someone say it's been fixed. I've noticed it a few times with police chases, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me. Speaking of police chases, I find them to be a lot of fun, while others seem to hate them. Similarly, the raid challenges can be quite frustrating, but are also fun to me. Depends on your point of view I suppose.\n\nThe GPS tends to provide the shortest route between two points, which is often not the best way to get to where you want quickly (taking you through backstreets instead of sticking to main roads), but hey, SatNav does that in real life too! Just think of it as a guide that you don't have to stick to. Learning the main roads and using your "local knowledge" instead can save time! Also it tends to suggest offroad shortcuts, which can be annoying if you want to stick to roads, but on the other hand, it gives you a route through difficult scenery which you might otherwise get stuck in.\n\nOne annoying thing I have noticed is graphical glitches during the cut scene intros to most missions. Don't know what's causing this, but it's only a minor irritation, it doesn't happen when I'm driving.\n\nAnother slight peeve is that much of the terrain is too destructible, you can drive straight through lamp posts and other features as if they weren't even there, yet some are rock solid. It's sometimes hard to know which is which. Okay, so it's just an arcade game so you could say it's excusable, but it does lead to bad driving habits, driving through obstacles that you'd normally avoid. In fact, to win certain missions it's often a good idea to crash through things.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/blIdOUmGMh8\nSame goes for crashing into other cars, often (not always) this has little or no effect, barely slowing you down in most instances. Again, I don't like this because it encourages bad driving habits, not caring about hitting other cars when normally you should try to avoid them at all costs. But again, it's an arcade game, so I can live with it.\n\nSure, there are a few faults with this game, but most of them hardly matter to me. The game world is so large, with so many places to go, so many things to see (there's educational info on historical landmarks) and so many cars to drive (not a huge selection, but there are many variants of each, and who needs hundreds of cars anyway?) that I'm having too much fun cruising and exploring to take much notice of the faults. I think if people focused less on the faults and concentrated more on the fun aspects of the game, they'd enjoy it a lot more.\n\nFor me the FreeDrive mode is the real game, going on road trips solo or with friends. I dont' really care about the missions and the story that much (although they do add a nice bit of character to the game), I just want to explore America!\n\nHaving said that, the game gets more interesting the deeper you get into it. As you level up you unlock factions and faction missions, and that adds a lot more fun to the game, not to mention money! Some say that money is hard to come by and there's a lot of grinding, but they're wrong, money is easy to make. It's not a "pay to win" game, you can pay if you're lazy, but you can make it easily enough by simply playing the game.\n\nI'm really enjoying The Crew and I highly recommend it to positive gamers who enjoy exploring a huge open world, who don't mind the arcadey gameplay and can live with a few faults. Be sure to get the Gold Edition or buy the Season Pass to get a bunch of good cars that unlock fairly early in the game, to give you a decent variety of cars to go free roaming in, otherwise you'll be stuck with the early cars for a while.\n\nNegative focused nit-pickers need not apply!","June 21, 2015","true","455.0"," 178 of 264 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","178","264","17","18"

Little did I know, I was in denial.  In the trailer, they made it seem like you could roam around and see hundreds of people driving different cars.  This wasn't the case, because\n1) There are like 12 cars in the game, so no one has anything different.  If you're used to Forza 4 or Horizon, don't buy this.\n2) There aren't any massive servers.  There are only 8 cars roaming around including yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 6/10.  It's really fun for the first two days; I'll give it that.  Once you finish those two days of cruising, it gets boring.  It gets to be a pain to play.  It becomes a grind to get what you want, which wouldn't benefit you in the long run anyway because unlike Forza, where certain cars have more potential, you can take a 370z and make it faster than a Pagani Huayra, both in handling and speed.\n\nAnd the AIs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanvy/recommended/241560/","Kanvy",".Kanvy*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanvy/","276 products in account",""The Crew" is supposed to be advertised as this revolutionary "Always-Online" MMO car racing game that many people have been sitting around for years to be made. It delivers an exciting experience when read on paper, however when actually excuted makes for a sloppily made game which show obvious signs of outdated programming, and included with it an even archaic attempt to jump into the racing genre a few years too late.\n\nThe ideas presented for this game are fantastic, an always online MMO where people can join crews and race against each other representing their gang, crew or team. (Basically whatever you want to call it.)\n\nThe main problem lies in the focus that the game progression system, driving mechanics, progression system and general programming are flawed in so many ways it makes me wonder what year they drafted this game in before they took it to the crafting table.\n\nDesign wise, the game's success is at the core of it's pitch. The "Always online racing MMO car game that thrives while you are offline" with a "Progression system of great detail and complete customization". The game focuses hard on trying to give users a feeling that the world moves on without them, and you can visibly see this in (what should be) other players actively driving around the map going objective to mission points while in active traffic along side you.\n\nTheme wise, it catches the feel of Detroit decent well, but sadly seems more or less like a rip-off towards other racing games themes that tend to stick with the south-central LA area and Detroit (Generic East Coast Theme.) There's no variation in location until the later portion of the game, and for the most part you will only see major shift changes in the locale when you move away from Detroit when you move across central USA, the dirty south, the pacific northwest, and the southwest.\n\nThe map's design is heavily (and for the most part completely) based on the idea of the whole USA as a driveable entity. It's lacking point however is that there's little to no detail outside the area of Detroit, and similarly detailed areas tend to stay grouped up within each other leaving huge spans of empty road between the different regions. (Example : Central US, Between Detroit and Florida).\n\nProgression wise, the game tries to give users a sense of calm as progression unlocks aren't solely limited to "street races". Other goals lead to stunt jumps, checkpoint races and time attack objectives. These types of objectives spark the inner racer within all of us who prefer to beat personal times, which is great for some users. However, because progression is done with small objectives in mind to "Level" up your car to qualify for specific races, you'll spend more time driving frustratingly difficult time attack, check point, and stunt jump objectives due to the lack of responsive and "actually useable" car handling.\n\nCar handling is heavily tied to progression as the cars at early levels drive akin to that of an ice cube sliding on the ground. The cars when driven at their base level tend to be very unresponsive at the least, and you're more then likely to spin out regardless of whether or not you slow down at a corner properly or use the emergency breaks. Early game progression unlocks help ease this problem, however like I said before, you will spend a huge amount of time on small unlocks to truly level up your car to it's max potential. The pitch for this is that higher level cars are more responsive, and thus drive better.\n\nMechanically speaking, the game runs well for what we've seen of it's previously noted issues. (Previously in beta, the animations were directly tied to the frames of the game data). Now that full 60fps support is "Unlocked" in the options, the lack of speed that users claimed to have in the beta is completely gone. You now have a complete sense of speed when you throttle your car above 100mph. *(160kh/m for you other homies out there.)* However, optimization in this game and it's calculation of physics and other players tend to take the game's performance below the 60fps region when in heavy traffic, but never drops below 30fps. *Hint hint* None the less, setting the graphics down in this game will tend to ease the wrath of traffic, of the obvious drawback of image quality. In addition, there are still flaws with the animation which obviously give away the fact the game was from the start developed with 30fps in mind. (Which isn't entirely a big problem, however when you play games like this which rely on user input, the resonsiveness and feeling the user gets while playing is the biggest selling point in how the game performs on a face level.)\n\n**Plot**\nI'm not going to say much, so far from what I've experienced the story seems akin to most standard street race movies.\nYou are the brother to the leader of an infamous street racing gang called the 510. One day he needs you to follow him to a meet up, brother is shot and you get framed as the murderer. Fast forward five years, in an effort to clear your name and find your brothers killer, and the crooked cop who framed you for the murder, you proceed to work for the FBI to rise the ranks and bring justice back to the streets.\n\nSimply put, not exactly the best writing, character development for the lead character is non-existent and the progression of the prologue goes by so fast I honestly thought there was another beginning section I had skipped beforehand.\n\nMultiplayer wise, you're more likely to have more fun playing with the CPU then you do with actual players. Missions introduced throughout the game have two options for execution. You have the ability for solo gameplay which allows you to compete against computer opponents and progress through the game. (The only real MMO online element begins here.)\n\nFor actual multiplayer, lobbies are formed via missions when you select the option to "race online" for that specific mission. Users are then paged, and/or formed based on who are currently doing the mission and are gathered from that method. Users past that area, or users who have not progressed to that specific portion of the game typically do not respond or bother to play online due to the lack of users because of inconsistency with progression. Half the time you will spend it again, with the CPU racing offline. With a majority of your online experiences happening at the higher levels where non-mandatory race missions are more freqent and people will be fully utilizing the "Crew" feature more.\n\nOverall, the game is a fun chuckle. It has it's flaws, and could be a great game with fixes. Due to it's limited playability however, and it's very difficult progression system combined with a linearly designed multiplayer it falls short on the expectations created for it at it's announcement. Did Ubisoft deliver what they promised? Partly.\n\nThe game however is far from complete. For this, I have to give it a thumbs down. A game in general should be well fleshed out especially past it's multiple alpha, and beta stages which had the ability for vast numbers of user input. At this point in time it should be moderately well developed enough to not show this many flaws.\n\nI've already spent my money, and I'll continue to play it to see how development progresses. At this current point and stage from it's inital release from CORE features that were already planned for the game and is executed in it's fullest, there's no telling what can happen.\n\ntl;dr it's a rushed poor mans version of need for speed before EA became return of the sith","December 2, 2014","false","9.4"," 272 of 429 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","272","429","0","0"

The Crew is an MMO where you explore the US with your crew which consists of you and your friends.\n\nStory wise the game follows on Alex Taylor. You are a rookie racer and your brother is the founder of a nation wide racing group called the 5-10. You want to join, but before you can prove yourself, your brother is murdered by another 5-10 named Shiv who teamed up with a corrupt FBI agent. A few years pass and an agent by the name of Zoe comes by with a deal, help her put both of them behind bars and you become free. But you need to work up the 5-10 chain before you can get to Shiv, so you need to build a crew from all over the country.\n\nThe Crew offers a one time campaign which you can play solo or with friends. A lot of the events are identical in every region. Get to a state, find the next member of your crew, do jobs for them and repeat in an other country to work your way to Shiv. Some of the missions, include time trials, races, chases, take down missions and destroy missions where you have to destroy shipments of stuff.\n\nThe graphics and the entire map are incredibly well designed. I've spent 5 hours alone on driving around and seeing the sights and trust me it's incredibly fun and at the time of me writing this review I still haven't explored the entire map, so there's a lot more to explore.\n\nThe gameplay itself, is pretty decent. The game offers you different type of cars, like circuit, raid, dirt, street and perf cars which you can use to drive on different types of terrain.  A lot of them handle differently, like the circuit vehicles are incredibly fast, but brake terribly, raid vehicles can drive through all the terrain, so you can use them to drive up on mountain areas.\n\nThe game also has online races, but you can forget doing Crew events cause literally no one is playing the crew races, every event is solo only and the matchmaking is some of the worst stuff, I have ever seen. If someone in the lobby has terrible internet, tough ♥♥♥♥. You will be stuck on the message that say's trying to reconnect the player having problems. The game doesn't kick him out and trust me sometimes it gets annoying when in a single race the game pauses the race multiple times trying to reconnect other players.\n\nThe game also suffers from really big issues, like AI rubber banding players in the top position. and the AI in the lower positions give up on the races trying to ram each other of the road when they get the chance to do so. The game also suffers from clipping issues where you ram something so hard your car will get stuck in whatever you hit.\n\nThe game overall is a really fun game, but a lot of major issues make this game not worth the full price. On a discount I can safely say you can get the game and you will not be disappointed, by the game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Only buy on a discount\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 22","true","37.4"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","6"

There are a lot of great things about this game and it really is next-gen with both it's graphics and absolutely fantastic open-world. Instead of writing a long and strenuous paragraph however; I will simply provide the pro's and con's of this game.\n\nPro's:\n-Insane Open World (largest I have ever experienced in video game)\n-Beautiful Graphics (despite what others have said, when you crank this thing to ultra it sure is a beauty)\n-Good Handling/Physics (change the in-game handling in the settings to "sport" or "hardcore")\n-Beautiful Cars (they look basically the same as they do realistically)\n-Selection of Music (different radio stations that you can choose in-game while driving are really cool)\n-An Alive World (you'll see trains, planes, cars, pedestrians, trucks, law enforcement, et cetera anywhere you go)\n-Difficulty (it isn't a little kids game you can easily beat; it does take some skill)\n-Attention to Detail (there are abandoned houses in deserts that each look totally different, cops have different accents according to the state their in, landmarks can be found throughout the map and provide you with real-life facts about those destinations, et cetera)\n-Decent Story (it has a story and that's what counts in my opinion, it isn't amazing but it doesn't suck either)\n-Car Spec's (they are very cool and unlike what most people say; you do feel a difference between them)\n-Only Next-Gen Racing Game Available on PC (as of my knowledge, there are no other racing games on the PC that were released at the same time as the Crew. All of the Crew's competition like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub are only limited to the consoles at the moment)\n\nCon's\n-Some Buggy A.I. (especially in cop chases!)\n-Not A Huge Selection of Cars (I don't fully know how to explain it, but I feel there should just be a more varied selection of cars)\n-No Profanity Settings (I know I'm getting a little ridiculous here but it would be nice to have an option to bleep out the swears)\n-Not the Customization I was Expecting (it's not horrible but there just aren't that many customization options)\n-Pathetic Community (I have tried many times to do a proper co-op race with random players and it always fails because no one will join. I have also been bombarded by trolls that are hacking in high spec'd cars that do not meet there driver level at all)\n-Always Online (this hasn't affected me a ton but it's a bit irritating and can get a little laggy with a lot of players)\n-Crashes (due to the always online part; I have crashed a few times. Fortunately the game always saves my progress so it hasn't affected me yet)\n-DLC (although it won't really matter whether you get it or not in the campaign, I could see there being Pay2Win's in PvP. Like seriously Ubisoft, don't make people spend $60 on a brand new game just to be greeted by the stupid $25 DLC Season Pass)\n\nSummary:\nShould you buy this game? Well, if you love racing games and you love exploration and you have a beasty rig (that meets the recommended settings or even the minimum settings) then buy this game, It is fantastic.\nIf you don't have what I mentioned but are still contemplating purchasing the game, it might be best to wait until the price goes down; $60 is expensive.\n\nAnyway, if you read this entire review and found it to be helpful; then thank you for your support! Hopefully it did help you to make a decision. ^.^","December 25, 2014","true","37.5"," 201 of 321 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","201","321","11","17"

Seeing as both have different stories to tell, I feel it would be appropriate to split them up. Warning, there may be spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the whole story. Enjoy.\n\nSingle player:\nThe single player has a great story, as do most games made by Ubisoft. You start the story as Alex Taylor, a man and brother who gets put into prison and framed for his brothers' death, which was caused by the main antagonist, Shiv. Throughout the story, you compete and earn your rank through a sort of street gang lead by various characters by their status, (V2, V4, V6) ultimately trying to get to the top, V8, where Shiv stands.\n\nEach city you unlock, which I might add are major cities throughout the United States, (LA, New York, Miami, etc.) you gain new members to your crew, or basically guidance and emotional support to your driving and discovery of locations, races and more. Your crew becomes a valuable asset to you, both becoming good friends and especially people you can count on.\n\nNow, for the actual review part:\nThe single player had some good moments, great scenes, and overall a great racing experience. The handling of vehicles is the best I've seen throughout all my years of racing games, and takes the cake for that. The only thing I really wish they would have done was spend more time on the ending. It seemed very rushed and very anti-climactic. This though does not change my overall feel of the game, I still love it.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer can be a separate story on its own simply in the fact you can basically go anywhere, with anyone. Traveling far distances with friends or strangers can be quite a great experience, especially if you can tolerate driving for literally hours at a time in real time. To put into perspective, you can probably make it across the whole map (let's say LA to Maine) in about an hour, or close to. This is driving at full speed, at least at 330km/h (at least I was).\n\nThere's plenty of places to visit, plenty of great atmospheric areas to go to. It can be very biased, but if you're not into driving for hours at a time, I wouldn't bother playing multiplayer, I'd just stick to the story.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a great game for what it's worth, can include hundreds of hours of multiplayer time if you're into it, or if not, you can free roam around at your will (and even go offroading in a dirt spec or raid vehicle!).\n","November 28, 2015","true","64.3"," 64 of 94 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","64","94","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aegisi/recommended/241560/","Aegisi","Tactical Marine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aegisi/","151 products in account","-I've read people say this is sort of what TDU/2 is supposed to have been. I never played them. The nearest to open world racing I have experienced is Burnout Paradise. My comparisons will be based on Paradise.\n\nFirst, the main draw, I think, is the sheer scope. Meant to represent the continental USA, the game world is huge and divided into 5 sections: East coast, west coast, the South, Midwest, and Mountain. In each region, there is a handful of towns, of varying sizes from the region. the South for example, has Nashville, New Orleans, Miami(which is one of the 5 major cities in the game), Dallas, and others. The midwest, where the beta starts and focuses on, has Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis.  Between them and the west coast is  Las Vegas and the desert, as well as other towns.\n\nDetroit, St. Louis, and Chicago had landmark areas to visit that would give a quick sentence or two on a neighborhood, factory( Detroit's Ford factory included). Unfortunately I can't say I know anything about the 3 cities in game where landmarks are described, so i don't know how many are real or not.\n\n\n-What about that open-world, no loading screen driving?\n\nWell, the game touts being able to drive "coast to coast". You can do that. If you don't want to, pull into a town, and feel free to use the train station or airport as a sort of fast travel to different towns.  You can actually fast travel to any specific spot you've driven to. What this means is I start in Detroit, fly to Miami or San Francisco, drive to the nearby wilderness, warp to detroit, and warp back to that isolated desert plateau.\n\nSpeaking of towns and landmarks, some regions have real world race tracks or mountain trails. Pike's Peak is very close to St. Louis, while Mazda's Laguna Seca course is close to the western coast line. There are other trails  and tracks, but those were the two I personally visited and ran. For those of you curious, Pike's Peak is in its gravel glory.\n\n-There's a lot of driving, what kind of driving is it?\n\nWell, it isn't as arcadey as Burnout Paradise,Initial D, Fast and Furious, or other arcade machine driving games. With that said, it isn't Gran Turismo, Forza, or Rfactor either. Users of steering setups like Logitech's G27 can expect to use all 3 pedals if they so choose. I personally made use of the 360 controller for pc, and while it wasn't as perfect as a wheel could be, I did fairly well. Controller users, expect some slight difficulty shifting in default controls. Using the Right analog stick up and down as sequential shifting works well enough until you need to reverse. Likewise, don't expect to be precise on throttle and brake using the left and right triggers. The boost button is the "A" button, which means boosting as you shift WILL be awkward and slow you down. Having one of the wheels is definitely going to be a better experience in fun and outright skill.\n\nAs far as tuning your vehicles go, expect more "MMO", less "simulation" and "racing". For example, I completed a quick event while cruising and got a new ECU. it added +2 to braking. When you buy your car and it's considered "full stock", you will see some real stats: Torque, max speed,  weight, drivetrain layout, 0-60 time. Once you begin upgrading it however, those will be replaced bby more MMO styled representations. My 370Z car in "Street" spec had a speed of 63xx, and after getting various unlocks, it ended up around 66xx. This may seem confusing, and I apologize if my description has lost you. Here's the bottom line: DO NOT EXPECT YOUR CAR TO HANDLE WITH SPECIFIC INPUTS AS IF THIS IS FORZA OR GT. The game definitely caters more to the feel/perception of driving than the technical  know-how and experience.*Note I've only played GT5, which is a decent "sim" for consoles, but  probably isn't the most in-depth driving sim either. It is a good comparison to this game and Burnout Paradise though.*\n\nViisually, car mods are well done. Swap bumpers, hoods, trunk spoilers, interior material, and paint. Bonus points for rally lights and snorkels for "Dirt" spec cars. Each part and sticker fits right. The cars are simply beautiful to look at. As you get damaged, paint scrrapes off, bumpers begin to hang off, glass gets cracked. Did you drive off-road? you've probably collected some mud.\n\nSo, the game's called "The Crew". Where's said crew? (Multiplay)\n\nIf you see a player you want to crew with, simply bring the menu up, select their trading card, and invite them. Once in a crew, the whole team (up to 4) can do most single-play events. If one player wins it, the whole team wins it. Got a friend that loves off-road, and another that specializes in hitting the apex on a hill climb or track? the off-road guy can do track events with the track guy. Team wins, off-roader can move on. Same with the track nut being able to sort of get carried through off-road events. The notes are true: *no* load times. You can drive from Detroit to San Fran without seeing a load screen. ***Except for  a noticable 2-6 seconds transition to and from map screen. So what happens when you are in Detroit and your friends are already in San Fran? Well, if you've been to the spot they are at, you can simply fast travel directly on top of them. Otherwise, unfortunately, you guys have a bit of a drive to meet up unless you take a bus or plane.\n\nFor better or worse, you can't see every player that is online in your world. the game seems to split players into "Sessions". You can freely see players on your map if they are in your session. Whether your friends are in your session or not, you can crew with them. Animals and perhaps other things aren't synced. A friend was running over some boars in a forest while I watched him do donuts in an open field. Weather does seem to be synced though.\n\n\n\nI tried to cover some of the technical aspects above. Driving physics and handling, the open world aspect, and multiplay.\n\nThe truth is, I had a fun time being in a crew with 2 friends, and going from meeting them near Laguna Seca, to driving for 20 minutes sowe could hit Pike's Peak. Yes, there's  a single player story revolving around underground street racing and gang drama...but what I and my friends enjoyed most, was getting in our cars, and just driving. I was using a Ford Focus, while my friends were using a Dodge Charger and a Ford Mustang. As we were traveling, I had to really struggle at times to keep them in my view. My god it was glorious. Sometimes they let off the throttle, or we paused to swap to different cars. After switching to my street car (370z) I was able to keep good pace and even pass them. At that point, we were able to just trail each other closely.\n\n\n\nBuy/consider  this game if:\n\n-You enjoy driving just to cruise. (Part of the charm is the 20 min drive)\n-You don't need/want very technical, realistic driving. OR You don't mind a driving game with somewhat..exaggerated characteristics.\n-You like open world games\n-You like cars\n-MMO/RPG type progression is ok to you: redoing missions for more XP/cash, less than accurate tuning( see above for ECU adding +2 to braking stat )\n- Simply looking for another game to use that steering wheel/pedal/shifter set for.\n\n\nMaybe skip the game if:\n\n-the idea of an always-online game isn't fun to you\n- You need/strongly desire simulation/realistic handling, roads, etc. The game makes some heavy compromises in each area.\n-You prefer more traditional racing, such as Forza and GT for track racing; Colin McRae/Dirt for Rally/ light off-roading.\n-you hate Uplay. (I had some very damning problems separate from the game)\n-Not a fan of MMO's or grinding to level up the player or cars.\n-You don't really want to use peripherals like a steering wheel, or analog controller. Like a real car, slight throttle, brake, and steering inputs will be the difference between a smooth drive and constantly smacking cars and guard rails.","August 30, 2014","true","78.6"," 108 of 169 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","108","169","0","9"

I'm not a big fan of racing games in general but The Crew is an exception and is one of the racing games that does it right in my eyes.\n\nI spend about 2-4 hours on the Singleplayer element of the game during the beta, once i completed this i spend the remaining hours cruising around in the largest map i've ever seen in a racing game. The MMO aspect realy comes into play when you cruise around the map. I bumbed into several other racers on my way across the US and we grouped up and drove around together picking fights with the Police.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/recommended/241560/","archy18","Archy Senpai [RTOZ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/","1440 products in account","The game is quite fun, and I have spent many hours in it, and will probably spend more too. However... there are some pretty big caveats to this. The price for one; I have the Australia tax, and the base game costs $75USD, not including the exchange rate and everything. Then there is the DLC - each one is a pack of 4 extra cars, hardly worth the price considering they don't really offer too much more. And then there are the Mi-crew-transactions. Seriously? Extra in-game micro transactions on an already pretty pricey Triple A release? There are two different forms of currency in-game, one which is solely earnt through missions, skills, and stunts. And then there are CREW CREDITS. You are given 100,000 reasonably early on in the game, but that's not enough for anything good. And so... you are invited to use real life money to purchase these in order to quickly obtain cars or specs that you would otherwise spend countless hours grinding for. The grind for this game is pretty ridiculous - not only do you have to grind for in-game cash (unless you pay real money) for the cars, but then, upgrade those cars, you must complete skill challenges to acquire parts to improve your car... for each individual car. The best parts are also RNG based, so you could easily spend hours farming the same challenge to try and get that specific part you wanted.\n\nIn contrast to some others, I've had no issues with Uplay, but this could just mean I'm one of the lucky ones. Unlike some of the Trailers, the world isn't as filled - this is both a good and bad thing. If you like PVP, well, you'll be in for a long wait. But otherwise, the comparative lack of players is actually a bit of a blessing in disguise. Particularly if you are farming money or parts, the smaller population sizes actually makes it much easier to do what you want without getting in each other's way, which is extremely inconvenient and can be extremely aggravating. One of the biggest draws, the co-op, doesn't really seem to work completely as well, sometimes crews doing a mission won't finish properly. That said, it is still incredibly awesome to drive around America with a group of friends, or accept a random online invite if you prefer that instead. There can, however, still be connection issues even within a crew, so that is something to keep in mind if you plan on primarily playing the game in multiplayer. You'll also want to do this with a friend, playing with strangers online can be dicey and very hit and miss.\n\nThe campaign is pretty standard and boring despite how short it is - done and dusted in about 7 or 8 hours. The campaign really offers nothing new, interesting, or relevant. It's very cliche with some pretty glaring plot holes. I enjoyed cruising around the map in free roam doing whatever I wanted more than completing the campaign.\n\nThis brings me to by far, the best part of the game - the world map. The Drive is the best open world driving experience I've had by far, with you literally able to drive from Canada to Mexico and coast to coast with an incredibly diverse environment to explore, with vast tracks of open road and off road land to discover. Many cities are either scaled down or removed completely, understandable but potentially annoying to some - I never had an issue with it, it would not make sense to make everything completely to scale. The exploration of the map is great, although sometimes the game feels more like a tourist guide... noting landmarks like the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. Regardless, the environments are fantastic, from the dense urban cities of Los Angeles and New York, to snowy mountains, deserts, and swamps. The time and environmental system in The Crew is also well worth talking about. From snow, rain, cloud, and sun, the weather is quite well, although rain does not affect driving as much as it should. The day/night system is a highlight, although sometimes streetlamps and headlights turn on and off at weird times... The poor standard of NPC traffic is a let-down. Not only in terms of how they look, but also in terms of how they spawn and despawn. I understand that this is to reduce the stress of the game, but it still looks odd to see other vehicles randomly appearing or vanishing, especially at night time, where headlights are the only thing which shows other road users.\n\nNow to the gameplay. The driving and racing offers nothing spectacular, although the game's physics and hit boxes are inconsistent. On one hand, it's pretty good to see a driving game where your car accumulates visible damage. However, repair prices are exorbitant, and the damage does not seem to effect the car's performance. Then there are odd times where you hit another car or object... sometimes you get the "crash cam", sometimes you spin to the side, sometimes you flip, sometimes you are bumped backwards or sideways... but there doesn't seem to be much  consistency. And sometimes you'll be sent flying over rocks or curbs through invisible walls. It can be entertaining to see your million-dollar car flip and tumble... but also frustrating and physically wrong. I feel the handling is quite poor in the game, with strangely large turning circles, the surprisingly high propensity to skid (not drift), something exacerbated off-road. Landing after jumps is also poorly handled, and you always land nose first, generally but not always, causing you flip and crash.\n\nThere isn't too much racing in this game, with a variety of other missions such as "disable" or "deliver", but the game's AI is very frustrating and completely unrealistic. Regardless of how your car is upgraded, the AI will always be right on your tail. Collisions will ALWAYS affect you more negatively than the other car hit, regardless of whether it's a race or police pursuit, and who intitiated the contact. And the police pursuits are not fun either. Pursuits only start if you hit a street lamp, but you will be ignored if you speed through a red light at four times the speed limit past a police car? And then, when the pursuit starts, it's actually quite impractical to see the police cars catch up to you... it just doesn't make sense that a random squad car could catch up to a supercar and then insta-stop and bust you. The speed with which you get caught, and subsequently the amount you get fined, make police pursuits far more trouble than fun. The traffic can also behave oddly, especially at lights and when merging.\n\nAnd then, finally, the cars themselves. I really love the fact that most of the cars are licensed, and have official paints, rims, etc. There are exceptions though, such as the two RUF cars. The stature of the cars is further refined by the 5 different classes, or specs - Street, Dirt, Performance, Race, Circuit - which are all noticeably different to each other, in both looks and performance. This is in contrast to some other games, where differences such as Rally or Muscle cars actually really don't offer much difference in terms of gameplay. In The Crew, the different classes all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and perform differently. Even with the classes, however, the selection of cars is really quite limited, especially if you do not purchase the DLC. While there is a reasonably large range of physical modifications available (bumpers, hoods, spoilers, etc.), these customisation options lack depth and are limited. And some, like the license plates, are barely noticeable. That said, you are able to do some incredibly fun and potentially silly things. Like drive a Mini Cooper down a ski ramp like THE STIG, or hit 300km/h in a Fiat or Dodge SRT.\n\nIt's months post release, but there are still bugs  - getting stuck or going through environmental hazards, , and graphical glitches where roads vanish or turn strange colours... Don't get me wrong, I enjoy The Crew, and it isn't bad, per se, but it's hard to justify the price, especially with microtransactions thrown in.","February 26, 2015","false","278.9"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","56","81","7","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shokkbox/recommended/241560/","shokkbox","shokk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shokkbox/","193 products in account","This Review is heavily outdated but I'll give you the summary of how the game is now.\n\n-Traffic exists and is always annoying in free-roam. [Shout out to the downhill drifters in the mountain state smashing into buses on every corner]\n-The servers are trash and sessions barely work most of the time.\n-New Car releases being only buyable via microtransaction currency is garbage for a game that's dying, which means Ivory Tower and Ubisoft are trying to get as much as possible from this game's whales.\n-Physics are awful\n-Customization is still awful and isn't being expanded on other then condensing categories of existing elements.\n-Monster trucks were a mistake.[Wasted Development Time]\n-Who the hell wanted bikes?[Wasted Development Time]\n-Shader revamp still isn't good enough, the car headlights are dying flashlights that barely light up anything.\n-Race track lamps don't cast light (what the actual ♥♥♥♥ Ivory Tower?) So it's dark as hell with your awful car lights.\n-Most previous issues about the game still exist like barely anything to do other then drifting (Which you have to buy the wild run for)\n(Wild Run DLC is literally "Buy this if you want to drift and have actual fun")\n-Drifting isn't as good as it could be (Because you can't edit anything about the handling of the car apart from RNG Parts WHICH THEY MADE EVEN HARDER TO GET.)\n-Rx7 was put in for ridiculously high prices to force more Microtransactions.\n\ngg Ubisoft edgelords being incompetent still.\nIvory Tower you can do better then this ♥♥♥♥, c'mon.\n_____\n\n[OLD REVIEW BEFORE WILDRUN]\n\nSummary at the Bottom.\n\nThe Crew is a game I was quite excited for since I played the Beta, though it is suffering from some massive issues and probably more as I play more. My review style is usually pointing out the negatives, as negatives are easier to see then positives, which positives clog the list up if you try to find them and it becomes a mess.\nNote: I didn't pay fully for the game with my own money(I sold TF2 ♥♥♥♥ on the market), so I am not biased by how much money I invested.\nLets get started..\n\n•AI\n-The AI is the type to mimic what the player does if it's not in 1st place, you'll notice this if you're already playing.\n-And they just do things that are outright impossible. In the video Jim Sterling made at the 8 minute mark, there's a AI controlled car that just does what he is doing except at a ridiculous level and still is faster. This is a massive problem when you're racing AI and they pull this.\n-Source of the ridiculously bad AI; http://youtu.be/MJbAt5QWDhU?t=8m21s He's not even racing him cause it's the prologue and he's doing this cause that's how they're coded, and in races they do the exact crap.\n-There are also times where they go through civilian traffic vehicles to keep up with you, it's extremely unfair and frustrating.\n-Faction missions where you have to race these very AI for an hour or 2 is just the most infuriating thing imaginable, imagine that AI, doing insane stuff and keeping up with you while you're trying your best to not slam into traffic in crowded cities at 150-200mph and the AI is going through it like it doesn't even exist with no consequences in handling. Not fun at all and I'd say avoid ones that have you racing the AI in those long missions.\n\n•Customization\n-Kits are another issue, many kits aren't done yet which should of been if the game had to be delayed.\n-Kits like the raid or circuit, you can't customize the body for the few cars that currently have it.\n-You can't color your rims(Which would be so easy to put in), so you're stuck with Grey/Default, black, white, and sometimes gold)\n-There isn't too many selections, for instance in Dirt, if I wanted a certain headlight setup, with fog lights, I couldn't do it, I had to have fog lights with a different setup of headlights. A tad restrictive and could possibly be easily fixed seeing as the fog lights are ontop of the model.\n-Vinyl's are somewhat dull as well as restrictive seeing as what you see is what you get, no color changing what so ever, so you'd have to tailor your core vehicle color to the vinyl or just either have no vinyl or pick a different one.\n\n•Cars\n-Pretty much a 14 year olds wet dream, there's a bunch of Exotics and Muscle Cars with barely any Japanese Cars.\n-When you start, you have the choice between 3 identical looking American boats, or the one Japanese Car, barely much variety to start with.\n-There's some Civilian cars that look pretty damn good and would add greatly to the selection, but they chose to make them just cars to pass by or get in your way.\n-Tuning is pretty much non-existant, the only thing you're doing is upgrading parts, not tuning. Static upgrades. No body tuning, or engine tuning. The spec kits are the only thing that 'tune' your car.\n\n•Misc\n-G27 and other wheel controller support is still awkward and the Force Feedback is not good to play with, it jerks the wheel randomly and you're constantly fighting it, no matter if your on Sports or Hardcore, you have to turn Force feedback down to play with a wheel enjoyably\n-Personally I don't really like nitrous boosts in games, but that's just my peeve, the mechanic is there so note that.\n-Crew system has problems with disconnecting at the end of missions, instancing, etc.\n-The Police are ridiculous during missions or higher level stars, like they're psychopaths who got a Police car and want to kill you at the cost of killing themselves, and suffer from the typical AI problems.\n-Physics are ridiculous, as the community calls them Cat-Physics, your car will try it's best to stay on all 4 wheels, which causes ridiculous things to happen if your wheels get off center.\n-Text Chat censors such stupid letter combinations making it impossible to have normal conversations.\n\n\nOn the topic of drifting; If you want to know what kit is best for drifting, it's Street. It use to be Dirt, but the handling changes made the the dirt kit less optimal for that.\n\nI will add on more to this review as I play more.\n\n•Summary.\n-The AI is Terrible and Unfair\n-Customization is more limited then it should be(It doesn't need to be NFS Underground, but it can easily be better then what it is)\n-Car selection is very uninspired and bland.\n-Currently doing missions in a crew has issues and kicks people out of the game and having their rewards lost.\n-Nitrous is a mechanic and is pretty much needed to be used in missions.\n-G27/Wheel support needs work\n-Assets in the game that should be used but aren't.\n-Game is still unfinished even after a Release delay, unobtainable kits cause they're not "finished".\n-No user radio for immersion sake, and the music selection is very boring. You'll have to resort to listening to your own music outside of the game.\n-Missions due to the AI aren't fun\n-Popo are not fun and you might as well let them catch out outside of missions if your star level is too high.\n-Text Chat censors are terrible, and was rushed.\n-Physics are counter-intuitive and can mess you up especially during jumps.\n-There is no Tuning, changing Specs is the only 'tuning' you'll get.\n\nWait for a discount or hold off until more updates come out. It's not that fun in its current state. It has the potential to be fun, just not currently.","December 3, 2014","false","82.4"," 111 of 175 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","111","175","0","5"

I may as well say that I really tried to like this game and even spent money on it, though that didn't help a bit.\n\nThere are few pros to this game, though I like the fact that I can drive around a miniature U.S.A., and that there is a freemode, but that's about it.\n\nThere are so many flaws to this game, that I can barely begin. Okay, I will adress the elephants in the room first...\n\nThe physics, oh GOD, the physics! Saying they are bad is a horrible underestimate. The physics make no sense, and will even screw you over at times. I have lost half of my speed due to a gaarbage can, spun out on the slightest nudge/miscalculation,  and I can never tell what is breakable. In fact, while doing the "Whiteout" mission, I have been propelled into the forest at 300 mph for no reason, though that was only once. Though this is much better, it still is a mess.\n\nThe A.I. in this game is unforgiving and cruel. A Ford Crown Victoria can keep up with a Lamborghini, ram a FOUR TON hummer (for those who don't know, four tons is 8,000 lbs.) off of the road with little effort, and will even spawn right in front of you.\n\nThis will be a short one; the skills are dumb and feel like another weak attempt to get people to play their game.\n\nNow, the one that bothers me the most. The cars themselves.\nThey are horribly unbalanced. For example, a RUF is a better offroader than a Hummer, the Pagani Huayra turns like a battleship, and the cars are horribly overpriced. The last one is so overlooked that it feels like a knife is going through my chest every time I have to go and save up for a car that is necessary for my success.\n\nAnd I'm not going to go into detail with the story, because we all know it's bad, boring and repeditive.\n\nTo conclude, this is a game that is a perfect example of what plagues franchises like CoD, Assassin's Creed, and some single games, like Duke Nukem Forever; lack of effort. It's just another poor excuse for what it is supposed to be, and another cheap way to get some quick cash.\n\nUPDATE: Make the wise decision, Ubisoft. Make Wild Run a free expansion. Why?

I know you're worried about it being Ubisoft - no worries, it's flawless.  I'm 30 years old.  I've been playing racing games since Pole Position in the 1980s on my Mac.  I've played everything from the 1990s hit Gran Turismo 1 to the brand new Mario Kart 8 on Wii U.  Simply put, The Crew is one of my favorite racing games ever.  It is a unique racing MMORPG like none other. Freakin' massive, gorgous, and varied open world to explore, the best open world since Skyrim. Tons of players everywhere. Nice co-op and PvP. Lots of different and varied missions/quests all over. Surprisingly decent story about gangs and the FBI. Tons of things to level up and customzie. Incredible graphics, one of the best looking games period. Tight and responsive controls that work perfectly. Very unique and just what racing games needed. Any fan of racing/driving must check this out, it's much better than I expected it to be. The game runs absolutely flawlessly with not a single bug in sight.  You can spend hours not doing any missions and just driving around and soaking in the world.  It's  racing game with the addictiveness of an MMORPG and it's is very hard to stop playing.  I can see this game eating hundreds of hours of my free time.\n\n9/10 -  Does it have flaws?  Sure but they are nothing major that prevents the game from being a blast.  It combines the best of the best of the best racing games.  Gran Turnismo, DiRT, Hot Purtsuit, and too many to name.  The Crew is the  biggest surprise in many years.

Just because the game was looking really interesting and something that I could spend hours on, just by looking at the videos, screenshots, etc of the game.\nI took my time with the story, I didn't want to rush it, just because there was so much other stuff to do around the world (exploring, skill challenges, side missions and so on) but eventually, when I completed the story, I pretty much stopped playing the game. I had already seen pretty much everything the game had to offer, the missions and everything just kinda became repetive. Of course the exploration part was still there in the game, as the map is massive so it's going to take a good while to explore the whole map, but as much I did enjoy driving around in the game, I just couldn't find the interest in exploring the whole map.\n\nHere's a list of the pros and cons in the game, and then in the end of the review, a summary.\n\nPros\n- Decent graphics\n- 5 different specs available for vehicles in the game (Not every car has all of the specs, though)\n- Big map\n- Interesting story\n- Decently made cars\n- Good amount of music in the game\n- Good performance\n- Amazingly detailed interiors in vehicles\n- Ingame awards\n- PVP events\n- Decent handling (A lot of people have said that the handling is bad, but in my opinion, it's pretty decent)\n- Good car customization options\n- There could be more customization options in the game, but the ones that are in the game work just fine when customizing a vehicle\n\nCons:\n- Short story (Even though it was interesting, it still was short)\n- Crew Credits (You don't need to buy these (with real money) in order to progress quicker in the game, but they do help you a lot if you want to buy that Lamborghini quickly and not spend a few hours farming money to get it)\n- Crash cutscenes are horrible\n- The AI\n- Opponent AI is impossible, when your car level is 1299 and their car level is 299, they still catch up to you in a second and are always right behind you\n- Traffic AI can be pretty buggy sometimes\n- uPlay\n- I would be so much happier if they could just ditch uPlay and move it to Steam. Probably one of the biggest problems that I have with uPlay is that when I open the ingame overlay, it freezes the game\n\nOverall, I have to recommend the game. Even though it has a lot of bad things in it, it's still a pretty damn good game for people who enjoy games like this. I had a lot of fun playing the game, even with the problems it had.\n\nSo, should you buy this game?\nYes, if.. You enjoy games like Test Drive Unlimited 2 or Driver San Francisco and you want to spend that 50€-75€ (depending on if you buy the Gold Edition or the Stock Edition + Season Pass or just the Stock Edition) on the game, but I'd recommend buying this when it's on a sale rather than paying the full price for it.\n\nNo, if.. You're into realistic racing simulators, this is not one of them.\n\nEDIT: Review updated since a lot of cons have been fixed.","January 16, 2015","true","178.2"," 148 of 245 people (60%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","60","148","245","23","10"

It was a HUGE disappointment. I swore to never buy another game at release nor while the price was at release price ($60), at least not without at least trying a demo, or even downloading a torrent. But I did it again, with The Crew. I couldn't help myself. I'm a sucker for an open world driving game... boy oh boy was it a mistake. First off you have to deal with Uplay, which is never a good thing, But I am a anti-launcher/DRM/Always online person. Second, you are always ONLINE, there is no Offline mode. Also there is no way to start over, once you start the game, make careful choices with your money and crew credits, and which cars you get, there is no going back. Oddly, though this isn't a deal breaker, the mirrors do not work... On a driving/racing game from 2014 and on, little things like mirrors, turn signals, whipers, refueling, turn engine on/off and other assortment of small eye candy should be a must, especially on a game where people will spend so much time just free driving to look at the world that has been created. I've seen a number of people "obeying" traffic laws, stopping at lights... How cool would it be to refuel, and use turn signals? Well you get none of that. Not to mention, and I know the creators of TDU made/worked on The Crew, but it mocks nearly every aspect of the TDU games aside from it's greatness. So bottom line, I played the "story" if you can call it that, took about 15-20 hours, fairly difficult if you dont have a much better car, but thats for a different discussion. Spent some time after that running hour long races for some cash, got bored and dropped the game. Went and bought TDU2 for $20 which is SOOOOOOOOOOO much better. So if you need an open world driving game, go with TDU 1 or 2 both are multitudes better than The Crew, not to mention, they are much cheaper. If The Crew were $10, I'd say go for it, but at $60 it simply is not worth it.\n\nPro's:\nDecent Graphics\nLarge map\nDecent sound\nCars look and sound good\n\nCon's:\nMissing car features such as working mirrors, turn signals ect.\nCrap Story\nCars slide everywhere\nCampaign is a bit too difficult for casual players\nUpgrade system is worthless, eg. If your Car level is 1200 and the opponents is 900, they can still keep up and pass you with sudden bursts of speed, going from 60 to 150 in an instant.... literally.\nNPC traffic pops in and out, sometimes right in front of you, causing a crash.\nNo weather system, no rain, no snow, no fog, no ice... so on.\nRequires internet and Always Online\nRequires Uplay\nPlayers tend to harrass and smash into you just... becuase I guess.\nCar handling is aweful\nLag is awful when other players are around. (no its not my internet, becuase it's freaking amazing with 126.78Mbps)\n$60 is too expensive for this game","January 11, 2015","false","103.0"," 49 of 73 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","49","73","6","0"

It manages to take the multiplayer concepts of Burnout Paradise and remove all the fun.\n\nDon't even get me started on the "police chases", what you think would be the best part of the game is actually the worst. If you think that you'll have a fun time driving up and down the US with your buddies while the cops are after you, go play an NFS title. All police chases in this game end the same way, the cops pull out infront of you, insta-stop and insta-bust you. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAwful excuse of a racing game, simply horrible. I'm sure there are better tagents and rants out there and I'm only touching on a few minor things that really ruined the game for me.\n\nThe "beta" was also a great way to generate hype while the devs did nothing.

But it does so little in the areas where it matters most that it falls short of where other existing games pass with flying colors.\n\nSure I love the visuals of the game and it plays decently well, but the focus of the game is cars and... There's quite a lack of focus in general on them. From what I can see, there's only 40 cars that you can get from dealerships yet this game has one problem that a lot of these style of games have. They tend to favour one or two manufacturers over the rest and that leaves the variety pretty thin, especially when you only have 40 cars and around 1/7th of them are Fords.\n\nAnother thing is customization. If you wanted to make awesome murals or just a silly paintjob for your ride, I got two words for you, "You can't". The customization feels like it came right from need for speed most wanted (2005) but with even less content then you would even think of. I can't even change the color of my Dodge Viper since there's only 1 color for it and it's terrible.\n\nThat's another thing. Everytime I get a racing game, I make it a personal objective to get a Dodge Viper because who doesn't strive to earn their favorite car? But I practically started off with it. You can't buy it but instead, use Uplay award points to buy it and then BAM! Instant car... I already feel like I have nothing to work towards in the game now and I only just started it...\n\nIn comparison to Test Drive Unlimited 2. This game has much greater visuals and world design and also doesn't have those annoying houses that make it take forever to manage your cars. But lacks in everywhere else like car selection veriaty, customization and pay to win mechanics. Yes, this game has paid for currency in it which you can use to buy skill points that give passive benefits to your stats or immediate access to any car.","December 2, 2014","false","25.5"," 138 of 232 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","138","232","0","1"

Some are blander than others, sometimes the trees look like big matches stuck in the ground.\nI mostly enjoy the different kitschy light situations. Sunrise, sundown, The Crew's sun always finds new ways to surprise me and to colour everything in different ways.\n\nThe MMO part, or let's say, the social component, seems like a total failure to me. I never saw anybody use the chat, unlike in TDU2, where people would often park their cars somewhere and have little group conversations that made it clear there were actual people in these cars. The only human contact I had during my 30 hours with The Crew was players trying to ram me into oblivion.\nMaybe it's my fault, but whilst TDU2 was The Sims on wheels,  The Crew seems to attract a crowd that's more into, well, driving, not chatting. That's okay, I guess.\nI enjoy driving. I wish more of my friends on Steam would take the plunge, but then again, driving around together could be very boring, I don't know?

At the moment, the multiplayer aspect of the game barely works, and ironically, forming a crew with your friends is nigh on impossible. The singleplayer is solid enough, though gathering enough cash to buy new cars is a bit tedious.\n\nEdit: As of now, the multiplayer does seem functional enough for me to edit this review. While I cannot speak for the crew aspect (since none of my friends are interested in reinstalling the game so I can test it), PvP does seem to work fairly well for the moment. However, I was disappointed in the lack of variety in some PvP races; most notably in the Perf spec races. There is only one viable car to race with, the LaFerrari, forget trying to race with anything else because you will with most certainty lose.\n\nIn the Street spec the Skyline is heavily favored, though it hardly matters what car you pick since most are fairly competitive. Sadly it is a spec that people rarely want to race with.\n\nAs for Dirt spec races the Skyline is again favored by most players, though a skilled player should be able to stay with the pack in pretty much any car, granted it has all platinum parts installed.\n\nRaid is my favorite spec, but only because most cars in that class appear to be relatively balanced. What car you choose to race with appears to matter the least in this specific spec. As long as the car you choose has all platinum parts, you should be just fine with pretty much anything.\n\nAnd finally we come to the Circuit spec, and here the car does matter. From what I have seen you have three options in this spec. The Circuit Hotrod, the DLC Cadillac Escalade (I wish that was a joke) and finally the Alfa Romeo Competizione. The Hotrod is free, so that is what I recommend you get.\n\nWhen in a PvP lobby, expect to play a lot of Circuit and Perf spec races since these appear to be the most popular. And maybe once in a blue moon, you'll get to play a Street spec race.","December 7, 2014","false","207.5"," 112 of 191 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","112","191","0","0"

I suspect they will be releasing DLC for more cars, considering they left out anything from Hennesy, Ferrari, Maserati, Bugatti and some legendary classics such as the Lambo Contach and Diablo.\n\nThe late and great Mr. Shelby is represented well as his last creation is probably one of the meanest cars available for it's specialization.\n\nThere's is a little something for every type of racer, Rally(Dirt), Street, Circuit(Traditional Races), Baja(Raid), then your borderline street legals (Perf). And all customizable according to the cars specs.\n\nCars range from the 67 Mustangs, 69 Camaros and 70's Chargers to your top end cars like Pagani, Lamborghini, Luxury Sports such as the Mercedes SLS AMGs and BMW M series even the Bentley S along with a little everything in between.\n\nThe driving simulation leaves a little to be desired, but with so much to do in the game you will barely notice it.\n\nThe Downfall to this game... Ford Explorers. They are everywhere and ready to screw you over on the turns that matter, the skills that you need gold or plat completion on for that car part you need, or in general they're just brake checking you while you're going 300 miles in your Dodge Viper SRT 10 fit for circuit racing and when you adjust to avoid, they'll be sure to change lanes into oncomming traffic so you rear end them. Also, the game unnaturally pulls you from your direction of travel at times and you need to compensate for that, which can mean over compensation and ruining your run. Public enemy #1 is still those damn Explorers.\n\nOverall 9/10","December 9, 2014","true","34.2"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","42","66","0","1"

The game offers the map of the united states in a miniscale version with open world driving of races from street cars, performance, circuits, or dirt. This isn't Test drive unlimited 3 so I will not compare it to 2 and there are certain strengths this game has and certain things it needs to work on so don't pass up on it since it is fun to play. (working on review video) and the list is a work in progress as I play the game since I am not done with this list. By the way if you're one of the ♥♥♥ that is messaging your friend to downvote the review for your own obnoxious trolling and agenda, I will let you know now that since this is a work in progress you're wasting your time with the thumbs down and I know who you are  since you've made it blatantly obvious and  I delete and reput up every update I make as I play the game and I am sick of steam not taking action against this\nAlso my reviews are final form done in video format from now on, thanks. My reviews are done about the game, not to tell you to buy it, or even that its the best game in the world nor am I payed to do this or to forcing you to buy it. I gave it a thumbs up because I had fun playing it for over 50 hours with friends and players online alike. Its to give you an insight to see if you want to buy it and play it or not.\nThis review system needs a better moderation seriously.\n\n\nPros+ Better off racing with a pad or a wheel(needs adjustment)and not keyboard, it is possible but best on either these 2 though the wheel will require a bit of adjusting in the options.\n+ This game is far more optimized than Assassin's creed unity and Farcry 4\n+ Decently good  graphics with Msaa settings cranked up if you can handle it, not the best but good.\n+ The story was decent, about 10+ hours, Revenge story what else can they do.\n+ 60 FPS gameplay is fast and furious\n+ Certain cars can be customized with kits. Street, Dirt, Performance, raid, and circuit spec for racing which is the type of spec you race at for specific regions of the united states, they seperated it into 5 different sections.\n+ The world map environment is  detailed there is so many things happening if you park your car and look around, Animals running by, Airplanes soaring past, and people walking along the streets. The immersive environment is fantastic.\n+ The skybox looks great as night and day cycle and depending on where you are located you'll see stars, the moon etc that looks aesthetically pleasing.\n+ Every car has its own interior and looks very nice and authentic though some parts aren't too great such as the dash widgets itself.\n+ Miniscale version of the u.s to drive and explore Many landmarks, events trials throughout the united states to compete in and rank the leaderboards and statistics.\n+ Handling choices such as sport, all assist, and hardcore, choose your own handling style and level.\n+ Cars upgrades as you do the trials and story mode to get the parts.\n+ You can buy the cars with CC if you don't feel like earning game cash to unlock it or you can earn game cash to unlock it,  You still have to earn the parts for the car via skills Trials etc. So your car is worthless without these trials done to earn the gear for it for it to drive faster and handle better etc.\n+ Drive all over the place using fast travel or just drive for your own entertainment, Day and night cycle occurs.\n+ Most importantly, with friends or even a crew of people to race around with this game is FUN\n+ MASSIVE CROSS COUNTRY RACE,JUST RACED FOR 2 hours in ONE race WOW!\n+ PVP and Coop Mode.\n+ Very competitive leaderboard system and trials.\n\ncons- The racing rules in this game is basically, if you lead first for a few hundred yds and do really well, noone can really beat you. The only way to win is to make a mistake at traffic or a collision turn, No matter how clean and how well you drive you'll just get outranked. There should be a system in place for those that drive clean instead of being the overpowered cars.\n- Not really a social mmo\n- Factions war online is pointless noone plays it\n- Car balance needs work\n- Online only game, Meaning your saves are online and everything else, when servers are down so is your game which sucks no offline mode at ALL!\n- The coop is lonely and not everyone accepts to help out the storyline, you can only invite friends but when it comes to randoms invite noone wants to really accept it and the chatbox feels lonely. Restricted to 8 players.\n- Engines in this game sounds bad.\n- Its a miniscale u.s many towns and city missing still as they add in more, so can be inaccurate and some people might not see things they want.\n- Limited Cars\n- No rear view mirror and side mirrors working. They really need to implement this\n- Need a better system in knowing who is racing in certain pvp lobbies across the u.s cities since its pretty massive and queing is all over the place, also finding the right quest for the pieces you need could be quite a mess\n- Lack of dynamic weather effects, Only snow in mountain.\n- Nice damage on car physics but it heals itself up like magic, ruins immersion\n- Hitting animals or people and they'll instantly dodge you like magic, some people may see this as very immersion breaking.\n- The game is about cars + parts, the better the car + parts the better you are at pvping other people basically racing against them. If you don't have a top gear car in races with level, then you will most likely get beaten. Topping out car specs and level is important to winning this makes the balance in pvp a bit unfair especially when a 500 level car will vs a 1200 rank car etc.\n- The radio music is very limited and just isn't great, I shut off the radio and play my own track the s, The soundtrack for the story though is great\n- Microtransactions to unlock cars defeats the purpose of challenge.\n- Cross country Ai are horrible.\n\nOthers and or changes via patch+-- Constantly repeating the same trial just to get the best + parts can get really daunting. The good news is you can BUY THEM once you unlock them at the garage\n+- Server situations is more stable now\n+- If you are impatient you can pay for in game cars and aesthetics but rest assured, THIS IS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME AND EVERYTHING CAN BE EARNED EASILY just pvping and doing trials etc for cash.\n+- Once again this game is created by IVORY TOWER and PUBLISHED by UBISOFT. Get the facts straight please and stop hating.\n+- Your money your cash, buy the game now or wait for price drop.","December 8, 2014","true","58.8"," 79 of 134 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","79","134","0","35"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cl1cks/recommended/241560/","cl1cks","What Button Shoots?","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cl1cks/","146 products in account","My experience so far is that while still a fun game it seems that everything done with the cars is done wrong. When I played the beta I just kept telling myself "it's just a beta." Boy was I wrong. Let tell you of my frustrations as well as what needs to be updated.\n\n-The car selection seems like someone obsessed with American muscle as well as DuPont catalogs. I don't want to street race in Ferrari and koinsegg (spelling). While I understand a few of these cars in the game it seems stupid for half the roster of a street racing game to be these kinds of cars. And there are 2-3 versions of old and new muscle. We have about 3-4 actual tuners to play with. Who made this car selection?\n\n-Pre-order bonus. Well I pre ordered the game for the Mini Cooper personally. Because I own one in real life. Was horrified to see that the pre order cars can only be used in street spec. Making them utterly useless.\n\n-The specs oh oh the specs. Advertised your game to be able to switch out specs on our cars on the fly for different race types. Reality sets in when you realize only a handful of starter cars can do every spec as well as only 1 truck having dirt spec. I'll say that last part again, only ONE truck in the game has dirt spec. Even the Hummer doesn't have a dirt spec. Once again WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. Is this a bug?!!!!!\n\n-Customization. If you thought the crew was gonna have the best customization since need for speed underground, then you better go back to your ps2. Customization is nonexistant. Besides a decent variety of paint and rims that's about it. Roughly 4 bumpers which are really just variations of the first 2, no trim paint options, no sticker color options, no painting of rims, no underglow, no ride height, no anything really. Watching your car be pulled apart while you customize it is merely a visual to make you think you have options. When in reality it needs some major work.\n\nOnce again I will say this isn't a terrible game as the map was done really well and the game play is fun. But this is a story line based on street racing games and there isn't much street racing in the vehicles. Failed to capture that culture making it sub par in the end. So many details missed and little to no focus on the cars. Already the season pass promising more half million dollar cars instead of cars we asked for that are commonly found in street racing. I would rather see generic copy cats like the rx7, honda civic, Subaru sti and so on then have named car brands of crap nobody wants to use. You only need 1 mustang in a game not 15 versions of it.","August 28, 2014","false","28.4"," 37 of 58 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","37","58","0","0"

The idea is that the game is always online. Any time you play it you will be able to see other people and even CO-OP with them.\n\nSo is it better than NFS Rivals? Two words: Hell yes! It is better optimized for the PC, more customzation, and it has an actual story line.\n\nSome people are complaining that the map is not big enough. Well think about it - Fitting thousnds of miles/kilometers of roads and hundreds of cities into a game is pretty damn hard. Not to mention that if they did so, you'll probably get a game that will weigh over 100 GB's, and probably won't run on most PC's. So they took the best of what there is, and put it in the game.\n\nMy only complain is that the game lacks some cars, for exmaple: Subaru Impreza WRX STI, or Toyota Supra. I expected to have those cars in a street racing game. I truely hope they add these cars sometime.\n\nAnd another thing, and this is aimed towards people, not the game itself: You complain about unrealistic physics in an ARCADE RACING game?! Are you serious?! An Arcade Racing game is supposed to have unrealstic physics.\n\nIf you're looking for sims: Go for something like Assetto Corsa. Because this is not a Sim. This is an ARCADE RACING game.","March 16, 2015","true","121.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

Before I hadn't done much adjusting of the settings but now that I have I can deifnitely confirm the handling is fine just the defaut handling gets you off to a bad start.\n\nI now have a 1299 car of all but Raid spec which is much harder to grind the parts on. There are certian cars for certain races. Races in the Mountain range on snowy roads are better in a Ford Focus than a Ford Mustang.\n\nThe game has alot going for it but they really need to work on expanding the Map maybe DLC's that add more cities into the map would be a quality start.\n\nThey really need to work hard on more cars ASAP there are tons of cars that could be added to this game that would really give it a lot more life. Not everyone wants a Ferrari or Lamborghini and while the Koenigsegg Agera R is an awesome car it's just not realistic to use on a US map.\n\nCar models I'd love to see added to the game would be more upper class but not super cars. Lexus, Audi, Cadillac and Acura. There are just a lot of cars left out that the game really needs.\n\nI really enjoy the game and there is nothing that would make me quit playing it. Weekly missions in game need to happen more often and there should be some type of end game which right now the only end game is racing other players.","August 28, 2014","true","242.2"," 51 of 88 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","51","88","0","0"

At first the game was really fun and seem to have a lot of potential. once you hit the max level you can  pvp, do 1hour+ long faction missions and free roam. The faction missions aren't that fun to do and are basicly made pointless when you can easily send friends out to (not actual friends they send and ai) to do the faction mission for you. Pvp is ok but needs to have a lot more game modes. The free roam is fun but I end up driving in the same areas seeing as how most of the map is either highways or ai filled citys. The offroading is a lot more fun than the on road seeing as how you can either go onto the dirt roads or make your own "roads" with the raids spec. One issue with the game is that getting any car in the game is as easy as just farming a few pvp missions or sending friends on faction missions, even getting the hidden cars isn't satisfying at all.  Another issue is that the so called fixes they have implemented into the game dont seem to fix much, a lot of the performance improvements to some of the rear wheel drive cars dont actually improve anything. Car customization is great and all but what I would rather have is a system more like forza horizon 2 where I can swap engines, buy diffrent parts for the car, body parts that actually affect the performance instead of just looking cool. The games car progression system compared to horizons is very dull, all you do is find a few jump challenges that are easy to do with the car you are using and just sit there farming for a few hours till you have a max level car. I am going to end here, there is a lot more I could talk about but this review is already long.\n\ntl;dr: The game is fun but lacks in certain game mechanics. Its also very boring once you realise how easy it is to get the most expensive car. patchs dont fix much.\n\nIf you want something better save your money and buy something more along the lines of project cars or if you own an xbox buy horizon 2 there is a larger car selection and you can properly tune cars. Although I did have fun with the game I would much rather have horizon 2 where I can basicly tune the tyres, gearing, springs, damping and all that good stuff. Again there are more things I could talk about but I dont want to make this any longer than it is.\n\nEdit: Another issue that I really wanted to mention is the car variety is very little and the dlcs only add 3 cars each.","March 8, 2015","false","135.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Skill challenges, Races in PvE and PvP and now including The Summit with stunts and freedrive challenges in it's latest expansion. In return however, the game has so many pet peeves that can bother a player to stop playing forever. Like a finish line delay that could lose you some seconds while playing with people outside your region, the ability to exploit some obstacles to gain seconds and a slightly messed up balance between vehicles.\n\nPeople hope for the best experience in every little aspect of the game, but The Crew is so massive that it can not offer this. As a result, The Crew does just about average in everything. You're not supposed to like The Crew because of sounds, amount of cars, customization, graphics or handling specifically. It expects you to like the wide selection of literally everything it has. Would it do better for players liking specific feats if the game chooses to minimize it's offers? Yes. You'll leave other people disappointed however. It's up to the developers to offer the best experience out of everything it has. You can see they 'slowly' improve on some stuff, but with each pro comes it's cons.\n\nI like The Crew because of it's variety and I try to look through the well-known pet peeves to enjoy an actual fun game. So far I think I'm doing a good job at it.\n\nShould you buy The Crew, the Season Pass, the Wild Run expansion or anything named together for the full price? No. Wait for a 50% discount. This will cause you less annoyance, but still have a jolly good time in a fun open-world racing game.","December 6, 2015","true","232.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

The map is split into five regions: The Midwest, East Coast, Mountain States, West Coast, and The South. Each region has its own unique geographical features. Six main cities (one in each region, two in The Midwest) are featured in the game: Detroit and Chicago in the Midwest, New York City on the East Coast, Miami in The South, Las Vegas in the Mountain States, and Los Angeles on the West Coast. Various other cities, such as San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Dallas, New Orleans, Washington D.C., and St. Louis, are also featured in the game. Over thirty smaller cities and towns line the countryside like Nashville, Norfolk and others. It takes approximately 45 minutes in real time to drive from coast to coast in-game. The single-player campaign is 20 hours long, and entails infiltrating criminal groups with protagonist Alex Taylor (Troy Baker). Players can also participate in mini-games called skills challenges that are peppered across the world. They are triggered when a player drives through them and it involves completing challenges such as weaving through gates and staying as close to a racing line as possible for a period of time. Players' scores are automatically saved so friends can try and beat their scores, in similar fashion to how Autolog works in games of the Need for Speed franchise. Missions can be played alone, with friends, or with online co-op matchmaking. The multiplayer mode lets a maximum of eight players to compete in races and other gametypes. There are no in-game loading screens or pauses.","October 10, 2015","true","26.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The story is rather enjoyable for a racing game and it is an adult level story not some dumbed down kids friendly story that makes me want to cry (Test Drive 2 im looking at you), The cars handle well for what they are and upgrading does actually make the cars feel better to drive.\n\nCons- (ohboiherewego.jpg) Welp this game does have its fair share of cons so far. The whole name of the game is the crew, which is funny conisdering me and my friends cant join each others crews, and the fact most of the time you are playing you never see anyone else driving around, and teleporting to friends to see them doesnt help because they never show up on your screen. Another con would be the huge lack of support with these problems and how none of the devs seems to care about the connections problems (Which isnt good considering this game is apparently an mmo, and an mmo with connection issues isnt a good thing). The last few cons would be gameplay based, the other ai racers in this game are either so stupid they drive into rivers or they are so rediculously op that they cant be caught even by the best of drivers in the best of cars, and the last con would be im having a problem where the game seems to take control of the car and ♥♥♥♥ you up at the worst of times.\nFinal thought: Even with this extensive amount of cons i would still reccommend this game as the majority of these cons will be fixed within the next few days (hopefully) and the game is rather enjoyable otherwise.","December 3, 2014","true","44.1"," 91 of 164 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","91","164","0","0"

It let me play it but fps would drop frequently. Fast foward to 2016 and a used gaming pc running GTX 550I and i got NO ISSUES with the game.\n\nEver since I began playing it on a desktop computer with a real graphics card i haven't had time to play anything else let alone watch some anime. Ended up completing the campeign within 2 weeks durring my free time and i must say i love it! I even bought a xbox one controller with usb cord to play the game--and it plays superb with the controller. The wheel has mixed reviews but its not for everyone, i know that sometime this year i will for sure buy a wheel/peddle combo for this game.\n\nThe custimization of the cars is handled well withe the fact that when you make it to level 50, you gain the opportunity to earn more custimzation such as more front bumpers or more rims.\n\nPVP is fun as well however if one player has bad internet connection it will interupt the game for a few seconds only as the match reconnects everyone.I do not ( i have googlefiber) so I always hope that whenever i enter pvp lobby that everyone has decent internet.\n\nNow that my storyline is done i had a day where i wasn't sure what to do but then i remembered the wild run expansion and the endless possiblities (until this time i had focused on campeign) and now im pumped again!\n\nThe updated graphics were a must for the game and now that they have done that  i do say all the landscape looks amazing! I'm getting the Wild run expansion and i can't wait to drive a monster trick up the side of a mountain or thru las vegas :P\n\nEver since i finished the campeign i have been planning on what story to write as i continue to play 'The Crew'. Whatever story i choose to write and drive thru i will sure as hell have hours upon hours of fun!\n\nWho knows maybe if i end up driving and writing the story i might publish it as a fanfic :P but thats months away i bet!\n\nConclusion:\nThe crew was good at release but since the Wild Run Expansion and upgradted graphics mainly, it has gotten far better than I could have imagined. Granted there are still some hiccups such as the pvp lobby intrupting gameplay (pausing it for 5 seconds) if a player has pretty bad internet connection. Otherwise they have worked hard on improving the game since release. An Xbox One Controller works great with the game and i can't imagine myself playing it on a keybored ever again! (unless i didn't have access to a controller!)\n\nEven though on steam this game has alot of mixed reviews i hope we as a gaming community can give this game the support it could use to really inspire the developers to greater hights with this game. The potential of it is without limits. Let's hope they never stop adding to this wonderful game.\n\noh yeah, and its fun!\n","May 9","true","123.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Don't look at those "Mixed" reviews. Like 80% of negative reviews are like "I pre-ordered The Crew + Season Pass and got no Wild Run DLC, clear scam." Maybe, however I was smarter and just waited for the first steam sale. And there I go. After one and a half year, where the game was quite advanced I finnaly got my sale.\nThe Crew Wild Run Edition for 30€.\n\nNow time for the actual review. The game has a decent storyline. The only thing that disappointed me, is it's linearlity. It is really linear, you genrally can't change anything, there are no decisions. For example I think that SPOILER ALERT:  You should have a choice of either killing Shiv or getting him caught by the police.\nGameplay is great, PVP pays-off extremely and has some justice in it. For example, when you or someone other in the race have a lag, the game waits for you/him.\nI also think that there should be more Radio Stations and more tracks in them. Option to add your own radio stations like from GTA 3 Upwards should be supported two.\nGraphics are beautiful, car decorating options are great too.\n\nAn overall of 8,9/10 for me, good job Ubisoft, one of your best productions...","March 2","true","60.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There are little graphical and gameplay quirks that happen here or there, such as the cockpit view getting a little glitchy past 200mph, and annoying car resets after what should have been seamless, on the fly missions that place you exactly where you were, but stopped. Not to mention, the server system seems a little flaky.  One second, I am online with a dozen players, and after completing a mission, I am completely alone. However, this is a brand new release, and with Ubi marketing this as more of an MMO, I'm holding out hope that those things will be taken care of in the future.\n\nThose hangups aside, the game has proven to be quite enjoyable. Physics wise, on road car handling almost reminds me of the good old days of the 1st Need For Speed: Most Wanted. Perhaps, just a little grittier, but fun nonetheless. In my honest opinion, off the road is where this game really shines, though. For anyone who's played the game FUEL, off road vehicle handling should feel awfully familiar to you. I was excited to hear that a few devs from the FUEL team worked on this game, and you can certainly notice the influence they had.\n\nAs far as gameplay? Missions aren't all that much to talk about, none are particularly outstanding, but they pace them well, and I've yet to get bored. Car customization was not nearly as in-depth as I had hoped, which is dissapointing. Certain cars can't even be modded in ways that would seem to make sense. For example, you cannot take a Ford Raptor truck, and convert it into the rally car / prerunner - esque "Raid" type. Meanwhile, feel free to do that to your Nissan Z! The whole MMO aspect, I'm not so sure of yet... mainly because it doesn't seem to be working correctly yet.\n\nIn short, the game has a LOT of potential, and I'm enjoying it so far despite it's quirks. However, there are some improvements that are needed to make this game really shine.","December 4, 2014","true","22.9"," 65 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","65","117","0","0"

Another blatant cash grab by Ubisoft. Ubisoft deserves to go bankrupt at this point. I would be okay with this game if it weren't for the process used to level up your cars. You need to do challenges to gain better parts, but the reward system is an ubelievable level of stupid. Rewards are randomized so it doesn't matter if you barely scraped out a platinum or absolutley crushed the challenges. What you're gonna get is complete chance.

The map is so much fun to explore just beacause of the simple fact that you can just drive right off the road at any point and blaze your own path to the next goal/start point/car dealership/whatever you may be wanting to drive to.

There are also alot of cars with awesome classes and tuning, from stock to circuit, 5 classes in total. There are cars, pickup trucks and so on. (Season pass gives even more) Map is quite living, with citizens walking in cities and animals living in wild, trains move, aircraft, alot of traffic vehicles, emergency vehicles on duty and so on. Story is quite interesting, but little, but after finishing it, there are also alot of skills to do... and then awards (Each class of awards done gives you special nr plate). There are also landmarks, what locate an historical building or place with quick review of it from real life, i really liked to do these.

The selling point was obviously the fact that the map is a scaled version of the United States, and good grief is it amazing.\n\nFor what it is, it has plenty of detail (and now looks stunning as well thanks to the update) and nothing will beat the road trips you take solo or with friends, perhaps strangers on the road also playing their own game (so to speak because its a quick drop in/out lobby system for lack of a better phrase) between the various states. Putting my phone on a speaker dock next to me, setting up my Logitech DFGT, turning off the HUD, going to cockpit view and cruising along the freeways at night is just so wonderful I can't even describe it. And it's not short road trips either, getting across the states will take an actual hour or 2, maybe more, depending on the route. Super easy to lose time in this game like that.\n\nSpeaking of, car physics. It's pretty arcadey, but everyone expected that (right?). They've definitely improved it since launch and its fine to play now for the most part IMHO.\n\nCustomization is handled pretty well. The UI could with quality-of-life tweaks but the modding of each vehicle it self is pretty well fleshed out (looking at you, NFS 2015). Should be noted, that all the vehicles do not have all the specs available to them. You can imagine my disappointment to the lack of a raid Murcielago :( still, Fiat 500 Monster Truck.\n\nMusic selection in this game is nice, didn't agree with a few songs but hey, I just play my own while playing now so. Car selection is also pretty good.\n\nI cannot speak much for the events and the Wild Run exclusive "Summit", but I hear good things. PVP races are prone to being glitchy occasionally (maybe they fixed this now, can't tell for sure) but they have definitely balanced the vehicles you can use for the races now as compared to pre-Wild Run (the LaFerrari was the go to car if you wanted any chance at winning for example in the Perf-spec), so thank you devs!\n\nSo there you go, my thoughts on The Crew. Would 100% recommend if you love cruising around the USA.","May 7","true","32.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","1"

This was a huge let down in many aspects. While i try my best to focus on the good of the game ( will be stated lower down), from time to time i find my self regretting the fact that i went against my instincts to not buy the game ( reason being deep down i felt like this game would be a total let down after ACU: Assasin creed Unity reviews).\n\nPros( may or may not state all)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+Huge map\n+driving never really feels repetitive unless doing specific races\n+open world\n+fun skill challenges, races, and faction races\n+being able to make crews between friends and or people you don't know ( Chance to make friends online).\n+Earning money is not a struggle therefore buying cars aren't a headache\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons ( to many to list)\n\n-Crew are limited to only 4 people\n\n-very low car selection from since launch\n\n-Car modeling is sub par for a next gen game\n\n-Street cars and circuit cars have a fetish for driving offroad\n\n-when turning corners in any class of car, it feels like you're slamming the vehicle to the left/right\n\n-driving dirt cars feel like you're constantly drifiting on ice\n\n-not much to do with friends besides races, missions and more races just pvp this time\n\n-Story line is a little to predictable ( not a deal breaker)\n\n-driving against AI constantly feels like the game is trying to recreate a movie scene where the race ends in NECK&NECK\n-IF MY CAR HAS A RATING OF 900+ THERE IS NO REASON OR SENSE FOR AI CARS RATED AS 600 AND BELOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.\n\n-Cop chases feel like you're car weighs 5 lbs and the cop cars have the wieght of an Airbus A380 jumbo Jet. when they hit you, you're car gains the speed of a bullet and goeing into the direction you're hit too, how ever when you hit the cop car that looks like it can be taken down easily, u still gain the speed of a bullet and fly into the opposite direction you hit the car into.\n\n-Cop cars that aren't exotic or have have the potential to go past 200MPH should NOT be keeping up with my Lambo. thats is Blazing by on the highway @ 245MPH. I swear, this game makes police chases feel as if some of the cop vehicles have magnetic propulsion systmes in them.\n\n-Graphics needs to be boosted up ( a bit apauling for a next gen game)\ni also felt like more effort were placed into using shaders and other techniques to mask the bad graphics.\n\n-For a game that has such a huge scale map, the entire world feels empty to some extent; eg: the only place civilians are prevalant are in medium to large cities in states such as like NY, LA and Illanois. And despite their presence in these locations, their numbers are outstandingly low leaving a feeling of deserted city with just civilian vehicles going in and out of.\n\n-THE DRIVING PHYSICS, HANDLING & everything else involved with the movement of cars are ABSOLUTLY APPAULING. ( driving games like NFS underground feels alot more bearable than this in my honest opinion. countless times while driving circuit cars, i begin to get the feeling like im driving my car on ice when moving at high speeds (it feels like im moving a lamborghini at rocket speeds on ice while trying to stare).\n\n-Accident situations are just wacky. by that i mean if i get careless while racing and make a mistake, and go offcourse i just have to hold B on the controller and i will respawn OR sometimes when im 150 mph+ & i am about to hit a tree or a car i sometimes just slide to the side like nothing was there. If im not lucky that happnes then i must endure a mandetory cutscene of my crash that sometimes happens in the wierdest ways. (cutscene can be skipped once 1 or 2 seconds have passed its bearable).\n\n-The speed of the cars are just all over the place. exotic cars can have the tendancy to bearly feel different ater leveling them up to 1299 ( max level ) in their respective classes ie street, dirt, raid & Circuit. for example. i bought a lamborghini Mercealago after spending some time doing races, the car top speed in full stock was 219MPH , currently i have leveled the car up to 1230, the max speed i have reached with this car is 249 MPH with NOZ blowing out the exhaust pipes like the mouth of a dragon.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are much more CONS, however you the reader should get an idea by now.\nIn conclusion i felt completly let down by this game. i haven't bought a racing game since the new NFS most wanted was released in 2012. I Thought Ubisoft was going to really dilever on this game but i was WAY out of the ball park with my expectations. I was fooled by the CG Trailors of the game they were releasing to hype this game up. To me there is limited fun to have in this game so therefore i will not recommend this game to anyone as of this moment unless this game undergoes heavy amounts of fixing.","January 23, 2015","false","36.6"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","24","40","7","2"

That said once you learn how to play, this game is amazing.\n\n'The Crew' reminds me of my beloved racing game Gran Turismo, but much better and with traffic, an open world and random weather.  I played Gran Turismo 1-5, I'm familiar with the game and engine, this game is most definately built off the same platform.  The vehicle modifaction system has been changed and the game has a story with a plot as well as being massively multiplayer.  You're allowed to play all the game's different modes in a "Crew" or a 4 man team of your friends.\n\nWhen you start out you have a choice of cars available at the Detroit car dealer.  As you unlock the game by beating story missions, there are 5 car dealerships and 1 motorcycle dealership.  I recomend starting with either the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z as they have several different specs the vehicles can be tuned to.  Much like Gran Turismo the vehicles are rated based on what 'The Crew' calls vehicle levels or Gran Turismo players know as performance points.\n\nThere are several different spec's a full stock car can be tuned to.  The game comes with 5 specs.  To unlock 'extreme specs' you need to purchase the 'Wild Run' upgrade.\n\nStandard Specs:\n1 - Street\n2 - Dirt\n3 - Performance\n4 - Raid\n5 - Circuit\n\nWild Run 'Extreme' specs:\nA - Monster Truck\nB - Drift\nC - Drag\nand a new vehicle type: Motorcycles... which kick ♥♥♥ by the way.\n\nEach spec a vehicle is tuned to can level up by unlocking parts via challenges, game missions or PVP events thus increasing it's performance point rating.  1299 is the max vehicle level/performance point rating available at this time.\n\nAs you complete missions new areas unlock, new vehicle specs and new vehicles are available.\n\nThe best way to earn money, rep and league points is to PVP.  It's by far the best way to earn money and rep.  You compete against other players based on how much you play, not how well you finish in races.  You have a choice of 5 PVP factions you can join.  The wolves, the snakes, the gators, the eagles, and some other faction that isn't memorable.  Your rep is compared to the rep of the other players in your faction.  If you have the highest rep in your faction, you're the boss and get a base salary of $150,000 per day.  If you're not the highest paid player, like most people, you fall somewhere in the middle.  Underboss = $100,000 daily, Street Boss = $60,000, Lieutenant = $30,000, Thug = $10,000.  I don't remember what Gangsta pays, but it isn't much, maybe $5,000 daily??  Yes finishing in 1st place pays better, but the difference between 1st and 8th isn't much.  The Devs encourage people to PVP with this system.  Traffic and collisions can be turned off to enhance your gaming experience.  Every player in the PVP lobby gets to choose what map they would like to race on.  Then based on what the players chose (5 players, 5 maps) the computer randomly selects one of the maps all of the players in the lobby chose and then everyone races on that map.  You can PVP solo or with a crew (4 man team).\n\nTo start I recomend the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z.  Both of these cars can be tuned to Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance or Circuit which is why I recomend them.  Money is tight early on in the game.\n\nMy recomended cars/bikes:\n\nStreet: KTM 450, Nissan GTR, 2015 Mustang Fast Back\nDirt: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, Hummer\nRaid: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, Buggy, Hummer\nPerformance: Ford GT, Mclaren F1, Pagani Huayra, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000RR, Ferrari 458 Special\nCircuit: Ford GT, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000rr, Ferrari 458 Special","February 10","true","485.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I have made 3 great new friends in the past 2 days from playing this game. Having people to play/cooperate/compete with makes this game so much fun, and you will always try to beat each-others records on trials and watch their tail during races. It is co-op, so if the objective is (for example that we found) to, say, finish 3rd or higher, and only one person in the event achieves it, you all get rewarded. I usually am the brute in our Crew, I drive a Dirt or Street spec'd Ford Raptor. I will keep the AI drivers at bay by ramming and cutting them off, and my friends will use their Skyline or Charger to win the race(Though the Raptor can perfectly keep up if I want!). We all have a role that we use to emerge victorious as a group, and the game really rewards teamwork.\n--\nThere is so much I would like to write about, but I am tired (from playing so long). The driving isn't Asetto Corsa level, but if you want to have a blast driving, this game does it. I have had some times where the others went off line, and I just drove, and drove, and drove, and went to the coast, traveled to the mountains and hot-swapped for my Dirt-spec ride and tore up the ground all the way down the mountain.\n--\nIf you have a steering wheel with force feedback, The Crew uses every ounce of it. I was a beta tester, and I was surprised that they had full support for my wheel, the Logitech Driving Force GT. It's not a mainstream wheel, it was designed for the PS3, but it works on PC with 900 degrees of rotation and force feedback. All the buttons work, I have not had to tweak anything. It just, WORKED.\n--\nAsk me anything you like in the comments, I would be happy to answer questions you have about the game.","December 2, 2014","true","65.2"," 56 of 101 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","56","101","0","3"

Not only that, it's sometimes just beautiful to look at as I've been guilty of just driving slow and looking around at the incredible world that Ivory Tower built.\n\nThis game really shines when you are racing along the world in the drivers seat view, I switch when I need to but being In the drivers seat is where its at for me.\n\nI say this game is well worth the money.

This has basically put my most of the way through the campaign.  My background with the game started earlier this summer when I got invited into the closed beta.  (Played about 6-8 hours)  The very first problem with this game is that you can't just use steam, on top of steam you have to use UPlay(Only works about half the time and takes forever to get into the game)  The next problem is that once you get into the game (assuming you have an internet connection) it tends to be rather buggy.  There seems to be an issue with optimization because my computer is rather capable and more than meets the minimum and recommended specs.  As with most AAA titles lately if you have AMD hardware you definitely need to beware  (my laptop with Nvidia hardware runs the game much better)  The main problem seems to be around the cities(Lots of buildings and poor optimization).  All in all this fits together to be a rather poor title but the one thing that keeps nagging me is the physics of the game itself.  I could probably get past the online all the time (Wasn't explicitly stated that you have to be) or even the sometimes poor framerates.  But the poor and might I add inconsistent physics and handling between cars is terrible.  Now I can personally say that I have never driven most of the vehicles in-game, but last time I checked a 600-900 horse Ferrari should be able to drift much better than an off-road Chevy Silverado(Actually have driven this).  However this is not the case all the muscle cars that people have been sliding around for years and years are impossible to drift.  The only game mode that seems remotely realistic is that of circuit racing.  I wasn't expecting this to be Forza Motorsport realistic but I at least expected it to feel something like Dirt 3 or Grid (Something sim-cadeish).  Finnally about the physics we are looking at the terrible bug where sometimes you will be cruising along and hit the same curb or patch of dirt you have hit 100 times with no consequence and now all of a sudden you are tossed into the air and are placed miles behind your competitor.  All in all I am extremely dissapointed with the crew as I have been waiting for a U.S. playground for cars for years.  Guess I am still waiting.","January 21, 2015","false","25.0"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","21","35","3","0"

This is well worth your money if you intend to play with friends online and like a massive map of the USA to drive around but if you want a hardcore racer to post times and compete against mates then this will only annoy you.\nPretty Good Game but could have been much better.","December 11, 2014","true","186.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I am currently level 27 and still exploring the first of 5 regions (more about that later). Why is it fun?\n\nThe Crew has a huge map, a huge number of difficult races and skill challenges, reasonable AI, the longest races I have ever seen in a computer game, a varied selection of cars right from the start, and a good system for levelling up cars, doing PvP, and doing co-op PvE with or without friends. It is a bit of a cross between FUEL (its game world is bigger, but emptier) and NFS:World (which has a more crowded MMO-feeling, but is pay2win and not as social). It has Burnout Paradise's ability to initiate challenges right in the game world without going to an instance, so you may be driving along and see a car flying through the air because you're passing a jump challenge and someone's doing it; or see everyone else's police pursuits (join in if you like).\n\n\nThe level cap is at 50, there are 5 regions, you can go anywhere at any time, but the events and cars of a new region unlock every 10 levels. So in theory, since my main focus is still the first region (Mid-West - of course you start in Detroit), I shouldn't be over level 10, upgrading my car with level 1-10 parts won from skill challenges available in that region, and generally having a good time; and I should be able to level out of that region by following the storyline missions, if I like, which I probably am. But the game also provides other ways to level up: you can grind story missions (even accidentally, if you want to improve your score from bronze to gold; and the game also makes you, because other player will invite you on coop runs - of course you can decline), you can do faction missions once you are level 10 (out of curiosity), or you can do PvP (a dozen races was enough to get me from level 21 to 27). This will unlock other car types (good) and the parts sets that come with the level (bad, because I now could just buy me all level 20 parts for my car and skip the East Coast region altogether, and with a bit more PvP, skip the South, too). Maybe The Crew should have taken a slice from GuildWars, where you're a) PvP-ready from the beginning with competitive gear (but you can use your own high-end PvE gear as well), and b) levels and player capabilities are adjusted on the fly depending on the level of the region you're in so that co-op works well.\n\nRight now, I exercise some restraint and explore and do the skill challenges and the exploration anyway, and the nice thing about The Crew is that even though my cars are somewhat overpowered for the zone (what with the stat boost levelling up gives them -- why, exactly?), the challenges are still tough to get golden. At the rate I'm going, there'll be many more hours of fun in this game.\n\n\nIf I could do it over, I would play each story mission only once and stay away from anything social (PvP, Factions, co-op) until level 40 at least. Recommended.","February 2, 2015","true","110.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","0"

All vehicle handles nearly the same, with more or less understeer. Gearbox is odd, and slow while shifting/down shifting, handbraking is slow. On road, cars rarely spin out, but when pushing them to the limit, the cars will throw the rear end out, but refusing to turn. There are three modes of driving: All Assistance, Sport, Hardcore. All assistance would include ABS, Traction, steering stability, etc. Hardcore has less traction and less steering stability. Drifting is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on keyboard, but manageable on Sport and Hardcore mode.\n\nTuning is simplified and a lot easier for the general audience, nothing too complicated. Parts are found during runs and story events, Gold, Silver, Bronze, each adding x amount of additional car level. Level cap for players is at 50. Level caps for cars are at 1299.\n\nFrom a car enthusiast point of view, for those who just wants to collect and drive the cars, and tune (not in-depth tuning), this game is great. Graphics are beautiful, damages to the vehicle is mildly realistic, environment is great. You wont be able to run over people though, just like that in Driver San Francisco, they would jump away with Level 9001 reflex skills. Engine sound effects on the cars come close to that of real cars, but only when not in cutscenes. Engine sounds from cutscenes souds like that of a muscle car, V6/V8. Collecters will still need to play the game and some events to make money, in order to mod the car. Game is Pay to Win or Play to Win.\n\nThe R34 GT-R is left hand drive, which does not exist, and makes the petrolhead in me heartbroken.\n\nThe Street Car upgrade in game gives a wheel (rim) which resembles 5Zigen Noir, which makes the Purist in me cry. Other recognizable brand of wheels (for those who care) includes: BBS (:D), HRE (:D), ROTA (D:), Volk Racing (:D) and of course, Original Equipment Manufacterer (OEM) wheels.\n\nAll Street Cars are stock height, which makes me Iacrophobic.\n\nGame cannot be played with no internet connection, from what I've seen.\n\nBest part about the game is that they have a replica Pike's Peak Uphill/Downhill sprint run in the Midwest. Very fun to do a tandem drifting run up/down with a friend.\n\nRate Game 6/10. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. Definitely recommend for car lovers. Definitely a great game to go cruising around with friends and racing around town.","December 18, 2014","true","22.3"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","46","83","0","0"

It combines the fantastic customization options of Need For Speed: Underground with the thrill of the high speed chases of Hot Pursuit, as well as including more serious racing environments for fans of series like Forza and Gran Turismo, and even putting heavy focus on rallycross and extreme offroad racing.\n\nThe storyline (at least as much of it that was included in the beta) was interesting the whole way through, even if it seemed like it was lacking in dialogue every now and then. The Crew offers a break away from the typical racing game storylines while still keeping you in the spirit of racing the whole time.\n\nThe open world is enormous and has a lot of exploration and events to offer. The beta version included only the United States map, and I only had time to explore from Chicago to the east (and not even all of the east!). I don't know how much of the rest of the world will be included in the full release, but I am eager to find out come November.\n\nAll in all, I give the game a SOLID 9/10.

It isn't a racing simulator, so don't expect full realism while in the driver' seat, but what you get in terms of handling is more than enough to enjoy the fun. Simply put: there's a fair background story, many cars, a gazillion of races and an explorable map that is the whole U.S.A. territory; all of this is what makes The Crew a very good arcade racing game. Sometimes, though, the arcade model becomes too evident (yes, Raid-spec "smuggling runs"... while also some PvP events...), but all in all this is an experience worth trying, especially if you plan to play it using a racing wheel set like the Logitech G27 (fully supported).

These games were expensive and not good as they look like. I was thinking about how worse Ubisoft can be, but even though I have these thoughts, still I made no prejudgement and watched stream on steam, talked with some friends about buying and forming our crew, and there I am driving across USA from East Coast to West Coast while feeling freedom and joy. The Crew is awesome.\nI was a racing-game lover when I was a kid. Played Midtown Madness, Most Wanted a lot and  loved those games. And here, in The Crew , gives me that joy. You can free ride all over the Usa, discover hidden car parts that unlocks a hidden car ( each from different regions ) or landscapes and antennas , similar to Creed Franchise. Then you can do challenges to receive car upgrades to increase your car level just like in MMO's , and the best part? Forming your own crew and driving together. I hope Ubisoft won't ruin this game and keep it updated with new cars, new stuff.

THIS is how Need for Speed should have been for 10 years and counting (talking about NFSU and NFSU2 as best in the series, don't get me wrong). THIS is what modern racing games should aspire to. THIS is an example of a great "racing" game campaign (you don't get to play only racing missions, but also takedown, escape, time attack, contrabands and so on). THIS is an example of a good open-world game concept, as you're always busy with something, there's no such thing as boredom in this game, only if you're low on imagination.\n\nThe bugs? They're pretty minor and unnoticeable at the moment of release. You can see a deer stuck in some fences, whatever. There's no game without bugs and here's nothing preventing you from playing.\n\nThe graphics? They're good. I don't mind calling them great as they perfectly fit a strong 2014 game engine. There are enough graphics options, and also do not think that the game is locked to 30 FPS. We can also expect graphics mods in the future.\n\nThe PC performance? Not bad, I must admit. The system requirements are pretty "fair", but whatever, even a low-mid spec laptop can beat this game on low settings. I didn't experience any sort of stuttering, FPS drops, all this kind of stuff.\n\nThe handling? Feels good to me. You can say it's bad if you played any other good handling games, but you easily get used to the car handling. Might sound funny, but in cockpit view it feels even better to me.\n\nBuy the game and don't mind about the cons, you won't get disappointed.","December 6, 2014","true","99.7"," 89 of 166 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","89","166","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/recommended/241560/","toxic_fuel","Toxic Fuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/","123 products in account","I followed this game for quite a while before it came out. I was super psyched for a racing game with car customization in an open world, something Need for Speed has not done for a while now. However, I will admit that once it came out, I never really heard anything about it. It seems like I basically forgot. Then, a friend of mine got it and I ended up buying it on sale. Clearly, as you can see from my hours, I really have enjoyed this game. However, it has some serious quirks to it, and they aren't necessarily good. So, here's what I enjoyed about The Crew, and not so much.\n\nPROS:\nThe Open World - I didn't realize just how big the map was until I really got into this game. It has, by far, the largest map out of any racing game I have played. I cannot compare it to FUEL simply because I have not played it, but it is bigger than every NFS game. And best of all? The map is not repetitive. You can drive from the swamps of the south to the deserts in the west, and have different scenery and small towns/cities in between. It mainly revolves around 5 major cities, and they are New York, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, and L.A. The developers certainly did their homework when it comes to the cities, and I applaud them for it. Even after 260 hours of gameplay, I still see places on the map I have not been, making the open world my favorite part of the game, by far.\n\nPvP - I find that the PvP is well done. You play in a lobby with up to 8 players at a time, who all choose exactly what event they want to do, and then the game randomly picks one of them. This includes events with any of the 5 specs. Some events are elimination, others regular races, and others a "king of the hill" type game. What's even better is the amount of in-game money you get from PvP. Even if you get last place, you still get nearly just as much money as the person in first, and this can make it enjoyable for anyone that plays. PvP is the best way to make money, currently. However, it still does matter what place you get, since there are PvP ranks in the game. The higher you place, the faster you rank up.\n\nThe Graphics - Towards the end of 2015, a free update brought in new, updated graphics along with a weather system, which also includes slick roads after rain. This is all much better than before. Unfortunately, my lower-end GPU cannot handle max graphics, however, that is not to say that the game still looks very nice on High. It now looks more like a game released this year. Also props for it being a completely free update!\n\nCar Selection - You can have (almost) anything, from a LaFerrari, to a Hummer H1 Alpha, to a Dodge Challenger. What I like is that the game has 5 different specs for most cars (some ranging from just 1 spec to all 5), which are Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Take, for example, the Challenger. It can have all 5 specs, so if you want to go on dirt roads with one, you hop into the dirt spec Challenger. If you want complete offroading, you go with raid. And if you want to take it to the track or go extremely fast on highways, you get the circuit spec, and so on. What's nice is that you only buy one Challenger, and as you progress through the game, you get it in each spec, so you technically have 5 Challengers.\n\nNEUTRAL:\nThe Police - I always enjoy it when there is law enforcement in an open-world racing game. At this point, I think it should be mandatory. The Crew, of course, has police, but they are only decent. Nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, this is where Need for Speed does something better than The Crew. During a police chase, even with 5 stars, there will never be any more than 5 police cars at once pursuing you, which by the way, are quite easy to take out. The roadblocks are laughable, since they never use anything other than the cars that are pursuing you to block the road, so you can usually speed right through them, unlike NFS: Most Wanted, which eventually has SWAT trucks that basically force you to take another route. There are also no spike strips. While it still can be fun to get into chases and have a friend taking out cops for you, I believe it could be made significantly harder at 5 stars with the use of bigger vehicles and spike strips.\n\nCustomization - I'm very thankful that The Crew actually has customization to begin with, but it is really lacking. For one, you cannot choose from any color in the spectrum; you just pick from a preset list of colors. Second, the decals are mostly terrible. I tend to use the same 10-15 decals on most cars, or sometimes not at all, because most of the others are just bad looking and don't seem to fit any vehicle. Granted, that is personal preference, but for someone who has played NFS:Most Wanted and Underground 2, those are far superior in customizing.\n\nCONS:\nUplay - I think you saw this coming. I know I did. Uplay is a requirement for The Crew, even if you buy it directly from Steam. You must download Uplay, and you must create an account. Although it can run in the background for the most part, the matter of the fact is that it is extra DRM that no one really wants, especially someone like me that only has 1 Ubisoft game. It also contributes to a longer startup time.\n\nThe Story - Full of clichés and it being overall boring, the story is pretty much mandatory in order to reach level 50. The movie-like cutscenes in it are neat, but if you are like me, you'll do the story just to get it out of the way. The fun seems to come after it's over with.\n\nSmart Loot - This system is possibly the worst addition to The Crew since launch. Granted, before it was added, people still complained about the grinding system for leveling up your vehicle. Now, however, it is much, much worse. Instead of what used to be a much quicker, platinum only part grind where you could go up as much as +50 spec points in a single jump, is now down to as little as +1 for the same skills. Not to mention you also have a chance of winning a customization part, such as paint, or a bumper. This makes it very hard to get your car to 1299 (the max spec level), if you weren't a player before Smart Loot was added.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nDespite some big flaws, I have enjoyed this game a lot, and I would say it's in my top 5 racing games now. The Crew, to me, earns an 8/10. If you can look past the cons listed above, I do recommend this game to any person that enjoys racing games, or is looking to try the genre in general.","October 2, 2015","true","287.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","4"

It went straight into a DLCfest.\nThe season pass doesn't grant you access to all the paid content, Wildrun isn't part of it, and on top of that, it costs almost as much as the game itself.\n\nPlus, it gives so little content that it makes no sense to pay that much: a bunch of bikes, new specs made with recycled and/or slightly edited assets and a new gamemode which should be competitive, but in reality it's just about who glitches the most.\n\nThe physics are broken, the cars don't feel alright at all. The steering capabilities also differ depending on input peripheral, with DirectInput ones having increased precision and steering radius, while keyboard and Xinput pads users get impaired controls. This issue hasn't been fixed, despite being a hot topic on the game's forums.\n\nVehicles aren't many for today's standards and they're terribly unbalanced. While updates fix the handling of some cars, all they do is changing the current kings. On top of that, bikes seem to dominate in almost any spec and they're locked behind a paywall. Despite the major outcry on the forums for more balance, nothing seems to have changed yet. Moreover, the engine sounds are terrible.\n\nThe only saving graces of this game are the graphics and the game world.","March 26","false","404.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

And while that may be true in many cases, you also must take into account for the scale of this game. No other game truly allows you to drive from Miami to LA in one sitting all the while seeing every different biome along the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightfire37/recommended/241560/","nightfire37","Capt. Crabby Dick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightfire37/","145 products in account","The Crew is one of those racing games that you just have to play even if it has Ubisoft's name on it. Let's get all of the BS rumors out of the way by saying UBISOFT DID NOT DEVELOP THIS GAME!!!! Ivory Tower developed this game with the ability of having 60 FPS at the start and yes it does have micro transactions but earning in-game cash is super easy. This game isn't tanted with Ubisoft's bad pc port mojo. This is a super stable game and I occasionaly experience a crash once or twice a day.\n\nSo gameplay, how is it? Well the gameplay is well how any Need for Speed from Underground 2 through Carbon but with a twist. This game has RPG elements thats similar to Need for Speed World but is not purposly asking you to empty your wallets into a pay wall. It is open world and the world is really huge. It is close to 50 in-game miles and it will take you a long time to get you there. You have a level (50 is a max) in which you level up by doing story missions (yes it has a story), skill challenges, PvP events, and faction missions. The story missions is what it is labeled as, missions that's part of the story. The skill challenges offer a way to gain car parts (more on that later) and get some experience for doing it. There is also a leaderboard so you can compete against a person's ghost and see if you can get to the top of the leaderboard. PvP events are what it is labeled. You go against other players and you can choose to fight for your faction or just free-for-all. Faction missions are where you get a lot of money, faction experience in which that adds everyday you login, and some chunk of experience. They also have one hour long races and one that goes up to 4 hours\n\nWhat are these car parts you mentioned above? Well those car parts give your car a level as well ranging from 0-1299. The car parts consist of a motorcore, air system, diff, tires, weight reduction, and more. There are five classes of cars and each car class is different to each other: There is Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Street is your step above stock. Dirt is something you would see from a World Rally Championship. Performance is your step above Street but is almost stripped out. Raid is something you see from the Dakar Rally and yes they have trophy trucks. Circuit is something you see from Grand Touring ot 24 Hour Le Mons racing. The car is completely stripped down with weight saving and high performance in mind with the ability to take corners.\n\nWell since this is a driving game, how are the physics? The physics can be odd but if you work around them, you can win a lot of the races. Drafting is a thing so use it when you can. The cars will tend to bounce off of things like bumper cars and it focuses a little on drifting.\n\nHows the car customization? It is what you would expect from a Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon game. You can customize the interior with your choices of aluminum, carbon fiber, mixed aluminum, and mixed carbon fiber. You cannot place stickers anywhere you want to though. They have presets which look cool IMO.\n\nCar selection? How big is it? Well IMO it is small but it will slowly expand with DLC. The car list consists of 58 total cars but at least they have trucks.\n\nFinal thoughts? Well I am enjoying the game. I am enjoying every bit of time I have put into the game. I would recommend everyone getting the Season Pass since they are going to add more cars. January 2015 is going to be their first DLC which should be an interesting one. I did wish they have given us the ability to move around the stickers rather than give us presets and working mirrors in the cockpit (yes a working cockpit). This game I believe will set a new standard on the illegal arcade street racing genre that was leaving a sour taste in my mouth because of the way Need for Speed has been going and from the look of things, it isnt going to get any better. You just have to play this game to know what I feel about this game. I have been dying to play a game thats open world with similar car customization as Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon but isn't trying to make your wallets screem and this is the answer my friends.\n\nUPDATE: Next Tuesday of updating this review, they are adding three more cars into the game if you don't count the Mini Cooper non-street edition we got at launch. I havent experienced any big crashes. Loading the game will freeze your computer if you are using a controller with XInput. I still would recommend this game. The AI can have some stupid rubber banding but AI can be difficult in a racing game.","December 15, 2014","true","440.3"," 39 of 71 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","39","71","0","6"

Doesn't matter what type or style it entailed. The Crew has its good and its bad. Lets go with the bad first.\n\nThe only real negatives I can personally give is once you hit level 50 and can get Platinum level cart parts it's a straight crap shoot at getting a level 50 car part. This is my biggest complaint. It's purely random, meaning you might get it on the first try or not get it for fifty tries or more. Also on the car parts that you "unlock", which allows you to buy the car part on another car instead of having to Story/Skills missions for the same part is restricted to which car spec you use when you unlocked that car part so if you get it through a Street spec car you can only buy it on a Street spec car, Any other car spec you will have to unlock seperately.\n\nThe car assists are split into three types, all assist, sport, and hardcore. None of which can be changed for what you want or don't want when driving. This is mildly annoying, but it also knows if you're using a controller or a steering wheel. Avoid using a keyboard if all possible with this game.\n\nThe NPC cars in Faction missions and the Police are cheaters, to put it as nice as possible, since it doesn't matter what surface they're driving on they will never lose any traction. The Police are lacking in the sense of you can drive by them at ridiculous speeds and run red lights/stop signs and they do not attempt to chase you. The only way to get a police chase is to either run into them or cause enough collateral damage during a Police Watch to trigger them into chasing you. Maybe this can be patched later to make them more like actual cops.\n\nThe car selection is nice, it isn't on Gran Turismo or Forza level, but it's sufficient. Overall the customization isn't bad either. Visual car aestetics are fairly wide until you get to Raid and Circuit specs (Since they are only color, sticker, tag, and rims options.) Again it isn't at the level of being able to make your own designs and putting them on your car. (I know why, mostly in the sense of people making poorly designed gentailia...) There are enough stickers and color variety to not run into same design, unless everyone in your session is obsessed with The Fast & the Furious.\n\nThe achievements can be entertaining in their title and down right fun to do depending on the prerequistes.\n\nThis game isn't for the simulator type player, it plays more to your Test Drive, Need for Speed and Burnout types. Even the adventerer in you will find it fun to be able to drive across the United States finding known landmarks throughout. The story isn't anything new, but it was still fun to watch and have some sort of cinematics and build some level of character developement for the people you add to your crew over the course of your exploits.\n\nOh, make sure you have some friends too, this is far more fun with people you know than driving it alone. At the end of the opening credits it says, "Never Drive Alone" and for good reason. Despite the flaws in this game I still see more posistive than negative, but what do I know since I'm the same guy that's been playing APB/APB:R for 3+ years. :)","January 24, 2015","true","329.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nhikx/recommended/241560/","Nhikx","ＮＨＩＫＸ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nhikx/","97 products in account","I'm sure most of you have already watched movies such as the Fast and Furious, right? Now, who wouldn't want to roleplay as a bunch of street racers out cruising on the city with pimped-out rides fighting for bragging rights?\n\nThe Crew is an open world, online multiplayer arcade racing game that lets you crew up with people to challenge others all over five major areas in the United States. That single line alone got me hooked enough to take the game and see for myself. After several hours clocked in, I managed to pin-point a few things that make this game great, at the same time notice a few issues that could be resolved in the future hopefully.\n\nThe Pros:\n- Probably one of the biggest selling points of this game is the fact that it's open world. They weren't kidding when they said, "If you can see it, you can drive there" part, with a minor exception from the world's boundaries. From busy streets, to wide highways, to rocky mountain tops, to the vast fields. You can race, or chill-out, practically anywhere given that you have already driven to that spot before. To add to this, the game allows you to warp anywhere with minimal to no loading time whatsoever. Always a plus on my book.\n\n- The rides aren't limited to your typical street racer tuning. The game has several specifications that works on certain terrain and objectives. It allows you to customize your ride to best suit the situation at hand, like dirt specs for off-road challenges, and raid specs for heavy duty pursuits. A large chunk of the pimping-out option is available as visual customization for your ride, allowing drivers to make unique rides that they can show-off to others, or look awesome winning in them during races.\n\n- This is a multiplayer game after all, so what could be more exciting than racing as a crew? Imagine cruising down the streets as a 4-man team out looking for trouble or a challenge. Visualize being chased down by cops while your crewmates dive right in to clear a path for you. Or you could just troll people around and block busy streets just for fun.\n\nThe Cons:\n- No game is perfect after all, especially during its first launch, so don't expect too much or you'll just end up disappointed like some. While the game is labled as an MMO, players are divided into "sessions" much like RPG games have "server channels". Most of the time players see only a handful of people in their current session, sometimes no one at all. While I have no idea what are the maximum number of players per session is, it would be nice if I could see 20+ drivers or so in every coast. Not too much though, or it would be chaos. Some people are complaining about not being able to see their friends in-game as well to crew up, which is quite a let down.\n\n- AI in this game is quite annoying in my opinion. First of, the term "rubberbanding", in reference to the elasticity of a rubber band, means that car A will not move too far away from car B in most situations. For example, you're in a race wherein you're in first place. The 2nd place AI will "rubberband" its way towards you no matter what situation it gets stuck in. It will suddenly dive towards you at ridiculous speeds even if it had just recovered from a crash. It works both ways when you're the one at 2nd, the 1st place AI seems to slow down a bit to allow you to get back into the race. Imagine the "rubberbanding" on police vehicles, chases aren't as exciting as it should be. In fact, it's difficult and down right scary.\n\n- The physics and controls on this game is a little off, I think. I mean, yes, driving at high speeds have this tendency to lose control obviously. But the handling and recovery is just too darn difficult.  The vehicles tend to spin-out easily, lose traction and so on. Let's not get started on the police, especially when they decide to break in front of you, they turn into a solid brick wall you can't possibly push aside. On the plus side, however, these cops really know how to do pit manouvers and stuff. And I think the handling of the cars can be remedied with the right car parts. Just expect to have a hard time at the start though.\n\nAll in all, despite the ups and downs, The Crew is still a fun game to have, especially if you love the challenge and the thought of having one awesome ride as an avatar. It's barely a week into release and I'm sure we can expect better things to come from this game. If you're debating on picking this up, my personal opinion is go for it.  I mean, why not? It's not a bad game, but it's not the best either, but I'm sure this game has potential to get up there on the list.\n\nHope to see you guys on the streets.

Still incredibly enjoyable if you like cars, exploration, or customization.\n\n-Cars. There's a lot of them, a wide variety of real life brands, and there's some pretty extensive visual customization for almost all of them.\n-Microtransactions exsist, but almost all of them are shortcuts that you can eventually reach in the base game, or are simply visual components.\n-It's always online, but I've never experienced any server difficulties.\n- Geography is completely boned up, but many of the cities or landscapes capture the essence of the town they smulate. Someone living in San Francisco won't recognize many streets, but it still feels like the city.\n- Game sometimes can seem empty. Civilian foot traffic is low in cities, and occasionally traffic is sparse.\n-Devlopers are still actively involved and relasing content, so that's pretty cool.\n\nThe storyline is the video game equivalent of a wet piece of toast - bland, uninspiring, and so generic that you completely forget about it. There's some pretty cringey dialogue, some pretty bad voice acting, and your protagonist is an unrelatable walking cliche. Once you hit the cap of level 50, it's a short MMO-style grind to max out your car, and then it seems like you're done with the game.\n\nThis is when the Wild Run DLC becomes a lfiesaver. It introduces weekly and monthly challenges against other people, inspiring you to come back again and again. It adds real end game content, and I highly recommend it.","February 24","true","83.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I will reach 1,000 hours playing this game soon and keep going. This is the best game that has come out so far. Right up there with forza horizen 2, except for PC.\n\nI have never got bored of this and still have allot of places to see in america. i learned allot about this contry from this game and saw the lands beauty first hand (digitaly). the landscape is amazing and the new Wild Run expansion doesnt come out for a few months.\n\nI love when costomization is supirior and unlimited. This is the only game that will give you the ability to drive formula 1 cars, track cars, rally cars, common street cars, armored cars, monster trucks, drift cars, drag, and moterbikes open world anywere you want. Btw, the bikes will have those specs too.\n\nThis arcade racer is the best for doing almost anythig, me and my freinds love to just go on top of a mountain and drive off the cliff and see who lands farthest, other times we try to smash every one who is landing from a ramp jump. They think its funny too because thay're not in any kind of race, just exploring. I made freinds that way too xD.\n\nthe PvP events are also good because you never have 3-6 year olds saying stupid stuff like on COD, and racing isn't the only kind of PvP thing, there are many game modes like the most recent is crown, aka capture the flag. and people are respectfull, if there is somone in the same faction i sometimes defend and give them the win since you get allot of money no matter how much you win, winning PvP just raises your faction level, witch is good but at least you get allot of money\n\nthe best part is, is the game actually starts when the story is finnished, when you hit level 50 that when you really play. and the updates are awsome, new car evry month, and patches to fix bugs all the time.\n\nAdd this to your wishlist and the next time it goes on sale, get it. this game is awsome.","August 23, 2015","true","577.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You get a good selection of radio channels, including a fantastic classical station, and a full interior view in beautiful detail. The world is obviously not a 1:1 scale of the US, but it is still immense, and you really can't get bored with this game from just driving around. Instead of TDU, where you just drive around Hawaii and look at pretty palm trees, this game has vast deserts, snowy mountains, and sprawling cities. I got to Las Vegas, and I was amazed by how much thought was put into the city's design. It is almost like the devs actually cared about making the game feel as good as possible.

You can drive for hours. (I literaly finished a race with a 104 minute record.)\n-Theres a weather system, Also day and night. Which really affects the gameplay.\n-TONS OF CARS.\n-The game not stands for full singleplayer, You can make a crew (A some sort of group that will join your missions.)\n-Pvp (NOT ONLY RACING, Theres a lot of multiplayer pvp mods !)\n-Upgrading and modding your car... Oh man.. This part. You just need to see the customization. (Ps. Made me poop myself when first saw).\n-You can have a driving test before getting a new car\n-Theres Voice chat and a regular chat. (Also whisper, crew chat and etc)\n-Theres a lot more honestly just. idk less important for this review (You should also taste by yourself you know.)\n\nSo ofcousre after Pros. I should hit with the Cons !\n\n-The biggest con by my opinion. Is the crashing system.\nCrashing into cards happends a lot (Even if you are not bad like me.) Lets say you gotta race inside the city and theres a turn left or right doesnt matter. Sometime, Because its a city after all, Theres cars waiting for that green light. Yea, In that moments youll find cars all over the road except to the right direction.\nI find it really annoying. Playing Perf spec (I guess the most fast cars in the game) On a road which is not straight inside the city totally can caus your death. (I did played a mission like that, i wanted to punch my screen, AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A CALMED PERSON.)\n\n[Woah thats a big con]^\n\n-When you buy a car, No refunds. You cant really regret it. Same with specs.\n-When theres a chat notification you dont really get it, You need to open the chat box, unless you make it visible the whole time, Which kinda disturbs.\n\nI must say, By my opinion once again, There is not a lot of cons to the game. Just really basic things. Handling isnt even bad. (Just on peft spec cars. Well thats because its ♥♥♥♥ing hard.) But yet the game extremely fun, and enjoyable.\n\nI really hope you enjoyed my review. Make sure to like it if it helped you so other can see it aswell.\n\n*SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISHHHHH*\n\nPeace and love sugars.\n","December 1, 2015","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The cars all feel similar (the performance cars all feel the same as each other, the raid cars feel the same, etc) and don't control as good compared to other driving games. The game borrows many ideas from previous Ubisoft releases that don't really translate that well in a car. The online community for this game may as well not be there. There is a chat in-game but in the 20+ hours I've put into this game I've yet to see one person use it.. which can make it hard for people to find a Crew to party with in-game. Invites to races and events other people usually go unaccepted. While a large portion of the Crew relies on having a Crew, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer for people looking for a single player experience.\n\nThe map for this game is huge and allows you to drive from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. In between are rocky mountains, open plains, wildlife darting across the road, cops, pedestrian vehicles getting in the way, little towns at the end of dirt roads and huge cities. In between all these are hundreds and hundreds (it seems like) of events. There's a handful of events such as staying in between the lines, smashing through 'gates', going as fast as you can, mountain climbing, and more. Completing these events (and other races) reward you with a score based on how well you did and are rewarded with different car parts than you can equip to cars; increasing their overall stats. Instead of climbing towers to unlock portions of the map; making you work a little for your progress, the Crew has you drive up to the satellite dishes located by a blinking aura on your map and GPS.\n\nThe story is extremely dull, laughable and perdictable.You play as Alex, a man wrongly jailed for the death of his friend. You have the chance you redeem your freedom as FBI Agent Zoe sends you information on the man who killed your friend, and she believes the police officer, Coburn, who arrested you is working behind the scenes with Shiv. You must race your way to the top, earn your ink, and take down Shiv. The music is subpar, instantly forgettable and I found a hard time finding something I enjoyed listening to in-game.\n\nIf you're interested in the Crew to get your racing game fix I would suggest looking elsewhere. There's plenty of other racing games out there that are multiple times better that'd you actually enjoy. Also, uPlay sucks.","August 15, 2015","false","32.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

But now it is not even worth looking at.\nthe reason why the game is not worth is because you will play in a incomplete game if you do not buy the wild run. I played in the beta of the wild run and had a blast. And after the beta I found out that you will have to pay for the expansion. I am not playing the crew anymore because of this. Since when is it okay to let people buy a season pass to then not give new content to them? it just does not make any sence. and you play in the same map as people that did bought the dlc. in other words: pay a lot and get screwed over, or pay a litle and get screwed over as well.\nthe game is now ♥♥♥♥. there is no way in earning XP doing stunts. or even getting parts. you get nothing.\n\nDO NOT BUY IT!!!","December 31, 2015","false","121.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

It essentially feels like an early NFS title in how it handles. Think Underground 2 or Hot Pursuit 2.\n\nCons:\nGlitchy! Sometimes you can ram a car hard, and the game will act like it was just a scratch, other times you will tap a car on the side lightly, and crash as if you rammed them. Speed of hit does not seem to matter.\nMicrotransactions : YES, this does have microtransactions, although i do not see the need to buy cash unless you want to progress faster. It isn't quite as bad as i have seen in many games with a pay2win aspect.\nNot worth the base value. I waited for this to go on sale, do not buy this at full price. I don't think this is worth $60 let alone $85 for the Gold.\nUplay: You must log in via Ubisoft's Uplay platform seperatly or make an account with them.\nHackers and Griefers: Don't bother with the leaderboards.\nHandling: Normal racing mechanics do not seem to apply in this game.\n\nIf you can get past the cons, there is some fun to be had in exploring and doing missions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaddyBurrito/recommended/241560/","DaddyBurrito","DaddyBurrito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaddyBurrito/","123 products in account","The Crew has quickly become my favorite racing game ever. Let me first qualify by saying that I am not a racing sim fan but prefer arcade-style racers. Previous favorites have been Burnout: Paradise and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage. I also enjoy the DIRT and Forza series of games. With that said The Crew has an engaging story with a cinematic feel. I was able to play through the story at a casual pace in about 15 hours. The cut scenes are very well done and really draw you in. Once you finish the story there really isn't much that ties the campaign to the rest of the game however. I hope Ivory Tower (the developer) finds a way to create new missions which allow you to see what Alex and the 5-10s are doing instead of the player just running around the US doing races that don't connect with the story.\nOther than the disconnect from the story, once you make it to "V8" status then the open world really affords you many choices. In addition to the option to go back and re-race any of the campaign missions (to win better car parts) you can also run skill events. You must do wither of these to get better parts for your car(s) before you will have a chance in the PvP section. You can also race in Faction events which earn bucks that you can use to repurchase parts you have already won for cars you haven't yet upgraded or to buy entirely new cars.\nSpeaking of cars, The Crew actually uses licensed cars from a wide variety of car makers including domestic and foriegn. Most of the cars are available to purchase with the bucks you earn in the game but others are only available if you pay real cash. The cost is relatively low and the season pass can make them even more affordable to buy all together. Each car has a variety of "spec" ratings from Full-stock, Street, Performance, Dirt, Raid and Circuit. Not all cars support all specs such as a Ferrari wouldn't have Dirt or Raid but many such as the Mustang GT have all so you can get really crazy with your builds. You can also customize the exterior and interior appearance of your rides and with the daily and monthly challenges you are encouraged to enhance your cars to earn more bucks. The variety of car looks and builds is pretty amazing. I rarely see the same configurations more than once when playing PvP.\nI could go on and on about this game but one of the things I like the most is that the developer, Ivory Tower, keeps enhancing and updating the game to make it better. Recently that added a league rating system and they routinely release new cars, tracks and events. The fact that this game continues to grow really makes it a great value. Unlike my past favorites I am always able to discover new things in this vast vehicular playground. Whether you buy The Crew on sale or at regular price you won't be dissappointed. This is one of the most fun and engaging racing games ever.\nOh and did I say that there is a huge expansion coming in the fall: Monster Trucks, Motorcycles and Dragsters!!!!","July 17, 2015","true","90.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

So, let me explain: The game itself cost 30 bucks, then you must pay 25 more dollars to get the DLC cars, AND THEN (yeah, thats not it) you must pay about 40 more "greens" to get another half of the game, with many new cars, game-changing specs of the cars, and many-many things. That half of the game named "The Wild Run", which is a DLC, coming pretty soon to the market. So, after some simple calculations we get a FULL game for about 90 bucks! Great job Ubisoft!\nNow about the game itself. Yes its kinda good, but after you drove a little, completed the story mode, got EVERY car in the game in EVERY spec, drove the whole map, discovered tons of the bugs, like wall-breach and go-underwater bug, some skill races in top-50, you got basically nothing left to do.\nSo the conclusion, should you buy it or not.\nWell, there is a litteraly a few people, like me, who can truly love it and fall into addiction, who think that the freeroam, huge map and 72 cars is enough (though i never felt like there is so much, and was actually shocked when i got that fact, as the cars feel pretty much similiar).

Its about the community, beating records, driving together and completing insane faction races.

Cop AI isn't very bright, but when they are driving on your sides, you're screwed. There is no way out of that the cop cruisers refuse to move, not like a car would act normally.\n\nAlso the difficulty for some missions is so artificial is angering. Most of the time, your car level needs to be well over the recomemded level because there are always 1-2 cars that just fly ahead of you and stay ahead of you. Also i noticed when a friend of a much higher level helps a much lower, the opposing racers are on par with the high level friend. Wait what?! At this point the lower level is better off on his own. The opposing AI car levels still have a low number but match speed with the high level pretty much throughout the whole race.\n\nI know the big map is great and all, but its not 20 miles from Miami to Chicago. At least make it more reasonable.\n\nAmidst all this backlash, I still recomend this game. For those who play it like a game not like something of a speed run.

The game handles like ye'olde typical arcade game. Honestly, that is a good thing. I have Asetto Corsa to fill the enthusiast needs.\n\nIt has been quite a while since I've enjode an arcade racer. Actually, the last time I remember having this much fun was with "Ultim@te Race".  I am only a few hourse in, so here is why I like the game in a nutshell:\n\n1. Pretty/adequate graphics.\n2. Runs like butter. Fast 60fps no stutters,,,,nuttin. Considering how bad Unity and Watch Dogs was I am pleasantly surprised.\n3. Huge game world , which means while you do the typical race activities, the tracks are diverse and fresh.\n4. The coop is fun. Just plain fun.\n5. The RPG like mechanics keep you going in a "just on more upgrade" kinda way. It is fun to see all those players driving around you all the time. Makes the world feel alive.\n\nThis game is certainly not for everyone, but if you, like me, just want to play an arcade racer with your buddies.....then give it a try....at least when it is on sale.

And dont get me wrong, Ive spent more time messing with settings than playing the game to know my issues are real.\n\n1. FIVE times before you get into the gameplay they make it very apperent they want you buying wildrun DLC, this is stupid, was my 30 dollars not good enough?. 5 times I got advertisments shoved in my face before playing. not the point of a game.\n\n2. the camera snapping back uncontrollably to the forward position anytime W is pressed, now I understand why this is needed, GTA did a good job of this, smooth transitioning back to front view. the crew snaps you back when your trying to look left or right and it freaks out when you try to look anywhere but directly forward. This is a car game. I want to look at my car, and look where I want to go. not just straight. this was a game breaker for me 100%.\n\n3. after spending even more time tinkering with the steering controls, I for some strange reason couldnt tell I was driving a Camaro.

This game is in some sort of identity crisis. It wants to be a MMO title, but its really not. I had a great time playing this with one of my friends, like a co-op experience. The problems starts when you want to get a group of people together. It worked just fine up to a group of 3 friends. The weird stuff started when we filled a crew with four people. Most of the time, the 4th player is invisible. You can se the players nametag, and you can race through his car, but you cannot see him. When we gathered two full crews, the same problem just expanded. You can see 3 players from your crew, but the rest of them are just nameplates.\n\nThe full-on PVP races is just stupid. The cars are scaled up / down to match each other, so it does not matter what car you drive, or what surface you race on. Its also impossible to properly queue up crew VS crew without the other crew being a bunch of random players.\n\nMultiplayer aside: the rest is great, and this is why i stayed for the game.\nYou can decide to ignore the races, and just cruise around in this huge beautiful detailed world. All the cars feels different to drive, so it actually makes sense to buy different cars. I really enjoy just driving around the huge map. Driving from one corner to the other, can last for between 30 minutes - one hour (depending on your car) with full speed. its great fun. And its really fun to race in the open world with 3 friends from A - B in the USA.\n\nI did experience a couple of bugs when playing. Sometimes after the race ends, the game crashes, and when i stream a video / watch a video with software on my other monitor, the game randomly crashes.\n\nDo i recommend this game?  Well, yes. I do. As a single player open world racing game, its great. As a MMO it really really sucks. So it really depends on how you want to play the game.","February 8, 2015","true","81.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A game that I'd followed for a fair few months before its BETA release, and then jumped off the train to "buyingit-ville" very shortly before release. For another 8 months I fondled with the idea of buying it, but never did. I didn't really know why... until now.\n\nNow, before I start, I should clarify that no, I didn't "thumbs it up" by mistake. I bought this game on sale for £12 and I feel it's worth that. But a penny more? No.\n\nAn open world, multi-purpose racing game with vast amounts of custimization that is also an MMO. Sounds great, right? Let me further clarify those for you.\n\nOpen World\n...and then some. Oh boy, the map's huge! I always thought GTA V's map was big, but this must be at least 4x the size of Los Santos. Not only is it big, based around the entirety of the USA and time-consuming to travel across, but it's also incredibly detailed. The sale price was worth it for the gametime on that map alone. Even without missions, it would still be enjoyable for me. You might want to get a plane if you're going from NY to LA though.\n\nMulti Purpose Racing/Customization\nYou betcha! Dirt, Raid, Perf(ormance), Street and Circuit specs will make sure that you definitely have the right tool for the job (or the race, in this case)! The car detailing with these specs is very nice. Cars look crisp, although some more than others, for some reason, and there's a lot to do in the customization front (bumpers, fenders etc.).\n\nThe A.I. however is a joke. It would seem that Ubisoft believe that you should have to hard brake around track corners in a specially circuit-tuned race car that should turn on a dime, only to fall off track and lose your first place position to the guy in last 1 mile back. But, the guy behind you in a Chevy V8, with tyres the size of a standard London road-lane and the turning circle of a cruise ship? Oh, no trouble there! In fact, they don't have to even brake! Their car has high-performance, rubberised glue... apparently. Oh, and if you can actually manage to pull off a first place medal against the sling-shotting A.I., don't expect it to be gold. You're going to need a harrier jet for that. Available in the new DLC , which you'll be able to grab in your nearest showroom for the low, low price of £25.\n\nM.M.O\nHa! Yeah right. I haven't played W.O.W in a few years, but unless their servers have changed to allowing a whopping 8 players in one match(!), then it is an insult to even put this into the same category.\n\n\nConclusion\nIt's a fun game. Has a lot of bugs but a lot of them are rarely noticable. It's a great time-waster and the cars look good, especially when you put a big ol' body kit on 'em. Buy it, but don't pay full price for it, even if that is only £25. Also, be prepared for a ton of in-game currency being thrown in your face. Seriously, it's like hitting a wasps nest with a baseball bat; overwhelming and really, really stupid.","July 22, 2015","true","35.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The handling seems a little arcadey and needs to be adjusted a bit in the settings and of course like all racing games a controller is always nice. But honestly the game will give you hours of fun upgrading your favorite cars, testing you skills in pvp or on solo/crew missions, and roaming around a toned down map of the USA. (with multiple race tracks to find might i add). The only possible downsides is that upgrading the cars can feeling like endless grinding to get the part you want, BUT it really isn't bad, also that the cop chases are pretty sub-par and lastly you need uplay.\n\nClosing note about the negative reviews:\n\nMost seem to be about the difficulty of the game and how some missions might need multiple people.\nHonestly all I have to say about the difficulty is git gud :p I had no problem with the game at all (not to mention a little challenge is always fun!)  and in terms of the missions that may need multiple people, there is an option before the mission inviting all people that you can see to help you, so finding multiple people is easy!\n\nPlease do not let the negative reviews put you off from this game and remember to read them carefully!","June 20, 2015","true","79.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'll be honest, it's not what I expected at all. I was hoping for another Test Drive Unlimited, so for the first while playing it I didn't like it much. We ended up stopping for three months before picking it up again and now it is one of my favorite games. They've made a lot of changes and fixed a lot of things, but I also like the game for what it is now, not what I wanted it to be.\nI've spent hours just driving aimlessly to see what I can find, more than half the time I'm not even on a road, I'm using a RAID spec vehicle (think offroad racing truck type of vehicle) to drive where there aren't even roads because the team even put detail into those parts of the map.\n\nSpeaking of Specs, that's what makes this game so cool. Currently, I am using a 1969 Camaro for all races. I have a version that is basically an offroad buggy meant for driving where there aren't roads, another that is a high-performance circuit racer, a street racing version, a dirt track version, and a NFS-type high-performance street race version. The same car becomes 5 VASTLY different cars, each handling differently and meant for different types of races and terrains. You simply can't drive a Circuit car in a RAID race, that'd be like driving a formula one car in a rally, it just doesn't work. The same is true vice versa. But you can use the same car as both specs if you want.\n\nThe story mode is pointless, I won't disagree with that, but this game is meant to be an MMO, the story doesn't really matter. It's only there to introduce you to the different specs for PVP events. It is still fun with a crew of course, but pretty boring by yourself. My cousin and I never even finished it. We got as far as unlocking the last SPEC and then focused on PVP events and faction events. PVP events and faction events are what's the most fun. They are races of all types across the US. My favorite race is a RAID race going down the side of a snowy mountain, it's high speed and there are no roads. Faction events can vary in length between less than 10 minutes to over an hour. That seems crazy at first but with a crew it is fun.\n\nThe entire map is covered with challenges like speed, escape, jump, raceline, etc. to get upgrades for your car like loot drops in an MMO. It's a great way to keep just driving interesting as well. But most of the time you will probably avoid them if you're just driving because really, this game makes just driving feel great.\n\nI'm looking forward to what is planned to be added to this game, they said they will support it for a long time and I really hope so. This is the kind of game you can drive for hours without even doing anything and still enjoy yourself, whether or not there is even a road in visible distance of you.","June 15, 2015","true","61.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

They all had no trouble with completing the first mission, even with messing up.  I don't know if I  would reccomend this game because I believe I got a glitched game, and I have no way to fix this.

I'm going to have to give a thumbs down for this game, and I doubt you'll ever see another penny coming out of me for your incompetence for a horrendous buisness practice (in-game cash shop after buying an AAA title game) and trying to force everyone to use your bad game launcher (UPLAY)\n\nI bought the game being hyped when everyone saw the amazing CGI Cinematic Trailer The Crew showed off when it was first released on youtube, everyone really thought we were gonna have fun, join together as one with a Crew, with those being huge in the car culture, the trailer really represented us gamers what we really wanted and expected out of The Crew, to no avail tho the game itself was not like the trailer... sadly.\n\nThe Game was okay at the time, bought the gold edition that included seasons pass and had unlocked most of the sweet cars, seemed like a sweet deal. Despite the fact that the CGI Trailer was no where near close to how the game itself really was, The Crew was overall a game that had more pro's than cons at the time of it's release\n\nUbisoft then decided to be money hungry, and not only did they change the way how end game worked by reducing the chances of farming rare parts through skills (pushing for people to buy in-game currency and or pvp for them (again low chance), and ADDED a DLC which was not INCLUDED IN A SEASON'S PASS (which I also bought) and the DLC didn't contribute to anything that The Crew was at first, it didn't even make me want to come back to the game, all they did was add a competitive content that had barely ANY interactions between players, a bunch of monster trucks and motocycles that had basically nothing to do with the game as well. Drifting was a nice addition and was probably the only good thing out of the DLC, Drag racing was somewhat of a pointless feature in the game.\n\n\nAll in all with current status of this game.\n\nThe Crew is now in my opinion one of the worst car racing MMOs to date with the recent updates. I have to say.. Good job Ubisoft you finally surpassed EA in being the worst publisher and game developer ever existed in the gaming industry, it's like you ACTUALLY WANTED recognition for it and ♥♥♥♥ people off with your half made games that aren't even complete, even your game launcher is WORSE than Origin. JUST HOW can you not learn from your mistakes?\n\nAgain, not one penny out of me until I see things improve with you guys.","March 3","false","140.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

When this game was released it got all kinds of terrible reviews but even at that time in it's incomplete state it was a good arcade style racing game compared to any NFS-type game before it.  Since that time they have added cars, stickers, colors, pvp options, graphics, race modes, bikes, monster trucks, 3 new specs (monster, drift, drag) in addition to the 5 already available (street, dirt, perf, raid, circuit), freedrive challenges, and tons of other things!  Some people will sit here and cry and complain about some technical issues with crashing, which is there from time to time, but with the amount of options they're adding to the game it's totally worth it.  Need For Speed is completely inferior to this game.  I have spent 125 dollars on this game including game, expansion pack, and season pass...

It's essentially TDU2.5; i.e. flawed, but still the most ambitious open world racing available. It's just plain fun.\n\nGOOD. The world alone makes this game easily worth the asking price. The open world is AAA, the best in a racer to date, capturing a lot of diversity and the feeling of cruising in a big open-world. You might expect cities, highways, beaches, snow covered mountains, forrest trails, canyons, and (sadly only a few) in-world racetracks. But you're still likely to be surprised by the diversity here; swamps, dunes, salt flats, etc. The Crew's world is just a fun place to drive.\n\nNOTSOMUCH. It's always online, which I might like just to reduce cheating, but requiring always online and not providing dedicated servers seems janky. One poorly connected player can effectively pause a race on and off through the whole race. Running into random players in the world is a core concept that I like, but again, poor implementation means the open world is VERY sparsley populated. I'm hoping they can fix this, but as it is, one of the biggest features in the game feels half-arsed.\n\nHandling is on par with the TDU series - a better feel than full on cartoony arcade stuff like Burnout, but still very much (too much) cartoon racing. Also, the story is pretty cliche. But seriously, who cares about that in a racer?\n\nSome things fall short of what this team pulled off in the TDU series. The great weather and bouncy baja-esque mountain roads from TDU2 are gone. No motorcycles. The car selection is mediocre at best. And the ability to instantly challenge other players is missing.\n\nBOTTOM LINE. I'm still hoping for a talented developer with a serious budget to release a racing world like this with proper handling and a more polished take on seemlessly-integrated multiplayer. Until that happens, I guess this is as good as open world racing gets for now.","January 9, 2015","true","64.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

And TDU2 had such a GREEEAAAT story. And such a GREEEAT physics engine/handling model. That game was a joke, I'm starting to wonder if people launched that on accident.\n\nUBI$OFT MICROTRANSACTIONS HURRRRRR\nEverything you can get from microtransactions is attainable with in game money, obviously DLC cars won't be but almost every game has that even. You can complain about microtransactions all you want, they aren't going away.\n\nSURVURS ALWAYZ DOWN!\nI haven't seen the servers down once and I've been playing since launch day, I also played in the closed beta, never saw it then either.\n\nI'm not saying it's a perfect game, I'm saying everyone is expecting a full fledged simulator when The Crew never set out to be that, it's revolutionary in the fact that there are so many different ways to customize your car, street, offroad, etc etc etc. I mean seriously somebody listed no working turn signals as a con, that's so petty.\n\nYeah, the mirrors don't have reflection and some of the shifting animations are fudged, sometimes the character will act like there's a paddle shift and there isn't which leaves him changing gears by swatting the air. As far as I can tell not enough people even use manual transmissions in game to care about shifting animations.\n\nOverall this is an incredibly fun game with enough to keep me coming back for a while. I paid full price for it and I don't regret it.\n\nEDIT: 12/17\nI saw the servers go down once a few days ago, they were down for all of 15 minutes. Yeah I was butthurt but it was pretty quick. I'm still enjoying the game but there are a couple more annoyances.\n\nPvP is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everybody has full driving assists on and never even has to think, they go careening off walls and guard rails and beat you by 4+ seconds while you're taking care to not hit anything.\n\nThe factions are odd, there's 5(I think) factions in the game but only 2 or 3 actually have people. I just so happened to put myself on one of the ones with a significant lack of people and it takes me 20+ minutes to find a PvP match for the faction v faction mode. I honestly don't see why they put so many factions in the game.\n\nUplay's "drivehub" is showing me news from 1-15-2015 lol\n\nEDIT NUMBER 2 12/17\n\nI'm gonna try and stop looking at the other reviews for this game, I just saw somebody complain that it is difficult to get a gold medal on challenges. LOL GIT GUD, THERES ALSO PLATINUM MEDALS IF YOU ACTUALLY WOULD PUT MORE THAN 2 HOURS INTO THE GAME. The challenges are exactly what they should be, CHALLENGING. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, you all want to be spoon fed yet you don't like the idea of microtransactions.\n\nSpeaking of microtransactions, it's not like I can go buy the best parts right off the bat with real life money, I would first have to earn the part with a car, the spend real life money to put it on a TOTALLY DIFFERENT car. So in essence, I'd be spending my money to make another car just as good as one I actually earned the parts with. Yeah you can buy cars outright with real  money but without parts it doesn't matter. People are just being way too critical of this game because Ubisoft. I bet they turn around and call Far Cry 4 GOTY though...\n\nEdit 3 1/9\nSo after getting over 120 hours and not seeing myself stopping I thought I'd throw out another update.\n\nI've seen the servers down here and there, they're fixed within 20 minutes though.\n\nI have one friend who everytime we try to crew up, it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, so we have his brother get on and crew us up. (Until they patched that a couple days ago)\n\nUbi announced they're going to fix mirror reflections, I hope you're all happy.\n\nFirst DLC coming out in a week, they'll be keeping that pace for about a year, supposedly.\n\nThey're also fixing the biggest gripe, the AI chase catchup whatever you want to call it, it's getting patched next week, so basically every review for this game becomes null and void.\n\n>Everyone's face when Ubi is listening and patching ♥♥♥♥","December 9, 2014","true","211.7"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Go look somewhere else.\n\nUPDATE: 01/11/15\nAfter nearly 3 months after launch there were only 2 patches correcting minor stuff but not a single commitment from Ubisoft on addressing wanted features in the game.\nThe Steam user satisfaction dropped its recommendation from 96% to 77% and it will continue to go down as more people figure out how little this game offers after 20 hours - which is a ridiculous little time for a MMO. --- CONTINUE TO STAY AWAY.\n\n\nI've pre-ordered The Crew Gold +Season Pass expecting that all publishing on hard working to bring a new concept of game would be delivered. After my first 8 hours with the game I'm never ever buying Ubisoft games at launch anymore (As I'm already doing with Assassin's Creed franchise since Brotherhood).\n\nThe game isn't an evolution from what we've seen on the Beta phase, it is just a "stability" upgrade in all aspects. To be honest, the only thing I've seen implemented from what was asked on forums during closed and open betas was the ability to change the gear faster while on manual shift, almost everything requested by the community was ignored.\n\nTo review the game I've used a Nvidia GTX-780 + i7-4770K overclocked, my personal impressions below:\n\n- Are you ready for Ubisoft concept of MMO?\nIt was confirmed by Ubi Community Manager that the "bug of few people per map" is in fact working as designed since they believe 8 player per map is OK.\nFor a game where the selling point is "Massive open world" this is a flaw.\n\n- Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer, cause it isn't working as it should. It took me about 50 tries to be able to do 1 single coop mission since the message "There is no one in your session" was constantly been displayed even while I could see about 10 players on the map screen.\n\n- Do you like driving from cockpit and using the rear mirrors? Hopefully not cause they we're NOT implemented at all you will see is a gray piece of junk that since it isn't showing your rear shouldn't even be there. Surprisinly and adding "more fun" to the randomness of this issue, when you put your view in 3rd person mode (behind the car)... TA DA! The mirrors magically start working! W-T-F!!!\nLets pause for a little reflection:\nSince 1987 we have working rear mirrors thanks to Test Drive 1 but not in this advanced "next gen" title? There is no other racing series considering doing the same crap.\n\n- Anti-Alising is so horribly implemented that even downsampling from 4K resolution to 1080p you will notice the jadded edges everywhere.\nSpecially when you're wandering inside cities hopefully you will not bother on blinking edges in general scenario elements like fences and light lamps, buildings and cars as you will be near to have a convulsion. Surprisinly AAs seems to had worked a lot better with "wild nature" elements so trees and vegetation don't suffer in the same heavy way cities do;\n\nThis is my tweak guide to correct the game Anti Alising to an standard expected by a Next Gen title:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/617321352146025421/?tscn=1417713397\nStill considering the fact that at DAY 2 I'm trying to manually override what was delivered in the "official pack" , Customer Satisfaction is barely achieved on that aspect;\n\n- Looking for Dynamic Lighting and Shadows? Bad for you cause your car and whatever is capable of emitting light doesn't create any shadows! Ugly absurd issues from WatchDogs are all back to terrorize people dreams of playing decent games;\n\n- Your car is the only thing on the screen that seems to be made with more than 20 poligons. When compared with your own, all other cars and objects are ugly and seems to be toys or re-used models from games launched back from 90's - Specially Mini Vans - Maybe they have used the same from SEGA Crazy Taxi? Seems very similar to me.\n** This can be minimized using my Anti Alising guide - check the LOD BIAS section **\n\n- Real bad textures. If you stay like 5 meters from any building you will few like playing GTA3. Ambient Occlusion made them feel more alive but they're all ugly and not even close to HD;\n\n- Dust and smoke effects from Counter Strike 1.6 are better than what we can see here;\n\n- Offline mode isn't working. You need to stay online on UPlay or, once you get in the game, it will ask you to connect to UPlay and restart it;\n\n- There is  no dynamic weather at all;\n\n- Engine sounds are very generic;\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\nAs it is right now, there is no reason why you should buy this game for more than 20 dollars. If you want a good looking racing experience, buy Shadow of Mordor and ride a Warg. I ensure you that your experience would be better than any hype you may have here and you will have a really good game.\n\nBesides that, give the game some time to have Ubisoft to fix its outstanding issues and the magicians from the internet to discover what Ubisoft have disabled under the hood to make it similar to the console versions.","December 3, 2014","false","29.8"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","4"

My favorite parts is Death Valley, the Black Hills, even though I've only discovered only 6% of the map. I can't praise Ubisoft and Ivory Tower enough for The Crew. It is a huge check mark in the positive coloum for PC gaming. It's far from them earning their reputation back, but it's a very good start. Glitches and bugs are expected since this game is brand new.\n\nWIth nice little easter eggs and salutes to past racing game legends like Need For Speed World, Hot Pursuit 2010, Burnout Paradise, Shift 2 Unleashed, Test Drive Unlimited 1 & 2 and many more, The Crew is a hotbed of MMO racing that just feels right. How many other games out there can you tune a Ford GT to 700hp, and wreck a Koenigsegg Agera R? I can't think of many.\n\nAnother huge check mark is the fact that the devs actually watch the forums; someone suggested that a free roam cam be added, like the one in NFS World, and within 12 hours someone from Ubisoft responded saying that something like that is in the works...\n\nNow that's rare now a days.","December 4, 2014","true","151.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With this that simply isn't the case, if you can see it in The Crew, you can almost always go there.\n\n6 levels of customization put the game's huge map to use, they are fullstock, street, dirt, Perf (performance), raid (trophy trucks), and circuit (full-blown race cars) each with it's own merits and downfalls that add an unmatched level of diversity to the game.\n\nThe options menu is even pretty comprehensive with toggles for anti-aliasing, even types of anti-aliasing. individual performance impactors with their own toggles, and full wheel support with multiple ways of customizing so you can tune it to your driving style.\n\nAll in all a fantastic game, even after the career mode there's plenty to do and fun to be had. 9/10","April 15, 2015","true","314.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What is does wrong, it really does it wrong!\n\nI will only list the things wrong and missing in the game. It has everything else in my opinion!\n\n1. This is possibly the biggest one for me and I don’t really know why! The side and rearview mirrors don’t work! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING! Almost every racing game has working mirrors!\nRacing games on mobile, last gen systems even the PS2 AND PS1 racing games had working mirrors!\nThis seriously needs to be fixed!\n\n2. Not enough races or race types! There are plenty of street challenges… -_-\nThere are so few races that I forget I’m playing a RACING GAME sometimes!\n\n3. Damage on cars are overdone in some places and underdone in others!\nIf I hit a leaf, my whole front end looks like I hit a tree at 200mph! But glass wont break or even crack even if I roll my car! This just seems lazy!\n\n4. Textures look good on your cars and most of the environments. It’s not what you would expect from a next gen graphics game, but they look good. And with the size and scope of the game I would think they look amazing! Where is the bad? EVERY SINGLE PEDESTRIAN CAR AND THE PEDESTRIANS WALKING DOWN THE STREET! I have seen better textures on the PS2! I swear I am not exaggerating! They look horrible!!!\nI can’t even begin to figure out why they thought this was OK!\n\n5. Now on to the little things. No neon lights. Why is this a big deal? It is and isn’t. I like neon’s, what can I say? But in a game that is supposed to be an MMO, you need to have more customization!\n\n6. No window tints.\n\n7. Very limited on body parts.\n\n8. The game has a lot of rims to choose from, but 90% of them all look the same!\n\n9. Cant paint parts different colors.\n\n10. The performance parts system is kind of wack! Look it up on YouTube.\n\n11. Not a lot of cars to choose from. But at least they had my Skyline!\n\n12. Its structured as a F2P type game. Now that wouldn’t be such a problem if it weren’t for the fact that they are selling it for $60. Plus I have played some F2P racing games that felt more complete than this game that had WORKING MIRRORS! (Sorry, but I’m not going to ever let that go till they fix it).\n\nAt any rate, the game is fun, not worth what I paid, but fun.\nBuy it on a sale, a BIG sale! Anything over $20 is way too much! But if you really want to play a game that kind of reminds you of Midnight Club L.A. then this is the game for you….Kind of.. -_-\n\nSo yes I recommend it, even though is sucks!\n","March 18, 2015","true","43.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Each spec you unlock changes how you play, and upgrading your vehicle is rewarding and challenging.

It's that good. It would take a large amount of hours to completely explore the map. I still haven't completely expored it in my many hour playtime. It takes about an hour (if you are going very fast) tho get from one side of the map to the other. It just such a fun map to drive around, to take a road trip, and to see all kinds of fabulous landmarks throughput your journeys.\n\n-Everything about the cars\nAll the cars have lots of detal, interior and exterior. They are all different to drive, and unique in their own ways. Also, all the sounds for the cars are the legit real life sounds, recorded from the cars in a sound studion. SO nice.\n\n---\n\nThings I like\n\n-Customization of car\nThe customization is quite good, especially compared to most of the recent need for speed games. The only problem is the customizations seem too concrete, there is no ability to add your own imagination or personal touch. Some stickers have different colors, but you can't change the color of a specific sticker. Also, each sticker goes on a certain, unchangable place on the car. You can make your car different than others, because there a large number of aesthetic parts and stickers.\n\n-Car specs\nI really like how the car can utilize many different utilities by changing the spec. There are 5 specs: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. They are all fun to experiment with. Some are great for the racetrack, while others are great for offroad trails. My only gripe about specs is that very few cars have the full 5 specs, most have 1-3 of the the specs. The starter cars all have the full 5 specs, so you will be able to have them all in at least one car.\n\n-The story\nIt is surprising for a good story to be in a racing game, but in this case that surprise came true. It may seem cheesy and cliche to some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n-The graphics\nThey aren't amazing by any means, but they are good. They capture american geography well (with a few minor hiccups) but there are many current racing games that have better graphics. They are definitely not bad though, they still make the game nice looking. The best graphics in the game are seen in some of the cutscenes. Legitimate movie quality cutscences.\n\n---\n\nThings i dont like\n\n-The "mmo" aspect of the game\nOnly 8 players in your session, and they players continually switch to different players, so, yeah, no. I still don't really know how to play with my friends, because there is no server choice, just places you in one.\n\n-Not that many cars\nThere really should be more.\n\n-Anything that has to do with AI\nOther racers, cops, even NPC traffic. All equally annoying.\n\n-Customization of your character\nNonexistent. Hopefully you are okay with the way you look, cuz you can't change that.\n\n---\n\nThings I HATE\n\n-ubisoft\n-uplay\n-ubisoft support\n-uplay servers\n-ubisoft bugs\n-uplay bugs\n-ubisoft glitches\n-uplay glitches\n-ubisoft in general\n-uplay in general\n\nFortunately, ubisoft only published this game not developed, so it isn't UNPLAYABLE (i.e. ACU) a good company called Ivory Tower made it, which was responsible for some other open world maps (i.e. GTA 4) Some things about the game just seem buggy and unfinished, not because of Ivory Tower, but because of ubisoft. It just seems like with the many delays the game should be PERFECT but it isn't.\n\nAnd now, for the thing I HATE the most about the crew, the following is a reddit rant that i put onto /r/The_Crew/ :\n\nOriginally posted by author of this review: There is one thing that i just can't get past about this game: THE MIRRORS DON'T WORK! I mean SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHY?!?!??! test drive unlimted from THE 80'S has working mirrors.\nhttp:// http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xSvpmi79ZXY/0.jpg  <---FREAKING 8 BIT MIRRORS! and the crew doesn't. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n3 reasons why the crew doesn't have mirrors\n1. ...\n2. ...\n3. ...\nDon't get me wrong I love the game but.....I JUST CAN'T GET PAST THAT\n\nOk thanks for reading all that. I'm done now.\nThe good conclusion:\nThe game's main feature, a big map, is DEFINITELY true. The map, the cars, the graphics, all together make the game an great, interesting, and fun experience.\n\nThe bad conclusion:\nThe online, which was the other big feature, fails to deliver. There are many online problems and bugs that make some give up on the game. But I am not a quitter.\n\nMy Rating:\n\n8/10\nFinal conclusion (tl;dr) :\nThis game offers an amazing experience, one that I have never seen in any other game. Simply being able to take a trip down a desert highway, explore a mountain, race around a city, and explore the entirety of the United states is something that no other game has ever done so beautifully.\nOverall great game, beautiful map, beautiful cars, just some problems that need addressing. My rating is subject to go up if those improvements are made. The crew is definitely my favorite driving game, and it will never get old or boring.\nWith a map the size of the U.S., how could it?\n\nHappy driving!","January 4, 2015","true","183.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a lot of cars to discover and drive. You can tune and customize your car almost just as you want. I bought the Gold Edition becuase i have seen the game on YouTube and knew that this game was made for those who both like good stories and cars. The story in The Crew™ is probably something I've never seen before. With a lot of action in this game, I could easily give this a 10/10! And for the extra feeling of driving a real car, buy the Logitech g27 Racing Wheel.

The Crew is a Open World Racing Game with MMO and Coop features.\nYou get into the role of a racer named Alex who gets pretty much trouble with the group 5-10 of his brother. After his death you are on the way to get revenge!\n\nPls dont be too angry to me and my language. I´m not the best in writing english, but i want to tell you my opinion of this game, because it deserves to be telled of :)\n\nShort Version\n- Graphics: 7 / 10\n- Performance: 10 / 10\n- Storytelling: 7 / 10\n- Possibilitys: 10 / 10\n- Server-Onlinetime: 9 / 10\n\n► Total Grade: 9 / 10\n\n\nLong Version\n\nGraphics\nThe Graphics of this game are pretty good and well done for a racing game being that big. But compared to other titles released today not the best and detailed one. Not saying that they are almost perfect for a game like this, its still not the best it could be.\nShader is well done, also the Antialising. Textures are well but not that detailed and a little bit "spongy" if you are looking close to them. However, its a well done composition of textures and it´s nice for the eye.\n7 / 10\n\nPerformance\nDue to the fact, that this game has a dang big world to explore and the graphics are pretty nice the performance is incredible. I was surprised that this game runs on a very low quality computer of a friend very stable and well.\nYou got almost every time the amount of fps you loocked in the options. (30 or 60)\nNothing more to add. Perfect performance for a game like this and for a game of this generation.\n10 / 10\n\nStorytelling\nThe game has a OK story but it is pretty long and has it plots and twists. Short cutscenes, short dialogs.\nI´d had it rated lower if it does´t have a playtime like this. If you play casual you can come through the story in something like 25 - 30 hours which is very long for singleplayer/or coop story without using the extra things and PvP a long time.\n7 / 10\n\nPossibilitys\nThe Crew offers a veeery big world to explore. To get from the west to the eastcoast you are driving something like 2-3 hours if you are fast. Also you got additional to the Storyraces and PvPstuff a tons of tests/skill mini missions where you can test your skills in some small disciplins. Escape fast, drive fast on a road, climb a hill and so on. If you want to get through everything you are going to have some 100 hours.\nIn addition The Crew offers a very good Tuning system. Optic tuning is back in business in a little bit smaller version of the "Need for Speed Underground 2" tuning possibilitys. Front, Back, Enginecover, Side, inside the car, outside the car, vinyls and weels. You can change many things in the optic again which is a must have for racing games in my opinion.\nThe powertuning is a little bit different. You get stuff after completing Missions and Skilltests. The bigger the level and the better you are, the better the stuff will be you are adding to your car. Later on you can get "Platinum-Rank" in every mission and skilltest which offers good stuff for your car in every skilltest and mission, the lowlevel ones and the highlevel ones.\nThere is a good variation of cars in this game, however i miss a little bit the cheap streetcars like in the beginning of Underground 2 which you had to tune from zero to hero. You start with a little bit besser "level" of cars. You can find tiles and build secret cars and you can buy cars from the carstores. In the end you will have a variation of something like 40-50 cars i guess.\nBig world, finally good tuning, many missions and extras. Its a racing game we waited for years to release.\n10 / 10\n\nServer Onlinetime\nSadly its an only online racing game which palys on a big Ubisoft server. (Or some servers, i dont know, you cant choose). You will put together with players in one session who are your ubisoft friends and who are on the same story-progression like you are.\nSo you will see allways your friends and possible helpers for your mission.\nServers are very stable in my eye. However, some disconnects happened to be true, but these didnt happen very often and i could play most of the time.\n9 / 10\n\nTotal Grade\nIf we put everything together and a little bit of my personal grad we will get this grade which is in my eye a true one. Pls dont forget to Comment if you have another opinion or want to add something :)\n9 / 10[/b]\n\n- Evilemerold","December 6, 2014","true","56.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having domination and customization at its core. As well, This game is ambitious to say the least, mapping the entire U.S.A to a scale that offers a surprizing veriety of locations to visit and scout. After a year they looked to reinvigorate the game by releasing a sort of overhauling DLC, adding new mechanics, game modes, and vehicle types, Even updating the graphics with new textures and weather effects. the DLC costs $30 but the base game has been reduced putting the whole game with the new overhaul somewhere around 40 - $50, which is well worth the entry for a great example of how to handle an aging brand without pumping out another game within an unrealistic deadline. The mechanics and physics are not on par with the best of the old Need for Speed arcade type open world racer, they feel very loose and a bit unpredictable at times, but for the overall experience the handling gets a pass by me. the open world and storyline feel overarcing and important, something we sorely lack in AAA titles these days, A sense of importance. One problem that holds this game back is the fact that it is set up as an MMO, which means microtransactions, which means spiked economy costs for things that a singleplayer would allow within much more reasonable values, if it were a singleplayer game it would probably have a much longer story and a much bigger payoff to upgrading cars and progressing, but instead we have every car roughly as fast as eachother and performance upgrades unlocking in a random loot counter sort of setup wich makes buying upgrades almost pointless. Just one example of how MMO is most often not the way to go with your game. I think the game would have greatly benefited on being singleplayer focused while having the same online components it already does, the MMO features in the core game are like any other AAA game that tries to go MMO, theyre pointless, its immerssion breaking, its economy stifling, it simply doesnt work.\n\nSo I give this game a 7/10 (Buy instead of that new NFS)\nFor a person whos played just about every racer under the sun, its a good game to have around if you want to play around in, from time to time, or just see the sites of the U.S in game form.","November 2, 2015","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I said easy fix, let us make a race and do our own checkpoints. Then i forgot about this game and a friend of mine gave me the DLC as a gift, and behold, exactly what I suggested happened.\n\nI put about another 40 hours into it already with my friends trying to increase our ranking in the wild run.\n\nThe only thing i don't like about this game is what they call SMART LOOT. You pretty much are forced into getting gold  just to get an upgrade to your car that only adds a point or 2 to the specs when you can get platinum which should be a better part. Sometimes smart loot gives you a part, but mostly a new color paint job that if i wanted I would buy. But with limited tuning that seems to not matter in the end with a mini cooper with the same specs as a hyper car. It wouldve been fine to cap off lower end cars, it would have made the game more fun to get faster cars and actually made the season pass worth it.\n\n7/10 with friends\n5/10 solo","January 4","true","179.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just completed it today. Today being 4 days after i got it, and i've racked up just over 23 hours of playtime. And oh boy.\n\nSummed up, this game is essentially the result of throwing Test Drive Unlimited 2, Driver: San Fransisco and Need For Speed: Undercover intro a breeding pen together. Being a massive fan of TDU and the Driver series, i'd say that sounds pretty damn good.\nIt has the exploration and collectibles of TDU2, the "undercover ex-street racer who was jailed up but picked by the FBI to catch bad guys" plotline, which i suppose is a mix of D:SF and NFSU, and then the attention to detail around the maps and customization of TDU2.\n\nThe plotline is pretty short. Like i mentioned earlier, i completed the storyline within 23 hours, and that's with quite some extra time added into exploration. You could probably sprint trough the game in 17/18 hours. Though, the exploration is what makes this game so enjoyable. Like, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's a unicorn and a bigfoot walking around for you to almost run over in your Paris-Dakar specced muscle cars and circuit spec classic cruisemobiles.\n\nThe map is large. Very, very large. It's basically the entire US, and even though it's downscaled, you'll still spend over an hour getting from one end of the map to the other. It's also surprisingly well detailed, with a ton of stuff to discover, like a giant ski jump to launch your car off, or 5 different race tracks, or wrecked cars, which is another thing very similar to TDU2.\n\nIt's a good time if you enjoy cars and exploring ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOh, and TD;LR if you can't be arsed to read my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review:\n\nUbisoft didn't ♥♥♥♥ up","October 20, 2015","true","49.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Therefore i wish the game had more "modifiable" graphics where i can choose what the graphics card focuses mostly on. Such as for example, car quality over cloud/sunray quality (For example).\n- I do feel like it's not a super great racing game, where as i got my hopes up while watching trailers and such.\n\nPro's:\n-Game looks amazing\n-Great details on car, great details on to be honest, anything graphic wise.\n- Very "rookie" friendly, i believe anyone could enjoy this game\n\n\nIn general, i do very much recommend this game if they fix the cars driving and drifting control.

The Crew is a Open World Racing Game with MMO and Coop features.\nYou get into the role of a racer named Alex who gets pretty much trouble with the group 5-10 of his brother. After his death you are on the way to get revenge!\n\nPls dont be too angry to me and my language. I´m not the best in writing english, but i want to tell you my opinion of this game, because it deserves to be telled of :)\n\nShort Version\n- Graphics: 7 / 10\n- Performance: 10 / 10\n- Storytelling: 7 / 10\n- Possibilitys: 10 / 10\n- Server-Onlinetime: 9 / 10\n\n► Total Grade: 9 / 10\n\n\nLong Version\n\nGraphics\nThe Graphics of this game are pretty good and well done for a racing game being that big. But compared to other titles released today not the best and detailed one. Not saying that they are almost perfect for a game like this, its still not the best it could be.\nShader is well done, also the Antialising. Textures are well but not that detailed and a little bit "spongy" if you are looking close to them. However, its a well done composition of textures and it´s nice for the eye.\n7 / 10\n\nPerformance\nDue to the fact, that this game has a dang big world to explore and the graphics are pretty nice the performance is incredible. I was surprised that this game runs on a very low quality computer of a friend very stable and well.\nYou got almost every time the amount of fps you loocked in the options. (30 or 60)\nNothing more to add. Perfect performance for a game like this and for a game of this generation.\n10 / 10\n\nStorytelling\nThe game has a OK story but it is pretty long and has it plots and twists. Short cutscenes, short dialogs.\nI´d had it rated lower if it does´t have a playtime like this. If you play casual you can come through the story in something like 25 - 30 hours which is very long for singleplayer/or coop story without using the extra things and PvP a long time.\n7 / 10\n\nPossibilitys\nThe Crew offers a veeery big world to explore. To get from the west to the eastcoast you are driving something like 2-3 hours if you are fast. Also you got additional to the Storyraces and PvPstuff a tons of tests/skill mini missions where you can test your skills in some small disciplins. Escape fast, drive fast on a road, climb a hill and so on. If you want to get through everything you are going to have some 100 hours.\nIn addition The Crew offers a very good Tuning system. Optic tuning is back in business in a little bit smaller version of the "Need for Speed Underground 2" tuning possibilitys. Front, Back, Enginecover, Side, inside the car, outside the car, vinyls and weels. You can change many things in the optic again which is a must have for racing games in my opinion.\nThe powertuning is a little bit different. You get stuff after completing Missions and Skilltests. The bigger the level and the better you are, the better the stuff will be you are adding to your car. Later on you can get "Platinum-Rank" in every mission and skilltest which offers good stuff for your car in every skilltest and mission, the lowlevel ones and the highlevel ones.\nThere is a good variation of cars in this game, however i miss a little bit the cheap streetcars like in the beginning of Underground 2 which you had to tune from zero to hero. You start with a little bit besser "level" of cars. You can find tiles and build secret cars and you can buy cars from the carstores. In the end you will have a variation of something like 40-50 cars i guess.\nBig world, finally good tuning, many missions and extras. Its a racing game we waited for years to release.\n10 / 10\n\nServer Onlinetime\nSadly its an only online racing game which palys on a big Ubisoft server. (Or some servers, i dont know, you cant choose). You will put together with players in one session who are your ubisoft friends and who are on the same story-progression like you are.\nSo you will see allways your friends and possible helpers for your mission.\nServers are very stable in my eye. However, some disconnects happened to be true, but these didnt happen very often and i could play most of the time.\n9 / 10\n\nTotal Grade\nIf we put everything together and a little bit of my personal grad we will get this grade which is in my eye a true one. Pls dont forget to Comment if you have another opinion or want to add something :)\n9 / 10[/b]\n\n- Evilemerold","December 6, 2014","true","56.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure, right after the release - when I got it - the game didn't feel finished in any way. I myself was a bit disapointed, but still played on. The reason I got the game was because of the HUGE map, which was in pretty good shape at the time. The cars didn't feel too realistic and I didn't feel the "feeling" I was expecting. But still, I plaed it, because I just bought it and wanted to try it out. I then stopped playing it for a couple of months as I had other things to do. Then a while back I started playing it again. The feeling was completley different. The cars were updated from the last time I played, and countless bugfixes had been fixed. I played it with my brother and had really fun! (Except the graphics I have on it as my computer is pretty bad xD) So would I recomend this game? Well, it depends. If you can relate to all of the following you should pick it up, and you will have a great time. So:\n\n-If you have friends that play it\n-If you like car games, but your not looking for a super realistic simulator\n-If you want a HUGE open world to explore\n\nSo the first point is really important. If you have friends to play with. If you don't, it will get boring after a while. You basicly just sit there driving arround. This is after all a game made for multiplayer. Although the "story mode" which is still in the online world was better than I expected.\n\nSo overall should you buy this? Well if you have friends that play it, yes, of you don't well it's still wuite fun as you can still find people online to talk with, but it is not as fun as cruising arround with your frineds. If your unsure I sugests that you pick it up during a Steam sale of any sort. At the monent while typing this, there is a 50% discount due to the steam summer sale.\n\nI hope this helped you, and I would recomend this game. (Maybe due to my 88 hours playtime xD)","June 17, 2015","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepinkiegamer/recommended/241560/","thepinkiegamer","ThePinkieGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepinkiegamer/","112 products in account","There are few games I actually like enough to write reviews about (and they mostly suck in quality too) but this game desereves an honest review.\n\nOfcourse a lot of people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the season pass not including the Wild Run DLC but I never bought a season pass or the wild run, I just bought this game on sale because I wanted to play an good looking open world racing game and this one was worth the 14 euros I spend on it in a sale.\n\nSo lets start with the story\n\nMany racing games lack a story entirely or just have a basic one.\nThis game is no difference, although the game has a lot more effort in giving a race an purpose, every race has a few lines of voice acting giving the context why you do it. so its not just "why did I just ram some random car off the road" in which the game responds "because OH HEY LOOK REWARDS!"\n\nThe story itself to spoil the least, Alex Taylor is a racer that wants to join the 5-10's but on the day he would get his ink his brother gets shot by Shiv and then you pretty much try to raise yourself in the 5-10 ranks to get revenge. (again im pretty much just explaining it bare bones there is a lot more to it).\n\nFor a racing game story i'll give it a: 7/10\nFor a general game story its a: 5/10 characters dont get any in-depth story\n\nGraphics\n\nThe Graphics in this game are really good. shadows look great. cars super detailed. first person driving looks great too. Rain is stunning.\n\nNight time is a little bright if you aren't in a shadow or if it' s raining. the world itself is detailed and there are people on the streets just walking around, some carrying stuff. (i even hit some hobo with a shopping trolley once) there is also wildlife running around from squirrels to moose. (Ofcourse it being a ubisoft game there is no senseless killing so you cant actually hit the people or animals) The forests feel dense and real.\n\nThere is even an in-game photo mode which allows you to take your own pictures in a higher resolution then you actually run the game. I have made a ton of screenshots using it and I even have a few new Computer backgrounds thanks to it.\n\nThere are a few pre-rendered cutscenes. Which im actually still trying to figure out if they are real recordings with the character models 3d rendered into them or if they are actually modelled so well that they look photo realistic.\n\nThe bad few things include:\n\nA few floating rocks and tree's in forest areas off track.\n\nCharacter faces in game up close are really ugly compared to the rest of the game.\n\nshort draw distance on cars (detailing like spoilers dissapear if they go a little far away even on ultra). wheel tracks also do not stay long, in the ending cutscene the camera pans into the distance following your car which is outside of the draw distance so it isent visible. Dust trails are really small (so small that if you look behind yourself in first person you dont see any dirt/dust kick up)\n\nMirror's have no real time reflection. (only like GTA V does. reflects low res world but no cars or anything) No option to enable a HUD rear view mirror.\nAI cars in photo-mode dissapear after a short while due to the fact that the game is online and the cars drive on going beyond draw distance and de-spawning.\n\nGraphically for a racing game this is the prettiest game I have played. 9/10 (compared to other racing games like Need for speed)\n\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nFirst the biggest thing I like is the fact that there are more then 2 cars on the road. on highways in major cities you can actually end up just rushing past a continous row of cars. so driving on roads feel actually used instead of the ghost roads you drive on in games like Need For Speed.\n\nCars handle pretty good, feel heavy and in control. I barely drove any other cars then the forced cars and the starting car you pick though. (yes you can easily complete the whole game with the starting car), I've only had 3 occasions of physics doing weird and getting launched at crazy speeds. a few AI cars also glitch sometimes but there is nothing massive as far as i noticed.\n\nThe special thing about this game is the always online world.\n\nSo far as i noticed the map is devided in section servers. Major cities have a special server and the country around those cities have seperate servers. I personally have a good internet connection and the server crossings have been seamless. no lag, no freezes, no "connecting to server" stuff.\n\nOfcourse if you are like me you coulden't care less about the online stuff and rather don't have any online stuff.\nthere sadly isen't a offline mode. but the game plays pretty much single player, nothing online is forced on you, you could play it as if it were a single player game. Every race can be done solo (meaning you and AI).\n\nThe AI is easy. As far as I noticed there is no difficulty curve (but this could also be because racing might be one of the game types im decently skilled at) The difficulty is addaptive to your cars level. so if a mission says its hard it's most likely easy if you actually know how to drive well. I even ended up having a 10 second split time on a hard mission.\n\nI should also not forget to mention that this game is not your generic "buy parts in the shop to upgrade" type. you unlock the parts after every race depending on how well you did. so being first doesent mean a gold part.  once you reach level 50 (the max level) you get platinum ratings which use "smart loot" as far as i noticed its not that smart and is just an fancy name for "randomized loot"\n\nThere are also on road skill challenges a few are:\n\nSpeed: drive on the road as fast and far as possible\nJump: Jump over a ramp into a landing zone\nPrecision: squeeze through gates that become smaller and smaller\nSlalom: drive around posts\n\nThese also use the bronze, silver, gold loot system.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis game also features Cops. Which are no threat at all and barely worth mentioning except for in the "escape from the cops" missions.\nThey barely do anything. you can speed past them at 300 Kmp/h and then wont do a thing.\nThe only few times i've gotten in a chase was when I purposely rammed the cop car or rammed a bunch of AI cars and objects.\n\nIf you do manage to get into a chase. well they arent that good either. if you want to have a good chase your better off playing Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted 2005.\n\nYou can get 6 stars which only changes how many cars chase you. at 4 you get a helicopter after you (which is the only hard enemy to lose) Road blocks are mostly 1 car and a police sign or on highways like 3 cars and a sign so easily avoided and they will not use Spike Strips or anything like that.\n\nYou can't disable the road skills meaning you either have to go around or start it and then close it via your phone.\n\n\nI still rate gameplay an 8/10 due to how good the cars felt\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nNot so much to say about the soundtrack. most missions have a special soundtrack which is mostly dramatic orchestral and a bit electric.\n\nThe in-game radio stations aren't that great either. I mainly listened to 2 of them, Koda boom for in the city and Sine wave digital for the countryside.\nThere is a "custom" playlist option which means "pick songs from our radio stations!" and no importing of your own music.\n(a huge thing that bugged me was how the power glove songs (from Far cry 3 blood dragon) still had the in game sound effects in them. You made the game how do you not have a clean version!)\n\nIn races where there was no special soundtrack I would open my steam overlay and just look up some other music.\n\nSo the music in this game gets a 4/10 you might like the tracks in the game though. It's just a matter of taste.\n\nStory. Graphics. Gameplay. sountrack. that's about everything I think, and im running out of Review space.\nWell for the TL:DR people:\nits a good racing game that is worth playing if on sale.\n\nrating 8/10","March 29","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Each spec you unlock changes how you play, and upgrading your vehicle is rewarding and challenging. Community events, plans for additional vehicles and features, and a strong fanbase/developer relationship means that The Crew has a bright future. The only downside is that a constant internet connection is required to play due to the MMO aspect, but considering no one seems to complain about World of Warcraft needing a constant network connection to play, I find it difficult to justify that complaint.

It's that good. It would take a large amount of hours to completely explore the map. I still haven't completely expored it in my many hour playtime. It takes about an hour (if you are going very fast) tho get from one side of the map to the other. It just such a fun map to drive around, to take a road trip, and to see all kinds of fabulous landmarks throughput your journeys.\n\n-Everything about the cars\nAll the cars have lots of detal, interior and exterior. They are all different to drive, and unique in their own ways. Also, all the sounds for the cars are the legit real life sounds, recorded from the cars in a sound studion. SO nice.\n\n---\n\nThings I like\n\n-Customization of car\nThe customization is quite good, especially compared to most of the recent need for speed games. The only problem is the customizations seem too concrete, there is no ability to add your own imagination or personal touch. Some stickers have different colors, but you can't change the color of a specific sticker. Also, each sticker goes on a certain, unchangable place on the car. You can make your car different than others, because there a large number of aesthetic parts and stickers.\n\n-Car specs\nI really like how the car can utilize many different utilities by changing the spec. There are 5 specs: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. They are all fun to experiment with. Some are great for the racetrack, while others are great for offroad trails. My only gripe about specs is that very few cars have the full 5 specs, most have 1-3 of the the specs. The starter cars all have the full 5 specs, so you will be able to have them all in at least one car.\n\n-The story\nIt is surprising for a good story to be in a racing game, but in this case that surprise came true. It may seem cheesy and cliche to some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n-The graphics\nThey aren't amazing by any means, but they are good. They capture american geography well (with a few minor hiccups) but there are many current racing games that have better graphics. They are definitely not bad though, they still make the game nice looking. The best graphics in the game are seen in some of the cutscenes. Legitimate movie quality cutscences.\n\n---\n\nThings i dont like\n\n-The "mmo" aspect of the game\nOnly 8 players in your session, and they players continually switch to different players, so, yeah, no. I still don't really know how to play with my friends, because there is no server choice, just places you in one.\n\n-Not that many cars\nThere really should be more.\n\n-Anything that has to do with AI\nOther racers, cops, even NPC traffic. All equally annoying.\n\n-Customization of your character\nNonexistent. Hopefully you are okay with the way you look, cuz you can't change that.\n\n---\n\nThings I HATE\n\n-ubisoft\n-uplay\n-ubisoft support\n-uplay servers\n-ubisoft bugs\n-uplay bugs\n-ubisoft glitches\n-uplay glitches\n-ubisoft in general\n-uplay in general\n\nFortunately, ubisoft only published this game not developed, so it isn't UNPLAYABLE (i.e. ACU) a good company called Ivory Tower made it, which was responsible for some other open world maps (i.e. GTA 4) Some things about the game just seem buggy and unfinished, not because of Ivory Tower, but because of ubisoft. It just seems like with the many delays the game should be PERFECT but it isn't.\n\nAnd now, for the thing I HATE the most about the crew, the following is a reddit rant that i put onto /r/The_Crew/ :\n\nOriginally posted by author of this review: There is one thing that i just can't get past about this game: THE MIRRORS DON'T WORK! I mean SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHY?!?!??! test drive unlimted from THE 80'S has working mirrors.\nhttp:// http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xSvpmi79ZXY/0.jpg  <---FREAKING 8 BIT MIRRORS! and the crew doesn't. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n3 reasons why the crew doesn't have mirrors\n1. ...\n2. ...\n3. ...\nDon't get me wrong I love the game but.....I JUST CAN'T GET PAST THAT\n\nOk thanks for reading all that. I'm done now.\nThe good conclusion:\nThe game's main feature, a big map, is DEFINITELY true. The map, the cars, the graphics, all together make the game an great, interesting, and fun experience.\n\nThe bad conclusion:\nThe online, which was the other big feature, fails to deliver. There are many online problems and bugs that make some give up on the game. But I am not a quitter.\n\nMy Rating:\n\n8/10\nFinal conclusion (tl;dr) :\nThis game offers an amazing experience, one that I have never seen in any other game. Simply being able to take a trip down a desert highway, explore a mountain, race around a city, and explore the entirety of the United states is something that no other game has ever done so beautifully.\nOverall great game, beautiful map, beautiful cars, just some problems that need addressing. My rating is subject to go up if those improvements are made. The crew is definitely my favorite driving game, and it will never get old or boring.\nWith a map the size of the U.S., how could it?\n\nHappy driving!","January 4, 2015","true","183.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are nice and the cars are cool and there are lots of customization option which is always nice. The fact that their are cities that look just like real life is awesome! I would recommend this game to someone who likes racing games or even driving becuase I could cruise around this awesome map for hours. So this is Ubisoft meaning it could be a pretty big price tag. This game is often not on sale so it is expensive but it is worth it.

Sure, right after the release - when I got it - the game didn't feel finished in any way. I myself was a bit disapointed, but still played on. The reason I got the game was because of the HUGE map, which was in pretty good shape at the time. The cars didn't feel too realistic and I didn't feel the "feeling" I was expecting. But still, I plaed it, because I just bought it and wanted to try it out. I then stopped playing it for a couple of months as I had other things to do. Then a while back I started playing it again. The feeling was completley different. The cars were updated from the last time I played, and countless bugfixes had been fixed. I played it with my brother and had really fun! (Except the graphics I have on it as my computer is pretty bad xD) So would I recomend this game? Well, it depends. If you can relate to all of the following you should pick it up, and you will have a great time. So:\n\n-If you have friends that play it\n-If you like car games, but your not looking for a super realistic simulator\n-If you want a HUGE open world to explore\n\nSo the first point is really important. If you have friends to play with. If you don't, it will get boring after a while. You basicly just sit there driving arround. This is after all a game made for multiplayer. Although the "story mode" which is still in the online world was better than I expected.\n\nSo overall should you buy this? Well if you have friends that play it, yes, of you don't well it's still wuite fun as you can still find people online to talk with, but it is not as fun as cruising arround with your frineds. If your unsure I sugests that you pick it up during a Steam sale of any sort. At the monent while typing this, there is a 50% discount due to the steam summer sale.\n\nI hope this helped you, and I would recomend this game. (Maybe due to my 88 hours playtime xD)","June 17, 2015","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepinkiegamer/recommended/241560/","thepinkiegamer","ThePinkieGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepinkiegamer/","112 products in account","There are few games I actually like enough to write reviews about (and they mostly suck in quality too) but this game desereves an honest review.\n\nOfcourse a lot of people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the season pass not including the Wild Run DLC but I never bought a season pass or the wild run, I just bought this game on sale because I wanted to play an good looking open world racing game and this one was worth the 14 euros I spend on it in a sale.\n\nSo lets start with the story\n\nMany racing games lack a story entirely or just have a basic one.\nThis game is no difference, although the game has a lot more effort in giving a race an purpose, every race has a few lines of voice acting giving the context why you do it. so its not just "why did I just ram some random car off the road" in which the game responds "because OH HEY LOOK REWARDS!"\n\nThe story itself to spoil the least, Alex Taylor is a racer that wants to join the 5-10's but on the day he would get his ink his brother gets shot by Shiv and then you pretty much try to raise yourself in the 5-10 ranks to get revenge. (again im pretty much just explaining it bare bones there is a lot more to it).\n\nFor a racing game story i'll give it a: 7/10\nFor a general game story its a: 5/10 characters dont get any in-depth story\n\nGraphics\n\nThe Graphics in this game are really good. shadows look great. cars super detailed. first person driving looks great too. Rain is stunning.\n\nNight time is a little bright if you aren't in a shadow or if it' s raining. the world itself is detailed and there are people on the streets just walking around, some carrying stuff. (i even hit some hobo with a shopping trolley once) there is also wildlife running around from squirrels to moose. (Ofcourse it being a ubisoft game there is no senseless killing so you cant actually hit the people or animals) The forests feel dense and real.\n\nThere is even an in-game photo mode which allows you to take your own pictures in a higher resolution then you actually run the game. I have made a ton of screenshots using it and I even have a few new Computer backgrounds thanks to it.\n\nThere are a few pre-rendered cutscenes. Which im actually still trying to figure out if they are real recordings with the character models 3d rendered into them or if they are actually modelled so well that they look photo realistic.\n\nThe bad few things include:\n\nA few floating rocks and tree's in forest areas off track.\n\nCharacter faces in game up close are really ugly compared to the rest of the game.\n\nshort draw distance on cars (detailing like spoilers dissapear if they go a little far away even on ultra). wheel tracks also do not stay long, in the ending cutscene the camera pans into the distance following your car which is outside of the draw distance so it isent visible. Dust trails are really small (so small that if you look behind yourself in first person you dont see any dirt/dust kick up)\n\nMirror's have no real time reflection. (only like GTA V does. reflects low res world but no cars or anything) No option to enable a HUD rear view mirror.\nAI cars in photo-mode dissapear after a short while due to the fact that the game is online and the cars drive on going beyond draw distance and de-spawning.\n\nGraphically for a racing game this is the prettiest game I have played. 9/10 (compared to other racing games like Need for speed)\n\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nFirst the biggest thing I like is the fact that there are more then 2 cars on the road. on highways in major cities you can actually end up just rushing past a continous row of cars. so driving on roads feel actually used instead of the ghost roads you drive on in games like Need For Speed.\n\nCars handle pretty good, feel heavy and in control. I barely drove any other cars then the forced cars and the starting car you pick though. (yes you can easily complete the whole game with the starting car), I've only had 3 occasions of physics doing weird and getting launched at crazy speeds. a few AI cars also glitch sometimes but there is nothing massive as far as i noticed.\n\nThe special thing about this game is the always online world.\n\nSo far as i noticed the map is devided in section servers. Major cities have a special server and the country around those cities have seperate servers. I personally have a good internet connection and the server crossings have been seamless. no lag, no freezes, no "connecting to server" stuff.\n\nOfcourse if you are like me you coulden't care less about the online stuff and rather don't have any online stuff.\nthere sadly isen't a offline mode. but the game plays pretty much single player, nothing online is forced on you, you could play it as if it were a single player game. Every race can be done solo (meaning you and AI).\n\nThe AI is easy. As far as I noticed there is no difficulty curve (but this could also be because racing might be one of the game types im decently skilled at) The difficulty is addaptive to your cars level. so if a mission says its hard it's most likely easy if you actually know how to drive well. I even ended up having a 10 second split time on a hard mission.\n\nI should also not forget to mention that this game is not your generic "buy parts in the shop to upgrade" type. you unlock the parts after every race depending on how well you did. so being first doesent mean a gold part.  once you reach level 50 (the max level) you get platinum ratings which use "smart loot" as far as i noticed its not that smart and is just an fancy name for "randomized loot"\n\nThere are also on road skill challenges a few are:\n\nSpeed: drive on the road as fast and far as possible\nJump: Jump over a ramp into a landing zone\nPrecision: squeeze through gates that become smaller and smaller\nSlalom: drive around posts\n\nThese also use the bronze, silver, gold loot system.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis game also features Cops. Which are no threat at all and barely worth mentioning except for in the "escape from the cops" missions.\nThey barely do anything. you can speed past them at 300 Kmp/h and then wont do a thing.\nThe only few times i've gotten in a chase was when I purposely rammed the cop car or rammed a bunch of AI cars and objects.\n\nIf you do manage to get into a chase. well they arent that good either. if you want to have a good chase your better off playing Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted 2005.\n\nYou can get 6 stars which only changes how many cars chase you. at 4 you get a helicopter after you (which is the only hard enemy to lose) Road blocks are mostly 1 car and a police sign or on highways like 3 cars and a sign so easily avoided and they will not use Spike Strips or anything like that.\n\nYou can't disable the road skills meaning you either have to go around or start it and then close it via your phone.\n\n\nI still rate gameplay an 8/10 due to how good the cars felt\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nNot so much to say about the soundtrack. most missions have a special soundtrack which is mostly dramatic orchestral and a bit electric.\n\nThe in-game radio stations aren't that great either. I mainly listened to 2 of them, Koda boom for in the city and Sine wave digital for the countryside.\nThere is a "custom" playlist option which means "pick songs from our radio stations!" and no importing of your own music.\n(a huge thing that bugged me was how the power glove songs (from Far cry 3 blood dragon) still had the in game sound effects in them. You made the game how do you not have a clean version!)\n\nIn races where there was no special soundtrack I would open my steam overlay and just look up some other music.\n\nSo the music in this game gets a 4/10 you might like the tracks in the game though. It's just a matter of taste.\n\nStory. Graphics. Gameplay. sountrack. that's about everything I think, and im running out of Review space.\nWell for the TL:DR people:\nits a good racing game that is worth playing if on sale.\n\nrating 8/10","March 29","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm definitely not a big fan of online gaming, but I did give it a try on this game and I will admit that I did enjoy it. What PISSES me off about this game is the fact that for certain challenges (in story mode) they computer AI CHEATS LIKE A MOTHER F*@#ER and it drove my blood to boil a lot of times, to the point that I almost threw my controller at the computer monitor. I wish they would 1, allow for different difficulty modes, especially for those people that are more about story line than gameplay, and 2, that they would allow for the use of trainers/cheats for the campaign only part of the game. I thought the visuals were pretty stunning, particularly the settings. I really loved the whole continental US map which you can freely drive to your heart's content. I wish they would have an update that would allow for a road trip to Alaska, that would just be AWESOME! Anyway, I do recommmend the game, however be warned you will lose your cool at some point... If you're that type of gamer that hates it when the computer AI cheats both the physics, and the fact that the other drivers are always faster than you, despite having a higher levle car than the suggested level on screen.","May 20","true","42.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought this game with a friend and he and I mostly play together and that is extremely fun.\n\nThe story is just ok, not great but who cares this is a racing game.  There are not a lot of cars in the game at the moment but that is ok all of the cars in the game a really nice.  I drive from inside the car with the dash board view, unless I am doing the missions where you run through a banner as you go because it takes you off road and you are usually running through brush and you just can't see from inside.\n\nI really like this game and came into it with no preconceived notions about what to expect.  My buddy and I just spent 2 1/2 hours just driving and unlocking more of the map occasionally doing fun side races.\n\nThis brings me back to the old original test drive games way back when.\n\nI really really like this game and the only con I have at the moment is I do get discord and it takes 15 to 20 minutes to get back on.\n\nThis is an Mmo but just like most new mmo's you don't have to play with other people.","December 7, 2014","true","115.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But you can't "customize" your car, you can only add packages, i.e. street package, performance package, with some flexibility otherwise. Graphics aren't the greatest, but gameplay is more important. Well, offline gameplay is, considering the community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. What people like to do is form little posses of 3 or 4 cars, then find solo players just cruisin' around and run them off the road to the point where online gameplay is literally intolerable, since you can't drive anywhere. On top of that, grandma's Nissan has the same physics as a Dodge Ram 1500, so theres no way to defend yourself. To add insult to injury, I bought the "game of the year" edition, or whatever they're calling it now. So thats just 85 bucks down the drain.\n\nIf I still haven't turned you off yet, I'd like to mention that you need UPlay to run this game. What's UPlay? It's like Steam, for Ubisoft. UPlay and Steam hate each other. It's nearly impossable to get in a game with people from your friends list because it's so hard to get Steam and UPlay\nto work together.\n\nStill need more? Recently there was an update for The Crew that added a new feature called "Wild Run". Wild Run is 25 dollars, regardless of whether you bought the season pass. What? I just paid 85 dollars for your game and I still don't have everything? Now, Wild Run includes a feature for the player to do races with other players, which was availible as a part of base game. Was. Now, unless you pay\nUbisoft even MORE money, you can no longer play with other people, which was the original intent of the game; multiplayer co-op racing. Ubisoft just decided that it was a good idea to completely disable the most vital part of the game in favor of petty amounts of profit.\n\nUbisoft finally managed to build an average, somewhat likeable game, and completely ruined it by trying to squeeze profits out of it like toothpaste out of an empty tube. I strongly advise against this game, not because it isn't fun, but because it costs WAY too much money to have fun. Don't be a part of Ubisoft's scam like I did.","January 22, 2015","false","12.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There's literally nothing to do but race around, and while it is a racing game, the trailers hinted at other forms of gameplay and much more exciting cinematics. It's not a bad game, but its not a good game either. The story is pretty minimal compared to most games, and trying to tie this story into a continually running server-based platform makes for some really annoying drive times.\n\nAlso we were promised the whole country, as though that would be to scale. Nope. Everything has been scaled down so that most of the cities are a third of their actual sizes. I threw down a lot of money for this game because I thought I would be getting a lot out of it. Really, because of the setup we actually got, I say this game is worth no more than $30. If the animations and the LOD look right up your alley, you might be inspired to pay $40. But never is it ever worth the full AAA studio pricing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo now that we have Wild Run, I guess the only thing I can say is WHY didn't I get it with my season pass?

Cities are shrunken caricatures, but the truly vast sweeping tracts of land between them means traversing it really does capture the spirit of a cross-country, city-to-city road trip better than any driving game before it. Plenty of racing games curate a bunch of different backdrops into their track selections, from urban street races in major American metropolitan centres to icy blasts across snow-swept mountains, flat-out sprints across the baking desert, or muddy expeditions through giant Sequoia forests. The Crew admirably does all this in a single game world you can drive across in one lengthy session.\nThis girth has come at a cost, though. It’s a world that looks fine whipping by you at speed, but it favours sheer size over the kind of granular detail we now expect in modern open world racers. Cities are smattered with recognisable landmarks but don’t really seem built to stand up to stationary scrutiny. Combined with low-detailed NPC cars (complete with entirely black, opaque glass), some forgettable effects (splashing water is especially dire), no weather, and the fact that the models of the 40-or-so cars are in a league below those of contemporaries like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub, The Crew struggles to shake the look of a game several years older than it actually is.","July 19, 2015","true","122.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But you can't "customize" your car, you can only add packages, i.e. street package, performance package, with some flexibility otherwise. Graphics aren't the greatest, but gameplay is more important. Well, offline gameplay is, considering the community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. What people like to do is form little posses of 3 or 4 cars, then find solo players just cruisin' around and run them off the road to the point where online gameplay is literally intolerable, since you can't drive anywhere. On top of that, grandma's Nissan has the same physics as a Dodge Ram 1500, so theres no way to defend yourself. To add insult to injury, I bought the "game of the year" edition, or whatever they're calling it now. So thats just 85 bucks down the drain.\n\nIf I still haven't turned you off yet, I'd like to mention that you need UPlay to run this game. What's UPlay? It's like Steam, for Ubisoft. UPlay and Steam hate each other. It's nearly impossable to get in a game with people from your friends list because it's so hard to get Steam and UPlay\nto work together.\n\nStill need more? Recently there was an update for The Crew that added a new feature called "Wild Run". Wild Run is 25 dollars, regardless of whether you bought the season pass. What? I just paid 85 dollars for your game and I still don't have everything? Now, Wild Run includes a feature for the player to do races with other players, which was availible as a part of base game. Was. Now, unless you pay\nUbisoft even MORE money, you can no longer play with other people, which was the original intent of the game; multiplayer co-op racing. Ubisoft just decided that it was a good idea to completely disable the most vital part of the game in favor of petty amounts of profit.\n\nUbisoft finally managed to build an average, somewhat likeable game, and completely ruined it by trying to squeeze profits out of it like toothpaste out of an empty tube. I strongly advise against this game, not because it isn't fun, but because it costs WAY too much money to have fun. Don't be a part of Ubisoft's scam like I did.","January 22, 2015","false","12.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There's literally nothing to do but race around, and while it is a racing game, the trailers hinted at other forms of gameplay and much more exciting cinematics. It's not a bad game, but its not a good game either. The story is pretty minimal compared to most games, and trying to tie this story into a continually running server-based platform makes for some really annoying drive times.\n\nAlso we were promised the whole country, as though that would be to scale. Nope. Everything has been scaled down so that most of the cities are a third of their actual sizes. I threw down a lot of money for this game because I thought I would be getting a lot out of it. Really, because of the setup we actually got, I say this game is worth no more than $30. If the animations and the LOD look right up your alley, you might be inspired to pay $40. But never is it ever worth the full AAA studio pricing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo now that we have Wild Run, I guess the only thing I can say is WHY didn't I get it with my season pass?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cornerer/recommended/241560/","Cornerer","FlatOut 4 Coming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cornerer/","33 products in account","MUST NOT BUY for following major reasons:\n\n1. EXTREMELY BUGGY since the launch of game. Unacceptable issues has been brought up with almost every month's patch which makes us nearly think they're here to make the game worse: how the car viewing angle turned 90deg with chase cam when your car's overlapping another opponent's car in no collision race (solved), stuttering issues for high-end PCs (NOT SOLVED AFTER A YEAR), nitrous not working for online races with manual without at least 1 car reset since Wild Run, NOT SOLVED WHAT THE... , and this March patch what has just turned up? ATI and Nvidea graphics users might not even able to start the game and game crash straight away.\n\n2. RUBBISH car physics. Even by arcade standards the physics are pure trolls, EVEN AFTER WILD RUN. For god sake Ubisoft your game engine is based on Atari's Test Drive Unlimited 2. How the hell  could you possibly make it so much worse than that game what the FU*K? O_O TDU2 at least has friendly controls while still retains bit of realism, if by no means much ... but you Ubi, bikes that can go to complete stop from 350km/h/220MPH in less than 2 seconds plus hit the wall at almost 90deg and still no crash, catch-up mechanics and INSANE AMOUNT of slipstream that can allow a car to override top speed by 70km/h and TOTALLY ruins online competition, collision physics that allows your car to "skid" past traffic even when u hit them head on, race cars that can go 420km/h with those huge wings+corner 50% faster than in reality ... it's honestly disgusting in its own way. I rather have something even more detached from reality (e.g. Burnout, Ridge Racer) than experiencing your half-♥♥♥♥♥ efforts trying to go for poor extents of realism.\n\n2.5. Extra steering rate for non-DirectInput controllers and steering wheels. Ehm yes ... if u uses either 1 of them you have an unfair advantage of being able to steer the front wheels so much at any speeds and the car can still response to such even at likes of 300km/h because of bullsh*t overpowered tire physics.\n\n3. Poor online structure. In simplest terms, The Crew uses some of the worst multiplayer connection programming which results in players in the same lobby who're not host to have latency. This often ends up with the host "off-sync" from his actual positions causing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff including both palyers slipstreaming each other on their own screens and the 3th place host player in a close finish ended up 1st in result screen. "Summit" tracks also lacking checkpoints real badly, forcing top players to go for insane shortcuts for majority of them.\n\nIf you really want to buy a racing game from Ubisoft, honestly, I rather hope you may consider trying out "POD GOLD" which is from the f**k-graphics 90s and you can download from GOG site for just $5.99 featuring compatibility for Windows 7 or above. Yes it's full arcade physics and no graphics quality to talk about, but it's got beautifully designed track layout + AI difficulty that can put you to smile for losing so badly just like those games in arcade centres. I can safely bet for most POD is even better than this piece of typical modern crap which other gaming companies seemed to have learnt from EA's NFS somehow just to steal money from kids. Topping with Ubi's Assassin's incident, I swear I would never buy Ubi's racing game for the 3rd time.","March 25","false","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Who knows how many other bugs are in the game yet to be fixed. So until this game gets some bug fixes I'd avoid it.

On a high end rig that can easily support Arma 3, this game runs smooth but has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of occasional framespikes which cause you to ram into something at high speeds.\n\nNow don't get me wrong; even when i was high i wasn't blind: i saw the game's description claiming it's ment for high-end PC's and next gen consoles, but that's just a very very weak way of saying "Our game doesn't even look that good but runs like ♥♥♥♥, if you complain we'll blame it on your specs!".\n\nIn reality the game itself looks very very meh. I've only played a couple of missions so far and from what i've seen the world is empty and very forced at looking alive.\nFor example, you see the low res environment around you (and yes, it really does look ugly and different than the cars), and you realise it's just a HUGE big open map with forced events. You'll have a cop car race out an alley and stand there as if he's going to chase you, you'll have fake people driving around to create the illusion you're not in a boring old sandbox and you'll be reminded how bad the game really looks for the framerate lag you have to pull yourself through to compensate for it.\n\n\nHas a lot of potential but you'd need a 2000/3000€ pc to run this "like the publishers suggest".\nWhich kind of just means they didn't feel like optimising this bad port and you are to blame for not having a better PC.\n\nHaven't gotten into the game that much but the driving is extremely simple and the physics are trash. I rammed into some cops at the opening sequence and proceeded to ram the fake players i encountered on my way from race to race, what i saw was my giant truck and my majestic american muscle car get twirled around like the physics engine went "What the ♥♥♥♥ bro this isn't my job i don't know what to do i'll just make ♥♥♥♥ spin or something".\n\n\nReally, really have no idea why i bought this game yesterday, but the "mostly positive" rating is misleading at best.\nMy guess is that i wanted an open world racing game as if you'd play GTA 5 but with much better driving and focused on this.\nNope, enjoy normal AI cars that have stupid nametags of random uplay accounts slapped above them, because that feels so real!\n\nMan i had more of a feeling of co-op driving when i was mimicing AI driving styles in GTA vice city.\n\n\n-Disclaimer-I don't have 0.4 hours in the game at the time of this review because the game barely runs. The game runs on 60FPS (capped at that), but it feels like it's poking you with a rapier every time you're trying to race by freezing your screen every once in a while even on low settings, this is a sign of poor optimisation.\n\nEditForced myself to play it a little more to get my money's worth (got it from a third party website), but the game seems to stutter and lag even more at lower settings and it is visually as attractive as a skinned rat.\n\nLooks like you're playing a ps2 port, plays like it's an ps6 port.","October 17, 2015","false","15.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","7"

You can team up with a group of friends for an epic road trip filled with fast-paced illegal activities, and seamlessly explore a massive map of the U.S., from the tip of Maine, all the way down to Miami, over to Los Angeles and back again, passing through other iconic cities along the way. Though it's true that all of this is possible, the experience isn't all that it's made out to be. The Crew tries to do a lot, and while it technically delivers the features it promises, it frequently stumbles over itself. There are brief moments of joy within, but just when you start to think the game's turned a corner, a bump in the road sends your joyride careening off course. When the best thing a racing game has going for it is the variety of environments it has to offer, you know something's amiss.\n\nYou start off in the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a trope-filled campaign that plays out like a Fast & Furious sequel, send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover, The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking. It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally outdated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of aliasing.\n\nKeep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have issues.","April 28","true","48.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I still haven't been able to unlock my free supercar.\n\nUbisoft screwed the pooch again...like right after you release one broken game you decide to release another how do you do this. It's like the level of glitches and broken code in new vegas, but without the modability. The game feels like alot of ubisofts other racing games as well but combined all recycled ideas to creat a steaming pile of "idea".\n\nThe crew gold gives you a whole what 16 extra cars, for an extra $25. Think about that now that is alot of money for something i would consider what should be the size of one car pack. The crews Vehicle selection, what a fun topic. They seem to pick alot of old musclecars, some new muscle cars, some exotics, and 2 tuners..... a 370Z and an R34. No subaru's, no mitsubishi, no hondas, and no toyotas "not even a supra, a legendary car". Like do you hate imports that aren't considered exotics.\n\nIf you do buy it wait a year until the price drops significantly, then also wait for a steam sale.","December 18, 2014","false","63.4"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","34","65","0","0"

Just look around... The game is short yea, cuz you played the story... Haven't played multiplayer, or with friends, there is 1, 2 hours fraction missions... without stop! NFS WORLD somebody? It's not the same but at least has a feeling like it.  Lot of bad review I don't know why, If it's expensive for you why did you buy it? I want the Season pass and The Wild Run DLC soooo baaad, but i WAIT for the SALE... Blame the game because it's expensive, can't wait for the sale or what? I'm just disapointed in ppl.. Seriously, yea the game doesn't have proper physics, somebody said SIM? Nope... Doesn't have enough JDM and what? I drive then the new Muscle cars, I don't like them much, so what? What's your problem ppl?... Tell me, can't write the steam code in you play, and think they gave you trial version? You gave a bad review because they didn't tell you to write it there? Oh STEAM always does, before you start the game Mr. Gaben loves you.. but you just skip the window cuz why not...\n\nHi there! :)I'm trying to be short as I can!\n\nI see NFS ppl! Cry for money maybe you can buy The Crew DLC\n\nI played NFS World for a while, really loved that game but EA stopped it (later i'm going to get back to this point). I was really doubtful about the Crew, my bro in law got in on Xbox one, the game was really ugly so I didn't planned to buy the game for a while, checked reviews it got worse I didn't want the game at all. I wanted to play a car game with my friend so we figured out we don't have a big selection. (Open world games) Tell me if I'm wrong.\n\nGot NFS 15'' on PC finished the game and it wasn't bad, gave me a little old NFS feeling like  05'MW. Now EA told the players we are getting updates etc. We got 1 medium update and 2 small. Then they told us that's it. I mean c'mon, they could told us , the game is a Demo... -.- New game coming in 17..\n\nI compare The Crew to the NFS, why, because that was an open world sandbox game, yes there is Forza Horizon 2 on Consoles, but not on PC yet.\n\nWhy is the crew better: Much less loading time, openworld(but it's not a small session), Tuning system(you are able to see the running parts), Cockpit cam, More updates (costs money but they take care of the game, not throwing it away), Whole US map which is pretty big(cruise without any loading time), Fun play tracks, Bikes, Dirt, Peoples on the street (like in MC LA remix), Fun events where you can get a car parts, league system, Fast n Furious sim.  * I'm still playing the game.*\n\nGood	  Loading time!\nFun with friends\nFast n Furious sim!\nLarge map\nSmall events\nDay night weather cycle\nDeveloper active\nDifferent setup cars\nBody tuning\nTraffic, Peoples on the streets\nCrowd scaring mustangs! :D\nShow how many miles, kmeters driven. (it's cool i think)\nPerks,\nPolice chases\nMany real places, racing tracks, GPS\nDrag in the desert\nInfinite garage space\nMobile garage/tuner\nLeagues/rank/Fractions\nMontly big challenges/1 2 hour long missions (without stop)\nManual transmission\nIf you unlock, or buy the part(Rims etc), you going to have it forever.\nBad   Visual tuning, bad rice vinyls, expensive\nGraphics (I wouldn't say bad but to compare to other games it's not the best, but I love it, low loading time, smooth play\nFew glitches, everybody cries about these, have you tried NFS 15? When u are fallig through the map, in the longest race, sometimes you have to stop not fall through and wait for the map load... Yea these glitches are nothing, stop crying!\nPhysics are bad, Fast n Furious 4ever!\nNot enough cars (  missing JDM  and M3 GTR :D)\nFew small missions are really hard, I mean just unfair sometimes.\nDLC's little bit overpriced, have to wait for sale.\nBoring music, you can fix it with old NFS tracks! :D\nSilent engine sound (maybe fixed in dlc, i don't know yet)\nRUF , what's the matter with Porches? I mean the same just sport ed...\n\n\nLot of people crying about they are going for money with all the DLC's, you know what, I rather pay extra money for extra stuff than, 3 dlc's and the game is thrown away... Fine they are overpriced a little bit, but they are spending time to make it I don't mind, I don't have the Wild Run dlc yet, waiting for summer sale! :)\n\n\nAt the beginning I was negative about the game, not it Turned to love, If you  were an old NFS World player I can offer the game for you, it's pretty good, RIP NFS W! Worth to BUY it ON SALE,\n\n\nOverall score 7.5/10","May 18","true","91.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

I have upgraded my raid car level to 1100, but I still feel difficult to control the car. The car easily slides to roadside when cornering. The game physics is suck as well. When the car hits the rock, just small rock, the car jump. ~_~# !

A racing game with a pretty decent story. The customization of the cars is fairly profound and fun. Its massive amounts of fun to plaly with friends. The only real issue i have is the cops. They are a little OP. You could have a Corvette maxed out, and they can keep up, and even go faster in generic Sedans. Its not a massive problem but it is annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ottynaut/recommended/241560/","ottynaut","sex weasel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ottynaut/","167 products in account","I will write a quick, straight on review for those who are wonder how the game is.\nThis come from 33 hours of gameplay, story done, top 90th in pvp some days ago.\n\nThere are things that bothers me about the game:\n\n-Customization part is that there aren't really many hoods, bumpers and stuff to chose from they mostly have little details changing between them, and they are usually tied to a spec, so this mean, no Skyline stock hood on a Perfomance spec Skyline! Bumpers and the rest are usually repetitive, not to mention the vynils You can't change their colours.\n\n-MMO feeling, this is the misleading part. In your world (your session) you will only be able to see 8 players on the whole US (at least for now) Yes, 8 this is not your typical MMORPG where you see hundred of people. So keep that in mind if you were thinking about it\n\n- Lack of JDM cars: Only three. Ain't gonna describe this much, just three, the rest is almost entire muscle cars with some european exceptions.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nStory is entertaining, not much to add into this part, characters are fine, not precisely boring, but nothing out of this world :]\n\nCops are incredibly fast, think about artificial difficulty, just like that, a crown vic can catch your LaFerrari full throttle, something like Most Wanted, but way more aggresive, if you like challenges, then i guess you will like it, but sometimes, it's a bit unfair, and they don't share the same physics as your car (you can't slam them offroad, they are like anchors)\n\nOne important thing, people tend to whine about the boat handling like GTA IV. It gets A LOT better on the mid-end game, the starter cars are the problem, and the fact it's a MMO, you NEED to level up to get better handling, speed, and so on, and it is highly recommend to play without assists.\nCars are all the same performance wise when you upgrade their parts to max, this means that if you are not a 16 y/o bugatti fan, your favorite $50k grand car will be able to compete to an Agera R and not remain obsolete in the the early levels!\n\nCruising on the states is an amazing feeling, at least that's what i felt since im kind of NA enthusiast in the future. Just keep in mind that this game is way better with friends, so you better get someone in with you. It will make the exploration feeling incredible, and there are plenty of stuff to do. From Skills, to PvP, and Co-Op missions (races up to 2,5h and maybe more!)\n\nTo finish this quick review, my final words:\nI think the game is on sale somewhere (christmas season maybe?)\nIs the game worth it's full price? If you ask me, i do not regret it. Is it fun even in solo? It is, yeah pretty much. Will it be supported for a long time? It's a game that doesn't have a direct competitor on PC, so think about it :]\n\n\nSee you in the States if you decide to give it a try! Claxon me up if you see a Gun Metal Gray R34 rocketing on the roads ;]","December 6, 2014","true","162.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

There's really nobody to play with. When I try to play a mission in "co-op" it says there is nobody in my session. Also I can't see anybody on the map which is just...weird. This game is just single player in multiplayer...which means you have a single player game that you can only play online. This game is far from what it was advertised as. They showed us trailers which had multiple people playing together as a team but in reality not even a single bit of that happens. I can't even make a crew with my friend because it is bugged. I suggest staying away from this yet another bad release from Ubisoft.","December 3, 2014","false","31.3"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","22","42","0","1"

I've played most of the newest- attractive - racing games and honestly, I'm addicted.\n\nGrid Autosport was the most recent release that actually got me interested. I like the "Circuit" type of racing cause it reminds me of Gran Turismo 5, which I played for hours on end.\n\nI've bought Asseto Corsa, Grid 2, dropped $30 on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and nothing.\nNothing caught my eye - I missed the Gran Turismo 5 style of racing game. Winning races, getting money, and then doing what YOU want with that money. Its the best system.\n\nA lot of racing games now are rewarded types where you win a certain amount of races and then it awards you with cars, which was frustrating.\n\nI doubted this game... a lot. I thought it was going to be a buggy, disgusting visuals, pay $60 for junk type of game... you know, like a lot of PC release titles recently.\n\nI watched a few videos and I decided to give it out, wanted to see how big the world is and such.\n\nI played 7 hours straight on release day.\nNo crashes\nNo disconnects\nNo bugs (That I've seen)\n\nThis game is POLISHED. I LOVE IT. The world is absolutely massive and it never forces you to do certain things. I got my Skyline and drove from NY to LA, then to Miami. Not being forced to do tasks.\n\nIt's perfect, being able to see other players, there car, seeing players FLY down street, drift, hit ♥♥♥♥, its great. The campaign is long too, which is also great! It helps you become more attached to your car, and to save up for upgrades and for a new car. It keeps you interested, and for once, I actually feel like I'm playing a story. I mean really, a lot of games out there are too short to remember. 14-20 hr games? ... Typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've been playing the main story for hours on end and I dont feel remotely close to the end.\n\nWhen you have a game with a longer story, you become more involved in absolutely everything. I havent played a good game in a while that has a story thats long enough for me to immerse myself in it. Im not saying that this game has the best story, but it definitely beats A LOT of recent titles. Just because of its length, and how that length makes you become more involved with the story. A huge plus from what I've experienced.\n\nGraphics are awesome, they really are. The game runs INSANELY smooth on my SC GTX 780 and i5 3570K @3.4 GHZ. A lot of releases lately have had fps drops here and there even when there stable.\n\nI havent gotten one frame under 60 fps yet, even with the 60 fps lock on. Brilliant (Also because it looks better then a lot of recent games too)\n\nIf you love cars and want to do what you want with them, get this game, it is ABSOLUTELY worth the $60.\n\nAnd don't go on metacritic for this for PC, its a bunch of winey PC Gamers that are constantly looking for an AMAZING game to come.\nSorry, not happening. It may not be perfect, but its one of the very few games this year that has gotten my attention and has hooked me. Cant stop playing.\n\n10/10 - Racing games should be more like this and less like Grid and free games.","December 5, 2014","true","83.5"," 46 of 90 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","46","90","0","2"

I purchased a g27 Logitech steering wheel and have been playing racing games mainly since then. To satisfy my "free roam/buy cars" itch I had been playing Test Drive Unlimited 2. Awesome graphics, Fun enough gameplay and hours of me crusing around Hawaii drinking beer and driving XD.\n\nI have read a HORRENDOUS amount of negative reviews about this game and since it was able to be played last night I havn't put it down, I dont know why it says 8.5 hours played. For one, the driving feels exactly the way I want a game like this to feel, I play other racing sims such at Assetto Corsa, WRC3, RBR and I will tell you, i would NOT want The Crew to play like that. WAY more fun being able to fly 120mph in an over powered 370z around corners and flying off rediculously over sized ramps (on the fly challenges are F***ING cool, you'll learn when you start playing) than it being on the "Realistic/Simulator" side. I mean seriously in those games you have to actually drop it to about 15mph around a sharp turn to keep your car in control. Do you REALLY want to be doing that in a NFS style game? No, it would get highly annoying.\n\nTo those of you with a g27. This game works perfectly with it, 900* of rotation feels just right. Plently of tweaking options to make all your pedals feel just right, Force Feedback kicks just right with what your car is doing.\n\nThere is alot more, just message me or comment for more questions.\nMust buy, 10/10, BAD A**.","December 2, 2014","true","90.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cars you can customize drive better the further they are leveled up. I always drive alone as i can't get anyone to be on my Crew.I'm at level 35 on Pc version as of 12.6.14. Would be better if the cars didn't spin out so much when they get hit. Cops are annoying & sure bust you quick once your stopped. Would be better is the tires didn't spin so easiy when using nitrous. Some of the cars such as in the Infinity Challenge just can't grip even the road when they near their top speed,Who ever heard of a super car hydro-plaining within their operating designed limits, Would be better in there weren't so many wheel choices of the same rims in 3 colors, would be awesome if we could just powder coat the rims in our choice of colors. That would eliminate so many rim choices. The Crew is the best racing game since Driver San francisco & Need 4 Speed The Run for sure. I'm sure Need 4 Speed Franchise needs to get with the game & not be so limited in it's predictable game style of very limited customization choices.

Long story short, I do not think this game is worth $60+ I would consider it closer to a $30-$40 game. Very stable, especially for Ubisoft, and I enjoyed myself.\n\nWhen this game was first announced at E3, I was so excited. It appeared to be close to the game I'd been hoping for years ago. I have always been a fan of racing games, and over the last few years I've been underwhelmed by the options on PC. I was quick to pre-order The Crew despite my displeasure with Ubisoft and Watch_Dogs especially. When I played the Beta for The Crew, I was met with a stable game which was nice, but there were little things that bothered me. First and foremost was their approach to many of the landmarks of the US. I live in Las Vegas, so once I finally got there, I was underwhelmed. I feel like GTA San Andreas had a better looking Vegas than this game does. I then noticed that Mazda Laguna Seca was on the map also. Laguna Seca is one of my favorite Tracks ever, so I had to see it. After my initial woes with Las Vegas, I was mildly worried. My fears came true, and this point I was legitamately upset.  If you are going to take the time to put a track as Iconic as Laguna Seca in the game, at least do it justice. The Corkscrew, a sweeping S curve, with a 3 story drop, is flat in the game. plus the bump just before the corner turns into a jump at any speed greater than about 50 mph. I understand they can't capture every single part of the US but for tracks, especially those like Laguna Seca, at least make them like the real thing. Car selection is very limited comapred to most other racing titles, but you can go through the entire game with your starter car. there really is no need to spend money at all. I beat the game only spending 2200 on mirrors for my Ferrari, because the Italian flag decal didn't really fit withthe rest of the car. All class upgrades are paid for and individula parts are awarded from skill challenges. unless you want to drive a different car, or make the ones you have prettier, there is absolutely no need to buy anything. I am not very ggod at games in general so I found some missions to be very frustrating. The takedown missions in particular were an annoyance for me. trying to chase someone down and inflict enough damage was very difficult for me. As were the Smash missions, hit a certain number of container within the time limit. it would take me over an hour just for those missions, mostly due to physics (more on that later). The story was pretty much what you would expect from a racing game. Not super indepth, lots of random missions that you have to do with no real explanation of why, but it does have a rather logical progression, and moves at a decent pace. I played through the entire campaign solo, and the only time i interacted with other players was occasionally having a head on collision mid corner. now that I beat the story I might look more into Faction missions, but for now, I found the online function to be more of an annoyance than anything useful.  Overall, I would say that from a game play standpoint, I wasn't really disappointed.\n\nFrom a technological stand point I was.... I'll say satisfied. In 24.6 hours of play the game only crashed 3 times. As far as servers go, the only time I had trouble connecting was when they were performing server maintanence. Visually, this is actually a very good looking game. If it weren't for the 60 fps lock, and the strange Depth of Field effects I wouldn't have any complaints. Honestly, playing at max settings (motion blur and depth of field off) I was playing at 3140 x 2160 on my  GTX 980 at a stable 60 fps, and gpu usage was only at around 70%. I would have liked to be able to fully utilize 144 Hz that my monitor is capable of, but for whatever reason they locked it to 60. Not a deal breaker for the vast majority of consumers, but it was mildly irksome for me. Normal road driving is quite satisfying, once I turned driving assists to hardcore, I was quite content with the handling. The collision detection baffles me though. there is no consistency as far as what constitutes a full crash and what is just a glancing blow. I had times that I would ram into the back of a pedestrian vehicle by more than half of it, and my car would just "glitch" to one side and I wouldn't lose more than a couple mph. other times there would be a couple of feet between my car and the pedestrian vehicle, and I would crash. I tried to figure out why, but never really could. The most ridiculous aspect of the physics is most apparent once you unlock the raid class. These vehicles are designed to go offroad, over large objects, and jumps. Every time I tried to go off a jump, the physics would react in a way that I can only call alien.  I could get practically no distance, or I would have insane nose up manuvers. worst of all was the tendency for the car to spring up to one side if only one tire went over a large rock or object. If your vehicle goes past a 90 degree angle the game treats it as a crash, even if you end up landing on your wheels again. If you did end up making it off the jump well, the game trys to keep you flat, most of the time, so more times than not I would end up taking an awkward bounce and spin out. This was completely unnatural to me. and it was so random I couldn't compensate for it. If the game was trictly on road, this wouldn't be a problem, but there are so many missions, like the smash missions I mentioned before, where this comes into play, and it is very frustrating. At the end of the day, I was able to work around these issues, and beat the missions, but I could never really achieve the score I wanted because the physics would mess me up. But i do have to give them credit, not once did i experience a glitch, much less a game breaking one. Just 3 freeze and crashes that I can't really explain, but since it is always online, server based, I didn't lose any progress.\n\nOverall I would give The Crew a 7 out of 10. It held my attention the whole time, and I found satisfaction in completeing missions. the overall experience was quite good, it had it's faults, but nothing was ever major enough to put me off of the game entirely. I would say wait for it so go on sale for 33% or more, and you'll get your moneys worth. For that reason, I do recommend  this game.","December 7, 2014","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arcade racers are racing games that have selective physics to allow fun things to happen.\nIf you are like me, someone who clocked 1000+ hours into Gran Turismo, played every racing game from F-Zero,CTR,Top gear,F1 simulators, to Racing lagoon. you don't expect anything to ever blow your mind again.\nHeck, after NFS after NFS, I started to believe arcade racers have nothing to deliver.\n\nThis proved me wrong. Fantastically crafted balance of doing what's expected of a racing game, and taking itself seriously without being pretentious.\n\n> Physics\n\nThe physics are well crafted to do what it's supposed to, The hitboxes are somewhat forgiving as they will let you scrape past a crash or dodge trees from time to time, (unlike Forza where entering a corner wrong is kinda...fatal) It doesn't make you OCD about keeping your car in control like GT, and is both a relaxing and exciting experience.\n\n> Visuals\n\nIf you have a good PC, the visuals are quite decent, the topper is the cinematic value of an active racetrack. The game is light and easy enough for you to enjoy the cranes and planes, and steam leaks, strategically placed to block you from seeing stuff ahead is a nice touch.\n\n> Story\n\nThe storyline? I didn't care for it at first, but it started to get better, unexpectedly good for something so cliche and dead on hollywood scriptwriting theories, The characters have a lot of depth for a racing game. It demonstrates there's nothing wrong with cliches, if it's done right. The end feels fulfilling and I'd totally get DLC for some of the character side stories\n\nThe game is meant to be played together, the story is written so you can talk ♥♥♥♥ about it. It's not groundbreaking but it does the job right, something I haven't seen in racing games in a long time.\n\n(Willing suspension of disbelief regarding "driving fixes problems" is required. though much less than a michael bay movie)\n\n> Gameplay\n\nIt's broken the line of pathetic cops game after game, where you can just "go vroom vroom really fast" and get away. It's a fantastic breath of fresh air. The cops actually do something. They will stop you if you drive stupidly behind them, you react to their radio as it gives you clues when they're going to ram you, and you'll have to take risks to get rid of them (not just "don't crash"). You can see that they're programmed to make the chase fun, forcing you to react and think of ways to taking them out, (which is not no longer a fancy dressing on a cake, it's required.) If you like challenging cops, this is going to be fun. I'm still expecting the difficulty to increase as people learn that you cant just get away by driving in a straight line. you know, the same people who ask Is it realistic? no, you aren't probably ever going to get away from realistic cops.\n\nIf you are finding it too hard, you probably aren't voice chatting enough.\n\nThe Missions are actually fun and challenging, there is enough substance in the car handling to make different skill challenges enjoyable, and the reward of making your car a bit faster after every race is great. Those crash missions are great fun, you have to plan and execute crashes giving a nice buildup to a climatic crash.\n\nI hate catchup bonuses, But I'm going to make this an exception, It's right for the type of game it is.\n\n>MMO\n\nIt's the best way to halt the piracy of the game, This was going to happen sooner or later, and this is a really good first step for racing games.\n\nFor an MMO, this is really well designed, I'm surprised at the MMO elements that they've got working nicely in the game, (like the RNG god) They're missing like, crafting, (Player designed parts? *wink wink*) but that's ok. but The game is well designed with so much to do for every type of gamer in the bartle test. I've found myself navigating a rocky offroad mountian climb with my friend, pushing him when he's stuck, and screaming when i was so close to getting over that rock before tumbling down. The open world is done right.\n\nYou're all worring about the cash aspect? I feel what they're doing now is perfect, Yes cash helps you get stuff, but to get the end game gear, you gotta get your hands dirty grinding the RNG god for platinum parts. so yeah, money will give you access to some cars, but any car can be tuned to the same performance tier, This is probably the correct pay model, It respects customers enough to not be pay to win, I hope activision keeps it that way.\n\nThe game is much more enjoyable with people to talk to, It's really how it's designed.\nThe drawback is there's only half a dozen people in your session, so it's sort of an mmo with very small servers. But let's be honest, 1-- players infront of the HQ isn't driveable, especially with how much you guys care about traffic laws. )and the number will probably increase after launch day fad is over when the server is more free"\n\nIt's not free of glitches, but to be honest i'm surprised at how well it's working for a game a couple days from launch day? I'm starting to hate Activision a little less, just for publishing this.\n\n>Sound\nI mentioned to my team time after time how good the Dodge Viper sounds, what pisses me off is the music, But luckly i'm on a PC, so I can just play whatever I want in the background. The sound's what it needs to be.\n\nTips> (Tl:dr version)\n- Any car can finish the game\n- get a crew and voice chat outside of game\n- accept that this isn't "realistic" like F1, GT, and Forza\n- prepate a written a list of insults for the police\n- expect some disconnects and patches near launch date\n- Don't tune a 2nd car until you get 40, then buy the most expensive kit starter.\n- Best way to farm for money is PvP, don't grind jumps like I did.\n- Don't try to gold stuff unless you are stuck at a level, Platinum parts unlock at lv50.\n- Your mother is a nice person, okay? now stop crashing me out in PvP.","December 4, 2014","true","66.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is coming from someone that is constantly very busy, I would stay up late and wake up early to find time to play this. I love the racing dynamics and graphics. The map is giant and beautiful and the detail in every city (except Santa Fe?). I love the fast travel and train/plane traveling. It is so much easier then driving forever to get somewhere because the map is so freaking big!

Right now everything is working fine and its the best damn driving game i've played.\nI've been a major fan of the Need for Speed series, especially the free roaming, free agent types of Most Wanted and Hot Pursuit.  With those previous titles, they pioneered many features of free driving and competitive co-operative play i've enjoyed.  With The Crew, I get to experience all of that with added elements of full co-operative support, an unprecidentedly open free roam world, well balanced cosmetic and performance modifications.  I'm still getting into the game so i'm still looking forward to the real PvE and PvP experiences along with the action the faction system will bring.\n\nFor now it definitely gets a thumbs up, though as with any launch title it will have bugs and problems, so be patient (or wait a while before you buy).","December 5, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the locations in the game have this authentic kind of feeling to them. While the level of detail doesn't match that of GTA V, it's still high enough to make you keep on playing and exploring the vast open map.\n\nApart from that, well, it's a decent multiplayer racing game. The amount of cars to select from isn't exactly whopping, and there is no photo mode to capture the scenery I mentioned earlier. The AI traffic can suddenly take to the skies and Boeing 747's spin around wildly while airborne.\n\nBut overall, it's an enjoyable experience if you can ignore the servers shutting down every two hours. Hopefully the developers will manage to get rid of that soon.\nSimply put, if you liked TDU, NFS:MW, Burnout Paradise, MC:LA and the likes, you will most likely enjoy The Crew as well. You might want to wait for a few weeks before getting it, though.\n\n8/10\n\nPS: I wouldn't mind an offline mode.","December 5, 2014","true","205.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Outside of the baffling and bafflingly stupid plot, the game serves up an idealized approximation of the life of a car enthusiast who has nothing better to do but buy great cars, drive them to hell and back... and then drive them some more. With literally thousands of miles to wander across on a map reportedly close to five times the size of Just Cause 2's, The Crew is a paradise for free drivers and explorers, a game that makes the hours pass by at alarming speed in all senses of the word.\n\nIf you've dreamed of cross-country road trips, this is as close (and cheap) as it gets. If you loved Test Drive Unlimited and its oddball, mildly disappointing sequel, you should stop reading this and buy The Crew right now as it is essentially Test Drive Unlimited 3 in all but name.","December 5, 2014","true","261.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Outside of the baffling and bafflingly stupid plot, the game serves up an idealized approximation of the life of a car enthusiast who has nothing better to do but buy great cars, drive them to hell and back... and then drive them some more. With literally thousands of miles to wander across on a map reportedly close to five times the size of Just Cause 2's, The Crew is a paradise for free drivers and explorers, a game that makes the hours pass by at alarming speed in all senses of the word.\n\nIf you've dreamed of cross-country road trips, this is as close (and cheap) as it gets. If you loved Test Drive Unlimited and its oddball, mildly disappointing sequel, you should stop reading this and buy The Crew right now as it is essentially Test Drive Unlimited 3 in all but name.","December 5, 2014","true","261.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nothing can prepare you for how big it is. The story line is rather shallow and pointless so far (I have yet to complete it). The driving has a mostly arcade feel to it but is not too insane. The cars are a lot of fun to drive and there is plenty to do. The game is very pretty to look at. Even at only medium settings. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who liked to 2005 Need for Speed Most Wanted or Need for Speed Underground series.","December 5, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An openworld racing, where you can free-drive even with your friends and its not full arcade play. You need to get used to it if you wanna play it seriously & smoothly. I can say that this is GOTY for me. Story line is not bad for a racing game, eventhough it was a bit rush-end.\n\nAbout Gold edition :\n\nIt gives you some amount of Crew Credits (Not worth what you pay), Season pass and some cars like Ferrari, Dodge RAM etc.\n\nIn my opinion, you don't need to buy gold edition if you don't mind about Crew Credits (Which you can use buying cars and kits if you don't have enough cash in game)\n\nJust buy the normal version + season pass, would be enough.\n\n10/10 would buy again.","December 7, 2014","true","63.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this.\nThere are few issues however with the game such as.\nThe Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).\n\nWarning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.\n\n'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) .  These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.\n\nThis being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.\n\nIf any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.\n\n7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )","December 10, 2014","true","89.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(give challenge somtimes)\n+ Open world where you can drive wherever you want (Even discover some easter eggs in the world)\n+ Good transition between game cinématics and gamplay (So you fell like you gived control of it after mission movies.)\n+ Posibility to send your friend do faction missions for you. (so you can save time instead of doing a 2h mission for a bit more of easy game money)\n+ 50 Cars for first release batch (Witch is not bad for a game that features quite detailed car interiors)\n+ Offers car customisation such as pre-fab vynils/stickers, Rims, Spoilers and some chasis mods. ( Alot more visual customisation to offer compared to TDU2)\n+ Day and Night Cycle System\n\nMIDS~\n~ Servers are down for maintenance sometimes. (yes it can happen, its an online game)\n~ Uplay Launcher (at least i can be used / merged whit steam tho)\n~ Storymode is a bit short. (but is still entertaining to watch)\n~ Missing Mirrors Animations for Cockpit view in some Cars. (they already working on it already for next patch )\n~ Weather conditions changes only when you go the mountains where there is snow (they might could use a bit rain but its not that bad)\n~ Can have unblanced AI (depending if you and your crew have to high level gap)\n\nCONS-\n- No offline mode (you need a internet connection to play this game)\n- No possibility to add your own Music (but you can customise your playlist atleast)\n- Microtransactions\n\nSo as so far for the rest for the game and the gamplay itself, the pleasure of free roaming those cars with friends is pretty Neat, if your one of thos players who dislike this game, just go back to driveclub or what so ever other racing sim game you were playing, otherwise if your looking for car tunning, driving everywhere from road to montains, and like fast paced races for the fun of playing it, this game i what you are looking for !\n\nAll together i would say, "The Crew" is a cool game to play for cruising around with Friends or even to play alone i would say, sure the game have some bugs and have a litle lack on MMO since its more concentrated on the NFS genre gamplay but is worth the price when we know they will comme up whit more !\n\n(10 thumbs up)\n\nContinue the good work Ubi we know that you can do it and update this until perfaction as other titles did before !!\n(Afterall They made Driver San Fransico a great fun game so why not the crew !)","December 11, 2014","true","52.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But, on the down side, there is no inclination of ultimate purpose other than to repeat what you have already done in the past. Not having a beneficial PVP or Faction vs. Faction system takes away one of the main key factors that would keep you playing this game, rewards. There is simply no motivating factors in the game that would make you stockpile vehicles or outdo yourself on the skills circuit, unless you have absolutely no life or are a completionist.\n\n6/10\n","February 27, 2015","true","66.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway, the game is not finished, yet enjoyable for a very specific crowd. Let me explain. At a very technical level, the game is not where it should be. Laggy and stuttery even on an FX-9590 and 290x, tendency to cook a water cooled processor that doesn't go past 58 in Prime95, and almost unplayable on a mobile platform with an A10-5750M and M290x. If you can muster better specs and get it to be playable and responsive, you'll run into their side of the hardware issues, meaning the server. It might not pe hardware though, but still technical. On some networks it works, on others it doesn't, and it will disconnect every now and then in the middle of one of those hour long races, and you'll have to do it all over again. So, if these are things that you think you can look past just to get a glimpse of the sunset from the Grand Canyon behind the wheel of a LaFerrari, this is the game for you. It looks amazing, the cars sound fantastic, and on hardcore driving mode the driving model is brilliantly tuned for a very good mix of arcade and sort of simulator. Not a simulator in the actual sense, just that it follows a few rules that arcade racers usually don't. Say you're in a controlled power slide, or a drift, and one of your back wheels hits the dirt on the outside of the bend, or the snow, or even a wet patch, you will lose control of the car, because the back end loses grip completely. That is a very nice touch. So, driving model not bad at all, but not a full on simulator by any means. The story itself is a cliche, obviously, you've heard it a million times if you're into this culture, or have ever played a NFS game or seen an FnF movie. Bad guy kills/betrays your brother/mother/sister/any other signifcant family members and then you seek to get revenge by driving fast and breaking the law almost all the way. Nevertheless, this story is told well, with good quality cut-scenes and voice acting. Also, the missions themselves are quite fun, at least at first, because later on the same challanges are presented for the lack of more then 3 or 4 modes. You get the normal checkpoint race, checkpoint time trial, a sort of destruction derby against the clock, where you need to catch and bash into the opponent several times until a health bar hovering over his/her car is depleted. This one is quite interesting and fun, until they pit you against a prison bus that can keep up with a modified Mustang that can do 300 KM/h. Funny, but frustrating after the fifth try. Also has the health or relisience of a prison bus. There's another mode which I shall call "touch the package" because it can be interpreted in several ways, and I love a good internal debate. Anyway, this one puts you on a course, against the time, in which there are 100 packages on the ground, the story will explain why they are there, don't worry, not as stupid as it sounds. You have to, within that time limit, hit 80 of those boxes. Sounds easy? Pah. Difficult, but fun.\nAs a whole experience, because there is much more to talk about, and I can't be bothered because it's my night off, and I just wanted to share my general opinion about The Crew, the game is enjoyable if you like cars and the whole customization, FnF and NFSU heritage stuff. For the car enthusiast, the flaws are not there to disturb, we keep hoping that eventually they will be patched, because they are obvious, yet we look beyond them and enjoy good looking and sounding cars, that drive in an impressively fun and engaging manner, amongst scenery that you will probably only get to see in game. By the way, the map is a smaller version of the United States, with little versions of New York, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and many other major US cities. Basically, you get to drive across America. And, also important, in my opinion, you can modify your cars in pretty fine detail, and the body parts available are very good looking, and have that racy feel, not the silly Underground toy looking things. You can put together a very good looking off-road version of a 2011 Mustang with 800 horses under the hood. Pretty cool. Thumbs up, but please work on those performance issues at least. Thank you.","January 29, 2015","true","44.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is good and fun and others swear that it is next to terrible. For me the Crew has been a lot of fun, but I have no interest in being with a group of people tearing up the country-side. I personally like the idea of the crew and the changing of car styles and it forces you to play with all of the spec's (Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit) through the Campaign. Overall if you like driving around a massive open world in any car you like doing random skills, races and occasional pvp it is a lot of fun and worth the cash.\n\n---->The campaign in general is alright, it is enough to keep you interested in how the characters work as a whole, but it nothing compared to Ubisoft's other story lines. It was written by the same writer of Red Dead Redemption, but was given a limited window in which to write it. The story feels rushed and a little bit like the fast and Furious, but it is a racing game and the Fast and Furious franchise really set the cliche and standard for many years to come. It is best to think of the Campaign as an interesting Tutorial rather than any form of story.\n\n---->The game play is very fun in my opinion. In the open world you can drive anywhere you want with ease and have a multitude of things to do along the road trip. With five different types of cars you can go anywhere. The races are fairly easy in solo, but can pose a challenge in Co-op. The servers are lacking players though, because of the recent political and social mishaps that Ubisof has had, but I have had no problem getting into races in PVP. There is a large gripe about the handling model with this game. *IMPORTANT* It is a little difficult to understand, but this is an arcade racer with a logical handling model. The handling is actually quite realistic; its clunky, difficult, and sometimes very difficult to control, but this is how real cars work at high speeds. (I have two performance muscle cars and race them on the weekends, so trust me when I say they can turn at speed worth anything. One is a 1970 Camaro SS Z28 and the other is a 1970 Dodge Charger R/T) Use the brake and don't just slam on the gas the while time is the key to racing effectively.\n\n---->The Customization is more than extensive (except on the Circuit cars but they are supposed to be race cars so I get that.) I have had a lot of fun personalizing my cars to be something that I like and find attractive. I can happily say that they have attempted to find looks and styles that suit everyone's interests. The visual parts can all be bought so you roll out of the tuner with a badass looking Mustang, Camaro, or whatever else. Althought, the performance parts are sometimes frustrating to acquire, but are rewarding after a challenge.\n\n---->My frustrations;\n-The occasional lack of players in the open world\n-The tiny chance of level 50 parts\n-The traffic spawn distance is very short sometimes giving you no chance to dodge them when you are ripping along the desert at 250+ mph.\n-The expense of some of the parts. (Now this is a little bit more specific. Because it is so easy to make money it doesn't really matter anyway.)\n-The fact that there isn't a circuit spec for the Agera R.\n\n---->My Joys;\n-The customization for the cars\n-The little things, like overheating brakes and over-spin.\n-The graphics for the cars and damage models.\n-The auto-repair for the exterior of the car so you aren't forced to look at a car the is half destroyed.\n-The Performance tweaks to the driving models that are a little difficult to notice.\n-The Spec differences and play style choices.\n-The ease at which you can make money.\n\nAll in all it is very good. Not perfect by any means, but enjoyable. Worth the money, you ask? There isn't an easy way to answer that. For me I have played a lot and plan to play more so it was for me, but for others who knows. It is really one of those; "I love it" or "I hate it" games. The hype it got really hurt it. I like it better than GTA five, way more. So if you want it, get it and play with it. Take the challenges with pride and just at least give it a try before judging. My friends and I love it.\n","May 24, 2015","true","88.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuroiminerin/recommended/241560/","kuroiminerin","Kuroimine Rin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuroiminerin/","39 products in account","Updated: This is my final review. All of my review on thia game are base on gameplay and its features except story plot, as I always skip them like I do in other race game (except Split Second <3 ).\n\nIf you have experience in Need For Speed Underground 2/Most Wanted (old), then you might have a same experience in The Crew, with different styles of course. Graphic is ok actually, and the control or handling car aren't that bad. So far it is good, it's cool to see other players during roam mode.\n\nBasicly the PvP (non crew pvp) is just same like other race game such Dirt 2, however, instead require host create a a lobby and organize the event, The Crew players that joined the lobby will vote which event they want to try. Haven't try yet the Crew vs Crew PvP (aka team vs team). Event after try I wont update anymore. xP\nDo caution that server in co-op/PvP is really terrible, most of time you'll get disconnected issue, not sure is this is really base on player's internet connection or it's the game's server issue..\n\nThere's no rubberband Ai like those negative said, it's just normal Ai like other racing game. There's no perfect and logic Ai. It's yours skills to how you deal with them. Here's my screenshot. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487074554\n\nHere's about Ai info I've been meet:\nRacer:\n•Like other game they sometimes can bit speedy or slow, even they speed is same as your. But as I said before, it's about your skills. For me, most Ai racer are very easy to handle.\n\n•Most of them stick into they waypoint, lika a train rail. There's a mission that I saw the same car hit on a truck twice (I retry the mission and yea, it occur on same place, same time). But meh, I play other race game before so its just normal.\n\n•A Take Down mission really annoying. Dunno how to explain lol.\n\nCops, Police:\n•All right.. So far I only see two way to trigger chase. 1st, hit anything inside 'Police Watch' area, until they trigger chase. 2nd way is, hit the police car if you see them. If you guys know other way (than mission), please let me know coz its fun trolling them xP\n\n•All police just do is only ramming you. The star wanted level seems only increase number of police chasing you, road block and heli. Seriously roadblock is pretty ridiculous, only 1 police car block, with signal obstacles, in any wanted level. Please do not run from them by trying taking offroad, they'll chase you with dirt specs, also with heli, which is really difficult to escape if your car were using non raid/dirt spec. It was hell for me to run from them using Golf inaide forest but it was fun. xD\n\n\nNote: For those people who is don't have a clue about trial issue, copy your CD key in Steam Library and paste it at Active Product on uPlay.\n\nPlease also do note that the trailer is too promising. I suggest you to try demo 1st. Well, it's still fun and cool racing game I ever played, 2nd of my fav after Split Second.\n\nHere's my review so far:-\n\nPros:\nBig detailed map\n\nAble to see other players roaming around. It's cool!\n\nNice graphic\n\nSomewhat it's challenging. Seriously, sometimes there's too many cars (obstacles) on traffic\n\nNo cut-scene crash/accident like Need For Speed series (if you think this is cons it is pro for me. I hate when speeding in race or in free roaming, or while eescaping from police you got crash and then a cut-screen, slowing down you).\n\nSupport are nice, I guess.\n\nMost time update\n\nGreat community\n\nCrew vs Crew PvP system\n\nGreat car customization. You can tune your car to into various specs which is street, dirt (rally actually..), raid, circuit. You can't tune Stock specs but you can customize its visual on your HQ.\n\n8 players on each roam map is great, I guess.. Assuming enable more players will make the map lag, like most online game I played. Even though the map is very super large scaled getting lag will make player frustrated and stop play. This is my experienced in most online game. At least for me.\n\nCons:\nCrew Credits systems in-game, in PAID games. Some car cannot bought through bucks. This should not happen. (Note: ingame progress you'll receive free 100k crew credit once. But as I said, Crew Credit supposedly not exist since this paid game, also can make game unbalanced.\n\nSeason Pass benefit kinda unfair for me. Plus it is expensive, not worth for its features. DLC also expensive.\n\nKinda unrealistic physics.\n\nMust have internet connection to play.\n\nIngame player's profile avatar are using uPlay avatar, and can't upload/customize ingame profile avatar like the trailer.. This is so frustrating, stupid, and horrible..\n\nThats all from me. :)\n\nMy rate: 8/10","July 23, 2015","true","52.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

After recently buying a Logitech G27 wheel with pedals and H-shifter I decided to give The Crew another shot. As I continued the story mode and started leveling up and getting better "gear" for my car I got more involved with the gameplay mechanics and started tweaking the steering options to my benefit. What was rather a boring and unpredictable experience with a controller, became with a racing wheel; a beast I had to tame. Manual shifting and clutch involved.\n\nThis is not a racing simulation, it's a racing stimulation. Never before have I gotten involved in hour long online races cross continent with sweat running down my face as I enter a U-turn in 350km/h while being chased by the police and other online drivers. Intense to the max, and it really brings out the little boy I have inside me.\n\nThe story mode is decent for a racing game but it's unlocking and completing all the achievements, challenges, awards, rewards, cars, tuning kits and performance parts that keeps me playing. This is pure fun.\n\nI can't wait for this fall's The Wild Run expansion to be released.\n\nVerdict:\n4/5 toasters","August 20, 2015","true","79.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like a average story which is something you just have an addition cause you do the same thing on every mission anyways.\n\nYes. If you are patient enough to fiddle around with Uplay and fix all the issues you'll have\n\nYes. If you like a game which only way of saying ♥♥♥♥ you, you are not going that way is by ruining the physics (hilarious and pathetic at the same time)\n\nYes. If you like racing games, the controls feel like the average arcade racer which is not a bad thing considering how ♥♥♥♥ing hard it is to drive around at more than 90MPH without any handling upgrades\n\nYes. If you like to ♥♥♥♥ around with your friends while exploring almost every part of the US until you realise you done goofed cause you should've played the missions cause even the ♥♥♥♥ing NPCs can outrun you in the areas you are supposed to visit later\n\n\nConclusion: This is a really, really fun game. I had some issues at first, weren't minor. Ubisoft support wasn't helpful at all but that doesn't change the fact that this game is fun with friends or atleast the right people.\nGrab yourself a Perf spec car and ♥♥♥♥ around near LV dragracing random people cause you can. Then drive to Michigan, Detroit and see the place where white rap started (8 Mile).\nIf you were to drive from west coast to east coast following the laws of driving (speed, stop lights and such) you would lose around 4 hours and 30 minutes. If you were to drive at the highest speed your car is able to reach it would still take over 50 minutes. This game is huge. you should play it\n\n","September 19, 2015","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImmortalZombie/recommended/241560/","ImmortalZombie","Accouterments","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImmortalZombie/","335 products in account","I highly recommend people to get The Crew if they like arcade like racing, fast cars, customization, and openworld driving. This game gets a lot of hate and people begin to compare it to games like Forza Horizon, NFS, Burnout, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 and also begin to compare to the 2 top racing simulators like Forza and Gran Turismo. I think people forget that this is not a full on simulator, this is a arcade type game where jumping things at 150 mph wont destroy your car. The Crew features about 40 cars with maybe 10 more coming on the way with DLC and there are 5 car spec's that you can chose from. Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Curcuit. You unlock each of those 5 specs as you play the game and level up and not all cars are able to have all 5 specs for example, A lambo only has Perf and Curcuit, a Dodge Charger only allowes Street, Dirt and Perf and so on for most of the cars.\n\nFor customizing you are only allowed to customize Street, Dirt, and Perf spec cars and each car for each spec has its own uniqe customization options but the Raid and Curcuit spec cars are already preset to a certain look and it cannot be change expect for the color, stickers (as they call it), rims, and the interior.\n\nThe game covers the whole USA but made into a small version to fit the game. You can get from New York to San Francisco in about 40 minutes - 1 hour. Some citys have been included but not made fully to scale as that would probably be impossible to do and would take too much time to do everything to scale so what is included in the cities is enough to make it recognizable.\n\nThe story is a simple story that is not so original but then again what can be done with a racing game? You are framed for murdering your brother when someone from the inside killed him with the help of a dirty fbi cop. So you are sent to jail and are offered to go undercover to seek revenge for the murder of your brother.\n\nThere are microtransactions in the game but it is useless because you still need to unlock every part to own it and cars are not that hard to buy with ingame money. I remember seeing that the Devs said they took actual car sounds from the actual car but that is not true. Every car sounds generic but at least each car has a different pitch and sound to it.\n\nPros:\n+Car customization\n+The whole US to explore\n+Can play the whole game with 3 friends\n+5 secret cars to unlock\n+Everything can be purchased with ingame money\n+Every car has a different sound, even though non of them are the actual car sounds its enough for each car to have its own sound\n+each car has its own detailed interior\n\nCons:\n-Only 40 cars to chose from\n-Lack of asian cars to chose from (only 2)\n-Police are a bit too aggressive\n-Skill Challenges get really repetative\n-Cheaters, no chance to gain a world record on any challenge\n-No working rear view mirrors\n-Microtransactions","December 25, 2014","true","176.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hearing times ranging from an hour to over two hours I was disappointed when I made it from Northeastern Maine to Malibu, California in just under 40 minutes.\n\nBut it isn't just about the quantity of width, it was about the quality that expands to the north and south as well. Whether you even choose to do the campaign missions, there can be dozens of hours of pleasure found in traversing the country in Street spec cars. They did a great job capturing monumental structures such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Mount Rushmore or landmarks like the Bonneville Salt Flats and the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe map itself doesn't feel copy and pasted either. Each section does seem to have its own unique features. Whether it be the snowy roads of the Rocky Mountains or the winding and elevating roads in the Giant Sequoia Forest, or Las Vegas towering over the horizon, it is worth going and seeing what The Crew has to offer.","December 28, 2014","true","90.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For cost of half of basic game you get in fact nothing. Oh yea, you can still pay further and buy motorbikes but even this is not possible straight on Steam - you are redirected to other page which does not belong to Steam. I am not a die hard fan of this game so I am not into spending tens of hours to slowly earn game's coins to be able to ride a bike. At least one bike should be accessible straight by buying the DLC, otherwise, for me it is waste of money.\nAnd one more thing: why the game does not turn off when I quit? Steam hour counter for the game still works and I can't get rid of it until next PC restart, so in fact hours count spent with this game is false.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHey, this is the best open world driving sim so far. It's like TDU but better, prettier, more exciting. I would also really like to see usable Petrol Stations, Motorbikes as well as radio playing my own mp3 songs, GPS that looks like the real one, playable slot machines.

Unfortunately, it doesn't come with one guaranteed.\nWhen I played this game/ both alone and with a friend, it is the absolute best racing/driving game I have ever played.\n\nNo, I don't understand why there's so much hate. What do all those haters play, Need for Speed Rivals?\nAll jokes aside; this game is definitely better than its competitors at its gen.\n\nI enjoyed this game thoroughly, and would rate it 98/100 (1 point minus for minor connectivity issues, 1 point minus for bad ending)\n\nLet me start with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map. Yes, the freaking huge map. And its not just 90% emptiness, no no no no....\nIts probably one of the largest maps in gaming history. I'm pretty sure it could go par against Guild Wars 2 in map size.\n\nNext up is the main story sequence. Overall, the story was NeedForSpeedMostWanted(2005)-ish and really pushes you to want to know more. Its not shakespeare but hey, I found it to fit okay.\n\nThe cars in the game are well modeled (except their bottom; but who the hell looks there), and there is a pretty good level of car-modding. Okay, not Need For Speed Carbon/UG2 level, but at least around NFSMostWanted(2005) level. The paints choices are great, and the vinyl choices are not bad. They should make more though.\n\nI don't think there is alot of cars in the game, and before people start chirping the game because you can purchase cars; you can finish the game and get the best car without paying a single extra dollar. Just don't pay heed to purchasable cars and you're good. I personally liked their car choices; despite the low car count.\n\nThe AI in the game (which some saw glitching) was actually flawless for me. They are pretty smart, and I'm pretty sure they are much better AI than that of older racing games. This is because the AI will not let you grind onto them or use them as "padding" as you make a sharp turn with them. They will speed up or slow down to make you screw up. It makes the game have a level of challenging in it.\n\nOkay, you got me here. The handling. Its not great is it? Well, I'm going to tell you that to each his own because me and my friend both just got used to it. I know, its kinda annoying, but it makes it a tad bit more challenging. It kinda forces you to learn how to properly turn and drift. Not sure if its realistic, but that doesn't matter for me anyway, it wasn't the end of the game.\n\nThe graphics. This stuff is not your Driveclub or Forza graphics. But its definitely the right gen. I can barely run it with my computer but it looks amazing. Although there are some blotchy textures in shady places, the surrounding game has some good texturing.\n\nThe Audio is good, but could use a little bit more bass/could sound more heavy.\n\nAll the different specs you can get for your car, these are what fill in the "not enough customization" and "not enough cars" gap. The specs and their upgrades are well done, and they give the cars more specialization in what they do.\n\nThe performance parts in the game are acquired by the means of completing mini-challenges or buying them at high levels. Of course, I didn't mind this as much but I could see why people would prefer buying them. Plus the model of the vehicle's inside does not change, no matter which performance part you pick.\n\nI did not have this game crash too many times, only twice from my many hours of playing and also once because my Eyefinity is not really compatible. I didn't find any bugs so far (minus my friend apparently being able do drive underwater once).\n\nThe PVP in this game was decent, and the MMO-thing is not the biggest thing about the game. I played with a friend; as I said before, and we both really enjoyed this game.\n\nThe challenges are a bit silly, but they are great in the case that someone wants to get some quick cash. The game's economy isn't that bad.\n\nWorth every dime of my 40$.\n\nTLDR; 98/100, huge map, get a friend, ending sucks, but overall an enjoyable game.","May 25, 2015","true","129.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I own the very basic version, no expansion, no DLC and I can say that the after-game content is pretty lacking, all that is left to do is re-do some story missions to get better parts, do faction missions, pvp and that's about it without the expansion.","June 1","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was great ((Too bad my computer exploded when I played it)) Well no time for that! Anyways.... I just loved this game I'm happy I got it BEWARNED Before you buy this READ THE REVIEWS You're gonna need a Moderate computer Either a $500 Or more Gaming computer or a strong/Modifed All-In-One Computer If you we're to get a All-In-One Computer then buy a BETTER Graphics card. Because its a very heavy game on Medium - Ultra Graphics if you have a decent Computer you can run it... The game is great Good Gameplay Great Graphics Great Cars. Great Story Great Game. I highly Suggest this this will blow MDNC:LA ((If you're still on that 2007 -2009 gaming)) It will beat NFS: Rivals. NFSW: World. It may cost $59.99 But its worth it I highly suggest this! Please do buy I love it. I know not everyone likes UBISOFT but its a great game its Teen it has Strong Language but if it doesn't bother you then you're good.... Anyways This game is the Stuff.... I highly suggest this ((Yes I said that 2 times)) So Quick Review: If you like Cars, Good Grapihcs, Good Story line and Never EVER Driving alone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockerbacon/recommended/241560/","rockerbacon","Rockerbacon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockerbacon/","17 products in account","Game is really fun. If you like arcade racing games it is a must have.\n\nPros:\n-The way the car drives is pretty customizable and even though you can't make huge changes like making it a sim, you can definitely make it drive to your taste (as long as you enjoy arcade driving).\n-Game creates the perfect challange. You can win most races with relative ease, but getting that gold medal definitely requires some skill.\n-People have been bashing the graphics, but for an online-focused open world racing game the graphics are really impressive.\n-Online experience seems pretty stable. One problem I always have with online racing games is how crazy things go when playing online, cars popping out of nowhere, suddenly stoping or accelarating, etc. So far I have experienced no major problems while playing coop events.\n-Variety of car classes and events for those classes. There are car classes build for different terrains and conditions and events for those different classes.\n-Don't like playing with other people? You can go completely solo. Even though the game is online-focused you can ignore everyone around you and play it like if it was a singleplayer game.\n-Even though it's an arcade game you can feel the differences in handling of each vehicle with ease, making car choices come to preference.\n-That huge map! Travelling from one city to another is already a lot of fun and there are kind of mini-games in every road that include jumping, slaloms, driving fast and on the road, etc. All to keep you busy on your travels while also rewarding you.\n-The performance is flawless. Some people may be worried about performance since it's a Ubisoft game, but I have a pretty old computer and can still run the game flawlessly with mixed high/ultra settings.\n\nNeutral:\n-There are not many visual customization options as I though there would be, but customizing your car is still pretty fun, even though I feel it could be better.\n-Soundtrack doesn't fit the game well. The songs don't give you that adrenaline that make you want to drive fast and recklessly. But I believe no one cares for game soundtracks anymore, since most people just mute the game music and use an external music player.\n-The story feels kinda dull. The story is amazing the first minutes of gameplay, but once you hit the road it doesn't feel like a big deal anymore, but all online-focused games are like this. I haven't completed the game yet, so take this one with a grain of salt.\n-Cops are lazy. You have to do some real ♥♥♥♥ for them to go after you, just driving a clearly illegaly modified car 100Km/h above speed limit won't do it. Some people will love it, some others will hate it. Sometimes they also appear during races and don't do anything. In events where they're the main deal it's a different story, of course.\n\nCons:\n-The car sounds are pretty bad, they just don't sound reallistic. Sometimes I feel like hearing an engine that came from a 2005 game.\n-You win performance parts in every event, which completely makes the performance shop useless allowing you to make a lot of money very easily since you have to spend very little of it to progress through the game. Remember that I haven't completed the game yet, it may change at some point.\n-You can't play the game offline, as far as I know. People who don't have access to a decent connection all the time must be very careful when buying this game.\n\nSome people have been saying this game is horrible, it is not. I haven't experienced bugs, lags, freezes, ctds or anything like that. The game is just great, even though it's not amazing. It's a great game that will give you a lot of fun specially if you play with your friends, but there's nothing really groundbraking about it.\nAlso, don't pay attention to those people saying that the game's handling and physics are horrible. It's an arcade game and it was designed to be so, so don't expect reallistic collisions, steering, car damage or anything like that. It has very good mechanics for an arcade game. It's not just an "accelerate and steer game" and you can still make mistakes in it, considering that you're playing on hardcore mode.\n\nI give this game a solid 7.8/10\n\nIf you have any doubts if you should or should not buy the game, feel free to ask me any questions ; )","December 3, 2014","true","82.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Changing it from "All assists" to "Sport" will make it feel like you have much more control over the car. Setting the steering speed factor all the way to the right will make it feel a lot less sluggish when turning. Setting sensitivity a bit to the right can also help.\n\nDuring the beta, I found the handling to feel much better after doing this and enjoyed the game quite a lot.

The costumization is great, the cars are sweet, and the variety is great. I've never played a racing game that has a Ferrari 458, and a 2010 Chevy SIlverado. The map is awsome. Instead of being stuck in one city, you can cross the entire U.S. The cities aren't perfect, or even close for that matter, but if you play the game in the right mind set, where nothing is perfect, you'll have fun.

IMO best story ever in a racing game. 65 Missions\n- Some extremely long races. 2.5 hours from Miami to Los Angeles via New York!!!\n(Perfect to turn your head off after a long day at the office)\n- Nice graphics (if you find the right settings)\n- Many ways to improve your cars.\n- Cars can be tuned into street, off-road, performance, race or rally cars.\n(some cars can only be tuned into some of the types)\n- Visual tuning\n- Performance tuning\n- Co-op missions\n- Cockpit view\n- Different radio stations\n- Country side looks fantastic (cities not always)\n- Total open world, also in all races\n- All cars feel different\n- Police (but too easy to escape)\n- Tons of mini games\n- All kind of animals, the crocodiles in the New Orleans swamps look fantastic\n- day/night cycle\n- addictive\n\nCons:\n\n- Frame-rate sometimes drops, especially in cities. Changing graphic settings does not prevent this.\n- Car handling isn't the best in the beginning of the game but gets better after improving individual car settings\n- Very hard to make money, but you need money to buy cars. After 40 hours of playing I only have like 10 cars. There are about 50 cars in the game but you have to consider the different race-types (race, rally, etc.) So you can have like 200 different cars if you have the money. (not all cars support all types)\n- You can buy game money with real money :-(((\n- Some cars can only be bought with real money :-(((\n...but you do not need them to win in MP\n- Permanent on-line connection required\n- Game takes long to start\n- Upgrading cars is time consuming and can be frustrating. Every car can be upgraded to max level 1299. You need to play tests (hill climb, slalom, speed test, escape, etc.) to collect upgrade kits. But the game randomly decides which upgrade level you will receive. So even if you successfully complete the test you might not get the upgrade part you need. If you attempt to upgrade a car that already has a high level you can repeat tests like 50 times without being granted with the missing part, although you succeeded the test 50 times. Alternatively you can buy missing car parts but only if you have already earned the desired upgrade level and the fact that the game keeps you low on money makes upgrading by buying parts a painful decision.\n- MP race selection can be frustrating. Before each mp event every player can select their favorite event. Players can select the track, the car type and mp event type (racing, king of the crown, etc.). They can decide to activate or deactivate contact with other players and activate or deactivate traffic. A random selection carried out by the game will decide who's player selection will be played next.\n- High influence of luck in MP if you play with crash kids. You can lead 90% of a race but if someone pushes you into a field at 300 kph you're almost certain to become last. IMO it's best to select races with deactivated player contact but it's a matter of luck if you will play such race or not because the game decides which event is going to be played.\n- AI is too easy most of the time\n- Not a MMO. Eight simultaneous players in free drive mode\n- No rain, no snow, no weather conditions\n- Uplay\n- If Ubisoft servers are unavailable you can not play.\n- Sometimes mp players seem to cheat, but very rarely.\n\n'The Crew' is not a serious racing game like 'Dirt', 'Grid' or 'Project Cars'. It's an arcade fun racer in a cozy, feel good world that simply looks fantastic.

Because this is the only decent Arcade Racer game yet on pc, and im sure when NFS out on PC it will knock the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game :D\n\nShort Review: Good Story and Large map to play with + BIKES!! , Lack of Cars + Bad car Costumization. So get this game only when it goes on Sale, i dont recommend you to buy it at full price,\n\nNow for Pros and Cons:\n\n+ Preety good story that can keep you playing for 1 week just for the stories. I say this because i have completed the story for 2nd time and it still enjoyable :D\n\n+ Large map you can travel across USA and it takes roughly 30-50 minutes to travel from Chicago to Miami. Imagine going from side to side :D Really fun for cruising around good scenery.\n\n+ Have diffrent kind of weather, like Rain, Snow, Thunderstorm, Sunny. If they add Tornadoes it would be so cool!\n\n+ Monster Trucks, Dragster and Drift spec, Lovin It!\n\n+ BIKES makes your game more easier to beat hahahaha\n\n+ Decent graphic after the Wild Run update.\n\nNow for the cons:\n\n- Bad costumization option.\n\n- Lack of Japanese car and some old European cars. Too much supercars here.\n\n- PVP not so good right now, but still enjoyable though.\n\n- Online feature in this game still kinda meh. Like Crew feature is kinda useless here which is they promised to #NeverDriveAlone but for me its #AlwaysDriveAlone.\n\nSo you may ask "Do you Recommend it?" then My answer is, If you REALLY REALLY want to play an Arcade Racer then get this game. Becaus its currently the decent Arcade racer game you can get for PC right now, When NFS released i wont recommend you to get this game tho.","December 30, 2015","true","41.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It is good game. But it looks like devs hired few pigs from EA because you will find in game content you have to buy to be able to use. It is not just disgusting begging for your money but it is unethical and also immoral. It reminds me NFS MW 2013 where you found the car you want to drive and the game pop up you the store page.

Which i have completed and put many hours, and more to come. So I wanted to write a proper review about this game and what I think about it.

The cars are great to ride to grind for, you get the feeling after playing hours and hours of grinding and then get the car you really want is rewarding. Which is a great feeling to me, the story is decent, its not the best story but not a bad one at that. There is also online which is okay, and theres PVP gamemode which you vs other players, which was fun but not a lot of people were playing.

If I had to rate the game, I would give it a 8/10 because I really enjoy this game, and like I said the only real problem is that they dont warn you about needing to but the Wild Run.

There are a few main points of contention I have with the game.\n\n#1. The car list.\nMaybe there were licensing issues or something along those lines but the car list in this game is a massive disappointment. If you're making a game set in the entirity of the US give us some good American cars. I'd love to see classics like your C2 or C3 Corvettes, Pontiac Trans Am, Impalas, '60s Mustangs and even weird obscure stuff like a Buick Grand National. Another thing is that for a game released in late 2014 all the 'new' cars seem to be a few years old. For example you have a 2010 Camaro, a 2010 Challenger, a 2010 370Z, a 2010 Continental Supersports, a 2009 Corvette ZR1, a 2010 BMW Z4, A 2011 M5, a 2010 Focus RS, a 2011 Mustang, a 2012 V8 Vantage,a 2010 Viper, a 2011 Grand Cherokee, a 2011 F150 Raptor and a 2011 McLaren 12C. Maybe it was due to a lengthy dev time but it just seems strange to have a new racing game with a car list this slightly dated. Another thing that annoys me about the car list is that there is an R34 GT-R V-Spec that is Left Hand Drive, they only ever made them RHD that's why Americans who are into "JDM" (That's another rant for another time) go crazy for them.\n\n#2. The customisation.\nThe vehicle customisation in this game is odd in that it's very in depth but also very limited. An example would be that I can put a stripe on my car but I can't change the colour of that stripe. All I want is a purple Camaro with a green stripe to give other players their daily dose but because of the arbitrary restrictions in the customisation menus I can't. All they had to do was emulate Forza or one of the PS2 era NFS games but Ivory Tower screwed that up.\n\n#3. The vehicle classes.\nWhen this game was hyped in pre release and during the beta it was shown that every car could be used in every class (Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit) but when the game was released there were restrictions and limitations as to what car can be used with what class. For example a Golf GTI can only be used in Street spec which sucks because Street spec is garbage. A Dirt or Perf spec GTI would be fantastic but it can't happen because the game says so.\n\n#4. The Physics.\nNot necessarily the driving physics, they're fine but they do start out pretty terrible (they improve as your car improves) but the crash physics and impact physics are screwed up beyond belief with my cars commonly performing physically impossible maneuvers. Another thing that isn't entirely physics related is that during the start of every race an animation plays where you cars rear wheels spin even if you have a front or all wheel drive car, as someone who likes detail in their driving games this upsets me greatly.\n\n#5. Crew Credits.\nThey're a currency you buy with real money. Need I say more?\n\n#6. The "MMO" aspect.\nThis game is not an MMO. Ubisoft are lying to you, it might be multiplayer but it is 8 people per server and with a map this large you are spread out most of the time and barely have any interaction. The 'Never Drive Alone' tag was a lie as I spent most of my hours in this game driving alone.\n\nWhat this game needs is a sequel made by more competent devs and with more attention to the little details. It also shouldn't be marketed as an MMO because it isn't.","March 2, 2015","false","61.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Don't. Unless you plan on playing with a few friends, this game is absolutely horrible.\n\nCONS:\n60% of the campaign you're not allowed to play with friends.\n\nBots have PERFECT handeling, I mean P.E.R.F.E.C.T. handeling, making for extremely frustrating gameplay.\n\nThe amazing "always online" gameplay is not entirely there. Sure there it's online but it's not what they make it out to be.\n\nThe bronze silver gold ranking for races are absolutely wonkers. For example, I was first place 94% of the race (according to the end race results), and by the finish of the race I had 10 seconds on the 2nd place runner. I not only had to restart a million times, but I had to make the other bots crash for me to get in first. I got a bronze medal.\n\nVehicle customization is not there what-so-ever. Most vehicles have near to no body kits, and it costs money out the ♥♥♥ to make your cars look cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROS:\nGame is pretty.

The game will only swap controls, so you'll end up with a ♥♥♥♥ed up control scheme after changing 3 bindings. Also, the game doesn't let you get rid of useless ♥♥♥♥ you don't need to have on a controller, like a button to see your friends or a button to activate missions when you can do that from the map or the controller start button, or, maybe one of the 4135643513 keys on the keyboard sitting in front of you (Remember this is a pc game? I don't think the devs did).\n\nAfter dicking around in the menu for 20 minutes you'll think you're all set and start a race, turn a corner, hit the button you bound to look behind you, but instead downshift, hit your handbrake, set off your nitrous, blow the welds on the intake manifold, remove your brake calipers like the white Jetta in Fast and Furious, yell "MONICA!!!!!!", pop a wheelie, say a remembrance prayer for Paul Walker, and lose the race.  If you hold it down, it'll teleport you to New Orleans and put in a reservation for you at Bubba Gump's Shrimp Company.\n\nIf you want to change the asinine keybinds on this game, run forrest, run the hell away.","March 12","false","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I have loved it ever since I heard of it, when it came avalible for pre order, I bought it, then went out and bought parts to make sure my computer could handle it. I still like it, getting into a car and just driving across the huge landscape is just extreamly relaxing and thrilling at times.\n\nWith that being said, I highly recommend you -DO NOT- buy this game. Ubisoft has been for some time trying to be worse than EA in jackassery, and they have somehow suceeded very well. As pointed out by the other reviews, season pass effects nothing with Wild Run, a forced update and major expanshion that the game now prettymuch relies on and costs as much as the normal game, dispite only giving you limited content. [Four new class types and new event zones mainly]\n\nIf you are able to pick this game up dirt cheap, sure, go for it, the aimless driving is fun, but that is all that this game offers now, aimless driving. I hate Need for Speed, but you'd be highly better off buying one of them, and that hurts for me to admit that.

This is punishing current owners, even if you don't account for the drop in price or the discount, because it means that as someone who actively owns the game it effectively is more expensive for me to get to the same point than it is for someone who doesn't get own it.\n\nIf you compare gained content, rather than raw price, I am gaining the same amount (Wild Run) for $15 that someone who buys the Wild Run edition gets for $9.\n\nI wanted to get Far Cry Primal to play with my life-time coop buddy, because I love Far Cry. I own FC3 and FC4.\n\nI am never buying an Ubisoft game again. Ever. Because I know this company direction is going to continue forever.

I feel as you progress more, it'll be easier but when you have to go and get performance vehicles.... be prepared to spend lots of your time grinding for money if you want an actual decent car.\n\n-Ranked\nI feel as though they let you go into ranked WAY too early as I went into it (Not at all knowing what I was doing...) and was matched with the top of the top players (Platinum, Gold, Etc.). While they had level 1499 Vehicles, i sat there with a puny level 300..... As that may be my own fault for rushing it, I just recommend if you play to wait a LONG time before playing ranked.\n\n-Street Challenges\nAs this may just be my own personal opinion, I find as you're driving down the road, the excessive amount of Street Challenges are way too much. They typically cover the entire road, and frankly try to force you to do them. You literally have to swerve off the side of the road to avoid them... Personally, I just find them annoying as they hardly reward you anything and are quite dull, typically trying to force me off the path I was originally going.\n\n-Wild Run\nAs this isn't nessicarily a con to me, I find lots of people complaining since the season pass didnt include Wild Run. As I didn't pre-order or buy the Season Pass expecting it (Due to me buying the game far after the big fuss about it happened) I don't find this really a con since it's only $10 more. Though do be warned, season pass doesn't include ALL dlc like most games have it. It lacks a big item that the game basically requires and tries to force onto you, Wild Run.\n\n-Basic Story Plot\nI won't spoil anything for you but, if you have ever played Need For Speed: Undercover.... This is basically that game. It has pratically the exact same plot and will give you extreme de ja vu.\n\n-Bad Graphics...\nAs this isn't such a big deal to me, the graphics for some things do make me laugh. The graphics for scratches are incredibly cheaply made... That's really all I have for that one... It's just rather funny how horrible they are.\n\n\nNow Onto the Pros\n\n-Long Story\nAt the time of writing this, I am 10.3 Hours into the game, and still not even halfway into the game. It seems to be VERY long which I absolutely love, something most games nowadays seem to lack.\n\n-Some Nice Cars\nThere are some very nice, detailed cars in the game. Though expensive.\n\n-Entertaining\nI've always been a big fan of Racing Games and I can say, this game I absolutely fell in love with. It's one game that I can actually sit down and play for a long while without getting bored, which is very few for me.\n\n-Controls\nOkay, This is moreso to personal preference but - The Controls for this game is rather different compared to most games. If you're using a controller, it may seem a bit weird just to how the handling is, but I can say after a while you will get use to it. I personally fell in love with it.\n\n\nI would probably rate this game 7/10... It could definitely be better, but It's still rather good. A nice relaxing game to come home to if you have nothing else to do","May 19","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Ubisoft brings a massive wide open world to join up with friends and drive around completing races and winning money.  While it has a few bugs and gripes, it's generally still a fun game.  Playing multiplayer can sometimes have its faults.  Other players' cars will sometimes jostle around the road or almost "vibrate".  Makes it hard to race with friends and stay close to their bumper without hitting them and knocking them off course.  I have been disconnected quite a few times while playing multiplayer, which requires restarting the game to fix.  Hopefully these are all bugs that will be corrected, and not just pushed aside and forgotten when Ubisoft decides to just stop supporting the game.","December 20, 2014","true","86.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The freedom and choice is yours to make.  Follow the story, venture out and explore, and/or compete in challenges and races. The game feels a lot like Watchdogs if you never left the vehicle only on a larger scale with less people walking around. The vehicles handle similar to the vehicles in Watchdogs intially, but moding them greatly increases performance as you level the car.  Street, dirt, and track veriations of car modifications can be made for all different types of races as well as a large veriety of cosmetic options to customize your ride.  You will not get the sim race track feeling here as the cars are not heavily based on true physics like you would find in the Grid series.  This is definately an arcade style racing game more in line with Need for Speed that provides hours of fun!\n\nNot Just a RacerThe Crew is more than just a traditional racing game.  It is a MMO racing game.  The game is designed to play with other people by joining crews so that you can work together in missions.  Playing with others in your crew provides extra incentives such as experience and cash.  You can put skill points into your bonuses to increase rewards received from playing with your crew members as well as benefits to enhance your car such as reduced repair costs, better breaking, etc. However, the game can be played solo with just as much fun.\n\nWeak LinkageAnd here is the weak link in the design of The Crew.  People expecting a MMO will immediately notice that there is no need to join a community to play the game.  The option is there with some rewards but there is no real push to do so.

It would have been nice to see large cross country races pitting  multiple four man crews against crews or larger 16 plus members competing together in a large scale race against other crews or AI; but what we received was on a much smaller basis for those that want to play solo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geekl33tgamer/recommended/241560/","geekl33tgamer","geekl33tgamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geekl33tgamer/","99 products in account","Score: 80	 Author: geekl33tgamer	 Test Drive Unlimited Reddux?\nhttp://www.geekl33tgamer.co.uk/reviews/198-the-crew-review\n\nFrom the outset, the core concept of the game seems very appealing to anyone who has ever picked up a copy of any recent Need for Speed title, or the poorly executed (but great idea) Test Drive Unlimited game. Here we have a huge sprawling online world, filled with literally thousands of players, all going about their own thing with a Need for Speed and Burnout inspired driving model.\n\nThe games career play is a very cinematic affair, and within the first few minutes of starting the game you’ll soon start to understand how this game’s style will play itself out. You start off with some cut-scenes of a chase which you get thrown into, this is basically your tutorial. You need to race to the checkpoint marker whilst keeping the vehicle pointing in the general direction. It was certainly a very entertaining start to a game if ever there was one.\n\nYou get taken to a garage, meet some key characters who set the scene for the plot in the career play, and you need to buy a car. To begin, you only have a selection of 4 cars to buy, and once you have chosen one your given brief tutorials to the tuning system, car upgrades, perk points and such. There’s not a lot you can buy at this stage, but it’s handy to remember where these things are for later when you have enough cash.\nYou then begin your journey, working undercover for the FBI whilst infiltrating the 510 car faction. So as not to spoil it for anyone, we shall not go on any further about the plot within The Crew as may are still playing through it, or may not have purchased it yet.\n\nWhen you have a required first few events of the tutorial / prologue out the way, you are free to play The Crew however you wish. You can crack on with the career play, or so exploring. This is where you get your first look at the seemingly huge map that you have to play in. It is littered with icons of all the events you can do, your friends positions are shown as well as the major cities.\n\nOur first thoughts were that the map is very, very large – however we quickly found out that it isn’t. Despite appearing large, we can drive from the east coast to the west in a little over an hour. Missions as you play them will move you over most of it, but we felt a little disappointed it wasn’t as expansive as the map from Test Drive Unlimited for example. It doesn’t feel too small neither, but isn’t as unwieldy as it first appears to be.\n\nAs you explore the world, between events on literally every road are skill events you can just drive into at full speed to activate a mini-challenge. This helps break up the monotonous task of driving long distances between places, and gives you extra cash to spend in-game as well as car parts and experience points. Once you’ve explore enough areas, the game has a fast travel feature so you can easily jump back to anywhere you’ve previously been. If you discover the airports and train stations, you can also use these.\n\nThe major US cities litter the map, and the world is busy with jots of NPC traffic filling up the places. The cities never really feel big enough, but we understand the compromises that they had to make here to a point. Each city has a unique vibe and appearance. The mountain sections look particularly impressive, as does the games day and night cycle. It creates a great environment overall.\n\nThere are 4 cars to start with, but you can purchase any of the others as you discover new garages on the map. New garages unlock new classes of cars, but for a car game the total amount of cars we counted was only 45. We know Ubisoft plan to add more (with a season pass, sold extra), but the amount in the game does seem disappointing.\nOf the cars that are in there, they are nicely replicated visually. Each car you buy can be upgraded and tuned into different cars to suit your environment or event. Almost all the cars can be upgraded to street spec, performance, track, dirt and raid classes. The latter 2 are heavy duty modifications that make your car great off road, while the others lend themselves well to road racing. You can customize most visual areas of the car, upgrade its engine parts, and add decals. It adds enough to the car customization to make the cars to make them feel like they are personally yours, but the tuning options do not go deep enough for some. The upgrade parts are fixed, so you can buy varying grades of better brakes, or a differential, but you can’t tweak them if you wanted to say shift the brake bias forward.\n\nPerhaps the limiting of the granularity in the tuning area is deliberate so the game is more accessible. We don’t mind it as it does offer enough, but I know from speaking to players while racing, some were not happy with it. They equally wasn’t thrilled by the cars handling model. It is very much in the arcade category, but we expected that. It makes the game enjoyable to zoom around and have fun without needing to pay too much attention to corner entry lines and braking – Instead you can hone your skills on seeing how high you can jump off the ski-slope for example.\n\nNow, this is perhaps the game’s biggest selling point, and in Ubisoft’s own words they say “You’ll never drive alone”. I need to make it clear from the get go that this game does not have all the Uplay problems that come with Watch Dogs at launch, or any of the other recent titles released – However there are still problems.\n\nWe had no problems getting into the servers on launch day, despite the large surge of traffic, but the connection reliability has been ropy from time to time while playing. Without any warning whatsoever, if your connection drops for even a second, you’re returned to your desktop with an error message about the servers not being reached. That is coupled with the fact that every time it does this, some of your game progress gets lost. When you re-load the game, you will invariably find yourself many miles from where you actually were when it threw you out. This unfortunately happens with varying frequency, but it is something they are aware of so we hope it improves.\n\nAnother widely touted feature was the ability to form a Crew on the fly from either your friends or others who are in the world with you. Crews are important to help with the co-op options available in most missions – Some are quite difficult to do on your own, so pulling in others is an easier way to beat that one mission you may have been stalled on.\nSadly, we encountered several problems with this that could easily take up most of this review. We had problems adding friends into Uplay first off, and getting the game to recognize them in the game so I could add them. All too often friends in Uplay would not appear within the game itself. When they did, getting them added to the crew is simply an exercise of luck. Constant errors and timeout’s hampered forming a Crew on the fly as intended, and I found myself driving around by myself a lot of the time as a result. It’s currently near impossible to add players who are in a different country to yourself too, and this frustrate me further.\n\nAs a final nail in the coffin where online play is concerned, if you have the game in Steam as we do, you can’t invite your Steam friends into a game at all. You need to ask your friend for their Uplay ID, try and add them and then go through the process above.\n\nI feel players who buy into the game expecting a racing simulator should steer well clear, but if Need for Speed and Burnout style games are your thing, we think you’ll love The Crew. We do.","December 19, 2014","true","67.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

From the unwanted Wild Run "upgrade" that is one big advertisement for the Wild Run DLC, to the inexplicable graphical and physics bugs, and the rubberbanding AI, stay away from this game. It doesn't matter if you are a fan of racing games or massive open worlds, this game is not worth your time. Trust me, I've played 100+ hours and I just had the final straw. While playing a long-running faction mission (> 1 hr long) the road disappeared and left me unable to steer, accelerate or brake. I had to abort the mission. The usual fix of bringing up the map doesn't work because you can't bring up the map during missions. If you are a fan of games that have a well-designed difficulty progression then this game is not for you, either. Some missions are overly easy and others that are ranked as easy are next to impossible. Likewise, some hard-ranked missions are way too easy. It's as if random goals were set for each mission and the difficulty rankings were randomly set as well. That said, if you like games where you have to grind to progress, then this game is for you. Not only do you have to grind for upgrades, but just playing the game is a grind. In my experience the most fun thing to do in the game is to free drive with your friends, and not the game itself.","December 20, 2015","false","135.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","2"

This makes progression feel really slow and nonexistent, but in multiplayer it's extremely nice that the gap between vehicle levels is quite small, so you don't have to grind out max level parts.\n\nMixed Bag:\n~ Graphics look pretty good on high settings, but optimization is not what it could be... even if you can run games like Battlefield 4 on ultra settings, you might not be able to get 60 fps in The Crew without lowering some. And this game looks really bad with low textures, geometry, ambient occlusion and environment mapping... like worse than racing games from 2008.\n\n~ The vehicles are well done, but there is a very limited selection of them.\n\n~ Customization is alright. On some cars there are tons of options for visual customization, and on other cars there's nothing beyond a paint job. Different "specs" of the same car also have different customization options, and sometimes none at all.\n\n~ The world is very repetitive - a lot of it feels copypasta, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. While they could have made the major cities stand out a bit more, if every part of the world was unique the game would be like 200GB. So it's alright.\n\nCons:\n- Graphical issues in some areas, where there is a lack of texture blending, or awkward white around edges.\n\n- Vehicle handling mechanics are very poor. Your cars turn rather slowly, continue to turn for a short period (even with driving assistance disabled) after you straighten the wheel/thumbstick, and very easily skid out. The cars are also very stubborn when taking corners. Drifting isn't an option since you lose a LOT of speed, and your cars grip the road at all the wrong times. Often times your steering will feel jammed where your car continues to turn at a certain angle in spite of your speed changing or you changing your steering - happens a lot when skidding. The game is all about corners - acceleration in this game is pretty slow, so if someone comes out of a corner slightly faster than you did, they're going to gain a lot of ground.\n\n- Physics aren't great. You can crash into railings or other vehicles and maintain your speed, and other times you hit a pebble and your car goes spinning out of control or flies fifty feet in the air.\n\n- The game isn't massively multiplayer at all. There are up to 7 other players in the lobby with you at a time, usually fewer. The 'campaign' is very uninspired, and is simply generic mission after mission where you can invite friends or lobby members to join it with you. The only things to really do as a group are the instanced PvP Races, Storyline missions, and Faction missions (basically just more generic events against CPU).\n\n- Matchmaking for PvP lobbies is terrible. You can't simply wait for more people to join, the race starts after the same amount of time. The lobbies are divided up by parts of the map, rather than putting everyone into a large matchmaking pool and having more variety within a single lobby. There is the West Coast, Mountain States, Midwest, East Coast and South lobbies. Each one has 20 events to choose from. Midwest and East Coast almost never has games. A lot of the events are the same as each other but with a different type of vehicle (such as street vs performance vs circuit).\n\n- Connectivity issues. Can be in a lobby with my crew members and they will be right in front of me, but we can't actually see each other. Sometimes we get booted from the Crew for no reason (and our internet is fine).\n\n- Primary source of income is a farmville-like thing. You pick faction missions and can "send friends" (from your friends list) to complete it. The more friends you send, the higher the chance to complete it. They finish in like 12 hours, and you collect the reward.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong... the game is pretty fun, but this is far from a Triple-A title, and there should have been a lot more work into the game. Handling mechanics, physics and multiplayer gameplay all should have been improved. The rest is stuff that I can live with and isn't a huge deal - even the poor matchmaking is something you can deal with, you just have to wait a bit longer than ideal to find a game. But the cars handle so poorly, there's nothing interesting to do with other players outside of the multiplayer races (which you have in any racing game, nothing "massively" multiplayer about it) and you can't really drift (which is like the funnest thing to do in racing games)... it's just so frustrating and lacks the fun factor, IMO.\n\nIt's fun to play, but not worth anywhere near $60. This was very overhyped and poorly exectued. I'd suggest getting this game when (if) the price drops to around $30.... that is if anyone still plays it then.","February 10, 2015","false","62.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This game truely has it all; two tracks, bayous, jumps, cities, MILES upon MILES of roads. The scope is simply amazing. I have seen some people say that this game lacks detail because of the size, but I simply don't think thats true. Going through my neck of the woods (Michigan area) I can clearly see they nailed the look and feel of the state, and I think the pure size only enhanses the experience. As for the handling think heavy Need For Speed influence with maybe a hint of Burnout. Definitely not a game for the people who are simulation master race, more of a fun game for everyone else who just loves driving for the enjoyment. There is nothing more satisfying than logging in with some friends and just cruising across the Rocky Mountains or flying through the Vegas dunes, and thats why this game is so good.\n\nAs for the bad, there isn't a whole lot. My main complaint would be with the AI being able to hang with you even if your car is rated over double theirs. However this makes the game more challenging, so its not really much of a con. Also the disabiling missions aren't very fun. They are all doable since the AI takes the same path every time, its just annoying the first time you hit them and they have 6 health and you have to chase them for 60 seconds only to love tap them and kill them.\n\nPros:\n- Great arcade driving feel\n- Huge world\n- Cruising with your friends across America\n\nCons:\n- AI rubber bands hard even if you have an insane car\n- The disabling missions aren't fun\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nAnyone who gives this game less than a 7 missed the point.","December 7, 2014","true","37.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The little research I put into the game gave me the impression it was more of a Gran Tourismo/ Forza fell rather than the Need for Speed game that it is. The tuning system is very simple and easy to use. In regards to customizing performance there isn't any adjusting specific specifications. The entire system is based on "part 4" is better than "part 3" by xxx points. Simple and effective, just not what I expected.\n\nThe games racing phsyics are probably my biggest complaint. It has a very arcade feel. Say there is a pebble in the road. We'll call it 'bob'. Say you hit bob on a run with your front left tire at +100mph plus. Bob may just nudge you a little bit causing you to have to steer and correct course. Another run you may clip the same bob at 40mph on your rear right and find your vehicle 30ft in the air while spinning like you were shot from a canon. Then your next run bob decides to take your front left tire at 80mph and throw you into a spin where you may travel over 50yards off road before being able to regain control. Now I love my wrecks but some sort of consistency in the games phsyics would be expected of a game title like this.\n\nAll in all the game is still fun. It even has a ton of acheivments to unlock, plenty of vehicles for your specific taste, visual customizations are abundant also. End game gameplay is fun and they offer various styles of events to enterain your mood what ever it is.\n\nI'll keep playing it so look for me in game.

And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.\n- The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.\n- Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;\n- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.\n- Cockpit view:\n- When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.\n- In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;\n- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down.\n- Some of the game physics are just out of this world:\n- You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.\n- You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;\n- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.\n- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.\n\n(...)\n\nAnd there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to "farm" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.\nBecause you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.\n\nShould you buy the game?\nYes/No.\n- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.\n- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this.\n\nTo me this was the most expensive "early-acess" that I've ever bought.","February 1, 2015","false","13.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leukujekku/recommended/241560/","leukujekku","Deranger[FI]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leukujekku/","119 products in account","Big Game industry is full of hype. Don't believe what you see on the trailers, I tell ya! (..at least that's true in most cases)\n\nIt's harder to know these days if the game is good or not. Many people get amped up by the hype of salesmans and their trailers with awesome music, superb graphics (which in many games  are from cutscenes and no actual gameplay) and all that stuff. Emotions sell. That has made me think a lot harder on what games to invest in.\n\nI thought about buying this game a couple of days, during which, I watched a lot of youtube early access videos, read some reviews and so on. And finally decided to buy it. I'm now very happy I did.\n\nMany times with big releases, there comes the feeling of money gone to waste. Not in this case. THIS GAME is, simply put, AWESOME!!\n\nActually I can honestly say that it's the best racing game I've ever played. I really can't compare it to the good old racing games, because it's been so long. I was a hardcore carmageddon fan back when it was the new hot stuff. Also need for speed since the first game of the series, and enjoyed them very much with maybe one or two exceptions of the NFS series later releases. I also liked Flatout 1&2 very much and Gran Turismo 5 was my the only racing game on PS3 I played a lot. And thought bugbears new Next Car Game on PC looks good, it seems to be pretty much same the formula then Flatout2, just with minor upgrades and graphics upgraded ofc - nothing this major as we see on The Crew.\n\nI'm listing these just so that you know, what I'm rating this against, and what kind of driving games I usually enjoy.\n\nI haven't bumbed to games like that in a looong time and was starting to worry that they're gone extinct. Luckily my fears were unjustified. The Crew really delivers!\n\nThe part I've read some critique is the phrase "never drive alone". Well, yeah, it's kinda true. There are lots of people online, but the time I've played, only one dude crewed up for a race without me asking first. But since I haven't been looking to form a crew yet, can't really complain about that.\n\nAnd I must say that the time flies with this game even if you play solo races. go exploring or just enjoy driving and leveling up. Also, it probably the launch is effecting to that too because I'd think that lots of people are busy leveling up their rides and exploring. And of course, people come and go and play at different times, on different timezone and so on.\n\nIf you have 1-3 friends, who enjoy racing games and play a lot at similar times then you do, then think no further. I can't imagine how much fun this game can be if you play it with 1-3 IRL friends, with teamspeak ofc.\n\nAnother thing, the world is HUGE. Also the terrain is done very well. Mountains feel like mountains. There are lots of racing tracks, like the legendary Pike's peak, some oval tracks and one of my favorite from Gran Turismo: Mazda's Laguna Seca raceway! And many others. You can naturally also go check Death Valley, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon and so on.\n\nI've explored maybe 1/5 of the map in 12 hours, and I've done a lot of exploring during that time. If you think you might enjoy driving from coast to coast, it's going to take a long time to drive. Luckily there is an option to drop in at locations you've already been. Also it's possible to just take a plane and from NY to Las Vegas, and you're instantly teleported to the airport, if you don't care for joyriding cross the country.\n\nDuring the 12 hours I've played so far, the negative can be pretty much summed to the following:\n\n-Uplay.\n\n-3-4 server disconnects during 12 hours gameplay. But if they fix this, I think it's acceptable during the early stages. The server load must be huge. But still, it's a minus because company like Ubisoft should have the resources to host the game. Better to have some extra capacity going to waste during launch, then the other way around.\n\n-Uplay. I hate the fact that I have to run steam and Uplay at the same time\n\n-Some very minor bugs, that really haven't effected the gameplay, for me at least. The guide thingy that shows you where the waypoint is pointing, doesn't always follow the road. This happens rarely though and only with custom map markers. I also have to note that this has happened only couple times during my gameplay, and it's a very minor thing. I hope they fix it though.\n\n-Uplay. Steam doesn't show the people I've played with on uplay ofc, and every steam friend probably has different nickname on uplay. Makes connecting more complicated.\n\n-The cars feel a bit rigid/stiff and slow at start, but once you get to lvl10 or so - you'll get there fast - they start to show some character. 12 hours in and I'm near lvl20 though I've done lots of exploring. I would guess that the leveling gets slower though, when you get to higher levels.\n\n-Season pass/DLC. But this time it feels that I will be getting something for the money, unlike watch dogs for example. I of course don't like to spend 20€ for 12 cars and a bit of content, but as an OVERALL, I think this game is worth the combined price of the game + the season pass. And I can't think of another Ubisoft game I could say the same.\n\n-Car damage could have been done better, in my opinion. I don't know if it's me, but if you crash a car to a brick wall @ 300+ km/h, something should happen (other then the cosmetic fender flying off, and then we go again). Stuff that happened in Flatout2 for example. Wheels flying. Cars being torn apart. Driver flying through the window. That kind of stuff. Or something towards that. That's how I feel about this, others might disagree since it is more towards arcade game. Still, maybe they could have implemented a toggle switch for that for those players who want more car damage.\n\n-Cop cars sometimes way too overpowered. they will catch you with their normal cars weather you're driving on road or on corn field. Sometimes this makes very nice getaway races though, but more then half ot the time it's a bit ridiculous when you're going 280km/h and your car is like a huge magnet for cop car(s) to ram into.\n\nCONCLUSION: 9/10 (might change this as I get more time into the game, but for now)\n\nAFTERTHOUGHTS:\n\nMe being on steam for years, and this being the first review I've ever written should say something of this game.\n\nBut to be absolutely clear: If you have ever liked racing games like NFS series, Flatout and racing in general and have the hardware to run this game, definitely buy this one.

I consider myself a car enthusiast and tend to be more meticulous when playing games in this genre. The ability to create my own fun within sprawling open world of games like Test Drive Unlimited allowed me to spend endless hours cruising around. Thanks to solid underpinnings such as: satisfying driving physics, beautiful car design, and accurate engine sounds, I didn't have to rely on other lacking aspects of the game like: bland writing, mediocre voice acting, and tedious missions to support the enjoyment. Unfortunately, Ivory Tower’s attempt does provide a platform that satisfies this balance.\n\nI'll begin with one of the focal point of Ubisoft's advertisement campaign for The Crew - the map. As you probably know, it's a scale representation of the United States and it's huge. It consists of four distinct areas and smaller regions within. The diverse biomes of these regions were a treat to explore due to subtle differences in foliage, climate, and even the way a car handles. However, I feel that it’s a case of quantity over quality. On the whole, the road systems are uncomplicated, resulting in driving any distance becoming monotonous. It feels as though they were designed using tools from a city building game – “copied and pasted road assets” would be the answer to every I-spy question on long journeys.\n\nSo will the handling redeem The Crew of its boring highways? No. To put it bluntly – it’s bloody awful. I have spent so many hours fiddling the various settings to find a set up that would work. The Crew turns the joystick on a gamepad to a D-pad. There’s no chance of a subtle adjustment to steering mid-corner, you get full steer or nothing. This is particularly frustrating because, in 2011, Ubisoft’s Driver: San Francisco showed that their arcade-esque take on car physics could actually provide for a really satisfying drive. But seemingly none of this charm rubbed off to The Crew in 2014.\n\nOn somewhat of a side note, The Crew was not a shambles of a release like some other Ubisoft titles of recent. It runs frame rates as would be expected and glitches are few-and-far-between. There were some initial multiplayer issues which seem to have since been resolved.\n\nI won’t spend long attending to the story line of The Crew. Does anyone buy this sort of game for the story? Being brief, it’s mostly bearable and easily forgettable. Engine sounds are nothing special. They’re different for each car but many sound badly synthesised and have no grunt to them. Car design is generally decent and aesthetic customisation options are plentiful. However, the performance upgrade system is based on simple units, the scale and progression of which seems to have no bearing on the outcome of races anyway. And there is a severe lack of cars to choose from – the selection is really poor. Pairing the irrelevant upgrades with an uninspiring grid of AI results in races becoming a chore. The other chase and takedown style missions are tedious and downright frustrating at times. Though far from being the MMO Ubisoft suggested it would be, The Crew does allow for a handful of friends and strangers to join your in-game world. The most memorable moments of my playtime will be synchronous drifting through Yosemite National Park with two strangers in convoy, or improvised drag racing meets on the Bonneville Salt Flats.\n\nThat’s exactly what I hoped The Crew would be, and there are faint glimmers of it throughout. Open world racing games should be a setting for enthusiasts and casuals of any age to create their own fun. Sadly, The Crew doesn’t lay these foundations. It sits alongside recent mediocre Need for Speed games in my rankings and I will probably not return to it. If I had to give it a rating, I’d say 6/10. If you live in the US, pick it up on sale, drive around the area in which you live, then go and buy something like Assetto Corsa or Project Cars for a proper race experience.\n\nA few quirky issues that I had with the game but didn’t feel warranted a point in the general review:\nThe steering wheel on the cockpit view doesn’t do full 900 degree rotation. Come on! Driver: SF had this feature and it was glorious – especially when using a wheel.\nMirrors don’t actually reflect anything. Seriously, all developers, please start implementing this.\nWhilst driving, the user interface feels incredibly cluttered. There seems to be a constant bombardment of notifications, noises and flashing on screen. Shut up and leave me to drive!\nWhen in manual transmission mode, shifting at anything other than the red line will cause a short rev limiter bounce sound to occur. It’s really annoying and I can only speculate it’s laziness on the developer’s part.","May 19, 2015","false","52.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Instead you have to buy using crew credits (cc) if you don't have cc you need to buy it using real money. This is stupid.\n- The prize money you received in game is very little in amount, so you have to wait longer to buy lamborghini or ferrari but if you're impatient you have the option to buy crew credits in order to buy cars without waiting (to me this is a little bit unfair, because people have already paid for the game and you need to pay more in order to buy cars in-game because some people could not afford to buy the crew credits because they have spend it on the game itself)\n\nOverall verdict:\nI recommend this game to those who like cars and exploration type of game. Who enjoys playing with friends and strangers, competitive driving and enjoy site seeing in their dream car on a virtual world. The issue for me is that, the difficulty for this type of game is kinda difficult. It is suppose to be an arcade game, people supposed to enjoy not stress when doing story line missions (especially during the hit and run mission). The fact that you can't change the difficulty is stupid to me. It reminds me of Midnight Club Los Angeles, how hard it is to win races, you have to be focus and not able to enjoy it. It put my stress level high.\n\nThe next thing is that you can't control the car properly on a straight line if you use controller or keyboard, it is utterly impossible to corner and keeping the car on a straight line. This is an arcade game, ivory tower should make the car controllable on any gaming peripherals (keyboards, controllers and steering wheels). I hope that they fix the control issue and also the difficulty settings, let the customer or user choose their own settings.\n\n(Edit) this is my second thoughts on this game 6/10 for me. I hate the internet connection issues. #0_24, #0_34, #0_1..i mean what the?. They should have fix these problems before launching the game.

Think Test Drive Unlimited combined with Driver: San Francisco. Think Need for Speed: World combined with Burnout Paradise. Think…ehh, you get the point. If any of the games I’ve listed so far tickle your fancy, or even combinations of them, then The Crew might be for you.\n\nThe game has its quirks and its rough patches, but it is generally an alright game. The story is bland, the graphics could be a smidge better, the car handling takes time to get used to, and the claim that it’s an MMO is kind of false. I’m not saying the graphics are bad, they just have their moments of making me say “that could look better.”\n\nThe car handling, at least for a 'keyboard racer,' works but feels somewhat odd. I've yet to try The Crew with a controller or steering wheel. At times I feel like I'm not in complete control of the car. Playing with all the assists off just made the game harder, not so much more enjoyable. I now play with all assists on because I'm already tapping the left and right arrow keys twenty times per second. Vehicle collision bugs me. Sometimes you'll tap a wall or car and bounce off unharmed. Other times you'll nudge the same entity and do a full 180 and come to a screeching halt. The AI of the other racers and police are painfully scripted. Cops have near infinite acceleration and top speed at times. Opponent racers haul ♥♥♥ off the line leaving you in the dust for a bit. And towards the end of a race, the AI "gets tired" and basically coasts for the remainder of the race, allowing you to finish first almost every time.\n\nCalling The Crew an MMO is incorrect. The roads aren’t full of other players. In fact, they’re almost completely void of other players. The Crew only ever boasts 8 players on the same map at once. If you’ve played other multiplayer racing games, I’m sure you’re used to the whole “drop-in, drop-out” system. Regardless, for most of the time I’ve played The Crew, I’ve generally been either completely alone in my own world or only paired with 1 or 2 other players. Players can invite others to do missions with them, but I’ve only ever received a handful of invites. It seems that with The Crew you either have friends to drive with or you don’t. But then again, I didn't buy it to mindlessly hang out with other players and talk smack about their iridescent paint jobs.\n\nBut besides this, I find myself compelled to keep playing. The Crew combines open-world racing with some RPG elements. Grinding XP, car parts, and money is there. Oh, and numbers. So many numbers. The sheer amount of digits littering your screen upon completion of a challenge, race, or mission is a bit daunting. But as you do missions, you’ll level up your general level, as well as your car’s level. Thus, more numbers.\n\nNeedless to say, I like The Crew. I’m sure not everyone will enjoy it. It definitely sets itself apart from other racing games, at least a little. I’m a fan of the customization, the leveling, the open-world, and the numbers (oh baby the numbers). It’s a game to keep an eye on to see where it goes, or maybe even what games spawn because of it and its ancestors.

It's nothing like iRacing or Assetto Corsa as in a simulation. This is a Need For Speed Underground 3 with a massive open world driving experience. The car customization is impressive. I started off with a Nissan and finished with a Ford Focus fully tuned with street and dirt specs. Doing challenges was a blast, reminds me of the old Trackmania days competing for a better score/time. Physics are great too. The better the parts you get make a noticable difference in the handling of the car. Not to mention the perks you get as you progress through the campaign. Racing with friends was a blast. The 4 of us beat the campaign, got our dirt tuned vehicles and went cross country up and over hills and into canyons. Traveling from Florida to Washington. From NY to LA. Took quite some time even doing 180+ most of the time with a few crashes. We ran into multiple players and ran them off the road (They were pretyty slow) xD The cosmetics are amazing. Back when NFSUG2 was the game to play, this is the baby of that. A big baby though. Years of research and development going into a large massive MMO racing game that has topped my expectations.","August 29, 2014","true","371.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It's good and I enjoyed it, but not that much.\n\nNote: It's an arcade style game so I've judged it accordingly. IMO a lot of people are judging the car physics and handling etc like they would for simulators, but it is an arcade game so judge it on it's merits. For an arcade style game I think it does really well.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fun single player: Combined the typical "Need for Speed" storyline elements with the GTA style open world roaming allowing you to pick and choose your missions\n- Co-op can be done on any missions, you can do everything on your own or with friends, you don't need to be alone for some missions or with friends for others\n- Graphics are great\n- Haven't encountered ANY issues with the game at all\n- Hidden cars are found by exploration and unlocking areas of the map, not just winning races and earning money\n\nCons:\n\n- Story Mode isn't very long, I've finished it in 18 hours and I didn't use quick travel at all so spent quite a long time driving to some missions\n- Limited selection of cars, possibly because they decided to make DLC but would've been better if they were available as part of the core game\n- Not many "customisation options" at all: This is for both car customisation and audio/graphics/display settings etc. There's really not that much at all compared to other PC games out there\n- Limited replayability: There are some bonus missions and "skills"  and stuff for completionists to do but other than multiplayer with friends and a few longer missions, there's nothing really to do after you finish the game until more missions are released with the upcoming DLC next year, assuming you buy it\n\nOverall, I had fun playing it and would recommend you buy it too if you've enjoyed Need for Speed/Burnout style games in the past, then you'll likely enjoy this too. I would however wait until it is cheaper before purchasing it.","December 8, 2014","true","27.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

It has a big map that can take minutes to hours to explore with a lot of variety when it comes to terrain and climate. There is hidden wrecks that you can find across the map with different specs such as Street Dirt raid perf and curcuit. Most of the wrecks are hot rod based and they have a lot of features when it comes to customization.\n\nThere is a lot of customization in the game such as bumpers spoilers skirts vinyls rims paint but there is something that has been bugging me and that is that some cars doesn't have that much customization options if not anything at all. Like the maserati gran turismo s you basically have no options here except for changing the OFFICIAL rims or the OFFICIAL colours. You can't customize the gran turismo s. And in curcuit spec there isn't that much options either you basically get a big body kit but with no options to change it. Just like raid spec you only get that 1 body kit.\n\nAlso there is a lot of cars / specs from the trailer missing in the game and cars that I would love to be in the game. there is only 2 import tuners in the game and that is the 370z and the skyline R34. Where is the Evo's or the RX7 / RX8's Supra's GT86's ETC? The 2012 Dodge charger has mitsubishi evo parts but it isn't the same.\n\nThe story is very short and very difficult trough the end most likely just to make the gameplay longer. I'm not sure if this game was rushed or they just lost their creativity but if you bought this game just for the story you will be very dissapointed. It feels like the full game didn't include the full story and it just ended too fast.\n\nThe physics are very weird in this game. Sometimes you will get random cutscenes where your car flips and crashes which is skip-able but still can get annoying at times. ESPECIALLY during missions or pvp races.\n\nAfter exploring almost every part of the  crew bought and customized almost every car in the game and found almost all of the wrecks there isn't that much to do anymore. Sure it is fun to do road trips at times but it can get very repetetive.\n\nOverall: Awesome game for cruising and customization but it lacks some features such as fenders specs and cars.

The way the cars feel reminds me instantly of the old need for speed series, which is something nostalgic and fun. Progression through the game will allow you to unlock different specs for your cars, being able to tune up your favorite ride with up to 5 different specs: Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid,  Circuit. Each spec has an immediate impact on the car's handling.\n\nThe story is not the most ingaging one though is not too tone down to be silly or childish. Its just there for you to follow.\n\nThe AI feels cheap, which can sometimes ruin part of the experience. You can indeed outrun them and get some nice distance as long as your driving skills are up to par, but they still somehow manage to keep up a speed that their cars shouldn't be able to have. Not sure if this is working as they intended or a bug, but it would be better if they didn't use cheap tactics to make it "challenging". The cop AI is -okay-. It sure makes me chuckle when i run inches away from a cop at 180mi in a 50 zone and they don't seem to give a damn, but then again, if they actually had to chase people for every time they are speeding the game would become unbearable. Its not hard to escape the cops, but its not an easy task at first. Once you get the hang of it you will be able to lose them easy, especially inside cities, or you could always go rampage and try to shut them down. So far, the only way to have the police chase you is by breaking things, crashing into other cars or the police itself. A small destruction bar will fill up and once its max the chase starts, or if you break things right in front of the cops, that sometimes also triggers the chase.\n\nDay to night cycle is highly welcome making the world quite beautiful. I've been stopping several times just to admire the view and take screenshots left and right. The entire presentation of the game's world is quite good. I gotten no texture pop ups so i've been able to enjoy every detail without problems. Some landmark views are just way too good to miss. If you are into these type of exploration, then the game has plenty of areas to go just to get a cool view of things.\n\nExploration is encouraged, be it either for the view or to find abandoned car pieces / antennas. Antennas work like Far Cry's antennas or Watch Dogs CToS, once found they will display all side missions around that specific area plus they will also allow you to fast travel (though about this i am not 100% sure cause at times i could fast travel to locations where antennas were not activated yet). You can use trains or airports to travel from the different locations, this can help at times especially if you are in a hurry and want to go to a specific part of the map that you haven't explore yet, as fast travel won't work on locations you haven't visited.\n\nCar and player customization is minimum. I think for a racing game of this caliber, its a shame it has so little to offer. For colors, you are only allowed to change the whole body and only with preset colors for official/metallic/iridescent, there is no color palette. Another lacking thing is the fact that you can only place one sticker on the car, and i can't seem to change the color which makes it almost impossible to bond with your ride. You can modify the front bumper, the interior of the car, hood, spoiler, rear bumper, side mirrors, and the side of the car though i haven't found any car that allows me to change that area in particular. As for player upgrades, the HQ has perks for you to increase that will grant different bonuses.\n\nEach mission and side mission will grant you a car piece that directly affects on the performance of your ride. The better you rank in the mission, the higher the upgrade will be, ranking from Bronze to Silver to Gold. Self explanatory, bronze is the minimum upgrade, silver is the medium and gold is the best upgrade. Each car piece comes with a specific bonus (acceleration, top speed, grip or breaks) Every car piece you get is "car-bounded" though the piece will go to your garage, if you want to place that upgrade on another car you will have to pay a small fee. Though if i am correct, the car pieces are only usable with other cars as long as they share the same spec (Race, Dirt, Raid, Perf, Circuit), so if you finished the mission or side mission with a street car, the piece will only work for those specific cars. Upon leveling up you will be given the option to purchase pre-build kits that will instantly upgrade your car. The first kit you get it at level 10, the second one at 20 and so on. This kits are barebones generally level 10 or 20 (depending on the level of the unlock) bronze pieces, but it does help speed up things if you don't want to go through the trouble of racing every mission or side missions again. Every 5 levels the overall performance of every car you own will get a boost.\n\nThe damage on impact is nice to watch, though the autoregeneration of the car is a bit puzzling. Not sure who's idea was but its strange to see the car going all wolverine on you and shaking off the VISUAL damage. The damage done to the car won't affect the performance on your car though it will affect the life of it, causing you to eventually head back to your HQ to repair your car is the life on your car is low. Same as damage, you car can be covered in dirt and snow but it will wipe off the moment you hit the road.\n\nPairing up with friends is what the game was meant for, and sadly this is were the main problems shows up. Making up a crew with your friends can make progress easier, though the sole act of crewing up with your friends can prove to be frustrating. Connectivity issues, unable to join crews, made this particular experience tedious to no end. For some reason the 4th member, will somehow always find a way to not work and when it does, you might be able to run some missions before you get dc'ed from the servers. The game seems to eat a whole lot of bandwith, so slow connections might have a tough time playing the game with friends. Upon reaching level 10 you will be given the option to choose a faction out of 4. This will enable PVP missions and PVE, and also a type of "salary" that will increase base on your performance.\n\nOverall, despite of connectivity issues, the game is fun. Its not the mmo experience it was advertised but what you get is not bad either. Its hard to recommend it unless you are into exploration and have the patience enough to go through the connection issues. When it works, its a really fun game. If you are in doubt, i would suggest to wait a bit longer, maybe a price drop. For racing enthusiasts, the gameplay might be  too arcadish, but its still fun.\n\n\n","December 4, 2014","true","100.8"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Ive been wishing Midnight Club L.A would get put on steam these last couple months, and dayum! this game was perfect. A great addition to the genre with a very expansive world that ive barely seen a quarter of as of this review. The game keeps you motivated with offerings of newer parts, higher ranks, better cars and more excitment. I havent even delved into all this game has to offer such as; PVP, faction missions, and daily/weekly challanges.\n\nThe game is ever enhanced once you have some friends to drive around with, which truly does make it feel like you are a part of a "Crew". While the game doesnt really feel like an MMO, there are plenty examples of massivity. The map, the amound of races, the customization, and the amount of things you can do.\n\nThe game drives pretty well! while the handling is iffy, it never takes away from the driving experience, its nice and arcade like. If you have fond memories of Need for Speed Underground 2/Carbon or Midnight Club, or just any racing game period, i definitely recommend The Crew.","December 3, 2014","true","25.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

However, after playing for over 3 hours I got disconnected twice.  This game (especially on PC) is great! The graphics are awesome for an open-world game with no load times while doing fast travel.  The civilian and their cars are not as bad as many people pointed it out to be.  The environment looks great! Your car looks great!  My friends and I travelled from Chicago to Seattle through the mountains and never got bored.  There are side achievements/quests to keep you busy and if that's not thrilling enough you can bump into a cop car and have them chase you through the mountains.  The season pass was worth the buy. You will not only receive  12 cars (later on in 2015) but the Ferrari and Mclaren are fun to drive!\n\nAll-in-all this game has a lot of modifications, unlockables, and is truely an awesome experience.  I can't wait to join a faction and put more hours into this!!  The hype is real :).

IF you like those games get this game!!!\n\nSteering First people had problems with the steering in this game being to arcadey. Its not at all you have 3 types of steering options in this game and plus many more options on how you turn ect like TDU2.\n\nCars Not many cars in the game just around 40. But I can see alot more cars in upcoming DLC'S\n\nMap The map is huge!!!! The traffic in this game is insane there a bit too much to too little and some do crazy stuff too. Its funny to see what the AI will do next though. There also could be a DLC for a new map in the near future.\n\nCustomization and Tuning You can basicly tune and customize any car to your hearts desire. There not much of customize options but it's way better then the new Need for Speed games.\n\nOther The game has soo many nice options in the menu but too bad the fps is limited to 60. Thats the only bad part of the game. If thats even bad.\n\nTheres so much to do in this game its insane!!! You can chase people, get chased by cops and even do story. Story is alright for the racing game. It takes around 30 hours to beat the game and thats if you want to rush threw it. There some bugs and glitches that need to be fixed but it's not game breaking. Servers are having some trouble but its launch day. For being an mmo you have 8 people in session thats 2, 4 man crews. But theres alot of people playing. Thats my review.\n\nMy suggestion:If you do buy this game add me I will play with you.\n\nAlso the game takes 40 hours to complete. That being said 10 hours of game play = $10 of money that you spent on this game. Therefore 40 hours = $40 and the game should be worth that.\n\nI still have more hours on this game then anyother new Call of Duty game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthetwist/recommended/241560/","iamthetwist","One_Track_Mind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthetwist/","125 products in account","What an amesome looking game.  Initially, I was worried it wouldn't be able to run on my computer but with all the graphical settings on low and 720p resolution it runs smoothly.  The controls had a minor but noticable amount of latency.  I was amazed at how good it still looked amazing even on low settings.\nThis has the most impressive open world I have ever played.  Each geographical region is immersive enough to get lost in.  The cities are all absolutely excellent and really capture the layout and aesthetic of their real world counter-parts.  As San Francisco is my own local city, I was a bit disappointed to find that it was probably the weakest of the representations but it's certainly still passable and still a lot more accurate than the versions in the Driver SF, or GTA San Andreas.  The way the world loads around you as you drive reminded me a bit of the game FUEL though the map was obviously less repetative.  Your car seems to be surrounded by a radius of detail and the rest that's on your horizon is a bit vague.  This could also be due to the graphical settings I was playing on.\nI didn't really bother with much of the story.  I skipped cutscenes and completed enough tasks to unlock the freeroam driving, then played on my own terms.  I'm saving the experience of the story for when the full version is released.  There were a few bugs in the beta that I expect will be fixed before November.  Buildings and stationary cars are overly-reflective to the point where windows become blindingly bright.  The GPS line sometimes seems to not realized that you ARE following it and then givs up on you.  Some of the lines, crosswalks, and street signs same a bit out of sync.  The collision engine with plants is also very inconsistent at this point.  Crop fields have an excellent effect of folding up underneath your car but shrubberies in the deserts will not respond at all.  There's one bug that I actually found rather delightful and would be happy to see left in the final game.  When you drive through the Bayou, some of the alligators walk on just their front legs.  It's really funny looking.\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.  I think it has a lot of potential and it really deserves a lot of praise.  It is vey ambitious and I am eagerly awaiting it's ultimate release.  If rumors are true that more cities and regions will be added as DLC, I woud love to see Boston, and some expansion done to the Bay Area.  It would also be great to drive through some of the U.S.A.'s great amusement parks such as Disneyworld, Magic Mountain, and Cedar Point.","August 30, 2014","true","275.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You dont actually tune anything. You select a part and put it on. These parts are unlocked through races and events. I was a bit let down on the whole 'tune your car' thing, since you arent really tuning your car.\n\nCustomization:\n\nThere are lots of colors and vinyls to choose from, but it feels lacking in the customization department. Again, a letdown. Yeah, its got body mods and stuff, but it fails to meet expectations set by NFSU2. For instance, you can pick a wide array of stripes, but not choose their color.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nThis is NOT an MMO. Yes, there are thousands of people online. However, you will only see a few at a time. At no point will you ever see 100 other drivers at the same time. Ive seen a few people, and we have largely ignored each other. 7 other drivers is the maximum it will ever show you at once. They wont always be the samer drivers, but that it the limit. Thus far Ive done everything alone, though Im still pretty new to the whole thing.\n\nNow, the game is fun. Especially with a wheel, pedals and H shifter. They will require about 1/2 hour of tweaking to get just right - but its very enjoyable when done. People said not to use manual and hardcore driving assist (which is zero assists such as traction control and stability) but quite honestly, I find this the best way to drive. Granted, I have just under 20 years driving experience and have had my fair share of street and drag races IRL. Manual transmissions are natural to me. The vehicles simply act slightly more natural with everything off. I think the visceral experience of shifting and turning a wheel really add to the experience...Im not even sure Id enjoy the game half as much without it based on the lack of customization available.\n\nThe game's storyline plays out like a cheap ripoff of a FF movie. Given the arcadey nature of the game, thats ok with me. Cheese is good sometimes. There are tons of short mini games involved such as hitting as many targets as you can, jumps, 'go fast and stay  on the road' races and such. There are plenty of odds and ends to keep you busy for quite some time if you are a completionist. The races and storyline events can be tough, requiring a few shots at it to learn the track before a victory can be eked out most of the time.\n\nMy most major complaint is the lack of actual tuning and customization. Everything else seems to work as it should at this point. After some hours of trial and error, I have the steering wheel decent enough to handle the game and feel pretty ok with it. Its not perfect by any means, but serviceable.\n\nIf you want a game with a storyline like a bad Fast & Furious movie, driving style along the veins of NFSU 2, and just a [fair] bit of customization, this might be what you are looking for.\n\nIf you're looking for realistic handling, deep customization, in depth tuning, and a more serious/sim style experience, this game is not for you. It has none of those things.\n\nIm going with Recommended because its not super broken out of the box. Everything works, its fun, but its still a bit of a letdown. I was hoping for real tuning and deeper options for customizing your ride.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2014","true","41.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The launch it seems went off without any problems as far as I could tell and there was lots of people driving around. The way coop missions are done are pretty nice because you can send out a request to people in your general area. Also if your in a crew, they could be like off in a different city for example then start a cool co-op mission and it asks if you want to accept the mission and then you both just start it up seemlessly from wherever you happen to be. So when continuing missions, if you are like sidetracked at the car vendor, they can go on and drive to the next mission progression and start it up. Also, you can see your team mates like line in the sky showing where they are headed next (its shown on the map as well) so you can sorta instantly see if your both heading toward the next place.\nI'm not nearly covering all the different cool things but one more thing that really stood out to me. In all driving games before where you could explore a city such as grand theft auto for instance, its always been where you go in one direction and eventually you are going to hit a wall and have to make a right or a left then another right and another at the edges of the world. I must say, it was sorta of a weird sensation where I never hit that wall, I just could drive in one direction for a REALLY long time and never reach that invisible wall at the edge of the world. The scenery changes and all of a sudden I'm seeing new landmarks in the distance. Its quite a trip, of course there are eventual walls at the border of the USA but you literally would have to be on a mission to reach it. While just driving in one direction on like a 1 lane road I was also very surprised because quite often I would go through a mission start thing where all of a sudden I'm trying to get the most air off a jump or go as fast as possible for as long as I can staying on the road. It was like a total bonus to me just joy riding off into the sunset.\nLast thing, there is an option in settings to put refresh rate to 60 FPS. Boom, on Ultra graphics its gorgeous, not sure what some people were saying how it didn't look new gen, It does.\nBuy it, its worth it.","December 2, 2014","true","39.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I will admit that it isn't  for everyone and i have a few complaints, like the lack of cities in the game, i would've liked to see Atlanta in there, which is where i live, but i digress. It is still very fulfilling to drive across the country and see all the major American sights. My last really good racing game was Midnight Club LA and that game was very frustrating, but extremely fun with friends. This game has a bit of a different feel, since there aren't any game types like there were in Midnight club (I realize they are completely different developers) but I would like to see Some gametypes implemented, like keep-away. But anyway, The Crew is addicting, And from a developer's standpoint, as i am, for a game of this scale, the graphics are pretty insane. The world is massive, but it still looks beautiful and runs very smoothly. Even the little things, like reflections no the cars. I see all these people complaining about visuals  and AI catching up to you. Firstly, what do you expect from the police? a cake walk? and secondly, It would be too easy without auto-catchup. I personally prefer a challenge. It's a good game, and I am optimistic for new features and DLC's.

The launch it seems went off without any problems as far as I could tell and there was lots of people driving around. The way coop missions are done are pretty nice because you can send out a request to people in your general area. Also if your in a crew, they could be like off in a different city for example then start a cool co-op mission and it asks if you want to accept the mission and then you both just start it up seemlessly from wherever you happen to be. So when continuing missions, if you are like sidetracked at the car vendor, they can go on and drive to the next mission progression and start it up. Also, you can see your team mates like line in the sky showing where they are headed next (its shown on the map as well) so you can sorta instantly see if your both heading toward the next place.\nI'm not nearly covering all the different cool things but one more thing that really stood out to me. In all driving games before where you could explore a city such as grand theft auto for instance, its always been where you go in one direction and eventually you are going to hit a wall and have to make a right or a left then another right and another at the edges of the world. I must say, it was sorta of a weird sensation where I never hit that wall, I just could drive in one direction for a REALLY long time and never reach that invisible wall at the edge of the world. The scenery changes and all of a sudden I'm seeing new landmarks in the distance. Its quite a trip, of course there are eventual walls at the border of the USA but you literally would have to be on a mission to reach it. While just driving in one direction on like a 1 lane road I was also very surprised because quite often I would go through a mission start thing where all of a sudden I'm trying to get the most air off a jump or go as fast as possible for as long as I can staying on the road. It was like a total bonus to me just joy riding off into the sunset.\nLast thing, there is an option in settings to put refresh rate to 60 FPS. Boom, on Ultra graphics its gorgeous, not sure what some people were saying how it didn't look new gen, It does.\nBuy it, its worth it.","December 2, 2014","true","39.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Are you kidding me, a game this HUMONGOUS you definetly need a ton of different cars! But if all the cars turns out to be DLC, i think that's pretty dissappointing, and i may stop playing, because thats just ridicolous.\nThe game is essential when it meets up, with multiplayer. I love driving with my friends, and meet new friends, to ride along with.\nI would like to see some more options, and definetly, more ways to earn money, other than doing Faction, and grinding missions.\nI'm sooooooo maaaad, because there is Season Pass... Are you kidding me? Aren't this game based on the community, and not our money? I saw this game a year ago. I like what i saw, and i actually hoped and hoped and hoped, that this wouldn't be a failure, but, as for that matter, i would call it a train wreck in its state right now. Connections issues, gold diggers, SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ EXPENSIVE DLC COMING UP, and no future plans published... Please. Even Bandicoot did better.\nBut to be honest, the game is overall okay, but i definetly didn't live up to my expectations.\nUbisoft may be ♥♥♥♥, and if they ♥♥♥♥ this up... I'm done.","December 15, 2014","true","98.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
