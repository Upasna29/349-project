Remember Me is that game.\n\nBefore we get to that some background is required. I finished it on easy and on hard difficulty, found every collectible, and did every achievement. I have spent 22 hours with it - yes, it's that short a game.\n\nWhy do I hate it, you ask?\nI hate it for the promise of being something greater than what it is. I hate it for the linear design and poor controls. I hate it for being told what to do and not being allowed to find it for myself. This game holds your hand from beginning to end. There is a lot of collectibles to be found but they are easy to find. They grant you more health or power or unlock artwork but do not give you any additional information about the world. There is a lot of climbing and a lot of fighting, and some more climbing and some more fighting. Fighting is competent but pales in comparison to Batman Arkham Asylum. The climbing is boring. Don’t get me wrong, I love climbing in games, but it has to give you the illusion of choice and discovery like in Prince of Persia or Assassin’s Creed. Here you have only one route that is always obvious. The camera is lazy and stiff and does not help you at all. There is no puzzle, there is no discovery. Every ledge that you can grab is highlighted for you. You just climb and run and open doors to get to another fight.\n\nThat's not a good recommendation is it? Well, I do recommend this game for the things that I love about it, which outweigh anything that I hate about it. And what is that, you ask?\n\nI love it for the story: this is one of the best sci-fi stories I have read, watched or played in my life. It's up there with Blade Runner, Ubik, Neuromancer, and Ghost in the Shell. It's philosophical, emotional, mature and a little too pompous for its own good. The dialogues can be a little too poetic and dramatic at times, but they still fit the story. I won’t give any spoilers, because the story is the true worth of this game.\nI love it for the music: this is a journey in itself, the music defies description. You just have to listen to it, especially how it changes during the fight.\nI love it for the graphics because the actual graphics deliver what is promised to us by the concept artists so many times and rarely delivered. We often see the beautiful concept art for games that we love and we hope they could look like the artist imagined, but we know that the technology is not there yet. In this case the programmers delivered. Using the Unreal 3 engine and DirectX 9.0 the programmers from DONTNOD show a vision of New Paris that will stay in your memory forever.\nAnd finally I love it for the ability to remix memories of other characters. It is such a powerful game mechanic it is a pity it was implemented so poorly. The game allows you to remix a crucial memory of four characters in the game but there is only one right solution. It is such a wasted opportunity for branching story. It would be fun to replay the game just to see how the story would unfold if the memory of a character was remixed differently. Well, maybe another time, eh?\n\nSo should you play this game, you ask?\nYES, play it for the story and the sensual feast that it is! It's a unique experience that you will Remember for a long time.","March 14, 2014","true","25.9"," 307 of 327 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","307","327","0","6"

One of the biggest positives of the game is it's graphics. From the very start right to the end your treated with breathtaking views, wonderful scenery and some great detail. it's not perfect but it's certanly a lot better then most games I've played.\n\n2. Sound and music is another big positive. The music soundtrack is absolutly brillant and the way the music reacts to what is going on in combat is a nice feature. The sound effects are quite well done as well but the ambient background noise along with the great scenery work really well together to create a relistic enviroment that makes you want to explore.\n\n3.  It has a great story line and the game does well to help keep track on whats going on. The story has many plot twists and does a good job of making you think "what's going to happen next?" or "who's the real enemy, Edge or Memorize?"\n\n4. Gameplay. Some people have complained about the combat system in this game but personally I like it, it involves timing your punches and kicks and remembering different combinations to pull off the biggest combos. On top of that you can customize the types of attacks you throw in those combos for example you might start with some regen pressons to heal yourself at the start then put some power pressons at the end to do big damage dealing attacks at the end of the combo.\nAnother type of gameplay this game brings is a feature called memory remixing. At certain points in this game you have to remix someones memory and this involves going backwards and forwards in the memory to alter certain things at certain times to meet the required objective. It's a very nice feature that is fun and gets your brain thinking but it looses its charm slightly once you know how to succeed in them. Also they could of done with having more of them in the game.\n\nSadly although it does have it's good bits, it does have bad bits as well.\n\n1. Controls. The biggest con is definetly the controls. They are very fiddly and Niln isn't exactly the best when it comes to turning and sometimes it can take a second for the controls to work which is a nightmare in this one perticular point where you have 1/2 second to react to things otherwise you die. The control problem can also be seen when your climbing around on walls as the camera sometimes confuses the game on where you want to go for example instead of going left it might send you down.\n\n2. Bugs. This game has quite a few and I've defiently come across a few game breaking bugs that have caused me to die or get stuck. Even the tutorial in the 1st memory remix can cause a bug as it stops you from altering the memory unless you do exactly what it says but it's very easy to stray slightly away from that and it has hit me twice already. Another bug that has happened was myself hopping out of a window (which your meant to do) but then I accidently climbed back in but the game treated it strangly and instead of putting me back in the room it glitched me through a wall and giving me the abillity to walk in the air which caused me to reload the last checkpoint.\n\n\nOverall if you look past the bugs and the fiddly controls it is a very nice and entertaining game and I certainly love playing it. Different people have had different reactions to this game but this is my overall opinion.","November 25, 2013","true","50.2"," 349 of 389 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","349","389","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbs/recommended/228300/","orbs","Meep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orbs/","435 products in account","Remember Me is an underappreciated story-driven game with stunning visuals but repetitive combat.\n\nIn the futuristic setting of Neo-Paris, memories are digitized commodities. You are Nilin, a memory hunter with the rare ability to enter and alter people's memories - a threat. You start the game after having been imprisoned where you've had nearly all your memories wiped, and it's from here you must escape and uncover the full story of who you were.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353700779\nVisually the game is so covered in detail I found it hard not to take screenshots of every little thing. Environments are meticulously crafted to a point of complexity rarely seen in other titles. You'll find there is a real sense of scale and grandness to the world, and with the nuanced detail given to its citizens and conversations you overhear it begins to feel alive. You can tell a lot of work went into the concept and design of each area.\n\nAs you plunge through levels of society including the homes of the rich elite and slums where memory junkies have become mutated forms of themselves, it only gets darker as you uncover the full truth. Each chapter ends with a cutscene where Nilin ruminates on the dystopian society she is newly discovering and tries to see her place in it. While being a bit overly melodramatic in these, Nilin's character is written in such a way as to be insightful and emotive. It was a controversial choice by Dontnod to have a female lead character but they were adamant - and I think her genuine nature is one to be praised.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354996476\nUnfortunately there are some drawbacks to the gameplay. Where you may wish the game was more open world to explore, it's not. Instead of having any semblance of freedom you're led along a linear path with not-so-dynamic parkour and climbing where your only choice is to jump from convenient ledge to convenient ledge to reach the next objective, usually an uninspired mob fight. Combat also quickly becomes repetitive, relying on pressing a sequence of buttons to do moves and receive chain bonuses. There's not much to it, though special abilities try to keep things interesting.\n\nAlternately, its most creative and compelling implementation is "memory remixing" where you can use your ability to enter people's memories and manipulate events within them. Here you can rewind in a scene to make a subtle change, often only slightly moving a minor object, and watch how new events unfold. Each time is meaningful and fascinating, and in my opinion it wasn't used nearly enough. It emphasizes the idea that altering a single event, or the memory of it, can change a whole life's trajectory.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356298129\nAltogether, Remember Me is a game to admire for its visuals, storytelling and dystopian setting, and for a small studio it's absolutely impressive. Don't miss checking out the excellent soundtrack too. You'll have to deal with lacklustre combat and linear progression, but ultimately it's the elaborate presentation of the world and its background that make it worthwhile.","January 4, 2015","true","36.9"," 205 of 217 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","205","217","6","7"

I will say that though Capcom's Remember Me isn't the best game ever, probably not even close, it is a unique experience in more ways than one, keeping my attention throughout the game.\n\nCombat works and plays out like Batman, but not quite as fluid. The ability to change up your combos makes for a refreshing experience each time. Enemies are can be quite tough in numbers--especially when they differ in types, forcing you to use different tactics for various enemies. Button mashing won't get you very far.\n\nThe platforming and exploration are the weakest links, as they are far too scripted. You never get a sense that you're in immediate danger from scaling walls. And exploration is so linear, so confined, which is a shame considering Neo-Paris is a major sight to behold.\n\nMemory Remixes are the star of Remember Me, setting it apart from other action/adventure games. Basically, you can hack into peoples memories and alter things, changing the outcome of their behavior. It's fun to mess around and experiment. Not to mention, the memory remixes give great insight into Nilin's character; you really get a sense that she is conflicted with the ethics of what she is doing, which, in my opinion, makes her a very human character to whom we can relate.\n\nThe story... I won't elaborate about it. You really need to experience it for yourself because it will blow you away. Some of the writing is awful, though. But most of it works.\n\nOverall, fantastic game. The story and lore are the strongest aspects. The game play is, for the most part, solid. Remember Me is a game you don't want to miss.","December 30, 2013","true","22.4"," 249 of 284 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","249","284","0","5"

This game was VERY nice and I'm gonna say why did it get all those mixed reviews.\n\nBefore that, I'll just summer the game storyline in one paragraph so we can move on into a more interesting debate: Remember Me takes place in Paris, year 2084. In this context people has developed into a point where memories can be digitally stored and even modified, both good and bad ones. At this point of the history, some people gets full control of all those memores storage and hierarchy is still a never-ending conflict. You take control of Nilin, a young girl who lost her memories without knowing why (obviously) and wakes up into a prison cell. I won't speak more because of spoilers.\n\nNow the pros, cons, and specially why I disagree with official reviewers.\n\n- First of all, the mechanics of the game are simplistic and nothing innovative at all. Combat system is nothing from the other world and even though you can create your own combos the feature is not as squeezed as it could. Moreover the camera movement can become your greatest foe at some points.\n\nHowever... honestly, who would care about those mechanics? Almost all new games are just a remix from others of the past. All action games are inspired by other action games, just like FPS games (which is the best example). Was someone actually looking for something new in the combat system? As long as controls are tight and responsive, I'm OK with that. And they are in this game, so just move along.\n\n- Graphics are very beautiful. The city is astoundingly cool and I didn't expect to find this mixed aesthetics between old-fashioned, modern and cyberpunk. If you go for minor bugs, invisible walls and locked doors, you'll find plenty. But seriously, this game was crafted to follow a story, so why the hell would you enter into a clothes shop anyway?\n\n- Soundtrack is awesome. A mix between orchestra and future music suits perfectly, and so it's demonstrated into this game. It's a very cool feature and you probably won't be disappointed with it.\n\n- Average difficulty is insultingly easy. I've played action games on Easy mode harder than this game on the hardest settings. Chill out a bit and for your dignity just pick hard difficulty from start 'cause you won't have a trouble.\n\n- As I said, camera can be problematic. I'm fine that during the exploration, climbing and jumping parts the camera moves for me so it focuses on where should I be looking at, but during combat and some specific times it is just killing.\n\n- Length is OK. I've just beated the main story in about 9h, and I'll probably need another 3-5h to get all the achievements. Just the average for a story-driven game.\n\n- The game is linear as hell. No submissions, no shortcuts, nothing. The game just drives you where it wants to, so if you're looking for a sandbox-like, look elsewhere. As for me, I'm OK when games are linear if I ALREADY KNOW they're gonna be one.\n\n- The story is very catchy and will keep you for more. It's the main feature of the game and at least for me in wasn't disappointing in any state. It won't be the best storyline you'll play in a videogame, but it's a good one. A GOOD one.\n\nAll in all, Remember Me has been a very enjoyable experience and I wouldn't mind replaying the game. I seriously think that official reviewers can't enjoy games anymore. They just purchase them, grab their shotgun and instead of focusing on what's the purpose of a game, they simply try to find as many flaws as possible in order to make their "objective" analysis. FFS, if you look for flaws into this game, you'll find TONS OF; the thing is that no one should care at all. So stop looking for perfection in every aspect and play the game for the story.\n\nAs I'm ignoring these mechanics garbage, I'll tell you what actually would make the game not that enjoyable to you:\n\n- The most remarkable con I found is that the game constantly treats you like an idiot. It takes your hand in EVERY way, even on the climbing thing. There's no space for thinking; exploring; doubting; discovering. It's like you live in an endless tutorial. Hints are cool when you're familiarizing with the controls 'n' stuff but not for the WHOLE game!\n\n- [MAYBE SPOILER] The Memory Remix feature is incredibly interesting and sadly developers didn't take all the potential it had. I know you should just mix the relevant characters' memories, but goddammit it's so good it's actually THE THING that keeps you for more! I wish there were more stuff like this, since this is what can make me enjoy a triple A game.\n\n- Collectibles. I hate collectibles. They're usually an artificial way to keep you playing a game against your will so I put it as a con, as I'd do in any game.\n\nAll in all, this game caught my attention way to much time ago and now that I've played it I don't regret any euro I've spent in it. I'm a fan of cyberpunk games and dystopian backgrounds and this game has been a drug to me. In a good way. Don't let official reviewers fool you: this game is very cool and they're focusing their analysis in an unfairly biased way.\n\nFinal Mark: 8/10","May 21, 2015","true","18.0"," 224 of 255 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","224","255","12","13"

I had never heard of the game before and only picked it up because it was included in the most recent Humble Bundle. I'm very pleased because I was able to enjoy a game that I otherwise would have completely skipped over.\n\nFrom the futuristic Neo-Paris penthouses to the dark and blood-streaked slums, Remember Me is quite aesthetically appealing. There is only one HUD element and it remains hidden unless in combat. The special effects and soundtrack match exceptionally well to the world. The game has unique style and an impressive amount of attention to detail. It is rare for an action game to be so focused on ambience and aesthetics. That focus is why Remember Me was so enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay itself has some shortcomings, though. The camera can be frustrating at times and you're limited to about four combinations. There is some variability with how the combos can be set up, but largely you'll be mashing X/Y and dodging relentlessly. The game is also very linear. There is no exploration other than the occasional dead-end detour hiding a collectible. Finally, the unskippable cutscenes are a travesty of proper game design.\n\nThe combat is redeemed through a few clever elements. There is a feature where you can reconfigure your combos to heal, reduce cooldowns, or strike more powerfully. There are also activated abilities called S-Pressens which have varying effects such as turning invisible, stunning enemies, or causing a large explosion. The ranged weapon also adds some utility and combat value. Enemies throughout the game (and several bosses) might require a mixture of all the above.\n\nI would rather emphasize the characteristics that make a game memorable than lament a combat system that is otherwise forgettable. I really enjoyed Remember Me. While I wouldn't pay full price for the game, it was an absolute steal at bundle/sale price.","October 23, 2015","true","17.7"," 121 of 132 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","121","132","2","0"

Pity the game they are pushing so late out the gate, considering the new generation of consoles is now upon us, is like a paper bag filled with water. Now I love strong women protagonists in my game (Beyond Good and Evil and the Tomb Raider franchise are some of my most beloved games) so having read the synopsis for Remember Me and glanced over a couple of the screenshots it was pretty much a done deal that I would be pre-ordering and pre-loading before launch. Even when the reviews started appearing and it became clear that most reviewers found the game to be a middling misfire I was still sure that Remember Me was going to be one of those games almost personally made for me and that I would love the heck out of it!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158817988\nI am not so sure where the love affair began to sour or whether there was even a love affair to begin with now that I look back at the title. No game in recent memory has irritated me more than Remember Me. Many of those irritations spawn from what could have ultimately been a landmark title that appears to be constantly holding itself back. It's like a beauty pageant entrant making it halfway through all the pomp and pageantry - sights set on the crown - when bang, she trips over her clogs and accidentally sets her head on fire!\n\nThe game introduces us to the superbly realized character Nilin - who quite frankly deserves a much better game than the one she finds herself in - a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into peoples mind's and steal or alter their memories. Having recently lost her own memory she sets about to reclaim her own identity from the very people she once worked for. With a fascinating back-story and very intriguing premise the game then proceeds to dump all of this into one of the most lifeless and dull digital worlds ever created. Sure Neo-Paris looks stunning when you first encounter it but you soon realize that not a single soul lives in this city unless the game deems it so.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188807416\nWalking from one lifeless part of the city to the next is occasionally peppered with altercations that rip the fighting mechanics straight from Rocksteady's Batman Series except something seems to have gotten lost in translation. Fighting your way through hordes of these enemies has never been duller nor felt slower than it feels in Remember Me. I imagine the game was trying to go for that dynamic feel but it feels more like your are fighting your way through a rising tide of water than anything else. Not content to just play brawler - Remember Me also wants to play out like a futuristic version of Tomb Raider with tombs being replaced with water pipes and building ledges but the game insists on continuously telling you exactly where to jump and where to climb removing all the fun of discovery.\n\nIts not all bad though - Remember Me certainly lives up to the standards set by other Capcom games from a graphical standpoint, even though its not developed by Capcom but by a French development house, DONTNOD entertainment. The story it tells is also rather intriguing as it twists and turns towards its conclusion. The memory mixing element of the game is brilliant but sadly underused. Except for some key pivotal scenes in the game, the memory mixing is relegated to mostly a plot device. I would have loved to have seen this become a proper game mechanic but hopefully we will see more of this should a sequel ever get commissioned.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170551492\nRemember Me feels like a game that was rushed out the gate and if Capcom does decide to commission a sequel I sincerely hope they give the sequel a bit more time to breathe. There is a fascinating protagonist just waiting to break out of the confines of this rather dull adventure and I for one hope she gets the chance to truly do that.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 15, 2014","true","15.7"," 214 of 259 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","214","259","0","6"

I wouldn't recommend it for the current price, but I also wouldn't tell anybody to never play it. It's nice to see a game with a female protagonist who's actually well written. I just have mixed feelings about the game.\n\nI've played this game on PS3 and now I'm doing another playthrough on PC and I thought my opinion would change, but it hasn't. Remember Me is (unfortunately) one of those games that should've been great but instead it was... average.\n\nI'll start what I personally disliked the most: the combat. There's a great idea in there somewhere, putting together your own combos like that and in the first 2 chapters I enjoyed it. But it stays the same pretty much throughout the whole game and it soon becomes tedious. It becomes a chore, something you have to get through in order to move the story forward. The fact that I dislike the combat so much is really overshadowing the game's great protagonist and story, because combat comes back so often. Unlike memory remixes, which really only happen a few times (which is odd).\n\nAs for the rest, I'll sum them up in pros and cons. Starting with the pros:\n+ Great protagonist. Nilin is a well-written character. She's not forced to be sexy or witty. She's just a strong, smart character. I really enjoyed her monologues after each chapter. (Why isn't she a poet?)\n+ Edge is another good character (who should just become a poet). At first, I did not understand his purpose in the game but it all becomes clear in the end.\n+ Beautiful environment.\n+ Memory mixes.\n\nCons:\n- Unenjoyable combat. I wouldn't necessarily call it 'bad', but it's just... not satisfying at all. And the fact that there's a fight pretty much every few minutes does not help the matter.\n- Pretty much zero interaction with environment. Neo-Paris is (probably) a wonderful place to be. It's beautiful, it's alive. Also, all the stores are closed. Those who are open do not allow you to get in. You will not be able to wander off to that crowd of protestors, or talk to the woman who mutters something about you as you walk by. This game is basically forcing you to take a linear approach (aside from the few collectibles there are to gather).\n- Not enough memory mixes!\n\nThat's about all I can say about this game. It was such a promising idea and I still consider Nilin and her story to be great, it's just unfortunate that she's in a game that's unenjoyable to play.\n\nI'll probably work on finishing the game anyway, and getting some achievements. I guess that's typically Dutch! I paid for it, so I'm gonna play it.","October 21, 2014","false","3.6"," 291 of 364 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","291","364","4","2"

This is a great game with a very interesting, fresh, story. Don't go in expecting and amazing combat system, but it'll do for this game. Constantly got chills down my spine. Come for the world and story, stay for punching and kicking faces into the ground.\nOkay, so more details... What this game does well (IMO): It tells a great, compelling story that you can very easily get engrossed in for about 9 hours of single player, story mode game play. This is a hand-to-hand focused combat game. There is a ranged weapon that is also a game mechanic.\n\nThe game play is good. The game does a very good job at making you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ when you're fighting 7v1. The targeting is basically automatic, yet you feel like you have control over who you want to hit. Then you go and punch their face into the ground.\n\nThis game has good visuals. When I say visuals I mean the graphics and aesthetic. The graphics in the game are pretty good. There are complex scenes that seem vast and large. They look amazing the entire time. Does not even bog down my computer for what seems like entire cities being rendered. At no time did I feel they skimped on the visuals, except at times when you'd get close to a player texture. The quality is good, but not "oh my god, this is fantastic."\n\nThe aesthetic (different the graphics) is very good. They keep to the same style through out the entire game. You visit a few places, and they seem to be done very well. They are engaging and full of life at all times. The art team did very well here.\n\n\nWhat the game does wrong. There are a few things that the game does wrong. The number one thing for me is: THE CAMERA MOVEMENT IN THIS GAME IS SO CRAPPY IT BREAKS IMMERSION. Seriously, it's hard to look up and see what you want to see. Let alone see what the art team has created for you to explore. Most of the time I found myself looking at the ground.\n\nDue to the bad camera, movement at times can be tricky. This leads to some bad deaths, or just getting frustrated at the game.\n\nSome of this game is scaling walls / parkor?. The system for this is meh at best. You don't ever do it in combat, so it's not like you're getting angry at it a lot.\n\nOverallI really enjoyed this game. Multiple times during the story I got chills down my spine. The story drags you in, and keeps you there. As long as the bad camera does not drag you out of the story, you can be sure that you'll enjoy this enriching, vast, world as you punch and kick faces into the pavement!","January 3, 2015","true","10.6"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","118","129","5","0"

The game feels like a very very very linear Deus Ex (emphasis on very, this game is on rails).\n\nThe fighting can get a bit tedious, but after completing it on the hardest difficulty in 9 hours I can say that some points provided a significant challenge and the story was very enjoyable.\n\nFor the first game by a new studio, it's very impressive.

It is not really the punch or kick you pick but their "type" - some will heal you but cause less damage, others increase your Focus bar so that you can unleash special attacks once it is full and there are those that can break some enemies' defenses. It is very rewarding to have your own moves and you unlock some special attacks even towards the end of the game. Remember Me remembers to remain new and original.\n\n2) Be Kind, Rewind: Occasionally you get to see a cutscene, a memory of someone who is vital to the story. This is a memory you can tamper with. Why? Because it is important for that person to remember something else. To remember that it happened in a different way. You start moving your mouse clock- or anticlockwise (depending on whether you want to go back or forward during the short film) and try to look for glitches, items you can tamper with. And once you make the changes the memory may turn out to be a completely different experience. This is an amazing feature and my only issue with it is that only a couple were included in the story.\n\n3) The environment / story: This is a believable world, a world full of leaping creatures in alleyways, sewers and full of robots / drones doing the daily chores in shops and various facilities. You notice ATM machines offering cash in exchange for memories. And when you get to climb up and reach the rooftops as you finally leave behind the dark slums you spot the Eiffel Tower. It looks the same in 2084 but its gleaming whiteness is in contrast with the riots and struggle and sadness happening on the streets of Paris. You, Nilin, are tasked to solve this problem. While at first the game wants you to find out who you are it gradually incorporates more elements of this new world into the story and makes Nilin realise who she is and what exactly is the Big Picture.\n\nEasily a must grab for sci-fi fans. Pick it up if you are eager to get your hands on something original. In the meantime, Remember You Soon!","August 17, 2014","true","20.7"," 98 of 115 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","98","115","0","1"

Sure, there are people that seem to have a genetic knack for quick judgement calls which turn out to be largely factual, but I'm not one of them. After starting Remember Me, I assumed I was playing another run-of-the-mill action adventure game, but before long I came to realise I was actually enjoying it.\n\nSet in a dystopian future, players assume the role of Nilin, a "Memory Hunter" who, ironically, has had her own memories stolen. Guided by the ever-present voice of Edge, the leader of the rebel group, Errorist Movement, Nilin must take down the Memorize corporation who, in controlling memories, effectively controls the population.\n\nI'm a bit of a sci-fi junkie, and the premise surrounding Remember Me is an interesting one. The futuristic setting of Neo-Paris is beautifully crafted, with great contrasts between the slums and affluent areas of the city, which makes the very linear nature of the game much more apparent. Sadly, exploring just isn't an option.\n\nThe highlights of the game though, are definitely the "Memory Remix" scenes, where players need to tweak certain aspects of a person's memory to alter it. Unfortunately, you're only presented with a handful of opportunities to attempt this, and I think the game would have been better if more of the focus was on remixing memories.\n\nAside from synaptic DJing, Nilin is also an adept hand-to-hand combatant, and the combat system does allow for a bit of tactical fun once all the combos and unique "S-Pressen" moves have been unlocked. It's not exactly complex, but there is some added depth to the button mashing.\n\nOverall, I think Remember Me is an enjoyable game, without being an innovative one. I'm glad I was off the mark with my initial assumption. I'd certainly recommend this to sci-fi fans, since the setting and story were part of the appeal for me.","June 2, 2014","true","14.2"," 78 of 88 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","78","88","0","2"

Nilin is such a bad-♥♥♥!\n+ Intriguing storyline. Kept me interested.\n+ Interesting world. Dystopian Neo Paris looks so cool (I kept wondering why I saw more robots than humans in the city).\n+ Combo labs that you can personalize for different fights.\n+ Remixing memories is fun.\n+ Easy combat skills and cool powers to help in fights.\n+ Graphics looks great.\n+ Good voice acting.\n+ Good soundtrack.\n\nNow the negatives:\n- Very slow unskippable cut scenes. And why does Nilin walk so slow every time she talks to Edge? Can't she run and talk at the same time?\n- Nilin's monologues that doesn't seem to contribute much to the story. Again, unskippable.\n- The camera sucks.\n- Repetitive and annoying boss fights.  Just dodge and mash mouse buttons. Sometimes, your combo doesn't register.\n- Memory remix as a selling point but only get to do it, like, 4 times in the game.\n- Very linear, you can't get lost in this game. Paths are marked. Unfortunate really, I'd love to see more of Neo Paris.\n\nI enjoyed the story (completed the game, just for the ending). The gameplay, though, not so much. Would I recommend this title?

It has certainly got me excited for the 3rd Game rumoured to be released in 2017 "Vampyr".\n\nThe Game takes place in Futuristic Paris, and comes with a very unique and interesting Story, with some solid Visuals to take in. For the first half of the Game, I found myself to be walking through the streets purely to take in the sights of Neo Paris. As Beautiful as it looks, I just wish it had more interaction to it.\n\nIt is heavily Story driven with a unique and interesting setting, topped with some very nice Voice Acting. The handful of Characters it has won't be seen much, but they were still well made, and fit in perfectly.\n\nI read many comments about how "Linear" the Combat is, and personally, Action Games are my least Favourite so I decided to play it on Easy so it was less painful for me. However, I found the Combat very interesting, and more importantly, fluent.\n\nMost Games have their general "Rotation" for best DPS, and I find this Combat System to be no different from that except you don't have freedom to "Button Mash". Infact, you have the ability to Edit the Combo's to add certain effects to each blow. Besides the Normal Combat, you also have a collection of Special Abilities to counter certain Enemies.\n\nThe Combat reminds me a bit of Assassins Creed. Being surrounded by Enemies, and having to dodge an incoming attack while fighting through, with some allowing a finishing blow "Overload". Difference being that unlike Assassins Creed, you don't have the whole Group standing around waiting while 2 Attack you at a time. In Remember Me, ALL of them are going for you, and you need to always be thinking about your position, which Combo to use on who, and which Ability to use on who.\n\nMy only dislike I have for the System is that you only get a total of 4 Combo's to Edit, unless you buy the DLC. However, it's not a big problem at all because 4 is definitely enough to get by.\n\nBesides the Action side of it, it's main focus involves jumping from ledge to ledge with a Waypoint every 10 Meters [which at first I didn't like, but dealt with it]. It has a couple of simple Puzzles, and a few interesting Riddles which I enjoyed, as well as the a few unique scenes to alter Memories.\n\nAll in all, Remember Me was a very solid experience in all aspects.\n\nGenre\n- Action / Adventure\n\nGame Elements\n- Combat\n- Quick Time Events\n- Puzzles\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- 9 Hours\n\nLiked\n- Interesting and Unique Story\n- Interesting Combat\n- Great Main Character\n- Nice Voice Acting\n- Beautiful setting\n\nDisliked\n- Needed more Environment Interaction","November 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","50","58","0","0"

It provides options to create your own combos using different types of attacks. Some may like this level of freedom, but there are multiple points in the game where you need to choose the 'right' combos to get through the fight. This can become frustrating, not to mention also that many of the smaller enemies need 20 .. 30 .. or more hits to take them down unless you use your 'focus' power abilities. Boss fights are more enjoyable, employing different tactics but there are not that many of them compared to the grind of meaningless mob fights. Unlike the excellent combat system in DMC (also from CAPCOM), you generally feel weak & under-powered.\n\nAfter each mob fight scene, you generally have some more 'on-rail' corridors to run down followed by some short 'Tomb Raider' style climbing sections. Rinse & Repeat till a boss fight or cut-scene. Nothing challenging in traversing the world either, and I kept wondering why Nilin had to climb everywhere! Sure she is on the run, but still seemed excessive & out of place sometimes. Almost to the point where they are just trying to cash in on the heroine action/adventure success of Lara Croft (but not really pulling it off).\n\nThere is next to zero interaction or exploration within this beautiful world which was also a shame and the main character animations of Nilin where pretty basic, not really giving her much personality or detail.\n\nOn a more positive note, the real standout feature that is very unique & fun to experience is the Memory Remixing. This alone was almost enough to give Remember Me a 'Thumbs Up'. Yet these are rare & short-lived, and only get one of these every few hours of play. Really wish this was more a main reoccurring feature since they really executed this perfectly!\n\nI found it hard to get emotionally involved with Nilin or any of the supporting characters. Story drives forward at a good pace via the cut-scenes, but little is done to give the characters depth or clear rational/reasoning to much of their actions. For someone who has lost all her memories she seems quick to trust others without any real questions or concerns. On writing this I have played about 30-40% through the game so perhaps this improves in the closing parts of the story, but the game has become boring for me so I am unlikely to continue further.\n\nAll-in-all, I will remember this game as one that was so close to becoming really great; interesting blend of many familiar science fiction themes/ideas yet not enough differences to make it truly unique. A game dogged by artificial limitations & repetition in the design, which really detract from the experience. May still be worth grabbing if you are into the genre (only at a good price), but I honestly feel this would have made a better movie than a game!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 11, 2014","false","5.4"," 97 of 133 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","97","133","0","11"

Here the population is oppressed by an agressive and ruthless corporation named Memorize.\n\nMemorize created a tecnology that makes possible the recording of personal memories from any person. These memories are then sold to the public in ATM like machines, downloaded to your brain through an implant in the back of you neck called sense, that everyone as it seems, and then voila enjoy the ride. This process causes addiction and it's like the new legal drug on the streets.\n\n"Remember Me" is an action game play on a third person perspective with a focus on combat. An editor called "Combo Lab" let's you costumize your attacks in to combos. These combos can heal, do damage, reduce habilities cool downs, amplifie effects or a mix of some or all of those as you see fit. Besides these combos there are special powers that you unlock through the game like becoming invisible or doing extra damage for a few seconds.\n\nAfter a while combats can become a bit repetitive mainly because you will stick to 2 or 3 combos and use them again and again until the jobs done. The exception to this are boss fights. Those are demanding and require a more strategic aproach requiring you to rethink combos to adapt to the situation.\n\nI found the story to be interesting specialy the memory hunting part where you have the chance to change peoples memories by altering little details in it to create a new memory that suits your goals.

Players take on the role of Nillin, a memory hunter who has, in fact, had her memory stripped away. She begins the game stumbling down a hallway as a mysterious voice comes over a communication device to break her out. Over the course of the experience, discovering Nillin’s past, and why the evil corporation MEMORIZE is in fact so, well evil, pushes the player forward.The story is complex, and confusing more often than not. Performances operate at both ends of the spectrum. While Nillin comes across fantastic, some of her supporting cast lack the emotion necessary for certain sequences. There are some cheesy bosses and eye-rolling dialogue, but for the most part, I enjoyed the alternate take on the genre. The world of Neo-Paris is what sells the experience though. Each area is crafted with such lush detail that it is hard not to stop and take notice. The lights of the Eiffel Tower glisten in the distance, while the flooded streets below give that sense of defeat. This is a wonderful world that I was wishing I could explore more.Remember Me is a “by-the-books” third-person action game akin to Assassin’s Creed or  Mirror’s Edge. The influences of both of those game sin particular are prevalent throughout the entire experience. The gameplay consists of a heavy mix of platforming and combat, both of which are distributed evenly with a great pacing from start to finish.Combat is where things really get interesting. On the surface, it feels like any other hand-to-hand system. Comparisons to the Rocksteady Batman titles are inevitable, but Dontnod mix it up with a customizable combo system. The Combo Lab is a unique take on the idea by opening up strings of button presses that can be customized with four separate types of attacks. Visually the game looks great running on max settings on the PC. The textures are fantastic, and Neo-Paris really comes alive. The soundtrack is amazing. There are no better words for it. Composer Olivier Deriviere has crafted one of the most memorable scores I can recall. Unfortunately, the game picked up some bad habits along with the good ones adopted from the marquee titles in the genre. The camera in particular leaves a lot to be desired. The combat in the game can become very frantic and fast-paced; you need to be able to see what is going on at all times. That isn’t always possible as the camera likes to zoom in on the action at random times. In any case,I loved my time with the game, and would recommend it to anyone looking for something completely outside the box. Overall 8/10.","September 14, 2014","true","91.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

I would put it high, high, HIGH on my list of GOTY candidates. The only possible weakness in it is that it's too short (About seven hours for me, start to finish). Nilin jumped right up the list of my favorite video game characters, being a weird amalgam of Jade from BG&E and Faith from Mirror's Edge. The story was tight (as in compact and focused) and also sweet (as in awesome), and it managed to subvert many of the tropes I kept expecting. The world was a take on dystopia that I haven't seen. The combat was a little imprecise, and you didn't really get to explore the world much physically even though there was tons of detail crammed into every little nook and cranny, but there was just so much there.\n\nThere weren't enough memory remixes, but I file that under the "Too short" category.

A person that choose to stick with this game will find a more deeper experience with Remember Me, the further you get. The platforming aspect is pretty much cliche for this kind beat em up action game, but its not to the point of annoyance, thanks to the jumping indecators, that sometimes guide you to your destination.\n\nOne of my complaints for this game is the camera controls during combat and during the platforming segments. You'll find yourself constantly fidgeting and fighting with the camera, to get the right view of your battle area. I sometimes find the camera will hover above the characters head, to where you'll pretty much just see Nilin's hair. you'll sometimes miss a que of a enemy, to where it will result in you taking damage.\n\nThe story is decent, the gameplay is decent, the graphics are great aside from your regular texture pop-ins. The feeling of being in a futuristic world (Neo-Paris) is there, though the linear experience kind of hinder you a bit. i found myself wanting to explore the world more in this game.\n\nThis game is definitly worth the purchase for people who want take a break from first person genre thats populated on Pc.","September 28, 2014","true","16.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

The visual style of it was pretty darn impressive, both artistically and graphically, to an extent. Most of the voice acting was good enough, and I had very few glitches and only one crash I can recall. Why, then, am I not recommending the game? Well, because those are the only good things I can really say about the game from my experience, except perhaps that it was a good idea that did not turn out well.\n\nIs this an awful game? No. However, the game fails almost entirely on its gameplay, explaining the world you're in, and the plotline itself. The gameplay largely consists of much crappier versions of activities other games have already done. Did you think the modern Tomb Raider or Uncharted games did a decent enough job of climbing sections? Well, Remember Me does a far crappier version of these. Perhaps you thought the Batman Arkham games had some enjoyable third person brawling combat? Get ready for a very poor man's version of that system. Not only that, but the game is set in a sci-fi location where memories and tech are everything...in presentation, at least. In actuality, 90% of your controntations in the game are punching and kicking the crap out of stuff.\n\nIn regard to the game explaining the world you're in, they just didn't even try to have a coherent set of rules for this future setting. You can alter memories, but it's only important maybe 5 times in the entire game. There are "execution" moves you can pull off that don't kill enemies but do a blast to their head. The game never tells you exactly what this does. It's implied that it messes with their memories. There is more involving stealing memories as well as having a hologram arm thing that shoots projectile energy...but it doesn't seem to have a port to fire the energy or anything like that. The technology is never explained and feels terribly out of places. It -looks- nice, but this game's only positives tend to be graphical. The plot of the game largely relies on various pieces of technology and things these pieces of technology do, when you're still trying to grasp what this tech does, and there are mutant things you fight which the game does a terrible job of explaining what they are as well. This is one of the most poorly constructed games as far as explaining how stuff works in that universe, that I've ever seen.\n\nRemixing memories is decent enough, but by the last two times I had to do it, I was well past the point where I wanted the game to be over. The game has 8 chapters, the last of which is super short, but by the time I was finishing chapter 5, I was very ready for the game to be over. If not for the game's visual presentation, the fact I paid for it, and that I really like science fiction settings, I do not believe I ever would've mustered the willpower to complete this game. I doubt I will ever play it again, as trying another game or replaying any of dozens of better games was a far better use of my time than this.\n\nSince the visual look of the game is its strongest point, I'd actually recommend that if you want to enjoy this game, that you just watch a few Youtube videos to see the city and everything. It looks great. That's about all there is to really like about the game, though. In a few years when graphics are far better in so many other titles, this game will have nothing it does better than other games, so I cannot recommend it.","April 23","false","31.4"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","43","58","0","0"

Nilin lost all her memories during this progress and can barely remember her name. Someone named Edge calls Nilin, helps her out of the prison of La Bastille and will give information and guidance about the whole situation of neo-paris and about herself during the entire game.\n\nThe story itself is very deep and thrilling. From the very beginning on the player is riveted by it, You really want to know who Nilin is, what happened to her and what she'll do now to gain her memories back. Bit by bit you get more informationen about the whole situation so you get the feeling to play more and more forward.\n\nThe graphics are very smooth and clean, but also every level doesn't look like the other so you'll never feel like you were in this level already 30 mins ago, Anyways. here lies a bigger problem: You probably have to lower the graphics to play it without stuttering. Also don't forget to turn off v-sync. This will improve it a lot.\n\nEven the controlls are very smooth. I always recommend a controller for games like this. It will make the combat itself and targeting edges while climbing easier.\n\nLast but not least a big point in this game is the combo creation. You can influence the combat with combos you're able to build by your own with given keys. It doesn't matter what you want to use pure damage, cooldown on your skills, etc. Within the combat you are also allowed to change the combos like you want. Just access the menu and swap the keys you already assigned.\n\nI got it while it was on the big capcom sale, but I would always buy it for the whole price. It's absolutly worth it and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nPersonal rating:\n\n- 9.5/10.0 -","May 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","45","62","0","4"

Now after completing it, I am even more mesmerized by it. It`s amazing!\n\nThe story is great and would be appreciated a lot by sci-fi lovers. The music, made by some crazy genius mixing contemporary classics and breakcore, suits it incredibly well. And the visuals... OH THE VISUALS! This is the most beautiful game I ever played. For real. The concept, the design, the detail, EVERYTHING, I feel speechless to describe. You must see it ot believe it.\n\nMany people hate the combat system, but actually it`s not that bad. I used only the first two combos trough the whole game - X-X-X and Y-X-Y-X-Y. It`s true it gets little repetitive, but it`s definitely not a random mashing of buttons. It was able to even get me in somekind of meditative state in the long battles. It`s really arcade-ish and strange in a way.\n\nThe main character - Nilin is not you usual pumped up sexualized bimbo. On the opposite she is emotional, strong and intelligent and it`s not hard to get under your sking because of what she is and not how she looks.\n\nBe careful before buying Remember me, though. This game is extremely linear and scripted. As well as the most beautiful it is also the most scripted game I ever played. There is always only one option and you can never get out of the scenario.\n\nActually I would say this is more like a graphic novel with elements of gameplay : D If you don`t have problems being led by the nose from the game creators and you want to experience a great story and amazing visuals - don`t hesitate and play this game!\n","September 7, 2014","true","15.0"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","35","45","5","0"

You will play as Nilin, who recently got his memory almost completely wiped. A mysterious guy, whom only you can hear from your voice comm will help you and try to remind you who you were. Later you’ll find out that you are part of a rebel group called ‘The Errorists’, whose mission is to bring down Memorize. The Memorize Corporation are the one who have invented a new brain implant that allows people to upload and share their memories on a cloud, not only this but they can also remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. Not only have you learnt about this, but you also found that you are a memory hunter. You have the ability to steal memories, and as well as remix them, bending people’s past to your benefit.\n\nEnvironment and Design  – One of the best environments I have seen, the world is completely detailed. I never felt a dull moment all through the areas, nothing is rushed. But this comes with a price; the game doesn’t let you experience what the world can truly offer. The game features huge world, yet you’re stuck on a limited area to progress through the story. You don’t have the free will to check out different places. You’ll also know easily when you’re about to face a wave of enemies. Wherever the story goes, you’ll follow.\n\nGameplay  – There are only 3 happenings in this game; conversations, climbing, and combat. The game pretty much revolves around this three.\n\nIn terms of combat, the game features an interesting way of making your own combos and its effect. Though the actual combination to press doesn’t change, you have the option to choose the animation and the effect of that specific attack. You have the ability to regain health, decrease the cooldown of your skills, inflict a devastating damage or multiply your combos, the choice is yours. After a few tries, you’ll definitely get the rhythm of each combo.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll unlock each skill one at a time. This can be a downside because the only possible way for you to truly enjoy the different ways to finish off an enemy is during the last stages of the story.\n\nThe game also showcases your ability to remix memories. In here, you’ll see the whole scenario and you have the ability to rewind and make some changes that would alter the ending of that scenario. Even though this is a great feature, you only get to do this on specific characters.\n\nControls  – Other than the different types of enemies that the game offers, you also have two additional enemies to deal with. First one is the camera angle will most of the time get in your way. Instead of showing you what is happening on your character during combat scenes, the camera will show you an object that will completely block the view. Second would be the annoying controls outside the combat, basically running and climbing. There are times that the controls override what I pressed. You want to go right? Sure, let’s go left.\n\nConclusion  – Yes, the game is very linear to the point that you only have a very limited space to explore. But the story and combat system they offer, makes up for it. Even though the game is quite short, I personally enjoyed the whole ride.","November 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","32","42","2","0"

The graphics are absolutely stunning, the story feels original and fresh, there's fantastic voice acting, good music and sound, and the gameplay is fluid. It's really quite a treat of an action adventure game. In my book, this is a must play title.\n\nAlthough it felt a little foreign at first, the remixing of memories is implemented really well offering a unique element to the game. There is also a combo customization element in which the player can customize abilities like healing, power cooldowns, or extra damage. For example if you like using your memory powers more often you can customize to add more cooldown abilities or if you seem to take damage often you can add more healing powers. It requires player interaction throughout the game as you unlock more upgrades, but I think some sort of default arrangement would have been fine for most players. The combo order in terms of punches and kicks never changes. There are also a few hidden objects placed around the small maps for health and power upgrades in addition to artwork unlocks.\n\nNo game is without flaws and Remember Me definitely has a few, although nothing game breaking. The camera look sensitivity was the one aspect that annoyed me the most. For whatever reason the vertical mouse look and horizontal mouse look sensitivities are set differently making the vertical movement slower. This made it ridiculously painful to look up and down throughout the entire game, and was especially annoying during combat. There was nothing in the menu system to allow me to compensate for this. On top of that, the combat aspect itself is quite shallow, limited to punching, kicking, and dodging using up to four different attack combos. And even though you get a range ability later on, it takes a while to charge so it never really becomes a factor.\n\nThe game is completely linear with almost no interaction to the external world other than climbing ladders or gripping ledges and they dumbed down the platforming aspect such that it literally indicates exactly where you need to go for each jump. As a puzzle game lover, I typically despise games that have to hold your hand the whole way.\n\nDespite the minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall story this game delivered.","October 30, 2014","true","12.2"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","29","37","0","0"

I've never finished a game (besides portal) that quickly. I loved Nilin, she was a very diverse character. I could connect with her throughout many points in the story. The small clues that eventually led up to the, well, two big reveals, I definitely didn't pick up on until I really thought back on it. The fighting was a tad bit difficult to learn and VERY repetitive, but the story made up for that. All in all, I REALLY liked it.\n\nNote that most thumbs down reviews don't have many hours logged. Trust me, there's a reason: at first, the game is a bit uninteresting and slightly boring, but as you play, it becomes a LOT better. If you don't look at the game critically, it's fun and easy to play once you get the hang of it.\n\nMy only real complaint is the repetitiveness of the boss fights and not being able to explore much. Neo-Paris is so gorgeous that I would have loved to just get lost in the city. I also would have liked more to do with the memory remixing.\n\nIt's a hugely story driven game, so if you like that kind of thing, this is definitely the game for you! (as long as you're cool with some combat too).\n\nEase of play: 8/10\nThe concept of fighting is easy to grasp, but can be repetitive and annoying that it just frustrates the crap out of you. It's a relatively easy game; your paths are clearly pointed out for you and the game gives lots of helpful tips. It's easy, yes, but is it a bit... too easy? Maybe.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nI ran this game on Windows XP with the minimum graphics card. With all settings on medium, honestly, the game looked fantastic. I'm sure it would look even better on a computer with higher specs. I rated this aspect from my personal experience with the game. YMMV.\n\nStory: 7/10\nI loved the concept, and the story is a HUGE part of Remember Me. I loved learning about Nilin and Edge, and the two major plot twists at the midpoint and end of the game honestly shocked me. It was a bit boring at some times, but overall, it was fun to learn about the world of Neo-Paris and uncover the secrets behind Memorize and the Sensen technology.\n\nOverall: 7/10\nI liked Remember Me a LOT, and I think it's an underrated game. If you're not sure, wait until the price drops (I personally got it for $8 and it was VERY MUCH worth it. I would pay the current price ($30) if I had to.) The visuals are stunning, the characters are intersting, and the story is fantastic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/228300/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","Remember Me is the kind of game you'd expect a first-time developer that's not located in any kind of development hub to make. It's a science fiction auto-platformer (Uncharted, Enslaved, etc) brawler game. It's set in Neo-Paris; in the future, climate change refugees and income inequality lead to a European Civil War which ends with people using earthquake-bombs to destroy Paris.\n\nCombat... so, uh, I don't like brawlers. Don't like God of War, don't like Ninja Gaiden, don't like Bayonetta, etc. This is where you yell at me because my taste is ♥♥♥♥ or something, rather than understanding that different people have different tastes. You can go into a screen and set each button in a given combo to have one of the following effects: heal me; cause bonus damage; speed up the cooldown of my special abilities; amplify the effect of the previous button. Typically I'd set up one combo to heal me, and another longer combo to do damage and run the cooldown. Overall the combat felt fairly fluid... I'd compare it to sort of high-level play of the Batman games. I think people who like brawlers would probably find it shallow because the execution is so easy and varies so little throughout the game, but that's fine by me.\n\nWhat doesn't work is the late-game combat. The back 25% of the game, you pretty much entirely fight electrified super-buff enemies. Any method of attacking them hurts you. As a result, you either need to attack them with an endless number of heal-me combo attacks (because the healing cancels out the hurting) or power up your special moves and use those to take them out. This wouldn't be so bad, but at the end of the game when you clear out a combat arena, they send a second wave after you, and so you've depleted your special moves from the first wave. It gets pretty frustrating. The early game bosses are really cool, the late game bosses boil down to defeating tons of trash mobs and then periodically being able to injure the main bosses. The boss of Chapter 7 was a genuinely miserable experience, I died about 10 times or so.\n\nRemixing is really cool. Basically, you hack into someone's memory. You watch the memory play out. At the end of the memory, you use the analogue stick to rewind (by circling the analogue stick, so it feels like you're editing video on tape, very cool control choice). At key points in the memory there are objects you can interact with. By altering the objects, you change the way the memory plays out. It's possible the result will be a memory bug--for example, changing someone's memory so that they die is not possible because how can you remember your own death?--or it's possible you'll lead to a desired alternate outcome. Then when you pop out of their memory, they might have a moment of clarity or conscience as their updated memory makes them reconsider their beliefs. Unfortunately you only get 3.5 of these sequences in the game and the plot never deals with how deeply disgusting it is to alter a character's memory to trick them into helping you; like, to give you an example, the first remix involves changing a woman's memory of accompanying her sick husband to hospital to a memory of the hospital killing her husband in front of her, this to get her to take your side in a civil war. And the character you do it to continues to pop up later. So is this woman not going to visit her husband anymore, because she thinks he's dead? What the hell?\n\nThe game has a really distinct visual style and some amazing views. Neo-Paris combines the messy dirt of Blade Runner with the bright sterile colours of Fifth Element. So expect to be overwhelmed by colours and distracted by grafitti and trash everywhere. The character designs are basically leather and latex future badasses. The weirdest thing I found was that large quantities of food is left on the ground, and at one point I found an entire lasagna just sitting on the ground, untouched. Who the hell cooks a lasagna and then throws it out the window? But some of the views are really really inspired. I wish the game gave you more of the outsides of Neo-Paris and fewer levels inside sewers or prisons. There's somewhat significant environment reuse. You visit some version of the prison 3 times, and another level is mostly a sewer--the game only has 8 real levels. I am sure this reflects budget limitations.\n\nThe score is basically a big soaring orchestral score combined with some 70s sci-fi synth--I don't know how to describe this really, but not the kind of dark synth you think of from 80s sci-fi, a more optimistic synth--and then randomly injected with really digital, glitchy kind of techno. The combat music is really cool. If you get hit or flub a combo, the music stops. The better you're doing, the more glitched out the music gets. I felt some level of comparison to Parasite Eve in that at its best the combat music had a kind of acid lounge jazz feel, but more techno. Really cool, original score, and I'd listen to it outside the game.\n\nHaving said all this, I do have some problems with the game. The story is absolutely nonsense and the levels don't really fit together well, as if they made the levels separately and then had to thread them into a story. The dialogue is really really poetic but sometimes unclear, which makes me think that the game received fewer editing passes than most or maybe it's just the ESL coming through a little bit. The jargon-heavy nature of the script subtracts from the world rather than enhancing it--really, I need to follow the Remembrane to find the entrance to Memorize to save the Errorists. I unlocked a new S-Pressen ("Expression") or an upgrade for my SenSen and just found a Mnesist. Groan. The conclusion to the story is incredibly, incredibly stupid... I can't stress how dumb it ends up being. I won't spoil it here, but if you sit down and think about the motivations that went into starting Memorize corporation, as well as how those motivations translated into the way Memorize is ran and what it is shown doing in the game, it makes no sense.\n\nOn the whole, I'd recommend the game because of the interesting things that it does, including a biracial female protagonist and some really beautiful views. The platforming is so effortless that it feels pretty good and liberating to go through it. I'd probably recommend you play on easy to minimize frustration since I don't think you'd get a whole lot of satisfaction off of "mastering" the combat system by playing on hard. The game will never get a sequel and the developer will probably make another game, to say nothing of the way game budgets basically render stuff like this unlikely to exist more generally, so it sort of stands on its own as an interesting and unique artifact.","March 10, 2014","true","11.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

Like Tomb Raider, Remember Me involves a great deal of acrobatic platforming, an excellent story with deep characters, a fantastic soundtrack, and a kickass female protagonist.\nHowever, also like Tomb Raider, the combat falls short of many players' expectations, the replay value is based upon the player's interest in collectibles and/or interest in the game's world, and the mix of platforming and occasional puzzle solving will not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nIn many ways, the game evokes a sort of cinematic feel, with a great deal of the enjoyment coming from watching the characters and the story's events unfold. Players looking for fast-paced action or a highly customizable experience will likely not be satisfied with what this game brings to the table, but for others seeking an intricate story and overall enjoyable adventure, Remember Me is certainly a *memorable* experience ;) . . .

Not in the past, probably won’t do within next few decades.\n\nIt is very hard to say an Action-Adventure game with linear story is a bad thing simply because with an open world with variety objectives on will cause chaos in game and make gamers lose their concentration to the significant part of story. Remember me does have a very strong-characteristic storyline which does not have much space for some adds-on. So I support developers, they made the right choice.\n\nThe game contents, graphics, walkthrough systems etc are not much to say, they are all very outstanding, all YOU NEED is to play to find out yourself.\n\nBut there’s something I specially want to mention about the game, it is the music. The music is an epic, they all go so amazingly with the game, it drowns you towards the “Remember Me Universe” and thanks to it, you will never leave the world unless you quit the game and back to the desktop. I wish they could do a soundtrack eagerly that I can listen to them even if I am not in game.\n\nThe only thing so sad is that Remember me does not have Steam Badges and following with the Trading Cards system. It is on my top hit list and I want it so dearly.\n\nOverall, a highly anticipated video game came out and people said bad about it usually turns out to be a masterpiece. People said how bad it was simply because of the overwhelming expatiations which were too high for the game and, these objectives often being considered non-achievable. It would bring down all the great efforts the development team had put them inside no matter how hard they had tried.\n\nScarlet's Score: 8.5/10\n","January 15, 2014","true","37.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","14"

It is very linear and story-driven, but it doesn't utilise the core mechanic of memory remixing much at all. At it's core it's a third-person fighting game with some shooting tacked on. The combat mechanics were average at best despite the pressens adding an interesting touch. Shooting is sloppy thanks to a sluggish and unresponsive camera and some mechanics were badly interpreted for a mouse/keyboard player.\n\nThis is a console port though, so that's why it has these problems with controls. Despite this though, I got used to it and didn't end up grumbling too much in-game from control-related failures.\n\nThe story is very good though, but I won't spoil. The dystopian future is pulled off very well with some amazing level design with very few complaints. They even tried a bit of a puzzle element, which was completely out of place but a cute effort.\n\nI do recommend this game.

While the concept is fairly interesting and the world design/graphics are great, the gameplay is minimal and at times it feels like the game is playing itself. Parkouring through Paris might look great, but the game constantly holds your hand and you just have to follow the corridors/the marked way. The combat is not much better; it consists of repeating the same 2-3 combos over and over.\n\nIn interviews, the author blamed the game's lack of success on the fact that the main character is female, and gamers won't play games where they aren't male. But the real problem is that while the atmosphere is great, the gameplay is weak - and you might as well watch the game on YouTube, because there's no reason to suffer through the combat and parkour.","December 23, 2015","false","9.4"," 42 of 64 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","42","64","0","2"

With only 65 on Metacritic, I expected to have to wrestle with bad controls and wonky gameplay in order to experience the story and setting that initially interested me. Gameplay is great if you enjoy combat a la Batman or AssCreed but find that it's really not challenging in those games. I found myself having to change strategies and combos in reaction to new enemies thrown my way. The pacing is great throughout. The story is engaging. The set pieces are stunning and the game looks fantastic even on lower settings. All in all, took me about 10 hours on hard mode.

How can so many mainstream reviewers be wrong about this?\n\nYes theres yellow markers on where to jump.\nYes the characters do have some silly/odd names.\nYes the combat feels light and nothing like BATMAN: AA & AC.\n\nBut the main question is does this detract from the game making it not worth playing? Hell no!\n\nThe combat is light and fluid just like the main protaganist Nilin so it fits the character very well. While some may find it annoying that your combos do get broken mid-flow by having to dodge other incoming attacks thats how street fights go. While you combo to death one baddie do you expect his four friends to take a break, order coffe and read the local paper, all while you pummel his face and body with your fancy moves? If you say "Yes!" to this then may I suggest something more like  Cooking Mama™, an EA game or a trip to the boxing gym so you can flail on a punching bag. The combat if fast, fluid and most importantly entertaining. The fact that you can edit your combos mid-fight to help heal or reduce your timers is very helpful in a pinch.\n\nThe visuals are totally fantastic. The atmosphere oozes throughout the game from the slums of District 404 to the heavenly hights of Neo-Paris. Some of the areas are nothing more than fancy corridors linking one part to the next but I found myself walking through instead of running like i could have. Looking around at all the little details hidden in plain sight from the puddles on the floor, items on tables, robots doing their thing and street vendors selling their wares. What I found was a vivid living world pulling me in. Even the "journal entries" are interesting. Adding to the game instead of distracting from it. The yellow markers for the jumping sections do look odd but if they were not there in some areas you wouldn't know where to go  and would leed to alot of wondering around with that "Where do I go now?" expression. An option to turn these off would have been nice touch for those who don't like them.\n\nWhile remixing peoples memories I found meself engrossed in almost every detail. I found myself wondering how I would react if these were my memories being alterd. Would I be the man I am today? Would I turn to the dark side? These are fantastic ideas but as many reviewers have mentioned before me "...there should have been more of theres segments..."\n\nAs you may be wondering I really like this game and as you're reading this now I hope I have hellped you resolve some of the things that may have stopped you from buying this game before now. This is a game that will (hopefully) make you think about events in your life and the lifes of others. How these events if changed or stolen chould change the very person you are today. All while keeping you engaged in the story and wanting to progress to see what happens next is a good thing and I would reccomend this to everyone. I'm just sorry that I put off buying this title and I hope to see Remember Me 2 in the future.\n\nSUBJECTIVE SUMMARY >> Well worth the money for a solid original game and story.","December 30, 2013","true","12.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","3"

Unfortunately you can't just ignore it, even if you play as a "scriptkiddy" (easy mode), because there's no way to avoid the boss fights and they're getting harder and more frustrating nonetheless. "Easy" only means that you take less damage.\n\nAt first it's okayish, you have combos and special stuff, looks solid. But later it's a mess, it just doesn't work anymore and it leads straight to constant and massive frustration. It feels like Batmans (AA/AC) combat system gone totally wrong. Instead of cool, tricky and satisfying melee fights you get a straight punch in your face every one or two seconds, which destroys any attempt to control the fight. Of course, you can jump around (and evade attacks) like crazy and kick some suckers here and there, but then it will take hours to end the boss fight (Boss plus his countless stupid minions). If this sounds incredible fun to you go ahead and grab a copy.\n\nI almost finished the game but just gave up then. I don't care whats next which is sad since the game art is one of its own kind. Even though I can't see the U-Engine anymore its pretty nice, shiny and pretty dirty as well. The story is more "so la la", I expected more.

He largely participed to the creation of the universe.\n\nPros :\n-Fantastic art style. The augmented reality, remix scenes, the final episode, fight against Madame are great examples.\n-Solid utopia/dystopia with an excellent ending. Tiny things like people naturally saying "Remember you soon" in place of "See you soon" or clever blend words like "Errorists" or "Mnemopolis" add a lot of cohesion.\n\nCons :\n-The gameplay is very rubbish : combat system is dull, ultra linear levels with nothing interesting to do but following a thread, the pace is boring... When you steal memories it just feels like you've reached point B and head to C as everything is scripted. When you use your powers to move a container it just feels like you're pressing buttons on your controller because the entire scenery is empty except for the said container.\n-Camera was ... ugh ...\n-Not enough remix scenes! c'mon this was the coolest thing to do! why so few?\n\nConclusion :\nI am not sure video game was the right support to allow Remember Me to bloom and that's a shame.

There is also nice contrast between the higher class and lower class parts of Neo-Paris. Luxurious shops, finished roads, well-furnished homes, and even a ritzy android brothel can be found in the Saint-Michel district. Slum 404, however, right next to the district, has no roads. The buildings are dilapidated, Leapers run abound with their home, the sewers, being just next to the slum, and there are no stores - merely stalls, stands, and bar put together by scrap metal. The world was well fleshed out and I wanted to explore more of it.\n\nSadly, you don't really get to explore it since the level design is very linear. If you liked the world of Mirror's Edge but hated that you didn't get to explore it much, Remember Me has the same issue.\n\nThe premise of the game is interesting too, with memories becoming a commodity. I love the opening of the game, showing the moving, heart-felt, well-intentioned marketing for commoditizing memories - then the stark reality of how prisoners in La Bastille are abused by having memories taken away, and how the wardens and doctors are basically thought police.\n\nAlso, I think Nilin is cool and a badass. I like her character design. I did roll my eyes a few times during the game towards the end when she said things that just made you go "Wait, what?" because they felt uncharacteristic and shoveled/ham-fisted in for the sake of "drama". Female representation in video games has been a hot topic lately, so I figured that was worth mentioning.\n\nOk, now for the bad stuff and why I can't recommend the game for $30 in good conscience.\n\nThe gameplay is lackluster and easily the weakest part of the game. Mostly just memorize 1 or 2 combos, swap out the Pressens you need for the situation, and press the spacebar + a/w/s/d whenever you see a big red "!" on some part of the screen - often the direction you dodge in doesn't even matter and can be cast during any attack. The platforming/parkour is very fragmented, lacking the flow of Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed while having less depth. It being slow and easy makes it incredibly boring and tedious .\n\nBeing boring and tedious seems to be a common theme, even in the memory remix portions of the game. Memory remixing is just a matter of moving through the scene and trying all the possibilities until you get the outcome the game wanted. There isn't any challenge, risk, or open-endedness to how you reach the outcome. Memory remixing is basically a point and click adventure game that lasts 5 minutes at most.\n\nAlso, UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. If you're a completionist like me, this will make 100%'ing the game a royal pain. Rewatch every monologue by Nilin, watch Nilin put her hand to ear and walk at a snail's pace until Edge is done talking to her, watch a Leaper attack an enforcer to the ground, watch a conversation go on and on, watch the memory for its full duration at normal speed before you remix it, etc.\n\n\nVerdict:\nIf you do not already own this you're probably better off just watching a let's play or waiting for it to go on sale for about $10.\nIf you do own this, it is worth a playthrough at least.\n\nHopefully if DONTNOD Entertainment get a sequel going they can polish the gameplay to make it more engaging, allow you to explore Neo-Paris or another city in this dystopian setting, and allow you to skip cutscenes.","November 23, 2014","false","29.4"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

The most disappointing part is that you can see how much effort went into the game, but it still fails to engage.\n\nMy gameplay experience was as follows: Disembodied voice tells you to go and do X at location Y, so you head towards Y because you have nothing better to do.  Most of the trip involves idiot-level climbing with handy yellow "This way, stupid" arrows guiding you. Roughly halfway, you arrive at a large open space and you're attacked by swarms of random enemies.  Combat involves mashing keys furiously.  Helpful key-mashing hints keep popping up, basically saying, "LOL! Don't suck so much". Once enemies are dispatched, you arrive at your destination.  Cue cut scene.  Rinse, repeat.\n\nAfter several cycles, you have your obligatory boss fight, which is tedious in the extreme.  Your attacks only do minuscule damage against his / her / its billion hit points, so it takes time.  Once the boss is vanquished, you have a pointless QTE, which is difficult to get right the first time, especially if you're rolling your eyes in annoyance.  This means you have to endure another round of boss-vanquishing before you get to try again.\n\nThis was the point where I said, "Screw it, I've given it a fair crack, but I am not entertained" and moved on to more interesting things, like laundry.  If I have to deal with rinse and repeat, I may as well get something worthwhile out of it.","September 4, 2014","false","1.7"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","29","44","3","1"

People had panned the combat as difficult or confusing, and the game to be nothing special.\n\nLucky for me I still went ahead and picked this up (at a steep discount, though, so take that for what it is).\n\nFrom the moment the game started, I was intrigued by the setting. Though full of sci-fi tropes, the game still managed to capture my interest and imagination, and I found myself caring for the protagonist as she made her way from beginning to end. I even found myself worried that she was, at times, too trusting of those around her and I worried that she would make the wrong decision - and though I had hoped at times I could make the decisions for her, the linearity of the gameplay did not take away from the final product.\n\nAs for the combat, I personally had no trouble figuring it out. The 'build a combo' system isn't quite what I expected - what I had expected was something more difficult. Basically you get four different combinations of X and Y presses on the controller (or your keyboard equivalent). Over time you unlock different 'powers' to place in each of these slots... so if your combo is X-X-X you can have one X be a powerful hit and the other be a heal, or maybe something that lowers the cooldown of your presens (big power moves). It made sense to me, and I managed to adjust and play with the combos to suit my playstyle and for different parts of the game (easily done on the fly).\n\nGetting the combos to work wasn't an issue either... but be warned, this isn't a button-mashing game. For the most part, combos all require calm, regular and deliberate button presses. If you are accustomed to going crazy with the controller, you will be frustrated as getting any of Nilin's (the main character) powers to work properly requires combos to succeed.\n\ntl;dr\n\nGraphically impressive game with a linear, yet rewarding story, interesting and appropriately challenging combat with some climbing, discovery all in a great science fiction setting. Game clocked in at about 9 1/2 hours for me, which I think was about right. Great buy, especially on sale.","June 29, 2014","true","9.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I was expecting one of the best games of the year, however I was disappointed.\nFirst things first, I browsed many different opinions regarding this game, this one is mine and I hope you respect it.\n\n☆ One of the reasons I was looking forward to this game was the fact that the Character is a girl - maybe I was expecting something along the lines of "Lara Croft" in the new Tomb Raider, I don't know.. - but I didn't find Nilin to be that much of an interesting character.\n☆Located in NeoParis, the futuristic French capital, "Remember Me" is set in the year of 2084 and shows a Society controlled by a corporation called Memorize. For the sake of Spoilers, I won't go deeper into this subject..\n☆In the game, Nilin is always questioning herself about her role in the world, what is the real result of her rebellion, and if there even need to take control of that planet from Memorize Corporation - after all, there is still a slight piece of humanity in what is left in NeoParis.\n☆The exploration points are one, of a series of flaws, regarding this game. The gameplay isn't fluid and thanks to that made it boring and tiresome for me - there is nothing attractive about fighting with Nilin, much less explore scenarios in search of the ingame's collectibles.\n\nRemember Me has a good story and fabulous scenery, the game had the possibility of being one of the best of the previous years. But at the same time, has too many limitations. So, probably is likely to be forgotten.\nThe game is good, I was expecting more out of it.\n★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10","January 19, 2014","false","28.9"," 40 of 65 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","40","65","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/category-theory/recommended/228300/","category-theory","Category Theory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/category-theory/","662 products in account","I do recommend this game, but not for everybody, and perhaps not even for most people. Read further through the review to see if you might find it worthwhile or not.\n\nFirst, the story and enviornment, since this is really the interesting part of the game.\n\nPart of the dystopian premise here is standard fare: environmental problems  push a vast portion of the world's population into squalor, with the instability spreading to the first world, leading to civil unrest, war, and eventually a civil war that fractures Europe. The interesting science-fiction twist is a technology that allows people to extract, move and share memories. The game doesn't look in to this in the kind of depth a good science fiction novel would, but rather uses this mainly as a structure to support the plot. While the writing and acting has quite a few awkward moments, the overall story certainly avoids being a straight "good vs. evil" tale, instead being considerably more interesting. As Nilin, part of a plot to bring down an ostensibly evil corporation taking over the world, you'll find that things swiftly become uncomfortably unclear. Your very first memory remix involves bringing someone over to your side by convincing her that the corporation killed her husband, which I doubt anybody with a conscience could feel comfortable with if they take the story even moderately seriously. As you proceed, you'll find yourself wondering on a regular basis who the good guys really are, or even if there are any. While there are a few characters who fit into the "evil villain" mold, all the rest have plausible reasons for what they do, and nobody comes out purely good or bad. This gives the story a pleasing depth that most games don't have, and does a lot to make up for failings in the gaming elements.\n\nOne area where the game really shines is in the sketching out of the world. The fantastic art and design really makes the world come alive, even though, being a straight corridor game with almost no ability to look or explore beyond the path along which you're driven, I couldn't see nearly as much of it as I liked. But the details that were there were wonderful, holding up even to stopping play for close scrutiny, and the Parisian setting (with its mixture of French and English scattered about) adds very nicely to the foreign feel, at least for an Anglophone like me. On the technical side the art and design could have benefited from rather more polish, but if time and budget considerations forced the choice of where to put the design effort, clearly the developers made the right decision.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is a straight-line corridor game with, aside from short detours to pick up collectibles, no exploration or choice whatsoever. Even for those of us who like to take our time and look and poke around, this makes the game quite short; I would be surprised if anybody took as long as 20 hours to finish it. For those who finish games quickly anyway, this isn't a problem; for those who usually get a lot more hours out of a game (because they explore every nook and cranny), I suggest you simply take this as they give it to you and enjoy the fact that at least there's no padding here to waste your time.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't really have much to offer; it might best be described as "adequate." There's a reasonable amount of platforming of puzzling, none of which will bend your brain terribly. The memory remix idea does have the seeds of something brilliant in it, but unfortunately never really has the time, space or integration in to the story to do more than be an interesting sideline. You can play around with the remixing, but there's only one "correct" solution for the single storyline, so you can't explore the consequences of trying alternate paths. The best part about remixing memories is the discomfort you feel when you realize that you've acquired allies through building up a set of lies, and quite hurtful ones at that; you can well imagine that these people will eventually find out what you've done to them and their families (even if it was in the name of the greater good) and quite justifiably come after you for revenge later on. I'd love to see a game that wraps this idea deep in to the fabric and explores the consequences of how you choose to remix people's lives, rather than just being an element you need to get through to make the story progress.\n\nThe combat in this game has been quite divisive, as is clear if you have a look at the forums. For the most part it's a fairly standard fighting style game with a bit of shooting thrown in to deal with robotic enemies and knockdown of human enemies. The main interesting twist is that you can select, for your combos, which blows emphasize damage, health restoration, and speeding the cooldown of special attacks.\n\nExperienced players of fighting games seem nearly unanimous that, even on the hardest level, combat is far too easy. If you're one of these people, you're probably best off not looking at this as a fighting game at all, but as a relaxing stroll through the story.\n\nOn the other hand, for people like me who are terrible at fighting games, the combat is pretty rough, to the point of being very frustrating at times. The main problem here is that the game doesn't really provide useful training for the beginner at this genre; if you can't learn at the pace things are thrown at you the game will carry on forward anyway, and you'll soon find yourself out of your depth. Some careful combo design and going back to previous chapters (with more health and in-game skills) to work on particular areas where you're lacking can help mitigate this, but a training room or training mode allowing practice of particular skills would really have helped here. (The Combo Lab Pack DLC might also help, here, but opinions on that have been mixed and I've not tried it myself.)\n\nTo sum up, we've got a good linear story with more depth than typical for a video game and a beautifully realized interesting world, even if we can't see as much of it as we'd like. If that appeals to you, you can probably fairly easily overlook the issues with the gameplay, and you'll almost certainly be able to overlook the lack of polish, in trade for a unique experience. You'll also be able to find many areas where the game could have gone a lot further in exploring the consequences of different decisions, but I'm happy to leave that for another game, and take this as the good start in this direction that it is.","October 26, 2015","true","26.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

It's a really fun action adventure that is largely underrated because people want it to be something it's not. First of all it's a linear story. Yes it takes place in a futuristic Paris, no you can't explore where ever you want. As much as we all want it to be an open world game it's not. Now if you can get past that what you'll find is that Remember Me has a rich and detailed story and some elements that make it a really fun game.\n\nAs Nilin, a memory hunter, you're up against the company Memorize. Think 30th century Umbrella Corp. There's a revolution going on and you're public enemy number 1. In addition to leading a one man rebellion you're also piecing together Nilin's fractured past. Plenty of story to keep you entertained.\n\nThe graphics are incredibly detailed as you explore a diverse world, from the underground sewers to posh futuristic apartment complexes and sterile offices. A lot of work went into realizing the impressive environments. And even in non-movie sequences the visuals are stunning.\n\nAs for gameplay there's a mixed bag of tricks. The main thing about this that sets it apart from the rest of the pretty 3rd person adventure games is the ability to remix people's memories of events. However, those events are few and far between as there's only 4 instances of doing that in the entire game. And because it's a fairly short game, only took me about 15 hours to finish it feels like something with a lot of potential that could have gotten a lot more prominent use in a larger game.\n\nThis game also boasted the idea of being able to create your own fighting combos. This is also a place where I think a bit of false advertising or lost in translation fell flat. There's only 4 fighting combinations. You can edit what you do when you press a button but not much else. I feel like Sleeping Dogs had more variety in fighting where this game just pretends to give you a very limited variety. Also if you're reading this DO NOT BUY THE DLC. It just unlocks a handful of extra move types. You still have the same 4 combos just you're given a few extra designations. IMO it's not worth $4 but I thankfully bought it at 75% off so the sting of realizing it's cheap and worthless doesn't hurt that much.\n\nThat being said it's a cool game. If you see it on sale and want to play something that's a little bit different then go for it. You'll have some fun though quickly fleeting, it's got a nice story, good soundtrack and voice acting. It's not terribly challenging but you're playing it for the story mostly and that at least lives up to some of the hype.","February 17, 2014","true","20.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

I'm not quite sure why this game wasn't more popular when it first came out. It has an interesting story and compelling characters in a unique setting. Stylisticly it's somewhere between Mirror's Edge and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. That's a great place to be.\n\nVisually, the game has a super strong sense of style and a consistent color palette. Those are things I feel like get overlooked in a lot of modern games. And at 1440p this might be the best game I've seen yet for having textures that actually look good.\n\nThe sound is solid: good soundtrack, good voice acting. The dialogue itself is left wanting a few times, but for the most part it works and moves the action forward. Where things slow down is when you have to repeat a section you've already beaten: you can't skip cutscenes. This is especially frustrating at the beginning of chapters where the scenes can last for minutes. It's a standard feature that desperately needed to be implemented here and I hvae no idea why they didn't include it.\n\nWhere the game suffers is in the action itself. Combat is mostly melee based and it requires memorizing combos. That's not something I enjoy doing. In general, fighting is a lengthy, boring affair you must endure to get through the game. It particularly sucks to get through several waves of enemis only to mess up a single time at the very end and be sent back to the beginning. Once you learn the system it's quite easy to cheese the AI though. So the combat has the worst combination possible: not challenging, yet frustrating.\n\nThe quick time event system uses icons that are all the same shape and color, so they're easy to confuse, especially if you take a break from the game and come back weeks or months later. I still don't know what the use/interact icon is supposed to be.\n\nOnce you muscle your way through the combat there is a very polished world underneath. I loved the exploration aspect, and there are some fun and funny things that happen in the background. Just the level of detail and care but into the environments and NPCs makes a playthrough worthwhile. I wish I could've learned even more about the world's back story.\n\nThere is definitely room for improvement (and it probably would've sold better) if they revamped the RPG components to actually matter: having the ability to choose points going into HP, strength, or the ranged attach would've increased replayability and made me feel like I had more control over my character's growth instead of having new abilities thrust on me when it was convenient.\n\nI also wish they had made the locations and missions less linear. Not to the extent of something like a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game (I understand budget and time constraints) but something more akin to being able to wander around the city like in Deus Ex plus the minor skills tweaking I mentioned above would've put this game much higher on a lot of people's radars.\n\nOverall it's a great freshman entry from Dontnod. I'm really excited to see what they have in store with their second game, Life is Strange.","June 22, 2015","true","19.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

People now have a brain implant called the Sensen created by the mega-corporation Memorize. Sensen allows people to share their happy memories or remove their unhappy ones. Thanks to this Memorize has an enormous control over the population and has established a surveillance state.\n\nYou play as Nilin, a memory hunter whose memory has been wiped by Memorize.

You're also on a journey of self discovery as you question your motives and actions along the way.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nRemember Me plays similarly to all your favourate action-adventure platformers such as Castlevania: LoS or Enslaved.\nYou do a bit of fighting, puzzle solving and ofc jumping and climbing.\nI played the game using the Xbox 360 controller and I strongly suggest anyone to play such games with a controller of your choice.\nYou hit enemies using the X and Y buttons. As usually you can create combos with them by pressing Y-Y-Y-X-X-X-Y etc.\nYou can ofc shoot flying enemies and dodge attacks by moving the left stick and pressing A.\nClassic action-adventure gameplay but a bit simplistic here. You won't unlock any crazy combos. Enemies are very easy to fight and even if you do manage to die you start again basically at the same place.\nIt took me about 8h to finish the game on hardest difficulty.\n\nRemember Me is one of the easiest action-adventure platformers i've played but its charm is in the magnificent world and interesting story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/228300/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","I know this game is a little on the older side but I finally got a chance to play it and I feel like it could have been one of the most underrated games in recent history.  A lot of the features of this game are absolutely fantastic and judging my articles about the game the one gripe most people had was the combat (which honestly wasn't that bad).  To get right into what this game is about, Remember Me is a 3rd person action game with combo based fighting mechanics and a parkour style level progression design. Essentially it is like many other climb, jump, crawl games like Tomb Raider, Uncharted and Enslaved but the main character instead of using projectile weapons only uses her fists and her power arm.  Now the Combo system runs a little differently from other combo fighting games in that there are 4 primary "pressens" with 4 separate, and each more complicated, combos . However with these combos you can set any presser to each combo. The longer the combo the more xp you can get the more pressens you can unlock. There are 4 separate Pressens; Power which hits hard, Regen which heals you some each time you use it in a combo,  Chain which increases a combo multiplier making it do more damage and get more xp (these are best used at the end of the a combo) and cool down which lowers the time required to use a S-Pressen.\n\nS-Pressens are powerful, specialized pressens that you can only use once per certain time period and must have enough focus to use it. There are 5 S-Pressens which include Fury which lets Nilin (the main character) attack with each hit being more powerful than the last, Sensen Dos which stuns enemies and is very useful versus specific enemies, Rust in Pieces is a bomb that is effective versus robots, Camo which cloaks Nilin allowing her to move around regaining health and being able to perform a takedown on powerful enemies and logic bomb which can break shields and heavily damage enemies. Now the Specials and the basic combat system albeit are unique in their names and how they look, deep down it is just a generic combo based system and can get repetitive over time and can be prone to problems with connecting hits.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game however is the buggy parkour system. As it is a lot of times the camera control can be all over the place and Nilin could miss a jump that she should have been able to make. At times the parkour makes sense but other times it feels like it was just put there to have something for the time between fights and memory syncs.\n\nOne of the coolest features of this game however is the memory stealing/manipulating and as far as I'm concerned is not used enough in this game. Nilin's main ability (one of the main reasons she is such a sought after person) is that she can manipulate a characters memories of an event and completely change their personality of what happened during that event. During this mechanic you can go forward and backwards during a memory and slightly alter things in the room to make the characters do things including killing each other or remembering something to not be as tragic. It was used 3 or 4 times throughout the game but just the process of going into someone's mind and changing a memory to get a different outcome was absolutely facinating.\n\nEnough about the gameplay, on to the story.  The year is 2084 in Neo-Paris and Memorize corporation has invented a new implant called the Sensen which enables others to share memories with others, remove memories or even sell memories to earn money. During this time due to an infection and corruption of the implant, a new race of humans developed called Leapers. These Leapers are very basic in their mental capacity and are very aggressive towards non-Leapears. Enter our character Nilin who is a memory manipulator but in the beginning she has had almost all of her memories wiped because she had been captured by memorized and been punished.  However thanks to someone called Edge, she is able to escape and work to find her memories and try to take down Memorize. Throughout the game Nilin has to manipulate the memories of many in order to get to the bottom of the whole situation of Memorize and the Sensen.  The story is very unique and it is wonderful to have a main female protagonist that is the strongest character in the game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful and to top it all off, Dontnod Entertainment really did a top notch job of creating a very beautiful and realistic future Paris. The whole game is very aesthetically pleasing with the variations locations being so different showing the true difference between the impoverished  and the wealthy in Neo-Paris.  On top of that Olivier Deriviere did an absolutely fantastic job bringing the soundtrack to life to match the game beautifully. The music is much like the works done by Daft Punk in Tron Legacy in that Deriviere mixed a bit of electronic with orchestral sound. The end result is a soundtrack that I have ended up listening to repeatedly at work while I have been programming. The voice actors also do a fantastic job bringing their characters to life and make the dialogue all that much better.\n\nOverall this game is absolutely fantastic, from the story, characters, music, graphics etc.  The only downside is the generic gameplay and flawed camera angles during the parkour/climbing mechanics. I would highly recommend this game and I look forward to see if Capcon would bring us a sequel at some time in the future.\n\n•	Story - 95\n•	Gameplay - 70\n•	Graphics - 90\n•	Sound - 100\n•	Fun - 90\n•	Replay value - 80\n","July 8, 2014","true","11.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

The setting of Neo Paris is intriguing and breathtaking. The world is begging to be discovered but remains confined for the most part. The mechanic of creating your own combos is good in theory, but is a moot point when the game sends unnecessary waves of hit-sponge enemies at you. It just becomes monotonous at a point, which is why I found playing on easy to be much more enjoyable than Normal or Hard. The concept of the Memory Remixing is one that I loved and wish the game could have done a bit more of.\n\nFor all of it's faults, Remember Me builds a great world that I want to spend more time in. I feel that with some refinements (mostly combat) there could be a truely great sequel waiting to be made. If you manage to get it on sale, then Remember Me definitely gets my recommendation.","April 3, 2014","true","8.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It's a classic story of rebels trying to overthrow the ruling elite, but with a fair few twists along the way. Nilin proves to be an interesting and evolving character, cast in a story that's well worth experiencing.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, this is a fairly standard third-person action brawling game. A fair number of cutscenes and a lot of dialogue during gameplay provides exposition, as do the classic hidden lore items. Meanwhile you'll be fighting off a wide array of well-designed enemies and bosses by chaining together various combos of melee attacks. And as per usual there are some QTEs involved as well, particularly in boss fights, albeit fewer than is the norm in this genre.\n\nThe combat is very satisfying, particularly on the Memory Hunter difficulty setting. Combos are reasonably easy to chain together but you need to pay a lot of attention to what the enemies around you are doing to avoid getting hit. Unfortunately the difficulty is a bit inconsistent in that the first major boss is also immediately the most challenging in the entire game. Most later bosses can generally be finished in one go, partially because you'll have unlocked all your combat moves by then.\n\nRemember Me shines due to its excellent art direction and map design. The merely average console-port quality texturework and visual effects are outdone by simply stunning vistas that can be seen in the background. Just keep in mind that it's an extremely linear game with no alternative paths in its environments, nor are there any choices to be made or different endings during its story.\n\nThe game offers a few interesting twists along the way. Not only are there several different combos that unlock during play, but these can be altered to suit your playstyle. You can slot in different types of button presses in each combo to determine how much damage, health regeneration, and cooldown reduction a combo delivers. Initially more exciting is the ability to remix people's memories. That is until you realize that it's an entirely linear affair (albeit with a few alternative branches that can't be used as endings) and it only happens three times in the entire game. It's still fun to do, but far too underused a mechanic.\n\nA future where a company runs a post-apocalyptic world through controlling people's memories may not seem all that plausible. But there's great attention to detail throughout the experience that keeps it consistent and the hidden lore items flesh out the game's setting very well.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nRemember Me isn't the game that was marketed originally, but can manage to impress on its own terms if you forget the hype. A much better than average third-person action game, albeit an extremely linear one with its most unique elements - altering combos and changing people's memories - severely limited. And it's a solid PC port.\n\nTechnical Droning\n120Hz - No\nFOV slider - No\nBorderless Window - No\nGraphics Options - Decent\nTexture Quality - Average\nGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad, due to mostly melee fighting / combos / QTEs\nKey Rebinding - Yes","June 26, 2014","true","18.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

You play as Nilin, an acrobatic melee fighter / Sensen hacker working against a megacorp that manipulates human memories.\n\nGameplay\nBasically, Nilin can punch, kick or dodge in a catlike way (jumping over enemies or backwards). Your main objective is to hit combos like punch-kick-kick-punch-kick-kick. You use Pressens to personalize the effect of your combos (e.g. regen health, extra damage, ...).\n\nCombat gets more exciting mid-game, when you start to unlock longer combos and special powers while facing a large number of foes at once. Keyboard/Mouse controls are decent but personally I prefer a controller, as the combat feels more fluid and the camera is easier to handle.\n\nStory\nThe story has its plot twists and succeeds to keep you engaged. As a downside, I think it's a shame that some cool characters like Headache Tommy and Olga Sedova don't have bigger roles.\n\nThe lore is well written but it's not forced upon you. There are "Mnesists" (journal entries) that you can collect and read or simply ignore without any penalty.\n\nGraphics & Art\nIt's evident that everything, from the futuristic Neo-Paris streets to the character models, was done with great care by extremely talented artists.\n\nRemember Me is one of the best looking Unreal Engine games and a gorgeous cinematic experience. The lights effects are spot-on and the textures are first-rate (although not high resolution). My only complaint is that the FOV is ridiculously low and there is no way to change it. You can try some .ini file tweaks or Flawless Widescreen, but they inevitably end up messing with the HUD.\n\nClick here for a screenshot of the graphics options.\n\nMusic & Voice Acting\nThe music is fitting and was composed by Olivier Deriviere, who also composed the soundtrack to Assassin's Creed IV: Freedom Cry. The main theme played in the menu and in several scenes is quite remarkable.\n\nAbout the voice acting... Well, some lines are little bit cheesy, but the actors did their best and delivered a satisfying performance.\n\nVerdict\nRemember Me is a solid AAA experience. Don't let the ludicrous Metacritic score put you away.\n\nI certainly hope to see more from the French studio Dontnod Entertainment!","May 28, 2014","true","21.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

The combo thing is a nice idea, you can personalize your combos with differents effects, regen health, more damage, less time for the special moves, but the flow of the combat is a slog, never and i mean never did i get that sense of flow you got with the batman games, or in sleeping dogs for example, you have to time your hits in an excruciating slow manner, just a little bit faster would have change it a lot, and anyway there´s a lot of combat in this game, each time i entered an open space i started to groan, loud, and the final irony is the most unnecesary boss fight i remember, story wise makes no sense, no sense at all, is a boss fight because is a videogame and you need one of those, you know, videogames. The irony is that is actually a pretty decent boss fight, is not too difficult, but you have to use the abilities that you used in the game, no QTEs, even tough almost all the finishers in the rest of the game´s bosses are QTE wich was a nice surprise, but man, this game didn´t need it\n\nthe traversal is easy with a couple of different puzzles, and the game even throws at you help at the small hint that you are somehow stuck, i would have loved some more freedom to explore and to try different routes and so on, but no is my way or the highway dude, ah and there are some collectables, obviously, too in some nook and cranes not many  but i didn´t care too much about it.\n\nthe memory remix thing is the other great idea with a poor execution, but there are only a few and the annoyance at the wasted potential is small, but it adds up to the flaws of the game\n\nThis game could have been great, really really great,  with better combat, a little more exploration and freedom of movement and a couple of different decisions story wise could have been glorious, the dynamics between the protagonists tackle some very important issues and they did it pretty well to tell the truth, the twist is pretty obvious, and that´s what makes the final part of the game a dissapointment in its execution, and the end doesn´t really makes a lot of sense.\n\ni kind of liked it, but your mileage may vary depending in how much its linearity  and the combat annoys you, or how much you like it, the art direction like i said is superb, and the ost is now in my rotation, is really, really good","June 17, 2015","true","11.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

Besides, I really appreciate that they put a lot of effort in designing a holistic world view for this game. You would agree with me if you check out carefully the Mnesist (Official Collectible Documents) in this game. The details contained are exhaustive enough to recount a complete story, and in the meantime they also correlate and interrelate with each other. You'll get to know everything about the things and persons you've encountered and will encounter through reading those documents, and then you'll be admiring the elaborate settings of this game. Same as what IGN says about it, AMBITIOUS IDEAS.\nThe story is hardly defective, except that some part of the plot might seem a little bit too feigned and even ridiculous, to be honest.\n\nActions: 4.5/10\nSeriously, this game is tagged Hack & Slash. While I may have to agree on that, I feel like the Blow Feedback of Remember Me is probably the worst I've seen so far. I felt that it was okay, acceptable at the start of it, but once I reached Chapter 4 or 5, it wasn't anymore. Nilin's Melee Moves felt so much like Tango Steps, in my opinion, especially in the later stage of the game when the enemies are enhanced and featured; I hardly feel that it's a combat anymore. I don't know, but that's really how I felt, and it almost became a torture for me to stick it out to Chapter 8(fin). I might have closed the game and thrown it into the "NEVER PLAY" Group of my library if not for that I felt like it was so coercive that I completed the game.\nAnd the design of the chains of the moves is not very successful, because in the end you'll find Triple Strike (the first chain you could use in the game) most practicable.\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nPoor texture mapping causes unnatural facial expressions and robotically stiff combat moves (that's also one of the reasons why the Blow Feedback feels flabby and impotent), even in CGs (or Real Time Renderding).\nDespite the flaws in character graphics, the scenery of Neo-Paris in 2084 is unquestionably beautiful. I'm not an expert and I don't know why there could be such a huge technical gap between character map and landscape map.\n\nSpecial Content: 10/10\nEverybody remembers Memory Remix in this game, the best feature of the game. It also requires a little effort to figure out the puzzle, and in the process of it, you can trigger a lot of different conversations or something like that, but in order to progress in the game, you will have to find the one and only outcome of this Memory Remix. I can't say too much lest I spit out spoilers :D but surely you'll recognize the fun.\nAlso the game has included some stealth content, try it for yourself :D.\n\nConclusion: 8/10 - It's worth trying.\nIf you don't expect too much on its actions, it's definitely a good game for you; but if you really want to beat 'em up, go for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance :D I strongly recommend this game to those who want real Hack & Slash; but I guess the most important thing about Remember Me is the exquisite story, not the invigorating combat.\n","January 8","true","20.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","3"

The fighting is fast and fluid, and there's some scope for customising how you want to play - as a heavy hitter or constantly using heals and specials, say. It's just a shame much of the game is so easy by default you never have to do any of this. The platforming and exploration takes you through some phenomenal environments - visuals like few if any other videogames out there - but it's annoying that they're so linear you're rarely given much time to properly take anything in. And the puzzles, the "memory remixes", are a neat idea and presented well, but they're really just a case of slow trial and error to get the right boxes ticked or left unticked. A lot of Remember Me feels "good enough", then, rather than great, or makes you wish it gave you more freedom, or challenged you more, or spent more time fleshing out its story. At the same time it frequently looks and sounds phenomenal, it is still fun to play, and its story does manage some very moving, thought-provoking moments even if it's not as brave or as smart as it seems to think. Definitely pick it up on a sale if you like third-person brawlers with some smarts - just be aware it's not really as deep or as meaningful as the developers originally seemed to be implying it would be.","December 26, 2013","true","12.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Combat is basically a lite version of the Arkham games. A symbol appears over an enemy's head letting you know they're about to attack and you have a small handful of combos. You can replenish health and energy by using specific moves in your combos. There are a few special powers, some of which are interesting such as the ability to turn robots against their masters. Otherwise your time is going to be spent climbing, doing some minor exploring to find health/energy upgrades, and solving puzzles.\n\nThe most interesting aspect is the memory remixing, where Nilin goes inside of the memories of others and changes things around. Something as simple as moving an object, flicking a switch, or taking the safety off a gun can lead to dramatic occurences. If these were more fleshed out they'd be an integral and awesome part of the game.

But to be honest, nowadays, what is?\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game on a sale, however. Full price, eh. My record of 9.5 hours is pretty much the entire game length on hard difficulty, although I did miss some collectibles. Therefore, 28 EUR is steep. But I got this at -85% off, and I have no right to complain.\n\nThe story was VERY interesting, the setting was unique. Neo-Paris, 2084, where SENSEN technology is capable of storing your memory data so that you can erase the memories you don't want, relive memories you hold close, and use your memories as currency... and you're Nilin, an Errorist, who is guided by Edge trying to dismantle this system, which is supposedly "flawed" and should be destroyed.\n\nSoundtrack fits the futuristic theme of the game, it's glitchy orchestral, like a movie soundtrack mixed with electronic and effects. Great support for the events that occur.\n\nGameplay is primarily three things:\n\n- Combat: (combo-based system, combos can be customized in order to have their elements (pressens) be POWER, REGEN, COOLDOWN REDUCTION and CHAIN; and you also get Sensen Abilities which need a Focus bar which you get from punching your opponents enough. Simple enough.\nSome people in the negative reviews might claim "they couldn't get into the game because the combat is too difficult", but you honestly just have to press the right button at the right times, like "right left right left right" with the right delay between them and bam you executed your 5-hit-combo. Not hard, in my opinion.\n\n- Platforming: you need to climb on things, jump on things, move some things around, etc etc. Think of "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons" and that's pretty much how it goes, except you only move your one character.\n\n- Remix sections: There aren't too many of these in the game, but they hold important plot points, where you alter the memory of others. You'll see if you play. It's interesting. Really.\n\n---- NOW the question is, what did I mean by this game not being perfect?\nThere were some glaring flaws in some game design elements. Literally a flaw from a game design perspective. In order to learn more of the LORE of this game, you need to find MNESISTS. Now, they wanted to make collectible secret items... and they made those be the MNESISTS. The problem is that without them, you for example won't understand what the hell the Mnemopolis is - but these items are REALLY hidden, and if you don't know where to look, looking for them can be extremely tedious. They aren't indicated well at all, they're just tiny orange boxes, hard to find, and usually you need to go on an alternate path to find them.\n\nSo this is like playing in the Mass Effect universe, except you have to look for well-hidden secrets in order to learn the lore of the game, which you're supposedly interested in if you're interested in the plot. I think this was quite silly.\n\nAlso, by the end of the game, the enemy versatility kinda falters, they rehash some stuff from previously instead of adding something new.\n\nIn the end, it was still a great game.\n\n- PROS:\nInteresting story and unique settings\nGood soundtrack that supports said setting\nOkay combat (others might disagree but they just need to get a sense of timing I guess, it really is not difficult)\n\n- CONS:\nSome platforming is a bit tedious\nThe combat can get repetitive by the end because of rehashed enemies (too much saber force)\nTHE ITEMS THAT GIVE YOU THE LORE ARE HIDDEN COLLECTIBLES. Terrible decision, even if it kinda makes sense, but not really. Makes looking for them tedious, you might want to use a guide.\nThe antagonists' motives just aren't very deep by the time you actually get to them. But the plot overall makes up for it.\n\nRecommended. Not at full price, but at a greater discount, definitely.","January 31, 2015","true","9.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The story is based on such a unique concept of stealing other people's memories. Its futuristic and the another thing i loved was when she got into others mind and altered their memories.\n\nstory\nThe game begins with Nilin, a memory hunter, whose memory was almost stolen and wiped but she still managed to remember her name somehow. She was guided by an unknown friend who was later called Edge. He helped her and guided her throughout the game.\nIn between all of the episodes of game she tried to remember who she actually was and why she always needed to listen to edge.   She reluctantly obeyed his orders and did everything he said. As the game proceeded she found the missing pieces of her memory and tried to put them together.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351478194\n\nThanks to him she suprisingly found her mother and that happened when she was told to remix the memory of CEO of memroize, Scylla.\nLater in the game she discovered that Doctor Quaid was the only person who stole people's memories and made them leapers to establish an army of leapers. But before she could get to Doc to kill him, he was already killed by Johnny Greenteeth, who was turned into leaper by Quaid.\nIn the end she was forced by Edge to destroy the H3O, the center of Memorize. That H3O turned out to be Edge himself, the particular server where all the unhappy and bad memories of people were kept.\nAfter destorying H3O or Edge She learnt that suffering and having bad memories is part of life.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351512024\n\ngameplay\nNilin was one with great abilities and skills, she happened to accquire new ones in game.\nNo guns! only melee. She was good in martial arts and had to make chain of presens to make combo in Combo lab and that was to achieve great deal of damage even health point! Captain Gabriel Trace door's code was actually a riddle. To pass the security door, the riddle must be sloved 1st so as to figure out the code! well i kinda liked it cos i like solving riddles!\nMelee is actually good cos guns on the other hand are so frustrating and we have to buy them and then in middle of fight we just run out of bullets! so melee works quite better than weapons.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351417482\n\nGraphics\nIt was very pretty and impressive.\n\nAnd the upshot!\nThis game needs to be played, worth each penny. The graphics, music, characters, environment and almost everything was impressive. And above all the story was amazing!

Stunning Visuals, not the best Graphics in 2015 but the Design of the whole futuristic City is marvelous, the Digital Universe that you go thru at some points is also very well done. The Fighting is fun, can be repetitive but you can build your own combo sequences to fit your needs and the mix of enemies requires for you to handle them in a certain way, you can't just jump in and rage. There is some very original sequences where you need to remix the memories of NPCs, this brings something completely new to the game genre. Add to the mix some puzzle elements and some Parcours and you get a good 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay.\n\nOn the downside the game is very linear, one playthrough is enough unless you're a secret hunter who wants to get all the hidden items or complete all the Achievements.\n\nI would give Remember Me an 8.5/10.

The demo I'd played led me to believe that I'd be spending most of my time going into people's memories and changing them, but across 8 chapters, you only get to do so 4 times. The bulk of the game is spent running around and fighting.\nWhile navigating the landscape's numerous ledges, ladders and landings is fun, the game constantly stops you for overly-long combat sequences; in a game where your main character is so mobile, it would have been nice to have the option to avoid some of the combats by taking alternate routes. The combat is theoretically made easier by the inclusion of customizable attack combos, but the timing on them is so fiddly that using any but the simplest one is extremely iffy; often you'll get three hits into a combo before the engine decides that you were trying to perform an entirely different combo and starts you over. There are also special abilities that allow you to deal massive damage, stun enemies, perform instant kills, or turn certain types of enemies against the rest, but using them requires you to perform combos to power up your special meter. This gets more aggravating later on when you encounter enemies that damage you when you attack them; you can instant-kill them with the aforementioned special move, but if you encounter multiples of this enemy, you'll have to take a lot of damage while hitting them to build up your meter and reduce your cooldown timers. Boss fights last an unforgivably long time, requiring you to fight off wave after wave of basic enemies so you can use your special move and actually attack the boss. By the time I'd reached the final boss fight, I'd had enough of the combat and decided to watch the ending on Youtube instead, which I'd recommend over playing the game.\nI will give Remember Me credit for one thing, though: It's nice to see a game starring a biracial character, though I didn't realize she was one until around 2/3 through the story.","June 16, 2015","false","14.3"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","27","45","4","0"

You play as Nilin, a memory hunter, who is destined to bring down the corrupted Memorize Corporation. Memorize has been wiping away people’s memories and turning people into mindless pets. We the players, are tasked to fight back to restore Nilin’s memory and all the memories lost in Neo-Paris.\n\nTo add, “Remember Me,” takes place in a well-designed Neo-Paris town with a lot of flare and artistic style. There are areas of high class futuristic technology and there are areas of run down corruption. Many areas are set ablaze and crawling with Leapers whom attack you in the dark.\n\nOverall, the game is driven with high-tech angst, and can be dark and disturbing. Fighting enemies in earlier levels which you may think are hard are actually easy in comparison to later levels. Also, "Remember Me," has a repetitive, and head scratching combat system. In a lot areas you are fighting the same enemies. Also, some of the later bosses can be a grind to understand. Some need to be beaten up with certain powers that restore over time. This can be irritating because you are left dodging enemies to play defensively. If you are not dodging enemies you will soon face your death and if you do not do the correct combos it is harder to gain your health back. This is because you need combos to gain health and you have to dodge many enemies to avoid taking hits in which you gain your health back. All the while you have to focus on killing the main boss.\n\n"Remember Me," offers more than repetitive combat like being inconspicuous, leaping walls, solving puzzles but, the main focus they should focus on a future tentative, "Remember Me," title is the combat system and making the story not so linear.\n\nEven with my critique, I recommend this game.","July 3, 2015","true","32.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/recommended/228300/","inlimuniter","inlimuniter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/","245 products in account","I remember watching footage of Remember Me from E3 a few years ago. The clip featured a women in a futuristic world manipulating a man’s memories to make him kill himself. It certainly interested me, but for some reason this game stayed under my radar until now. I picked it up as part of the recent Capcom Humble Bundle so I decided I’d play through it and see what it’s all about.\n\nThere is a really good story here that definitely makes the game worth playing through to experience. The art style is really nice, it kind of reminded me a bit of the 2001 film AI, having a really striking futuristic style and a slight dystopian feeling going on. There's some really nice attention to detail in the world in little details such as memory dispensing machines that look like cash machines, the holographic interfaces over shop windows, computers with holographic interfaces, and the way people dress and their fashion sense. The architecture that contrasts Gothic and Neo-Renaissance Parisian architecture with futuristic structures is also really beautiful and strangely believable. You can tell that a lot of love and thought has been put into crafting this world. It’s one of those games where you want to walk around and look at every little fascinating detail.\n\nThe theme of memory storage and manipulation is very consistent throughout the game both artistically and within the narrative. I especially like the parts of the game about remixing memories and how that affects things. I wish there was just a little bit more of that in the gameplay and less of the combat, which is just lacking and slightly frustrating. The combat is a bit like a Batman Arkham game but lacks the refinement and can as such be very annoying on occasions. It badly needed a counter button or just something it make it more enjoyable. It feels like the combat is just something you need to push through in order to get to the other parts of the game.\n\nIt is a very linear game and features Tomb Raider-esque wall scaling and jumping. It also has some environmental puzzles and sneaking past stuff. I felt most of that stuff is actually done quite nicely in this game even if it wasn't exactly pushing the boundaries of innovation. One particular gripe I do have however is the amount of cutscenes, they happen very often without warning and they are not skippable. They are all really nicely done with great voice acting and well written dialogue, but they often felt almost rude in how they just take away control from you unceremoniously. It is a story heavy game however and the story is really well told so it's understandable.\n\nI played through this game in few days in a couple of sittings and I enjoyed it a lot, taking just under 10 hours to get to the end of the story. I wouldn't exactly say it's the best game ever or anything like that, but rarely can a game hold my interest from start to finish and this game certainly did that. I feel it could have been an amazing game had it focused more on the memory remixing and even more on the story, although it seems like the developers have learnt that lesson and done exactly that in their next game Life is Strange. If you can see past its flaws there is a very worthwhile game here with a lot of commendable things to like and enjoy.","January 8","true","9.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The universe is hard to describe, but if I had to, then the closest I can put it is Assassin's Creed 2 for the ledges and scaling buildings with European construction, mixed in with Deus Ex: Human Revolution futuristic style and technology. The writers have created a beautiful and rich tapestry and history about the new world in the future.\n\nEssentially, after the ice caps started to melt, the oceans rose, and the cities and countries that couldn't handle the changes began to collapse, governments etc. People started to move about on boats as climate migrants. Neo-Paris was one of the cities that did well.\n\nAt some point, a man created the Sensen, linking your memories to the cloud, allowing yourself to upload your memories, download others for a price (fancy a holiday? buy one! also sex movies as well with you as the star), and even delete memories that are too painful.\n\nThis and lots of little titbits can be seen in the numerous collectables which shed more light on the history of the world, the people, and the technology. These are all optional and aren't needed to further your abilities. There are two others which do help you though SAT patches, get five of them and your increase your maximum health by one, and the same with Focus boost, to increase a bar for your super powers.\n\nThe Sensen also acts as augmented reality, allowing you to see menus of nearby café's, bin collection time, and more usefully, ledges and pipes you can jump onto. The game subtly helps you with many of these prompts, like seeing a fire, and being helpfully told it's 972C, or the floor is electrocuted. This is why I love the universe, since it is nearly here, although it isn't built into our bodies yet.\n\nAnd so, we start the game with Nilin, our female protagonist, currently undergoing a memory wipe. Why? We don't know, not yet. This is the same with most games where you don't know what you're doing at first, but in this case it is justified, and you need to help find your own memories as to what the hell is going on here.\n\nThe game handily walks you through the controls bit by bit. A third person game, you essentially fight using combos. Inside each combo, you put in a Pressen, basically, a normal attack with something else in it, each Pressen is either the X or Y button. Power, to give you that extra oomph to your punches and kicks; regeneration, restores a bit of your health each time it connects; cooldown, reduces the time it takes for your super powers to recharge; and finally chain, which increases the Pressen just before it greatly.\n\nThere are four combos in the game, which are unlocked normally during the game, the longer the combo the more powerful the effects of the Pressens towards the end. Just for your reference, I played with an Xbox 360 Windows gamepad, and it worked very well.\n\nPeople have criticised the combat, yes, it is a little repetitive with little customisation to make your own combos, but it was fluid enough that the chaotic battles with eight enemies sometimes makes you think. Prompts show you when to dodge an attack and then continue the combo as if you never left it. The only annoyance is one flying enemy, which makes two sound when firing, and the second one is where you have to dodge, not the first, and I kept getting caught out by that.\n\nLater you get the Spammer, a cannon on your arm which fires 'data' at people, then a more powerful version to break structures. Your five super moves are also handy and are unlocked at specific points in the game. I won't go into detail here, but they help in your ability to fight the enemy.\n\nNow, the game itself, how does it play? As I said I used a gamepad, and it was fine for me. Camera issues were few and far between, like a column getting in the way of seeing who you're kicking or cramped locations. As you move through the game, the comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 vanishes, there is no freedom of movement throughout the city.\n\nSo what? With a city this large, it would take so long to visit everything, and the story doesn't need it anyway. You have set goals, and you go through the slums to the posh district, and then onwards to prison and so on. There are some nook and crannies that hide away those power-ups and the collectables. I thought I was good at finding them, but I missed a few in my first run. Linear as it is, it can get confusing, but the Sensen helpfully shows you the way to go with the ledges and jumps.\n\nI played on hardest difficulty, and found myself dying, a lot. Boss fights are tough, and for good reason, and in some battles, the opponents can overwhelm you, but with good timing on the dodge button (which makes you invulnerable to any damage during the motion), you can beat them. It is highly satisfying when you beat back over a dozen foes with your combos.\n\nMusic is mostly techno, trance house, thumping beats and so on during combat, and the voice acting is well done, and not too hammy (except for one or two characters, who were in fact hammy themselves).\n\nThe story is, to be honest, gripping. You start off with no memories, then you find out you’re a memory hunter, who can even remix other people's memories. Yes, you do get to do this in the story, though only four times. These are like watching a video, then changing subtle things in them to get a different outcome. It's fun to play through them all to get the different endings and so on, and overall it is a lovely thing to watch.\n\nHowever, to me, these were the major points when I felt very sad, because of the story. You are literally changing what they remembered, when in reality it was completely different. When you think about it more, that is horrifying. Each remix reveals more to the plot, and there are some great twists in the story, which overall I class as one of the top in any game I've played.\n\nOverall, a great single player game, somewhat basic combat but still satisfying, platforming is great for its purposes, beautiful environments and a great world to visit.","January 22, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

It made me think about the future of mankind. About the line we should never cross. The game environment is so well done and for me it perfectly simulates  a futuristic world.\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely amazing. I admire the great variety of things you can do with very good balance between them. It never gets boring or too repetitive. Everything from ordinary platforming, jumping puzzles, stealth and melee combat up to changing memories of people to manipulate them, stealing memories to get access to high security areas and creating your own move combos.\n\nFights in Remember me are very advanced. Combos can combine up to four different types of fighting moves - damage, heal, decreasing cooldown of special abilities and doubling of previous moves. In combination with 5 special abilities and special weapons - spammer and junk bolt - it gives you high amount of possible combinations how to win your fights.\n\nWeapons are not used only to fight but also to open doors and move objects. Moving objects around is part of few puzzles you have to solve to get through some areas. The game has also some puzzles where you hear several hints and you have to figure out the solutions. Even though I was replaying the hints so many times, it was still pretty much fun and challenge.\n\nNot to be only positive I should mention that the camera was not always very friendly to me. Sometimes it was rotating in a strange way. But I think I got used to it in the end so it was not really a big issue for me.\n\nI love its music. The futuristic feel and contrast grade are simply amazing.\n\nRemember me belongs to the top games I've ever played for its impressive world design, sci-fi story and very addictive gameplay with a good balance and great variety.\n\nAnd because the main protagonist is sexy! :)","January 2","true","22.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You'll fight your way through enemies, using combo-attacks. There are predetermined combos mixing punches and kicks, while you can decide which special ability should be triggered, as you can have an attack either be powerful, giving a bit of health back to you or shortening the cooldown-time of your more powerful skills.\nIt's an interesting concept and i found myself playing around with it, trying different playstyles.\n\nThe graphic is very good and has a great artstyle.\n\nThe story is also quite good, and keeps you interested (at least it did for me).\n\nOne of the more unique features, to actually alter memories to give it a different outcome (plays a bit like watching a videotape, fast forwarding, rewinding plus the ability to change different predetermined things), is used rarely, which is a shame as this was pretty much fun.\n\nAbout the flaws:\nThe camera is annoying from time to time and using mouse + keyboard feels a bit inaccurate.\nIt is VERY linear, though i didn't found that a negative thing as it was supporting the story, people might dislike the lack of freedom.\nThe Story itself also feels a bit like a mix of Inception, Assassins Creed, Johnny Mnemonic and other Movies and/or Games, but it still felt pretty unique.\n\nAll in all, if you like 3rd person games like Batman Arkham Asylum/City or Assassins Creed, then you should keep an eye on this one.","October 13, 2013","true","12.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

A story about a distopia where memories are commodity for desperate junkies, and the rich. It's full of references and quotations from famous literary writers and philosophers (from Balzac to Simone de Beauvoir). This narrative is also very well executed, and enriched with awesome graphics and an extremely fun combat system.\n\nSo why the low general score? The only negative issues I've seen target the game's linearity and hance the lack of replayability caused by it. I guess people judge games by their value of being potentially the only game to play for the rest of their lives, nowadays. Bugs are close to nonexistent - or too minor to take any notice.\n\nIf you're into the concept of memories - and a good distopic narrative that tells about it in an artistic manner sounds intriguing, this game is for you.","January 4, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game's premise is fresh and events take place in a rather stunning dystopian vision of future Paris. The environments are beautifully rendered and greatly contribute to the distressed atmosphere found in most parts of the game. The sound design isn't bad either, although the score may be a hit or miss depending on how open you are in your musical tastes.\n\nThe major problems however lie in the extremely linear level design, a terrible camera, as well as some gameplay mechanics that one feels did not go through enough play testing. There's a level for example where you have to fight some invisible enemies using a certain skill, but if you die and reload back into the game, the required skill is on cooldown, making the fight incredibly frustrating. The characters (with the exception of Nilin, who you play as) are fairly uninteresting for the most part and the combat itself isn't particularly fulfilling; it's almost spammy. I hope Capcom/Dontnod do a better job with the sequel. An open world level design would be a nice way to go about it in my view.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a 7/10.

Neo-Paris is the focus of actions: the once-great city has been rebuilt after a civil war caused by the catastrofic climate change. As I like scifi, this cosmos is very cool indeed, and effort has been used to make it believable.\n\nIn the game, you're Nilin, basically a young woman with master kung-fu skills. You are a former rebel suffering from amnesia caused by her captors and memory altering technology. Before being totally incapacitated, you are suddenly saved by a mysterious figure, Edge. You quickly proceed to become his pawn. Following his instructions, you find stuff about yourself and your past life, as well as the evil corporation you're destined to take down. Along the way you see sights of Neo-Paris: very visual, the game has fine graphics and I even spent several moments just watching some scenes because I thought they were beautiful.\n\nVery linear, the game lacks all choice following Nilin's story. Granted, she feels lost, the only lead to her memory being Edge. Story advances quickly and all characters are (in my opinion) quite realistic and thankfully there are no comedy relief characters, as the theme is serious and considers ethics of basically a *insert social media site* with access to your true memories.\n\nThe emphasis is more on action, putting you against both humans and robots. Conveniently, authorities are not allowed to use firearms so you can instead show them your kung fu. This is done by comboing punches and kicks and occasional evasive maneuver. Once you get the hang of it, it's quite easy as well (playing on the highest difficulty setting). It's not too special, but there's not too much of it either. Every level ends with a special boss fight.\n\nThe most interesting mechanic is remixing memories: at predestined points you get to invade people's memories and change them to suit your objective. There are only few cases like this but they are always super-important for the story.\n\nAll in all, the game took me 15 hours to finish the story, then another 15 hours to acquire the rest of the achievements, avoiding using guides until the very end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/228300/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","Introduction\nRemember Me is a third person, action game which combines slick combat with an engaging storyline for a mostly linear game. Its unique style, protagonist and features are sure to leave you impressed with very few errors anywhere in sight.\n\nGameplay\nProtagonist\nRemember me puts you in charge of a woman named Nillin who as you discover very early on, is a memory hunter; one of the best. However, now you've lost your memory, and you're on the path to getting it back. It's not often that we see a dark skinned, female protagonist so that's a welcome aspect to the game. Nillin is a determined fighter who doesn't seem to care who she's going up against and takes matters into her own hands, literally. As she has lost her memory, you as the player discover things about her at the very same rate that she does; it's often surreal. One thing is for sure, Nillin is a real gem in gaming.\n\nStory\nThe year is 2084 in a futuristic paris called Neo-paris, and you wake up in the middle of a lab after your memory has been wiped...mostly. You find yourself heading down a path to a total wipe until some unknown man named Edge contacts you via your built in comms; Sensen. He warns you of the danger of a complete memory erasal, and offers you one last chance at redemption; run and don't look back.\n\nRemember Me's story is brilliant and captivating, and though a few things may be unclear as you progress, you realize that the writers draw a parallel line between your understanding of the story and Nillin's memory. Early on the story was mostly decent, but once I hit around the mid-point, I literally couldn't put this game down.\n\nYour gameplay mostly revolves around platforming, fighting and solving various puzzles that may come your way. The platforming was decent, and the in-game navigation was done in such a way that it felt natural though future tech seemingly made things easier. One thing I didn't quite like was the lack of an open world. I wanted to know more about the future environment, it felt like I was forced to simply progress to each new area, sometimes being totally locked off from previous areas each time. It's a given with linear storylines, but I'm so used to open worlds now that locked paths & such are somewhat of a negative to me. This game would do pretty well with an open-world.\n\nCombat\nCombat in this game is fairly well done. There are two buttons used for melee combat, and later on you get the option of using ranged combat as well. Fighting revolves around chaining together combos; think of Batman Arkham series. If you have the combo lab DLC (recommended), you can change around your combos to include all kinds of cool moves which excel in various scenarios. Each combo has a fixed order in which you press a combination of X or Y buttons (for a controller). This helps you to memorize (heh) combos which can be quite invaluable when facing lots of enemies at once. Editing these combos was quite fun as I got to personalize my combos to include all kinds of various punching and kicking combos. Some of these were great finishers, some for AoE damage (like a whirlwind kick), and some were simply basic punches and kicks used to chain it all together.\n\nThere were a few interesting mechanics involved. Firstly, you had access to some special abilities (I won't reveal them all). For example, Sensen fury would disable your regular combos, and turn you into one superpowered, kung-fu master or something like that anyway...You'd be able for a short while, to punch and kick to your heart's content. Cooldowns on these abilities are pretty long, but that's where the second mechanic came in; cooldown reduction. There were certain types of sensen (I think?) that you could equip in the combo lab which would allow you to reduce the cooldown on your abilities. This made it so you could end up using your abilties multiple times per fight even though they were on such a long cooldown. There was also a regeneration sensen which allowed you to heal on hit, quite useful and saved me a bunch in fights, and there were multiplier sensens which enhanced the effect of previous sensens in a combo (enabling you to reduce cooldowns by well over 100 seconds when triggered.\n\nCombat was overall pretty simple, for an experienced gamer, but there were lots of moments that forced me to learn how to adapt and change my combos around in order to even survive. It was overall quite satisfying and in my opinion, is better than arkham city's combat in many ways, though you did not have any counter-attack options.\n\nRemixing memories was fun, as you could totally changed how someone remembered an event, though it did not actually change the past; realistic and fun. This could totally change their opinion on practically anything. I disliked the fact that we only had one set way of accomplishing these tasks, as it felt like I was restricted to getting one specific combination of memory glitches each remix.\n\nAudioThe music in this game was really good. There was definitely a futuristic vybe tied into all of the soundtracks, as well as some upbeat tracks used for combat. Speaking of which, the audio made combat that much more fun, as the music increased in volume as you chained together combos, and reduced in volume and complexity when you got hit. It was a very unique and interesting feature, one that should be included in a lot more games of this category. Each hit on enemies felt quite satisfying as the sounds for hit enemies resounded in your ears. Tougher foes were noticably more resistant visually and the sounds were toned down for them to emphasize this effect. The soundtrack, while not quite my style, was pretty good. The sound design team definitely deserves props for their work, as good or bad audio can make or break a game respectively.\n\nVisualsThe visuals for this game were amazing. The city of neo-paris looked amazing, as did the main protagonist. From the floating text over store-fronts to breathtaking interior designs, this game delivered. At the other end of the spectrum, the dark, dirty, infested underground sections felt exactly like described and you couldn't help but feel pity for anyone who had to live in the slums.\n\nVisuals were top-notch here, no complaints.\n\nAestheticsThe game had a unique feel right through. The future was filled with so much interesting technology, it made you want to exist in this world; it made you immersed though it was a third-person, linear game. Floating text over key objects and storefronts, robots doing various household tasks, clean cities and dirty slums, it all felt so real (if not a bit ambitious for 2084 heh). This is one world I'd love to see expanded upon in a sequel as it deserves to be explored some more.\n\nDrawbacks/NegativesEvery game isn't without its flaws, and Remember Me had a few.\n\nPlatforming wasn't always as accurate as it was portrayed. There were definitely a few moments where I jumped right for a ledge, only to fall straight to my doom where I should have definitely grabbed on.\n\nAs mentioned before, I felt like the world was just too closed off, and sometimes it felt empty (save for your average household robot which you couldn't talk to). Definitely would do well with more free interactions and less time forcibly being sent on missions.\n\nThe combat lacked a counter-attack mechanic, though this may be more realistic than anything else. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd just assumed that the combat would have included some counter mechanic.\n\nSummaryI'm going to avoid a simple pros & cons section.\n\nThe game was really good for an entry into a potential series. The story itself could very much continue based on the ending, and this is one city I'd definitely love to see more of.\n\nConclusion: 8.5/10 worth a buy.","January 8","true","13.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a mix of ideas all thrown into a pot, some of which don't pan out and others that turn out really, really good.\n\nFirst and foremost: don't buy this game at full price. It's entertaining, but it is by no means worth the $50 base they are still trying to charge. However, it is one of those games that does get exponentially better the lower it gets, and I found it to be a very solid $10-$12 mid-range title. It doesn't go on sale very often, either, so get it when it gets down to that range.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is a bit of trial-and-error. The combat follows the now-standard Batman and Sleeping Dogs formula with the twist of being able to create your own combo systems. It's not as fleshed out as I would like, and the controls are not as tight as others with the system. However, being able to reset timers or heal yourself via punching is a nice addition.\n\nSome of the cooler segments involve rearranging memories, in which you are placed into a scene and must make small changes to it that greatly affect the outcome (i.e. make a doctor kill a patient instead of curing him by messing with the hospital room, etc). The only downside is that the system is used very infrequently, with only two or so such scenes in the first several episodes. Again, a lot of cool ideas but none of them fleshed out much.\n\nWhat really makes the game, though, is the story and atmosphere. The game is absolutely gorgeous, and in the absence of good Cyberpunk games, it really does stand out. Nilin is a great character, and the city is breathaking on systems playing the High settings. I found myself actively trying to find the little Journal Mnesists things so that I could learn about the world you play through. They did a great job of building a futuristic Paris. I wish it was not such a linear game (especially for one that promotes the exploration aspects of it), but what paths we are set on really demand a lot of admiration.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, by any means, and the half-hearted attempts at some of the gameplay gimmicks keep it from being a true AAA title. That said, however, it really is a very unique and mostly fun game that will likely leave you entertained, if for no other reason than the story, visuals, and grand locations. It's a game with a ton of ambition behind it that fell just short of being fantastic, and it could warrant a sequel to tweak or expand what it does right. Well worth a steep sale price, but avoid at retail.","December 24, 2013","true","13.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Remember Me is DONTNOD's first game and it's great solid start :D. It tells the story of Nilin in a beautiful future Neo-Paris, who has lost her memory.  As a fan of sci-fi genre, I enjoyed this story a lot. It reminds me of some awesome movies of the genre. The game is linear and at quite many parts of the story you have to solve some puzzles, climb buildings. Remember Me also features some awesome "rewind" moments, where you alternate memories.\n\nThe combat is fast paced, and you can customize your own sweet combos and eventually unlocking more moves. Boss fights include some QTE, which was the only downside for me as using K+M, because the button icons for K+M didn't make it very clear what to press in few moments. Resulting in some retries.\nI think the soundtrack is amazing, it fits well in the scenes. The game's story was really good imo and it will keep you interested to the end, as you learn more about Nilin and the city. It made me think how scary it would be, if the technology would someday evolve so far, as it is in Remember Me.\n\nSo folks, try to remember and buy this game sometime :).","January 16","true","15.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Everytime I see pictures from it, I let out a sigh and say "Ah... The beautiful cyberpunkish future.", since you know, the game has that sort of vibe and I'm drawn to it. I know the "real" reviews haven't been praising the game, but as long as Call of Dutys and Titanfalls are "the best", I know it's just better to play the game myself and make up my own opinion.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. I noticed myself stopping quite often just to see my surroundings and almost felt like I could breath in the foul air of lower slums or feel the wind on my skin when topping a skyscraper. World looks detailed and creates a realistic atmosphere. Oh, and Nilin, the female character you control in game, looks cute and her animations are pretty spot on.\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward. (No spoilers, just what the trailers and game description already tells you!) You wake up with all your memories and skills gone. You hear a voice that guides you to get back on your feet and helps you trying to solve what's happened. Maybe a bit over used landing in games generally, but it works. In Nilin's story it makes sense, since she was a memory hunter herself, until she ends up on the receiving side.\n\nStory is progressing mostly via cutscenes and radio chatter between Nilin and NPCs chatter, while the player moves from A to B, climbing buildings, fighting pursuers and collecting hidden health boosts and lore updates. I can't help it, but very often I felt like I was walking on a narrow path. The world might look nice and "living", but the game world feels quite restrictive. There isn't much exploring to do and all you need to do is find the one path and stay on it for another waypoint or cutscene.\n\nThe fighting scenes reminds me alot from Assassin's Creed or some DC/Marvel superhero game. You can adjust your combos for different animations, damages and heals. During a brawl you can make cool athelitcs, dodging enemy attacks, while trying to keep your combos up for maximum pain. As the game progresses, you get more powerfull skills and cooldown abilities that helps you taking down big crowds of bad guys without a scratch. Nilin can be a badass if you want her to be.\n\nSo far the game hasn't been very hard on the puzzle side. I've found most hidden items with ease and the occasional "trap here, pull lever there" puzzles aren't overwhelmingly hard.\n\nThe most interesting part in the game is Nilin's ability to alter memories, which has a permanent effect on persons and helps the story progress. Jumping a memory phase back and forth, while trying to find glitches and then letting the memory play again is fun. As I'm not fully done with the game yet, I just hope there's more of these Jedi mind tricks, before the eventual end.\n\nI do recommend this game for anyone who likes a good looking scifi story, with some action on the side. I'm glad I didn't ignore this game due to the mediocre reviews it got in public.","August 18, 2014","true","10.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

First of all, this is my favorite game, all because of the ideas, the design of this game, the amazing soundtrack, the artworks and pretty much everything in this game, even the gameplay is not terrible as many people said.\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the game. The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The main character in the game is Nillin, a memory hunter. In the game there is a puzzle game were you can change the memory of your friends, and enemies - however, your actions are limited and you have to figure them out carefully. There are elements of parkour as well that makes the game feel more open even though there is no open world. Pretty much everything in the game is perfect but the combat system, which is a bit lame. In the menu you get artworks and 3D models of the story mod as well, you can get them while playing the game. I think that I've mentioned the main aspects of the game, expressing my own opinion of course..\nHope you like it, thanks for reading :)","December 23, 2015","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Instead, I will highlight bullet points of what I liked and don't like. This became longer than I planned due to my writing style though.  Overall, I don't recommend it, but it has favorable aspects and going by the helpful reviews on the store page as of this writing, the average mainsteam gamer will probably be ok with this as long as they are aware that this is an extremely linear spectacle fighter with irritating combat, but a unique and interesting world, story, character and occasional use of "memory remixing". If the world interests you, but you can't be bothered with the gameplay, just watch some videos about the story.\n\nLikes:\n-Setting: A futuristic Paris in a world where people can erase, replace or alter unwanted memories. Neo-Paris looks like Mirrors' Edge mixed with Assassins' Creed.\n\n-Asthetic: I'm a sucker for cyberpunk and "high techy" looking games, and I like the look of the futuristic setting with bright lights and holograms. I don't know why "SenSens" on people necks have all these weird shapes though.\n\n-Main Character: Mostly for the fact that it's not a white male. I didn't finish the game to be bothered whether I like her as a character overall. I'm just glad to see a female, and definitely one of color.\n\n-Memory remixing: This is possibly the main hook of the game, and the most intensive puzzles of the game. I love the idea of messing with people's memories, even though you aren't actually changing what happened. It's like changing the past in a time-travel game, but without actual time travel and confusing paradoxes and conflicts.\n\nDislikes\n- Combat: Oh, the combat. It has the impression of something awesome with customizable combos including unique mechanics of restoring your health and reducing cooldowns of your special moves with various attack animations, but it isn't fun to fight at all. The game feels like it wants to be Batman Arkham plus God Hand, but the free-flow is nowhere close to as smooth, responsive, and intelligent as Arkham nor is as deeply customizable and rewarding as God Hand.\nLong combat strings are constantly canceled out due to the need to dodge enemy attacks and while that makes for a more realistic/reasonable combat scenario, it negates the usefulness of longer combos. You technically have the ability to maintain your combo string - but it was never reliable to me. If I dodged completely out of the way of an enemy to an empty spot, then my combo was canceled. If I did a leapfrog dodge over an enemy, then it might decide to remember my combo. This unreliability in an action game focused on combos is inexcusable, and forced me to use the shorter combo strings. Worse, most enemies I could easily beat into a corner by spamming the main attack. I've spammed 'X" more in this game than I did in Dynasty Warriors.\n\n-Extremely Linear level design: This is common for games of this type in the past generation, but it is beyond banal to constantly walk forward as if you are playing a Call of Duty campaign. Platforming is thrown in to add a sense of scale, movement and verticality, but there is little skill involved as you follow inexplicably placed markers telling you where to jump and you are ALWAYS going down a singular, set path. "Thank goodness for all these conveniently placed ledges", the main character probably thought.\n\n-Overall "Hold your hand" game Design: When new combat mechanics are introduced, the game forces you to stop what you are doing IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT to show you a mechanic in a menu. When you get an unlock, the unlock message stays on your screen until you press select to view the unlock in the Combo Lab. A hint system which I don't think can be turned off, though some hints are manually activated. A "You always go forward" level design. Hand holding jump markers in platforming - I'd honestly rather let the game do it for me so I can go through the game faster at this point. Games like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and early Tomb Raiders had linear, but semi-skilled based platforming segments. Platforming in RM is just a more "interesting" way to  walk down the pre-determined path. Of course, like most extremely linear games from the past generation, once you go past a certain point in the level, you can't go back ,which sucks if you missed something from earlier in the level. "Reload last checkpoint"? Well, the checkpoint starts right after the point of no return. If you're really desperate, you can exit to the main menu and restart the episode, which leads me to.\n\n-God forsaken unskippable cutscenes: WHY OH GOD WHY DO GAME DEVELOPERS INSIST ON FORCING THEIR CUTSCENES ON YOU?! Admittedly, the story/plot/setting are the best part of this game, so you probably want to know what is going on. But if you want to skip something you've already seen or just don't care and want to play, too bad for you. You MUST sit through a cutscene. Did you die in a battle preceded by a cutscene? Well, you have to watch it again before you start the battle over again. Oh, and it has that beloved "slow walking while talking cutscene" Bulls*** that so many AAA action games insist on having.\n\n-Insecure Security: Important locations are protected by flying drones that immediately kill you the moment you step in their sight range....which is just a 10 meter circle under the robot. God forbid somebody exploits their patrol pattern. Maybe there are cameras and security teams to watch over blind spots? BAH! Who needs that?! Maybe the working robots can act as cameras? Not they just sit there, not even sending a silent alarm to their owners - WE HAVE SILENT ALARM BUTTONS NOW!\n\nI nearly quit the game for good once I had to solve a riddle which would seem easy, but confusing due to its implementation (a PIN number riddle) and then I finally had it when I completed an annoying boss battle, just to be able to not finish it due to a bug where I think an enemy got stuck behind a wall. I'm not sure what happened, but my player was stuck in combat animation and I couldn't open the door out.","August 15, 2014","false","10.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You may wonder why I choose to write in a language that isn't my own then - the answer is simply that I wish to share my thoughts with the widest public, and I wouldn't be able to achieve that in my mother tongue.\nWith that out of the way, let's get to the game..thank you in advance for your patience!\n\nI find it hard to accept the Metascore this game received, I have found it to be one of the most thematically interesting games I've played.\n\nImagine a future where your memories can be digitised, stored, erased, shared with those you care for: this is the future Remember Me takes you to.\nSounds inviting, doesn't it? But I'm sure you're smart enough to see the risk in this.\n\nWith access granted to the last remaining haven for personal privacy, corporations gain absolute power over the individual; the abuse of memory trading taints and fades identities.\n\nBut not all submit.\n\nA group forms to fight the corporations: they are known as the Errorists, and this is where your journey begins.\n\nCaptured and stripped of your memories, you are freed by an unexpected ally and persuaded to rejoin the cause you once fought for, determined to regain your memories and identity.\n\nNow to the gameplay: Remember Me plays as a third person action adventure with some minor platforming, and a melee combat system that borrows from the Batman: Arkham series, not without adding its own taste to it.\n\nIt all flows well and never gets overly repetitive, as combos can be customised in order to regain health, deal heavier damage or power special attacks.\nEnemy types are sufficiently diverse and can provide a decent challenge in the higher difficulty settings, as you will often adapt your combos to the situation.\nOnly minor hiccup is the camera, that at times follows at angles that make it hard to have a good visual of the fight.\n\nPlatforming is linear, ledges and ladders you can (and must) use are highlighted.\nThere are collectibles scattered across levels that will grant health or energy improvements, but overall the game is linear; I don't consider this a particular flaw, as the game is story-centered and linearity keeps the plot flowing at a good pace.\n\nThe level design is beautiful: Neo Paris is created with meticulous attention to details, and I often found myself stopping to take it all in, or just listen to NPCs discuss about their daily trials and tribulations.\n\nThe story is obviously the strong point of the game: if you were intrigued by the premise, moving forward will never feel like a chore and will not fail to catch you off guard more than once. You are in for a treat.\n\nThere is one more feature I haven't brought up yet: at set points in the story, a unique power of Nilin will be revealed.\nYou have the ability to enter people's memories. Cool? Very.\nNot only that: you also have the power to change them, affecting the present! This is done by interacting with different, set objects in the memory, affecting the end result. This is a great mechanic that I felt should have been fleshed out further. Imagine not having limitations on the remix, with any result you achieve having effect on the story!\nStill, it is a very interesting trait that already works well in the state it is given to the player in.\n\nIn summary: a gripping story, a thought provoking thematic, a setting as beautiful as it is tainted, a fun combat and a unique mechanic. If any of it appeals to you, do not hesitate to immerse yourself in the not so distant future Neo Paris.\n\nAnd if you read this in 2084..\nRemember Me.","June 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nGame OverviewRemember Me (RM) is a linear scifi action game from DONTNOD (Life is Strange).\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe game's outstanding combat system and general gameplay and story are marred slightly by an occasionally difficult camera and a handful of frustrating scenes, but these are minor.  Whereas I originally thought that the somewhat limited combat system would get redundant, it has instead been quite entertaining as combo chains are added and expanded well into the game.\n\nFurther, the puzzles in the game are well made with a balance between being easy and still slightly challenging, and the memory remixing is a very unique method of story progression and puzzle solving.\n\nStoryline\nWith an interesting storyline in a dystopian futuristic Neo-Paris, RM takes you on an adventure filled with memories, both real and fake, as you reclaim Nilin's memories and unravel the story.  This game's story is entertaining from the first chapter throughout, though some of the dialogue is over the top and expository.\n\nYou examine the story both through regular gameplay and through memory remixing, which is where you enter someone's memories and adjust key aspects of them to achieve the results you want.\n\nRating\nGameplay (story and mechanics) rating is 8/10.  Mechanical issues are enough to detract from the overall gameplay rating with camera and motion control problems at key times.  The story is outstanding, though, once you get past some moments of questionable writing.\n\nAccessibility Overview\nGame Options\nGenerally, the opening game menus are best controlled with keyboard or gamepad.  Mouse controls on these menus works, but is difficult.\n\n- Subtitles\n- Individual controls for master volume, music, voices, and sound effects.\n\n\nDeaf/HOH\nDeaf/HOH gamers may miss large portions of the story due to small, difficult-to-read subtitles.  Further, a lot of flavor text (random talking, chatter, etc) is not subtitled.  I would recommend enjoying the game and replaying or watching a video of the gameplay to pick up missed plot/storyline information.\n\nPros:\n- Subtitles exist!\n- All vital gameplay information (mechanics, some storyline) are conveyed via on screen dialogs\n\nCons:\n- Subtitles DO NOT indicate who is talking/are not color-coded\n- Subtitles are very small (possibly scaling issue with resolution), have no background, and are over a busy background, making them difficult to read\n- Subtitles during combat are easily missed, but do not seem to be significant\n- Background talking IS NOT subtitled\n\nNotes:\n- This is a single-player game; no chatting.\n\nMobility\nGamers with mobility issues may have problems with this game.  Most common controls for the game use WASD movement, space for jump, shift key for aiming, and e for use.  These can be changed.\n\nPros:\n- Keys can be rebound to suit your capabilities.\n\nCons:\n- There are Quick Time Events (QTE) in game that require pressing certain buttons within a limited amount of time.\n- There is only one key bind slot per action.\n\nNotes:\n- Casual difficulty mode still has QTEs.\n\nAccessibility Rating\nAccessibility rating is 5/10 for the issues above.

Remixing memory sequences. You go into the memories of a couple characters and modify (a limited number of) things to change what really happened.\n\nBuilding your own combo moves.  The buttons are locked to specific sequences, but the "power" of each button is customizable.\n\nThat's about all I really liked about it.  So the bad...  Can't skip cutscenes, most of them are quite long, and it doesn't offer any motivation to go back to collect items hidden around the levels if I have to sit through the cutscenes every time.\n\nNo counter-move, only dodging, and using it messes with your button combos.  It's really frusterating trying to get a longer combo against an enemy when you're fighting more than 2 or 3 and always having to dodge.\n\nSpeaking of combos, while I liked the concept, there weren't enough "pressens" (that's what they are called) to go around to fill out them all, even by the end of the game.  I collected ~90% of the items out there, and still had 2-3 locked button options.\n\nHidden collectibles, I never get them all in any game and it's a major chore to even think about going back to get anything I missed.  Especially with not being able to skip cutscenes...\n\nLastly, by the end of the game, I didn't feel all that powerful.  My combos were relegated to healing abilities and/or speeding up the cooldowns on special abilities.  Stealing memories shouldn't have been limited to getting stupid access codes.  All the special abilities and combo moves are unlocked at set points before entering combat with new enemy types.  It would have been way more rewarding to earn new moves through something that tied to the story instead of "oh here's this new move now".","April 9, 2015","false","11.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Far from perfect, but worth the playtime.\n\nA different battle system heavily inspired by the Batman Arkham games, and some climbing from the Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed series. On the other side, the game could have been less linear. The truly unique gameplay mechanic is the memory remix, during the remix tou will alter a person's memory for your own reasons (for the story's sake actually). The only downside is that there were too few of these.\n\nThe art style is amazing, and the setting (Neo-Paris, 2084) is just beautiful. Early in the game you will see some bits of the high-end of the city, and it feels truly alive.

There is another interesting and original part of the game however, the memory remix.\nFirst of all this is clearly a console game, which is very bad ported for PC. The controls feels clumsy, the menus do not support "normal" mouse-mode, and you are forced to navigate in an annoying console-way. And the memory remix is the most bad ported part in the entire game. To rewind in these parts, you literally have to clear your computer desk, to make space for you to look stupid with your mouse, while you make big counter-clockwise movements with your mouse. Very, very bad control!\nAnother clumsy and glitchy part of the game is the fight parts. And except from that, these are furthermore quite trivial and boring on the long term.\nThe game is very linear, and have too much of a console-feeling for my taste.

The other game is a straight up Batman style brawler, made way more complicated than it needed to be by you having to map abilities you unlock to the x, y, a or b buttons and then having to remember and try to pull off button combos in the right order and with the right timing.\n\nThe brawling sadly takes up most of the game, while remixing peoples memories you only get to do about 4 times in total throughout your journey through Neo Paris, which by the way made the game for me. This is one gorgeous and very cool looking city. It's sadly also incredibly linear while you are navigated through it while either climbing up buildings or fighting people.\n\nTonally it seems off as well, with your character and the story being overly serious but then undercut by these larger than life cartoonish villians you have to fight, which seemed totally out of place in this context, that was jarring for me.\n\nThe soundtrack was really awesome though, really memorable and hummable, in fact just get the soundtrack instead you'll enjoy it more :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOJ-Z357NxY&index=17&list=PLstXdGXEYegfDNZLqeogii9dYwM5V3Kya\n\nI would recommend the game to anyone who likes walking around looking at cool architecture, the gameplay didn't really do it for me, but this is one of the few games where i think it's worth playing for the aesthetic over the actual gameplay.","January 21","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/228300/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","First episode into the game and I was having a hard time containing my excitement.  This was the first "AAA" game I had played in quite a while that oozed with so much...atmosphere?  The trailers and screenshots don't quite do the prescence of Neo Paris justice, and I can see how they  may come off as a typical cyberpunkish utopia/slums contrast.  However, Dontnod's designers manage to take those tropes and somehow make them feel fresh and envigorating.  Even the UI for the menu's in the game are interesting, different, and don't feel like a hastle to sift through (the Combos Lab aside).  The Horn of Jericho is probably my favorite and the most memorable enemy offered up by the game, something about the giant angry robot projecting a shouting human mouth while roaring is captivating and creepy at the same time.\n\nThe game does a really good job of pacing out the combat, puzzle solving, and platforming, delivering all three in varying doses without any single one getting too tiresome before switching gears to something else.  Collectibles are cleverly placed and most use different cues like memorizing an image to find later in the level or audio cues so they can be easily located without too much "hunting forever to get that one achievement" syndrome.\n\nNarrative pacing is slow to start, and just when I was beginning to presume certain portions were just poorly written the story fills in the holes and brings the player back in.  Since the protagonist starts out the game as an amnesiac this is a good hook to keep you in sync with the status of the main character.  They know just as much as you do, sometimes even less...\n\nSome enemy models get tweaked as the game progresses, so while there's not a lot of variety to the silohuettes, the combat system forces you to rethink your strategy by changing the status quo each time a new enemy type is introduced or by throwing unique combinations of enemies into a fight.  The boss fights never seem unfair, though its not always immediately clear what your goal is to wear down the enemy in those scenarios (if you are ever stuck for a prolonged period of time on a battle or in a puzzle the game can offer a hint to help you along, but this was usually not provided in my playthrough as I eventually figured it out in time).  The combat system has you slowly unlock button presses with special effects throughout the game, which can then be chained together in templates provided for combos (XYYXYY, XXX, YYYXXXXY, etc.).  These special effects range from additional damage to healing on-hit.  While not my favorite part of the game it was fun to have some control over what my attacks did when facing specific enemy types.\n\nPlatforming is not an open world experience like Assassin's Creed, you can't climb anywhere (usually only on highlighted beams and ledges).  Despite movement being somewhat restricted I never felt like I was running down a linear series of hallways like some games suffer from.\n\nPuzzles come in a wide variety, some include modifying the environment through use of various machinery and your AR glove, while others involve cracking passwords or figuring out how to outsmart a drone formation patrol.  The most notable are the memory remixes, where you enter the memory of another character and look for glitches to remix to make them believe something in the past occured in an alternate fashion to help will them to the protagonist's cause.\n\nA couple of the remixes left a bad feeling in my stomach, combined with a few of the actions the player was championed into accomplishing by their "leader".  The moral consequences of making someone believe in a different past are rarely explored, and many of the negative actions the player has to take to get to the ending evoke a "Spec Ops: The Line" feeling with a lot less hating yourself and a little more "did the ends justify the means?" pondering.\n\nThe smaller gripes I have with the game include jumping being very nearly worthless when not in a platforming scenario, unskippable cut scenes (if I die with a checkpoint right before a battle, etc.), the sometimes confused UI in the Combo Lab, and the game pausing whenever I Shift-Tab (I could at least be browsing the web during the second+ viewing of those cut scenes?).  My love for what this game does RIGHT completely eclipses those annoyances though, Dontnod has built a solid third person game with mechanics that are classic but feel fresh, and have built a beautiful world around that gameplay.  Do yourself a favor and give this game a try.","September 28, 2015","true","12.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Some of them helped the game tremendously, and some took away from it, but at the end of the day Remember Me is very worth suffering through some annoyances of extremely linear level design, janky cutscenes and weird memory replay mechanics for a fantastic story with great characters in an undeniably gorgeous world.\n\nHighlights\nRemember Me includes incredibly gorgeous detailed environments and backdrops, and a very metropolitan, urbane feel to everything, a style which wouldn't be felt again until games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution\n\n* Detailed NPCs add life to the environment. You'll often stop to eaves drop on NPCs engaging each other or having a conversation\n* Interesting characters and especially very interesting bosses with personality which also help to add a dimension of challenge\n* One of the best asses in video games\n\nMistakes\nRemember Me stands up above many other games with some incredible design and production value, so it's painful and frustrating when something doesn't feel as well done as the other design elements. The extremely linear nature of the world, for example, feels like such a pain in the ♥♥♥ because of all the fantastic depth and beauty in everything else.\n\n* The combat is unique and very good when understood, but the game does an awful job of explaining and guiding the player to use the system, and you can easily play through the entire game without ever fully coming to terms with the combat\n* Some of the cut scene elements are un-skippable and just plain annoying at times\n\nRecommendations\nRemember Me clocks in at 10 hours of play time, and has a lower price point than most triple A titles, but at £22.99/27.99€/$29.99 it might be more than most should pay, considering the very dividing gameplay structure. When on sale, it's a real bargain, and worth the risk. It routinely goes -75% or more.\n\n* The game was originally designed, under Sony, to play more like Assassin's Creed, and a much more open world and was then rolled back by EDGE due to the smaller story, and to help fit the story https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=68&v=4oFzeVYk7Is\n* The Combo Lab Pack DLC adds a couple of extra fight moves which makes customizing your attacks mildly easier and more interesting but honestly adds nothing to the game overall for anyone other than committed fans.\n* Remember Me was developed by DONTNOD Entertainment, who would later go on to create Life is Strange\n* Plays a bit better with a controller, but a Keyboard plays fine too\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/228300","June 26, 2015","true","12.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You play as Nilin, a young, recently-turned-amnesiac woman who has clearly been having a pretty bad day. Nilin must regain her memories through hurdles presented both by the engrossing, eccentric environment that is the city and the evil entity that is the Memorize corporation.\n\nStory\nBeing set in the future, the game naturally attempts to present a futuristic atmosphere and encompassment to the setting. Remember Me does a great job with this. Neo-Paris is a fascinating city saturated with surreal ideas like fancy heads-up holographic signage for nearly anything of even minor interest and, of course, the capitalization of the human memory (blame Memorize). The story holds up fairly well and, though sprinkled with a few cliché set pieces, has some very interesting twists and ideas that give it fair value. A heavy start that occasionally crawls to a furious finish.\n\nGameplay\nWhen you are presented with the first combat scenario (the major gameplay aspect of the game), this is where Remember Me either pulls you in or whispers "Uninstall me". The combat unfortunately feels a little stiff. It's not bad by any means (and I'll explain why) but it has its limitations. The entire combat experience feels somewhat grounded, which comes off as odd because the rest of the game suggests furiously-free, fluid mobility. Nilin hits fast and can leap around by somersaulting over enemy shoulders, but it feels ''on rails'' to some extent.\n\nStiff combat acrobatics aside, fighting in Remember Me is redeemed by the clever Pressens combo system. Through experience, Nilin acquires Pressens, combat moves that can then be creatively placed into one of four combo chains found in the Combo Lab at any given moment. How you mix these up as you encounter different situations will greatly affect your performance. If you never change your combos, you will not progress through the game. Pressens come in three varieties: Power, Regen and Cooldown. Power hurts, Regen is obvious and Cooldown converts hits landed on bad guys into shaved time off of cooldowns for your S-Pressens, unique moves that specifically target or damage particular enemy types. Some S-Pressens are a necessity to defeat certain enemy types, and that's where your Pressen combos come in handy. You need to calculate (usually through trial and error) what Pressen sequences you'll want to assign to which of your combo chains depending on the enemies you face, or just go all-out Power and succumb to repetitive failure. I suggests learning about Pressens.\n\nTechnical\nRemember Me did leave some bitter impressions on the technical side of things. Gorgeous visuals aside, the game leaks memory very easily and performance issues become easily noticeable. After anywhere from 1 to 3 hours of gameplay, the slick 60+ fps framerate would non-subtly dip to a variable 30-40fps (it only takes up to 30 minutes for this to occur when soaking in-game). A reboot of the title temporarily fixes the issue, but you will need to repeat this process every few hours.\n\nThroughout the 26 hours of game time I have with Remember Me, I've stumbled across 6 instances of very severe progression-breaking bugs that each left me needing to restart the entire chapter. I encountered only one of these during my first playthrough. During my follow-up playthrough, knowing how to progress quickly, I fell upon the other 5. Most of them seemed to be caused by simply interacting with or completing objectives too fast which is a shame, epecially since Remember Me doesn't let you skip any cutscenes or cinematics. Some of these are long and they're quite abundant, so when you're trying to speed through a second playthrough for some missed achievements, you're gonna do a lot of waiting.\n\nThe TL;DR\nAll in all, Remember me is a solid 7.5 / 10 for me. Fair points lost for noticeable technical flaws of the PC port, but a strong overall note thanks to the creative setting, solid visual work, a soundtrack so fitting that it's practically transparent and a mostly-pleasant gameplay experience. Here's to a sequel that hopefully delivers even bigger.","July 25, 2015","true","25.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You do climb around like Assassin's Creed, but only through set paths, which again, I found to be more annoying than anything else, mainly due to the fact that you frequently fall and find yourself in trouble.

The number one feature is the environment/art style of the game, it's breath taking, and really had an impact on me, it immerses you in the game's narrative. The game sets a very plausible future of current technology/social trends.\n\nIts' very cinematic, often the gameplay engine looks as good as prerendered. The charaters have character; the models/animation and voice acting are top notch. The music is well done and has a remixed/glitchy style that really fits the game.\n\nThe style it's lot's of cables, robots, computer servers, bright billboards, massive TVs, colorfully designed appliances, neon signs, grafittied concrete countered by Paris historical revolutionary statues etc...

On that alone, I recommend a playthrough of the game. The visual design is also quite spectacular, and every time the camera shifts or pans into a vista, you can really see the detail in the game's environments. Unforunately, in the early part of the game, you spend a lot of time in some pretty boring and lackluster settings.\n\nCombat, in particular, the combo lab system, is a bit obtuse in the beginning. Once you realize the freedom you have in customizing a combo to give you extra damage, regen, or cooldown bonus, it's pretty simple to figure out the best order for your playstyle. The melee fighting behaves very similarly to the Batman Arkham games, where stringing combos and dodging at the "!" prompts allows you to wipe the floor in most cases. The boss fights are particularly fun when the game throws a good mix of enemy types for you to handle all at once. They can get tricky, and I had the most fun in those scenarios.\n\nCertain cinematic moments (particularly a certain chase sequence) can leave you frustrated due to its trial-and-error nature. Thankfully, that kind of stuff does not happen often.\n\nThe story is enjoyable enough, particularly near the end, and if you're open to some cheesy sci-fi, you'll have a good time. Don't expect to be blown away, though.\n\nAgain, I can't stress enough how much the music in this game makes it for me. Without that glitchy, up-tempo, orchestral soundtrack, I don't think I could recommend the game as much. It makes that much of a difference. If anything, get the soundtrack if you really don't want to play the game, though the two go hand-in-hand rather beautifully.","January 5, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I wasn't so sure if i was going purchase this game but I saw the Trailer, Read the Description and Look at the screenshots and it caught my attention right away. So i ended up buying at the risk of whether or not if i was going to seriously enjoy it.\n\nIt turns out my overally experience for this game was just ideally flawless I was amazing on how well scripted this game and how much my predicitions were all wrong Dontnod entertainment did an awesome job with an awesome storyline on their part. The Second thing I thought was amazing was just the action alone you had to think every second on when to encounter the leapers/guards and it was well challenged.\n\nAnother Thing that interest me was the customizations and the sensen powers who knew Niin (Sorry if i actually spelled her name wrong) would have the power to overdrive memories, control what happens and remix memories that just amazed me a lot and Dontnod Entertiament has an pretty interesting idea of the future but who knows what might happen.\n\nI got this game when it was on the community sale during the Steam Winter Sale and Even if i did pay the full retail price i would still made the risk regardless. Its well worth your money and you can always go back and redo the story on a harder level.\n\nRating 10/10","January 3, 2014","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uberawesomebanana/recommended/228300/","uberawesomebanana","[SpA]Banana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uberawesomebanana/","528 products in account","Remember Me is in my eyes a totally underrated game if you're only a little bit into this type of game. It feels like a great cocktail of Mirror's Edge, Tomb Raider and Batman Arkham Series. The game takes place in the year 2084 in a world shaken by nature after the ice melted and a company invented a brain implant to manage your memories.\n\nPros:\n* The visuals are astonishing. I really dug into the art style. Take a look at some of the screenshot and it will look even better in motion.\n* The sound/music is awesome, too. Great compositions and dynamic mixes (e.g. for fights).\n* The story! It great. You must play it to experience that on your own. Made me think what's going on in my head once or twice. ;-)\n* The love for details. I felt really impressed on how much work they invested into (small) details. Floating signs telling you the store is closed, but the website is online or to watch your step close to an edge, just make the world to feel complete. The memos you can find, will tell you stuff like details about the history of the world.\n* Memory Remixs: During the game you have to manipulate a couple of memories which is done by "scrolling" the memory forward and backward and change simple things like the position of a chair which may make the scene to come to a whole different ending.\n\nOKs:\n* Fights are like Batman, but not that fluid. You've got lots of enemies and mixed up types. So you have to manage your techniques and modify your combos to match new challenges. During fights you bulld up focus which allows you to trigger special moves you're granted through the story.\n* Traversing the linear levels is basically straightforward. The climb/jump/shimmy stuff feels like Tomb Raider, although there's always a marker pointing where to go. All over the level are hidden powerups/memos so you have to look left and right.\n* There are quick time events in the boss fights. They may feel cool, but I don't like them when they force me to repeat stupid stuff (like part of the fight before) when I press the wrong button.\n\nContras:\n* I had some control issues (keyboard+mouse) with an action scene where you're chased by a madman in an armed helicopter. Dunno if they were not precise enough or if it was just me.\n* One boss fight is somehow plain stupid as its extremly repetitive. It took some tries to get the basics and then it was not really fun. All other bosses felt much better designed.\n\nOverall: You have to play it yourself!","January 3, 2014","true","16.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FTDGolem/recommended/228300/","FTDGolem","Golem has a llamaface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FTDGolem/","169 products in account","Remember Me is fantastic work.  First of all, if you think MP is some kind of Holy Grail of gaming, or that 'Collectibles' are a modern trend that is core to gaming, then steer clear of Remember Me.  It's not for you.  This has been made by a team of artists and designers who had a big vision for a game and saw through a pretty good contender for a long-lasting favourite.\n\nThis game can be over fairly quickly if you rush the lot.  Don't - I like a game that lets me walk rather than run.  Check out the grand amazing vistas, the grime of the grungier parts of town, look for your journal entries, get absorbed, and this is far longer than most attempts at a SP campaign in cinematic game offerings at the moment.  The repeating levels was a minor 'hmmm' however there is a good reason for each revisit and reinforces the impact of your actions in the story-line.  This said, it felt a little restricted to too few areas for such a big city, never mind the injured world itself.  I came across a couple of bugs where the game hadn't registered a combat or action success and I had to restart the last checkpoint (minutes spend repeating myself, but there were just minutes.)  Combat threatens to become repetitive however that's avoided if you play as they mean you to - tactically, fluidly, and adapting.\n\nThe soundtrack has been crafted with the game themes in mind.  The acting is some of the best I've heard in a game in ages, particularly Nilin, whose actress does help keep you in the mood and pace of the scene.  On this note, atmosphere is rich, as is the world you're running in - again, you can tell how much effort has gone into this project when close attention as been paid to architecture on varying levels of modern on top of classic, with plenty of evidence of life.\n\nThe game's pace keeps you continually upgrading via a system of memory recollection (which basically works like experience). Apparently the combat has come under fire from some reviewers but I don't see the problem - you are clearly given the approach to take with different enemies, and if you forgot, check the Journal.  The game allows up to four combo sequences into which you can place hits and kicks of different properties.  You customise your combos to give you what you need - timing your combos is key to success, and for me, this works.  It's a very accessible tactical approach to avoid mindless button mashing. The other aspect of the game which I really liked was the memory remixing.  This isn't an idea milked to death, and sees you rewinding and pausing memories, altering details to change the outcome, and the target's motivations.  It's very linear, and I was even a little frustrated when certain obstacles that the acrobatic Nillin could clearly get over acted as invisible walls, or insurmountable set pieces (I do like to climb on stuff).\n\nTo finish off, back to the storyline - it went to places I didn't anticipate and in the end I was treated to an excellent bit of sci-fi, with a back story of decent depth if you care to look for it.  And you should, because the origin of this dystopia helps understanding it all.  The writing is on top form - some of the baddies and tough goodies are pretty standard but the story behind the world is well thought through.  The dystopia rose from a humanitarian ideal, brought down by greed, with a broken well of regret and pain at its core.  You'll be forced to take actions you question.  Is it right to enslave public menaces and monsters?  Is it right to change who a person is for a greater good? etc.  The plot delves deep into the important characters (including Nillin of course) and by the end, the world has changed.\n\nThis game could have been incredible, it could have been a lot more, but there's still enough to appreciate.\n\nEasy test now: If you're still reading, this is a game you shouldn't miss.","January 2, 2014","true","38.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The game environment is so beautiful and cyberpunk this includes Nilin the protagonist.  My one and only gripe is the world is so detailed and beautiful it compels you to explore it but the game story is linear so you can't deviate too far.

The game has cool features I don’t remember encountering in other games. You can build your own combos with certain bonuses in them such as healing, or special ability cool down decreaser. The enemies are fun each type you have to find the right tactic and/or combo to counter them. This keeps the fights interesting throughout the game. There is also a feature in the game where you can hack someone’s brain and change their memories by altering small things and see how it plays out until you get the result you are looking for. The story is strong and a little emotional. I got this game on sale around 20 bucks and I think that it’s a fair price. It took around 12 hours to complete. After you are done you can jump to different levels to complete achievements you may have missed. Graphically the game is awesome; very detailed and polished.

I saw some of its concept art floating around the internet before finding out what game it belonged to, and those pieces, while great, don't do that game any justice when you actually see the game in motion. Every piece of art has been translated over into the game world flawlessly.\n\nThe story is reminiscent of creative works such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Total Recall, and the such, which I'm sure without a doubt that those works had a huge influence on its narrative, and its very telling in its aesthetic that it definitely took influence from those. The combat system is kind of like the rythmic sort of combat that's become the norm in a lot of action games, such as the Batman Arkham series of games, or for example Assassin's Creed. The game also allows you to build your own combos, with a variety of different effects that you can unlock and choose from, in an a la carte type customization.\n\nWhile not that long of a game, I do think it is a very engrossing one, although my one constant complaint that I would have with this game is that the camera isn't the greatest, in fact it can be pretty frustrating to deal with sometimes, but it's really not that much of a hassle once you get used to it.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an action game, something with an original story, and with an interesting world. It's a shame that this didn't get much exposure, or money, so I kind of doubt that it'll get a sequel.

Es arte en movimiento, una experiencia audiovisual maravillosa sin duda alguna.\nEn este juego tendras accion a montones; robots y enemigos varios en grandes cantidades para poner a prueba tus habilidades en combate, en el devenir de su interesante argumento. Y es que aqui no hay nada dejado al azar.  Cada minuto, cada esquina, cada nota de su excelente banda sonora, cada enemigo a batir...ofrece una experiencia maravillosa al jugador, provocando que permanezcas pegado a la silla durante toda la partida, sin apenas parpadear por miedo a perderte el mas minimo detalle. Porque con 'Remember Me' lamentaras tener que dejar de jugar. Su ambiente te envuelve y embelesa como lo haria la mejor de tus experiencias en la vida real.\n\nComo detalle curioso del juego, me gustaria comentar un exquisito guinyo de los desarrolladores del juego hacia esa pelicula de culto como es Desafio Total, llamando Dr. Quaid a uno de los principales personajes de la historia.

I am not too keen on using controllers when I play games so unfortunately I played Remember Me a little bit then shelved it. Recently playing another Capcom game with a similar concept led me to dust Remember Me off and replay it. So here is my belated thoughts of the game:\n\nI'm going to start with its combat because there is so little to be said about it. If you have played games such as the Batman Arkham series and do not mind the combo building style of combat and platforming, then Remember Me will not disappoint you, however if combat like this is not your cup of tea and you are not fan of hanging from high buildings, then you will be very frustrated while playing Remember Me (especially on the hardest difficulty).\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not too fussed about the combat and are more interested in a very well told story, amazing art work coming to life with perfectly executed graphical design, as well as interesting characters and enemies, then this is a must-play for you. Not to mention, the soundtrack is quite good and the voice-over acting is flawless. It was also nice to play a female protoganist that was desinged very well with a realistic attitude and body posture, and not running around in bikinis.\n\nThe setting is in 2084 Neo-Paris. The details in the environment, characters, and enemies are amazing. I recommend you try and find all the collectibles (as some of them are very well hidden and will take you to every nook and cranny). The audio is flawless, from the music and the enviornmental sound to the voice acting, especially the voice acting which is very professionally done - it definately puts the player in the right mood.\n\nDespite of the unfortunate events the protoganist goes through, her desperation is just, without sounding needy. The rest of the voice acting is also perfect, as it gives you the correct emotions towards the other characters, (such as liking or disliking them, getting annoyed by them or feeling sympathy for them). The physique of the character in my opinion stands out - recently the protogonists in video games have been on the extreme side of appearances (especially females with unrealistic body shapes that in the real world would make it impossible to do the things they do in games). However in this one, the protognist (Nilin) is designed perfectly to play the role of the fast, agile and lean heroine without going over the board and shadowing her feminity.\n\nThe most important thing that captured me about this game was the main concept of the game, playing with people's memories. I found it quite unique and I don't think I came across anything like this before in a game. It was very refreshing.\n\n\n(TL;DR Version) I highly recommend this game to players who are looking for story-rich, beautifully designed game with Batman Arkham series style of gameplay, set in Neo-Paris with a unique concept.","August 2, 2013","true","49.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What could have been an excellent game is ruined by mediocre combat which is riddled with AI issues and just pure jankiness.\n\nThe sad part is that the one gameplay aspect in Remember Me, called "Remixing", is probably the coolest feature I've seen in a game in a while, where you alter cutscenes on the fly to complete a puzzle. But it's only in the game a few times, and is overlooked by the shoddy platforming and fighting.","July 17, 2013","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No doubt, you have to play Remember me.\nYou ask why? Because it is one of the most original games I've ever played. Interesting story, excellent game art, stunning soundtrack performed by an orchestra, unique level design. Even the starting menu looks great. But, unfortunately, this game is not perfect. The reason of this is not a bad gameplay. Even though the combat system was critiicized by lots of gamers, for me, it seems OK. Looked a bit complicated at first, but after some time I got used to it and, actually, got fun from gme fights.\nSo, my main complain about this game - bad face animation. Good game art hides most of the graphic flaws, but when it comes to looking at some character's face closely, while one is talking to somebody - all face animation problems become visible. Often face emotions just do not combine with a nice voice acting, spoiling impression about the game.\nAnother complain is not being able to go back after some checkpoints. Oftenly I missed some secrets just because chose the wrong door that lead me to the next story episode.\nBut, in spite of all, I liked Remember me. And I will definitely play this remarkable game again.\nMy personal rating for it - 8/10.","December 23, 2013","true","18.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is unfortunately not nearly as well-written or engaging as Deus Ex, but it does present a similar sort of experience (and with much better graphics. Worse music though). Remember Me runs really well too, and plays great-- the fighting is actually really fun despite the terrible lack of enemy variety, and the ability to nimbly leap over enemies as you're comboing them really makes you feel like you're controlling a skilled fighter (serioulsy, the nimbleness is off the hook here, and a nice departure from the usual cover-based face-shooting of Every Other Action Game Ever). The main character Nilin is another reason to play-- the character model is really a nice design, and i love the way she gets all out of breath after running a lot and the way she kind of looks around while  she's walking-- these are great details that really add to you caring about her. Hell, play it just because you get to play as a cool biracial French woman with a sweet haircut instead of the usual Generic Beefcake White Dude-- an extremely refreshing departure on this count as well (and if it bothers you that everyone is speaking English in a game set in freaking Paris, there's actually the option to switch the audio to French with English subtitles, so if you're a great big hipster like me and want it to seem more authentic then you're in luck).\n\nShort version: very nice looking and never frustratingly difficult, and although the story is basically a Luc Besson movie stretched over ten hours, it does at least broach on an interesting subject and also makes you care about the character and what happens to her. Definitely a solid purchase if you're into Sci-Fi, though if you're not you can probably skip it unless, again, you want the rare experience of playing a game where the character isn't like the character in every other game out there.","December 1, 2013","true","31.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I think a lot of people are not playing into the game very far or they would see all the platforming and understand this isnt just a blind brawler.\n\nive played all the batman games and while they are great they feel like button mashing fests if you play them that way. yes you can be thoughtfull and fight with strategy but its totally possible to button mash at anytime and succeed. while inthis game remember me you cannot just button mash blindy, you have to remember the combos you make and change them often to take advantage of the games potential. if you just mash X you will die quick esp the further you get into the game. i liked the idea of being able to heal with certain successful strikes and combos. it made me look forward to unlocking longer combos and strikes. its also the only way to beat certain enemies later in the game that mirror the damage you give to them back at you. if you dont use enough heal strikes you kill yourself. also the powers felt good and the cooldown system worked well. they have 1-2 min cooldowns (maybe more for some) but if you make use of the combo and strikes that shorten cooldown you cut a lot of time out of it and make them available much sooner.

The level of detail is some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics, artwork, and effects are outstanding. I can't think of too many games that come close to looking this good. One of the most underrated games I have played. The graphics/effects are outstanding and it has top-notch sound effects and music. It controls very well and combat is a lot of fun. Be prepared with a xbox 360 controller though for the best experience by far because since it is Capcom and they rank among the worst companies for programming pc games, keyboad and mouse movement is nowhere near as good as using a controller. Every time I walk into a fight I'm thinking "♥♥♥♥ yes it's time to beat some serious ♥♥♥" because combat has a great feel and you can really feel the hits landing. You also get a wide variety of combos and special powers. Overall, the combat really is very well done. It is pretty fun and very engaging. The story is very unique and well done also imo.

The level of detail is some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics, artwork, and effects are outstanding. I can't think of too many games that come close to looking this good. One of the most underrated games I have played. The graphics/effects are outstanding and it has top-notch sound effects and music. It controls very well and combat is a lot of fun. Be prepared with a xbox 360 controller though for the best experience by far because since it is Capcom and they rank among the worst companies for programming pc games, keyboad and mouse movement is nowhere near as good as using a controller. Every time I walk into a fight I'm thinking "♥♥♥♥ yes it's time to beat some serious ♥♥♥" because combat has a great feel and you can really feel the hits landing. You also get a wide variety of combos and special powers. Overall, the combat really is very well done. It is pretty fun and very engaging. The story is very unique and well done also imo.

It's a very interesting concept and story there's no doubt about that. Although I wouldn't say that it touches on our social media at all. It's more on the verge of talking about advancement in technology in regards to how it might affect us on a physical/mental level, which in this case using human memories to regulate our society. It's a game definitely inspired by many other forms of media like the anime Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex. Deux Ex imo is a far more polished game that literally trumps this one in terms of sheer story, gameplay, and characters.\n\nI would say that the plot of this game was "average" at best. It was nothing amazing and thought provoking like the 2 forms of media I mentioned earlier. The writing and dialogue is a little tacky, and there's little to no character development. The only character you will really follow is yourself. You don't really interact with many other people at all, and the motives of the people you bring down are quite cliche. I applaud the developers for making an entire world that is ran by people using their memories to get by, but they didn't write a stellar story at all.\n\nGameplay is repititive, but kind of cool for the first hour. The only unique thing this game has is the "Remix" sequences, which allows you to tap into a memory, and change it resulting in the victim remembering a fake memory instead of the real one. It's kind of cool, but you only get to do it like 4-5 times.\n\nHonestly I would pick this game up if it's on sale, making it like $4. Other than that I would recommend playing Human Revolution, which is a far superior game than this. They're both quite different, but share the same sci-fi like setting, but Deus Ex goes way deeper.","December 24, 2015","false","7.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Derivative combat mechanics and uninspired platforming are a small price to pay for the marvelous, high sci-fi world building and characters that are drawn with tenderness and depth. There are sparks of brilliance everywhere, and they burn just about long enough to leave you intrigued rather than frustrated. Being able to customise attack combos is a stimulating diversion, even though there are extremely few options to choose from. The handful of "memory remix" sequences are narratively arresting, but ultimately amount to an exercise in trial and error, albeit beautifully realised. Remember Me is a game that lacks conceptual focus and falls back on a lot of tried and tested gameplay conventions to make up for it. However, the gorgeously realised world, compelling plot and fantastic presentation mean that you should definitely give it a chance. I for one will come back for a second playthrough.","October 31, 2014","true","10.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The combat relies on the execution of well-timed combos. Combos which you can and must define yourself. An interesting idea that breaks with usual genre conventions, but ends up feeling not really satisfying. Maybe because this mechanic forces you to perform accurately timed button presses all the time, which keeps the player from truly enjoying some sort of flow of combat.\n\nAnother quite interesting aspect is the ability to remix memories. Basically you have to manipulate an ingame cutscene, which you can forward and rewind, to ultimately change the outcome to the one you desire. From a purely gameplay perspective this is indeed questionable, but it's an interesting variation of storytelling and does build atmosphere. You don't get to do this often during the game though.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay mainly consists of horribly stilted platforming, trivial puzzles and walking around a scrictly linear path. Doesn't sound too exciting overall. The reason why I still immensly enjoyed Remember Me lies in the unusual science fiction scenario that manages to build an immersive atmosphere. Certainly not for everyone!","May 28, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's top notch story, artwork and graphics that will leave you stunned, and great musical score makes this game something you 'll never want to forget. The only downside is the first few levels leave the combat a little meh(~2 Hours).\n\nThe Story:\n\nWithout spoiling anything Remember Me is a game where you think you know what's going to happen. When you finally play it you'll see that there is even more then you thought. The story in this game is one of the best stories ever told in a Big Budget released titles. The world feels real and the story plays off this amazingly constructed world perfectly. It may even make you rethink how you view your own memories.\n\nThe Graphic/Artwork:\n\nThe detail in this game is above any other I've seen. Little robot float by with signs showing you the specials of places to eat or shops. The floating text  of the signs are at the perfect depth in order to feel as if they are realistically placed. Dirty places feel dirty and not over done just like clean places feel just the right amount of clean. Nothing is over done and the detail is so perfect it's insane to think about. You really feel as if you are part of the world. The 3D is also very good.\n\nThe Sound/Music:\n\nThe Musical score in this game is perfect as well. It combines classic big orchestra sound with corrupt technology sounds in the perfect manner. Sound is one of my favorite things in a game so even if this styles sounds crazy even at first I didn't believe how well it sounded.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is great only maybe 3 lines in the game feel out of place. Each actor adds emotion to their character and draws you into the story and scene. The combat sounds can get a little repetitive though because the enemy are always saying the same one liner all the time. Nothing that can't be over look.\n\nThe combat noises and ambient sounds are also really well done. You heard ADs over a PA system about a product in the world or what just happened in the news. Robots talk about protocol for the area or you just hear people talking in the streets.  You can hear the distant sounds of computers running around a corner or a leaper hiding the shadows. The combat noise of punches landing and other abilities hitting are fine as well. Things sound satisfying when they land and never out of place.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is one of the weakest parts of Remember Me at the start of the game. You don't have many abilities, pressens, or combos and it can feel as if you are just spamming the one or two combos you do have in order to just get through. When you finally unlock everything the style of combat you do is almost an art of itself. It flows so well and looks very good. At the beginning of the game it can seem that the combat is down right bad but give it time it gets really fun.\n\nThe platforming in Remember Me in very linear as the game is pretty much 95% linear. There are a few places you can go in order to find collectibles but other then that it's pretty much follow this path. The platforming is pretty easy and really just something you do in order to find the solutions to puzzle as it's pretty hard to fail these sections. Overall the platforming is neither good nor bad it's pretty ok.\n\n\nAll in all if you are looking to pick up Remember Me I strongly suggest you do. I played it the whole way through in Nvidia 3D and it was great. I recommend using a controller so you can lean back and enjoy this amazing game.\n\nBy far the Must Play Game of 2013.","January 18, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

The style of this game is fantastic. Its vision of 70 years in the future was interesting and believable with a lot of fancy new tech around, but not too far technologically advanced. Frequently it was fun to stop and check out the scenery. There are a lot of nice little touches that add a lot of detail and flesh this world. There is some real stunning visuals in this game. Unfortunately, there are a few texture and lighting problems that make some areas just overall look crappy and don't sparkle like most of the rest of the game does. There's far too much time spent in sewers and drab dark places. Also, the world does feel empty as there aren't a lot of NPCs to fill out the levels to make it feel alive. Honestly, the story was mediocre, but not terrible. And the actual format of the game has been done so many times before. Travel to a big room and punch up a bunch of dudes and then continue on until the next fighting room is reached. The fighting wasn't anything special, but I did enjoy it. The combo system made for some interesting fights that reminded me a lot of the Batman series. The story involves a chilling future scenario where memories are bought and sold like commodities and memories can be rewritten at will by jacking into peoples brains. The expression 'Remember Me' does have a significance to the story, but I kept getting the feeling the makers weren't exactly confident in the game they were making and they kept repeating the phrase in the game so people will remember to tell their friends about the fun time they had playing through this game. The game is fairly easy. There were only a couple of difficult boss battles. It took just over 12 hours to complete the game. I liked this new mechanic where someone's memory would play out on screen and as it progresses key details can be changed to alter the memory in sometimes insignificant, sometimes profound ways. It was fun trying different combos to see how the memory changes in sometimes wildly different ways. Tweaking to get things to play out just right. This game does kind of remind me of a kinder, gentler take on the Resident Evil series. Instead of shooting missiles at genetic mutant freaks and driving down zombies, you're punching security guards. And instead of blood and monster puss stained walls, everything is covered in neon. But the RE vibe is definitely there. It's a fun game and I recommend it.","June 3, 2014","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, the plot this game contains is not particularly inspired, with "twists" that have little impact due to lack of significantly developed characters.  I never really felt connected to the protaganist, and everyone else in the game seemed to have more motivation than the protaganist, but these other characters were also pretty one-dimensional.  The only real upside is in the potential in this world, not necessarily in the plot that was written for it.\n\nSettings: The environments the game presents also feel farily limited.  You visit about 3 distinct environments: Rich District; Prison; and of course, the obligatory sewer section (you ever notice EVERY game has one).  And then, you essentially revisit these areas once more.  On the upside, the environments look nice and feel distinct.\n\nGameplay: The combat is also a mixed bag.  The idea behind the combat mechanics of customizing whether attacks are powerful, heal, or reduce cooldown time on special moves is pretty nice.  On the other hand, the combat itself feels stiff and offbalance.  It took a while to find the right rythm the game was playing at.  I noticed that one day, I was REALLY bad at the combat, but then overnight I suddenly had it down pat.  Overall, not the worst combat system I've played, but not the best either, B-.\nThe running, jumping, climbing bits are mediocre.  They aren't challenging, and they don't really offer much in the way of views.  On the other hand, I didn't really have any instances where I felt ripped off, and they were pretty fair about the secrets.\nCollect-a-thon items are not paricularly difficult to spot, the game even points out a fair number of them.  They also offer a fair challenge in exploring, finding, and collecting them, and I felt that none of them were too difficult to get.  On the downside, the game does not checkpoint when a collectible is picked up.  So if you pick one up and then die, you better go back and get or it.\n\nBugs/Glitches: For how unpolished certain aspects of the game were, it was actaully a remarkable stable game.  I only encountered 2 instances of glitches: one where a door would not open (easy to bypass with a checkpoint restart) and one where an enemy got stuck in another enemy's shield.  Additionally, I never had an instance where the game crashed, kind of a miracle considering I can't even think of another game with the same record.  Though I suppose it is dependent on the machine running the program, so take this statement with a grain of salt.  The only other issue I would place under this category would be the unfavorable camera, that just needs a little more work.\n\nAchievements:  A fairly well rounded set.  Some story based ones, a few collect-a-thon ones, a couple of grinding ones, and some that actually affect your gameplay.  If you can manage to remember most of them, it feels like it is possible to get most of them in one playthrough (neglecting one grinding based achievement in particular).  As you can tell by my playtime, it doesn't even take long to get most of them.  Not too easy, not too difficult, and actually fairly entertaining.\n\nA Metacritc score of 65/100 seems a little harsh, I would give it somewhere in the range of 70 to 75.  I'm recommending it because while I played it, it was fun.  But, I would recommend the Batman Arkham series or Price of Persia over this game.  Not great, but not bad either.","December 15, 2014","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspiegamer/recommended/228300/","aspiegamer","AspieGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspiegamer/","91 products in account","Remember Me never quite meets it's full potential but it's still a robust experience overall.\nFor starters, it's one of the most visually striking games I've ever played. The graphics and art direction are absolutely phenomenal. I'd almost solely recommend this game on the strength of it's visuals, it's that good.\nThe game has a very uneven story though it's bursting with originality. The writing is smart enough to ask to right kind of questions and there are some truly memorable moments in the 9 chapters that comprise the story.\nNilin, who already stands out from most video game protagonists by being a woman of colour, is written with the right balance of emotion and toughness. She feels vulnerable but is always capable of getting the job done. In between each chapter Nilin monologues about what's she done and how she feels; there are some genuinely interesting moments of pathos for her that flesh out her personality. She's much more interesting that other characters in these types of games such as Kratos or Dante.\nRemember Me's biggest fault is the gameplay. This is a character action game with a total of 5 combos. Changing what your combos do is a good idea in theory and having multiple enemy types helps but it doesn't change that you essentially are pushing the same combination of buttons for the entire game. This is going to be a problem for many people, especially if you're looking for a challenging experience. The combat doesn't nearly have as much depth as competing games in the same genre.\nIf you're new to the action genre, or you want an adequate action game with a good story, then I recommend Remember Me. If you want a highly polished action game, look elsewhere.","November 7, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In it's genre, I would even say it's the best.\nThe graphics are alright. The gameplay may sometimes be repetitive, but still fun as hell because it's a slasher and murdering hordes of enemies with majestic (and they are) combos just can't be boring. Speaking of combos, you can build your own, which I don't think I've ever seen in any game before.\nBefore the release, they promoted this memory manipulation feature, and some people might have been fooled by it. There are only several times when you do that. And it's not gameplay, it's story. It's extremely linear. It's not bad, just not that I thought it would be.\nSpeaking of story, it was awesome. Several nice plot twists and interesting characters. Especially the protagonist.\nOST also fits fights perfectly with all the glitchy stuff.\nSo, yes, it is really good.

Trailers seemed awesome so, *click, buy*. When you enter the game you are immediatly immersed with backstory and introduced to the main character, Nilin. While i won't spoil any of the storyline, I'll overview the general way in which things were layed out. The story is all about discovering Nilin's past while rebelling against the forces controlling Neo-Paris. Where she is, why she is here, what happened to get her in this situation?\n\nStoryline/Entertainment/Gameplay:\nThis game, to me atleast, is much more a story with interact-able content than a point-and-click adventure. Im not saying that the game was intense on cut-scenes (it wasn't, but ill address this later), but more that each episode of the game is linear (not open world) and would lock doors behind you, preventing exploration backwards in the level. There was never a moment where I was bored during this playthrough, enjoying every little event which happened. Every turn was new and new gameplay mechanics were added continually as you progressed. Although when some mechanics are added, there is no tutorial. So you have to work it out on the fly. The story is spread out along 7 or so episodes, each progressing on the previous to tell the story of the rapidly-evolving state of Neo-Paris and Nilin.\n\nCombat:\nTo be blunt, I felt the combat was clunky, but innovative. You're rewarded for doing combos by getting a rockin' soundtrack playing in the background. This however is taken away when you take just one hit. Combos are built off of 'nodes' and vary in effect. The first punch/kick is standard and then after that, the combo combinations can either be healing, damage, recharge (of special attacks), or link/extend (boosts effects of previous node). The farther in each combo a node is placed, the stronger effect it is. These nodes can be changed at anytime in or out of combat, allowing for a strong damage combo to instantly be changed out for one that heals if you are low on health, or recharge if you need a special attack and quick! Fighting sequences were well spread and bosses were unique, but each was defeated in similar mannor. Attack when boss is idle, dodge when attacking, and do a quicktime event-like sequence for the final blow. Combat, i feel, could have been removed or re-vamped, but the change in pace from story to combat is pleasant and added to the storyline of the game.\n\nEnvironment:\nAll the scenery and graphics were absolutely stunning. I took a few screenshots at key points which really show the beauty of this game. Because of this, it was a bit laggy at times, but i attribute that more to my computer being on the low-end, spec wise, not the game. Each map/area had little areas which could be explored, pick-ups which increase stats, and pacs which give even more backstory to this immersive game.\n\nControls:\nNot much to say for controls. At times, I couldn't hit keys at the right time, but its much more a personal thing then key-mapping. I didn't encounter too many issues otherwise, nothing which was immersion-breaking.\n\nReplayability:\nSince this game is linear and follows the same storyline each time (to the best of my knowledge), there is no point to re-play the game unless a period of time has past and you want to re-live the story, or to 100% the game by finding all the little story pacs and power-ups.","January 18, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It  is certainly a bold game. It has very ambitious elements in all directions, from story to the gameplay. But they are not very well implemented, putting the game in an position between average and good in a relative (to the player) matter.\n\nGameplay can be define in one word: simple. Button-mashing and easy platforming, full linear. Game gets most of its critism from this simple gameplay. However...\n\nSetting is unique. This is somekind of a cyberpunk game. But the focus is on the augmented reality via memory alteration and the glimplse of the world that we see is a rough dystopia rather than the embraced thrill of a cyberpunk.\n\nThe game reminded me Omikron and the anime serie Ergo Proxy in some ways (through some atmospheric elements). It is a shame that we see very little of Neo Paris. What a wonderfull game this should be if it were an open world sci-fi.\n\nI know there are people who would neglect the simple gameplay for a unique sci-fi/cyberpunk setting. If you are so, then I recommend the game. Grab it on a sale and you won't regret. Game deserves a solid 7/10, and thanks to its interesting setting, you will "remember" the game.\n\nNote: You should play this game with a gamepad controller.","December 21, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its now been several months, so I assume that any problems have been patched. So far I have not encountered any technical issues. Will update if I do.\n\nWhat do I think? I think its an awesome game and a worthy successor to Deus Ex. Judging by the start only, its almost better than that lackluster sequel we had few years back. The story has a very strong French distopian feel to it, that only the first Deus Ex pulled off.  The maps are gorgeous to look at, but limited and linear..."game-like" not open world, but still very  effective.  More than good enough. If Splinter Cell can do it, why not this game?\n\nSo why was everyone hating on it?  Probably has something to do with the fighting system. to be perfectly clear, I hate all button mashing fighting games.  Memorizing X Y X X, block, jump x is not my idea of fun. you may disagree.  The recent batman games looked amazing, but I hated that fight system. didn't stop everyone from praising those games! So why the hate here?  I don't know, feels the same to me. I'm probably missing some mind-blowing nuance that a fan boy reading this may point out to me.  I just set the game on easiest difficulty and enjoyed the story.\n\nAnd that is my final point, its a slick and beautiful to look at story experience. all the negative reviews have tanked the price, so especially on sale you can probably get it for song.   I would recommend it to any fan of futuristic sci-fi.\n\n","May 24, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has good graphics and the controls are good.\nYou are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.\n\nThe fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.\n\nA combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These "kinds" are things like "concentrate on damage", "heal yourself", "gather points for your other special attacks" or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.\n\nThe farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get.\nImagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss.\nYou can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.\n\nThe fights are fun. There is no but to this.\n\nThe moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good.\nYou can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time.\nSo one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible. The fight is over, you can climb there without problems. Two spots look the same, but the one is the "right" way, so to one you can do an incredible cool jump, to the other not, you die. That can be very frustrating.\n\nIf you are used to the open worlds from Assassin's Creed then you should start the game with a VERY open mind, because it is really NOT like Assassin's Creed, even if the fighting and the moving are a bit like it.\n\nThe story is ok or even good, not sure, it was good enough to keep me playing.\n\nIf you get the game for non-full price, yes, try it, it might be your new favourite.\nBut it might be you get bored after 10 minutes.\n\nThis game was not half as good as I expected because of the vidoes and reviews.\n\nBut still, it was fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acantophis3rd/recommended/228300/","acantophis3rd","Acantophis3rD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acantophis3rd/","133 products in account","This one is a hard recommendation. For all the things Remember Me does right, so many others it does wrong. I try to explain following my experience the first time I started the game up to the last second in which I unlocked all achievments for it and deleted it from my harddrive. So here it goes:\n\n==Story==\nAt first I was confused. I played, things got explained to me, I didn't really care. Something about evil cooperations, and memory hunters of which our lead chracter is part of. We're playing Nilin, who lost her memories and gets guided to her rescue through some dude called Edge before the evil cooperation could delete the rest of her memories. The game is divided into episodes and with each episode we try to help Nilin remember more of her memory and in the end trying to stop the evil cooperation. It's a well written story but it unfolds very slowly and uninteresting. The stories high-point are the interactive memory remixes. As a memory hunter Nilin lets the player break into someone elses memory and alter it to his liking, thus changing persons attitude forwards certain events in the past, affecting the future. Cutscenes in this game can't be skipped.\n\n==Gameplay / Combat==\nThe gameplay is your typical modern 3rd-person action game. There are linear corridors, climbing sections and arenas in which the Batman-like combat takes places. Combat is fast & fluid. The game allows you to customize from 3 to 8 hit long combo-chains that unlock over time.\n\nThe chains can be filled & customized through added presens. There are power presens and even presens that heal Nilin when she strikes. Later special abilities are introduced as well, so called S-presens. S-presens allow to stun enemies, manipulate robot foes, making your invisible for a short time to strike hard etc. Special Abilities have a cooldown. The cooldown can be reduced by adding cooldown reducing presens to your combo chains. There are also multiplier that can be added to the chains. These double the effect of previous presens in the combo chain. In the middle of a combo Nilin can dodge attack enemies and continue her combo. It sounds like a neat idea and it is IF combos wouldn't break each time Nilin strikes a different foe as the one she started the combo at. This can be very frustrating and it is and would explain why people think the combat is bad. But I enjoyed it due the possibility to change my combos accordingly to the enemies I was facing.\n\n==Visuals & Sound==\nThe game looks gorgeous on highest setting. The only problem I encountered with the game is the constant studder due to Unreal3's texture streaming. There are certain ways to reduce or get rid of the studder on most systems. The soundtrack is a weird mix of electronic noises. The idea behind the music is that during combat a beat is played and each time a combo breaks or Nilin gets hit my an enemy the beat breaks too. But then there are instances in which overly epic music is played too loud that doesnt really fit with the shown scenes.\n\n==Replay Value==\nI mentioned that cutscenes can't be skipped. It's tedious to replay certain chapters to collect missing collectibles or to reach a certain point or fight that requires certain actions to unlock missing achievments. Having a collectible / achievment guide by your side comes in very handy. On the plus side: Once you finished the game Nilin will keep all her unlocked abilities and presens (even thouh abilities can only be used from the point onward in which they are unlocked during the story).\n\n==Conclusion==\nSo why do I recomment the game? It's a short game delivering an well written and interesting story. It takes time to get used to the combat but once combos & presens are fully unlocked someone can have a blast with it. Achievment Hunters can also get their fair share of fun since It's easy to unlock those. But after you have done all that is to do in the game there is no big motivation to return to it.

The game takes place in Neo-Paris in 2084, and it looks beautiful. The way the areas are designed, and how the game progresses is great. The story is also amazing, dealing with memories and how they are bought and sold and shared between people and used as currency. It's very deep and the story around Nilin is very, very interesting.\n\nThe combat is also pretty great. You get to customize your combos using 'pressens'. Having multiple types of pressens that can improve your damage, heal, reduce the cooldown of your s-pressens, e.t.c.. You can make your combo's look pretty awesome or just plain silly, but it's pretty unique in it's own way.\n\nAlso, seeing as this is a PC port it has been done really well. The PC controls with mouse and keyboard are really great minus the fact the s-pressen menu (q) is pretty buggy at times. I totally recomment mouse and keyboard over using a gamepad for this beat em up game.","January 1, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is absolutely stunning even on lower graphics settings, with a gorgeous cyberpunk setting and beautiful (if very, very linear) environment, and has an interesting story and compelling main character that made me want to play it all the way through. It also has a terrific soundtrack.\n\nAll of that said, the gameplay gets difficult and tedious quite early on. Combat simply takes too long and is too predictable for it to be really fun, especially during boss fights where missing a single quick-time event (which flash up extremely quickly) will force you to get that last bit of health down again (and again). I feel like a simple counter button would have helped speed things along a lot, given that the only way to avoid attacks without it is dodging (pretty much always breaking your combo).\n\nOther minor complaints I have would be the fiddly, fiddly controls during the remix sequences (otherwise a very neat and interesting addition), and some of the dialogue writing - it often sounds very false and purple-prose-ish, particularly whenever Edge is on the line. I don't find that it detracts overly from the story, it's just a little jarring at times.\n\nLike I said, Remember Me is still a good game, and I would recommend it if you're looking for a interesting story and a great main character (how many non-white female protagonists do we get in video games at the moment?). I definitely also recommend, however, waiting for a good sale, and preparing for a few rage quit moments along the way.","December 23, 2013","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It falls on the "full of potential yet average" category. On the pure aesthetic aspect its simply gorgeous, creative and original. The story despite its slow beginning manages to be excellent once you reach the second half of the game. Its well written with the collaboration of one of the best French sci-fi authors of this generation making it an overall great experience. A great plus is that it has a female main character that does manages to not fall into the usual tropes, which is great.\n\nThe main theme of the game is memory and the possibility of a technology able to manipulate and change it. It articulates with society issues and personal traumas of the characters asking a few interesting questions like how far we can go to be able forget the pain and suffering in our lives. Indeed, there's a few great puzzle sequences where you'll have the “remix” people's memories in order to achieve your goals. As strange it may sound its actually done in a fairly interesting fashion, giving a lot of depth to the characters.\n\n\nNow about the gameplay :\nThe platforming in this game is unchallenging and requires nothing than just a bit of attention, making it a tedious process and the few puzzles and actions you'll progressively unlock barely improves anything.\n\nOn the combat side, it starts off with a lot of good ideas. The fact you can create your own combos in the beat'em all style of gameplay sounds wonderful on the paper, but in reality you'll have only five rigid sets of combos and you are only allowed to customize their effects. The combat mechanics actually rely more on using a handful of powerful powers once your combo bar is full. However there's quite some depth to this system and it even allows you to be creative have a lot of  fun once you've unlocked everything, alas this happens way too late. My overall feeling is that Remember Me would have been a better as an action RPG rather than a beat'em all.\n\nMy main problem with the game is that despite its good ideas and good pacing, it takes just too much time to fully show how good its story is and to unlock all the fun elements to make its combat interesting. The whole experience feels like a lengthy tutorial full of potential, that ends way too quickly after approximatively 10 hours.\n\nHopefully, Remember Me 2 is already in the works, lets hope that this time the developers will actually achieve their vision to make a great game.\n\nTechnical info : This game is a console port but like most recent Capcom titles its works great. However the default camera is annoying as hell. You can easly improve that by using a tweak posted on the steam forums to change the FOV.\n","February 5, 2014","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only thing this game really missed on was the combat.\n\nThat's not to say that the combat isn't good... it just doesn't... feel good after a while. The game's method of increasing difficulty ends up throwing more and more baddies at you in a never ending stream of punching bags. The boss fights are also something of a bore. Most of them consist of 'Use DOS, proceed to win'.\nThe, well, spamminess of the spammer is also a little dull on the last few boss fights (there's a prompt that actually reads 'SPAM').\nThere's also some wierd camera shifts while on the platforming bits of the game, and sometimes the controls shifted in wonky directions, resulting in a few frustrating deaths.\n\nProbably the biggest letdown of this game is the lack of actual memory rewriting you do in the story line. This part of the game comes in relatively early, but then you spend a good couple hours before coming upon your next 'victim'. In total there were maybe 4 instances where your character did what your character was supposed to be known for doing. Rewriting memories should have taken a bigger role in the actual gameplay outside of the few times it was used after boss battles.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, this game is amazing. It's a shame so few people have heard of/played it.\n\n9/10 would play again. I'll probably end up buying this game as a gift for my friends when the holidays roll around this year.","February 11, 2014","true","26.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story, setting and visual quality of the game go a long way to help it stand out from other titles, helping it cement an identity as a promising new IP. Sadly, the game is also held back by an underdeveloped combat system, often frustrating enemies, and one of the most linear beat-em-up experiences of recent memory. Saying this, there is some fun to be had out of Remember Me. Combat can occasionally be fun, especially when trying out new combos and S-Pressens, and boss encounters are particularly memorable and well designed. With all that’s been said, Remember Me just doesn’t live up to its potential. A setting and story this good deserves to be expanded upon in bigger, more ambitious games.

First impressions are very good. The artdesign, various landmarks in Paris, all affected by this futuristic setting, is incredible, accompanied by a fantastic musical score that combines orchestral instruments with digitized effects. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2nZCIJpLRM If theres one award Remember Me deserved in 2013 it's definitely Best Soundtrack.\n\nSince the world of Neo-Paris has banished firearms, the game evolves around punching dudes and avoiding getting punched. It is very reminiscent of God Hand on the Playstation 2. You create your own combos and by executing them well you earn bonuses like reducing cooldowns on your skills or healing yourself. In theory nice, but it is sadly very poorly executed. While in the early stages of the game the combat is kinda fun and has a good pace to it, especially towards the later parts of the game they throw way too many enemies at you. The lockon system is not very good so you end up hitting the wrong guy a lot and disrupting your combo. In the last third a lot of new enemy types are introduced that are very anti-fun and make the combat boring and tedious.\n\nI really liked the various ways the theme of amnesia is implemented into the game, not just music and fighting, for example they make you memorize screenshots of locations where collectibles can be found minutes before you actually get to that spot. The "memory remixing" minigames are really well done and even serve as narrative platforms, I wish there would have been more though.\n\nI still recommend Remember Me for its very interesting world. The story carries it a lot too, albeit some poor voice acting and dialogue it convinces with a strong beginning and a memorable ending. It's a shame that the gameplay is forgettable.","January 5, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is nothing short of amazing, as you take on the role of female protagonist, Nilin, in the year 2084 Neo-Paris.  She is a memory hunter, and the game starts with her imprisoned in the Bastille fortress, and the mega corporation Memorize, who has basically taken over the entire population's memories, is erasing her memories.  An underground resistance movement, known as the Errorists, breaks her out and their leader, named Edge, helps Nilin escape before they can erase all of her memory.  So, she starts off with a form of amnesia, which is fairly common in a lot of games, but this is one of the better adaptations, imho.\n\nSadly, I can't explain too much of the game, because it would start spoiling the game.  I've seen some denounce the gameplay as repetitive and boring, but I find it fun and exhilarating, trying to figure out on the fly what disciplines I need to put my powers into, because you can reconfigure them even in the middle of a fight to fine tune whether you're regaining willpower, health, or doing extra damage...or a combination of two or three of them.  It can get a little confusing at times, but it's fairly easy to master.  I feel like if I can do it, then most people won't have any trouble.\n\nThen there are the Memory Remix segments.  The parts of the game that make it so unique and intriguing.  They are puzzles of an event that you have to watch and then figure out how interact with certain parts of the memory to find out the right combination to "unlock" your goal.  And that's just fun as you rewind and fast forward a segment of time and finally get all the pieces to fall into place.  It reminds me of the Batman Arkham Origins crime scene review mechanic, only Remember Me's take on it is waaaay better.\n\nThe platforming segments remind me a bit of Prince of Persia (some of the more recent ones), with similarities to how it worked in Tomb Raider (recent ones, including the 2013 reboot too).  Just fun and interesting to play.  I give it an 85/100 and that's saying something for this little known developer (DONTNOD) that might be going out of business due to lackluster sales.

It was, after all, a stand-alone game - a new IP, too - from Ubisoft, who, it can be argued, reigns as the King of Sequels and Tie-Ins. The reviews for the game were mostly positive, but largely unremarkable, and Remember Me had flown under my radar until the last few months of the year.\n\nAfter having flown through the game, unable to put down the controller for more than an hour or two, I can say this about the game: Remember Me is one of the most unapologetically beautiful, engaging and emotional games that I've ever had the privledge of playing.\n\nEverything about the game shines with a blinding light - the storytelling is top-notch, the environments feel real and immersive, the characters are interesting and emotive, and the music is bizarrely beautiful in its fusion of glitch drops, synthesizers, and orchestra. The gameplay is interestingly engaging, combining elements of the run-of-the-mill platformer with the action-soaked sequences expected from combat-heavy blockbusters like God of War, complete with satisfying QTE events that allow Nilin to dole out special attacks.\n\nThe combat within the game is easy to pick up, and not difficult to master - by the middle of the game, you'll be dodging nearly every attack (if not every attack). And yet Remember Me's "Combo Lab" feature, which allows the player to customize both the moves and effects of the combos Nilin performs, keeps the action interesting in spite of the system's ease of use. The enemies, too, are diverse enough to keep Nilin and the player on their toes, with new enemies being introduced even in the last chapter of the game.\n\nThe story itself is mindboggling and supremely interesting, presenting a dark, forboding world that we may well be heading into. In a world full of speculative science ficiton, Remember Me's storyline takes an old concept of the monetezation of human memory (thanks William Gibson) and brings it down to a more personal level; though the story initially places the player within the grand scheme of the "Errorist Revolution," as it progresses it focuses more and more on the player character, Nilin.\n\nNilin herself is a fantastically realized character: she is emotive and introspective, and displays her thoughts eloquently in brief soliloquies between chapters. A strong female character, she is neither oversexualized nor depicted as dependent on any other force but her own strength of will and a desire to rebuild her lost memories. Her journey through the game is emotional and engaging, with the game's finale ultimately culminating in a sequence of self-realizations that can be easily translated back onto the player him- or herself.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.","January 3, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The camera is a bit too close at times but no deal breaker and I'd like to see more of an Assassin's Creed style parkour while navigating the world.","January 3, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its now been several months, so I assume that any problems have been patched. So far I have not encountered any technical issues. Will update if I do.\n\nWhat do I think? I think its an awesome game and a worthy successor to Deus Ex. Judging by the start only, its almost better than that lackluster sequel we had few years back. The story has a very strong French distopian feel to it, that only the first Deus Ex pulled off.  The maps are gorgeous to look at, but limited and linear..."game-like" not open world, but still very  effective.  More than good enough. If Splinter Cell can do it, why not this game?\n\nSo why was everyone hating on it?  Probably has something to do with the fighting system. to be perfectly clear, I hate all button mashing fighting games.  Memorizing X Y X X, block, jump x is not my idea of fun. you may disagree.  The recent batman games looked amazing, but I hated that fight system. didn't stop everyone from praising those games! So why the hate here?  I don't know, feels the same to me. I'm probably missing some mind-blowing nuance that a fan boy reading this may point out to me.  I just set the game on easiest difficulty and enjoyed the story.\n\nAnd that is my final point, its a slick and beautiful to look at story experience. all the negative reviews have tanked the price, so especially on sale you can probably get it for song.

Apparently, publishers thought that because most gamers are male, they wouldn't want to play as the opposite gender (uhh, Tomb Raider series?) and would feel awkward watching "themselves" if there were love scenes involved.\nNow Capcom has added the title to their range of games. All is still not perfect - from what I heard, they still meddled by asking for a planned love story to be removed. And as a woman, I cannot help but notice what form-fitting clothing the main character is wearing. But well.\nThe story plays in late 21st century Neo-Paris where 99% of society have the "Sensen", a brain implant that allows to share and erase memories. Traumatic events can now be made forgotten, lovers can gain a greater understanding for each other by experiencing their partner's life, entertainment consists in downloading pleasant memories for cash. We start into the game as Nilin, a young woman waking up in La Bastille while her memory is being erased. Without any idea who she is, she is helped to escape by a mysterious figure and soon learns that she was a memory hunter. Memory hunters steal important memories from others, but Nilin could do more: She could remix memories to make people believe key events in their past played out differently. Now, she must find out more about who she is and soon notices the many downsides to the Sensen technology that has transformed society. She is at a focal point of it all and could well change everything ...\n\nGameplay-wise, "Remember Me" borrows from other games, but it works well enough. There is a lot of hands-on combat that clearly took its inspiration from "Batman: Arkham Asylum", and I heard that Nilin's wall-climbing antics are similar to"Prince of Persia" - no idea, haven't played it. The combat system adds the use of special punch/kick combos that can score a lot of damage, refill Nilin's health or her energy bar for special moves or multiply the the aforementioned effects. It's a new idea for once, although I never really had to use the highest combination and only had to start thinking about combinations around the second half of the game. Admittedly it was a bit confusing at first, and that they named things here so weirdly - Pressen, S-Pressen, PMP, Sensen DOS etc. - wasn't helping.\nOver the course of events, Nilin will also steal memories to help her access places and - cool idea - remix memories. Those latter segments allow for some fun experimentation: We see an event happen, then can rewind it and change various details, then see how the course of events is changed. While there is only one combination that will lead to the goal, the element of discovery here is also interesting.\n\nFor me, the game was a mix of fun and frustration. Fun when things ran smoothly and the story rolled on, frustration at sometimes having to learn things by heart, like e.g. where to run while a helicopter's firing at you or, worst of it, the quick-time events at the end of a boss fight. Imagine already having drained the boss' energy to the lowest level, only having to finish things off, and then you're required to look intensely at the screen, waiting for several symbols (punch, kick, use, jump) in a row to flash up and quickly hit the key. You didn't see them clearly enough or weren't fast enough? Tough luck, back into the fight it goes. Bite marks on the keyboard may ensue.\n\nOverall, it's a solid experience with lovingly detailed graphics and a game I'd recommend. Not perfect, but something that's still fun to play.","July 6, 2013","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The gameplay is very linear (except for occasional detours for achievements) but that doesn't matter much due to the strong story. The game is a nice mix of stealth, combat and puzzle set in a dystopian cyberpunk future. The fights use a simple but effective combo system that is far less clumsy than e.g. Batman Arkham A/C (you don't need two dozen different key/button combinations but combat still feels satisfying). Atmosphere is very good, the story is compelling and the game in general is very entertaining.\n\nThe biggest complaint is that the cut-scenes cannot be skipped. This is a real pain because the game uses a save point system (which is again better than e.g. Batman because it also saves during stages of long boss fights, and in general quite often) and allows you only to replay whole chapters later. Unfortuantely each chapter begins with quite a long cut-scene and this becomes annoying fast when replaying the game for achievement hunts.","December 14, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has good graphics and the controls are good.\nYou are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.\n\nThe fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.\n\nA combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These "kinds" are things like "concentrate on damage", "heal yourself", "gather points for your other special attacks" or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.\n\nThe farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get.\nImagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss.\nYou can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.\n\nThe fights are fun. There is no but to this.\n\nThe moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good.\nYou can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time.\nSo one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible. The fight is over, you can climb there without problems. Two spots look the same, but the one is the "right" way, so to one you can do an incredible cool jump, to the other not, you die. That can be very frustrating.\n\nIf you are used to the open worlds from Assassin's Creed then you should start the game with a VERY open mind, because it is really NOT like Assassin's Creed, even if the fighting and the moving are a bit like it.\n\nThe story is ok or even good, not sure, it was good enough to keep me playing.\n\nIf you get the game for non-full price, yes, try it, it might be your new favourite.\nBut it might be you get bored after 10 minutes.\n\nThis game was not half as good as I expected because of the vidoes and reviews.\n\nBut still, it was fun. I'd give it a 6.5 / 10. Meaning, it is better than average, but not one of the "you must have played it" games.","July 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Combat seems rough at first but over time you realize how genius it is. Combo's become more than just button combinations, they become tactical. With certain combo buttons healing you, other doing extra damage and other granting cool-down on you special moves (S-Pressens) it becomes tactical to decide which combo to do next and how you want to build them. The game gives you many many questions and doesn't answer most of them until near the end. If I had to compare this to another game I'd call it a Character Action Deus Ex basically. The Cyber-Punk architecture layered throughout future Paris is woven together with the ancient structures of the past in a way that is beautiful. The main character is fantastically written as she doesn't just follow orders without thinking about the consequences but in the end she must follow them in order to regain her memories.\n\n9.5/10","November 16, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Apparently, publishers thought that because most gamers are male, they wouldn't want to play as the opposite gender (uhh, Tomb Raider series?) and would feel awkward watching "themselves" if there were love scenes involved.\nNow Capcom has added the title to their range of games. All is still not perfect - from what I heard, they still meddled by asking for a planned love story to be removed. And as a woman, I cannot help but notice what form-fitting clothing the main character is wearing. But well.\nThe story plays in late 21st century Neo-Paris where 99% of society have the "Sensen", a brain implant that allows to share and erase memories. Traumatic events can now be made forgotten, lovers can gain a greater understanding for each other by experiencing their partner's life, entertainment consists in downloading pleasant memories for cash. We start into the game as Nilin, a young woman waking up in La Bastille while her memory is being erased. Without any idea who she is, she is helped to escape by a mysterious figure and soon learns that she was a memory hunter. Memory hunters steal important memories from others, but Nilin could do more: She could remix memories to make people believe key events in their past played out differently. Now, she must find out more about who she is and soon notices the many downsides to the Sensen technology that has transformed society. She is at a focal point of it all and could well change everything ...\n\nGameplay-wise, "Remember Me" borrows from other games, but it works well enough. There is a lot of hands-on combat that clearly took its inspiration from "Batman: Arkham Asylum", and I heard that Nilin's wall-climbing antics are similar to"Prince of Persia" - no idea, haven't played it. The combat system adds the use of special punch/kick combos that can score a lot of damage, refill Nilin's health or her energy bar for special moves or multiply the the aforementioned effects. It's a new idea for once, although I never really had to use the highest combination and only had to start thinking about combinations around the second half of the game. Admittedly it was a bit confusing at first, and that they named things here so weirdly - Pressen, S-Pressen, PMP, Sensen DOS etc. - wasn't helping.\nOver the course of events, Nilin will also steal memories to help her access places and - cool idea - remix memories. Those latter segments allow for some fun experimentation: We see an event happen, then can rewind it and change various details, then see how the course of events is changed. While there is only one combination that will lead to the goal, the element of discovery here is also interesting.\n\nFor me, the game was a mix of fun and frustration. Fun when things ran smoothly and the story rolled on, frustration at sometimes having to learn things by heart, like e.g. where to run while a helicopter's firing at you or, worst of it, the quick-time events at the end of a boss fight. Imagine already having drained the boss' energy to the lowest level, only having to finish things off, and then you're required to look intensely at the screen, waiting for several symbols (punch, kick, use, jump) in a row to flash up and quickly hit the key. You didn't see them clearly enough or weren't fast enough? Tough luck, back into the fight it goes. Bite marks on the keyboard may ensue.\n\nOverall, it's a solid experience with lovingly detailed graphics and a game I'd recommend.

Remember Me is easily the most underrated game I have ever played. All the negative criticisms that initially turned me off about this game upon its release I found to be completely over exaggerated. I loved the stylized combat in this game. I played on the memory hunter difficulty level (which i recommend to play it at) and found the combat to be tacticle and fun. While yes it's not a hardcore game by any means, but it's far from being the lame, boring, and repetative experience that this game was unjustly labled as.\n\nAnother part of the gameplay that I liked was the memory remixing. Once again this was another big criticism, as reviewers didn't think it was a big enough part of the game. I personally think it was used perfectly, for if it was used more often it would then take away from the impact of your actions. Remixing someone's memories is a serious matter and the game does a great job of portraying this. This is further enhanced by Nilin's narations in between episodes.\n\nThis is truely an amazing and unique game, unlike anything I have played before. The story is great from begining to end and the world it takes place in is just as amazing. Varied set pieces will take you all around the diffrerent unique settings of Neo-Paris. Each as interesting as the last.\n\nI regret putting this game off for so long because of all the negative criticism it got at launch. This game is well worth your time and money. I would not have been disappointed at all spending full retail on this game, yet alone the $30 current price tag.  Getting this game on sale was an absolute steal, one of the most interesting and unique games I've played in a long time. If you're at all  interested in this game do not hesitate to pick it up when you get the chance, you wont regret it.","February 10","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is very linear (except for occasional detours for achievements) but that doesn't matter much due to the strong story. The game is a nice mix of stealth, combat and puzzle set in a dystopian cyberpunk future. The fights use a simple but effective combo system that is far less clumsy than e.g. Batman Arkham A/C (you don't need two dozen different key/button combinations but combat still feels satisfying). Atmosphere is very good, the story is compelling and the game in general is very entertaining.\n\nThe biggest complaint is that the cut-scenes cannot be skipped. This is a real pain because the game uses a save point system (which is again better than e.g. Batman because it also saves during stages of long boss fights, and in general quite often) and allows you only to replay whole chapters later. Unfortuantely each chapter begins with quite a long cut-scene and this becomes annoying fast when replaying the game for achievement hunts.","December 14, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Given the setting, more of the interesting\nstory details are told in memory packets scattered throughout the world for you to find.\n\nThere are moments in the game where you have to 'remix' someone's memory. You can rewind/fast forward\nthrough the memory changing certain things that will alter the outcome. These moments are cool but also\nannoying especially if you don't know what to change, you could be stuck for quite a while fiddling with\ndifferent things.\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe voice acting can be pretty bad at times\n\nCan't skip cut scenes\n\nConclusion\n\nA great game especially for its environments and setting but misses a lot in other areas. I would love to\nsee a sequel to iron out many of weaker aspects of the game.\n","April 4","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though it is completely on rails, it feels vast, like you're carving a natural path through a huge mega city.  It is also GORGEOUS.  Constantly.  I mean, it may not be the most technically advanced game out there, but it has world design on par with HL2's City 17.  Combat is button-mashing combo junk like Assassin's Creed or Shadows of Murder with annoying QTEs capping off boss fights, which is really the only disappointment the game presents (aside from very restrictive "platforming" segments filling out most of the game).  More pleasantly, maybe it's the agile woman protagonist in a French sci-fi setting, or maybe it's thematic parallels between memory access technology and photography, but I feel the spirit of Beyond Good & Evil in abundance here.  As a fairly enjoyable hop and skip through a fantastic dystopian future landscape, I would recommend it for the visuals alone.","December 8, 2014","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I tried both keyboard/mouse and gamepad but it doesn't work.\nEven in the easiest difficulty the fights are way too hard not because of the ennemies but because of the unresponsive controls. I tried changing the bindings see if a different key would work better but no it doesn't so it's clearly the game engine at fault.\nI'm stuck at one boss that I just can't pass because the only way to kill it is by aiming your special gun while moving and clicking to shoot at the same time and everytime the aiming button is not responsive so you press on it and nothing happen, you have to depress it and repress it to hopefully have it to work, but of course during that time you get hit...\nit's like this button would only work when the game allows it to in a way.\nAnd of course, getting rid of that boss is in 3 part and no checkpoint at the end of each part therefore if you die you have to start all over again and get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by those controls all over again.. till you are fed up with it and just give up.\nToo bad, I wanted to see where the story was going (even thoguh it was far from being very original) but won't be able to (unless I find a savegame that put me through that boss but then again I'd probably be stuck again a little while later)\nSo my best guess is to find a playthrough on Youtube...\nI'm glad I got it in a sale.\nWould be very upset if I paid full price. Now, I understand why the studio went bankrupt...\n\nIf you like the genre of action/platform with way too much fights and unresponsive controls, go ahead, otherwise you might want to try it out first.\n\nUPDATE: I finally managed to get through that boss fight thanks to some playthrough I found on Youtube. It seems to me that fight in particular really had a problem of lag with the Aiming button.\nThe lag is always present but less noticeable in other fights. Lol, the fight right next after the boss fight I got stuck too... as predicted I might say but I managed it after a few retries. I'm glad I am able to go through the story and the game but I will not change my recommendation (as it either yes or no) because those fights are way too repetitive and frustrating in my opinion.

If you play games for the gameplay, and not the story, you'll probably be disappointed. Ideas from other games abound. There's some climbing a la Assassin's Creed, but the path is always indicated - there's no exploration to find the best way up. There is one way to progress through each level, not multiple ways, like in Dishonored. The way some exploration mechanics play out may make you think there might be another path through the level, but there isn't. The combat mechanics are ripped straight out of the Batman Arkham series, though with a twist: instead of button mashing, you get to build and individualize your combos.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Well, high production values mean great graphics, sound design and some really great music (played by the Philharmonia Orchestra, no less). Lots of screenshot opportunities. The combat system, though derivative, is not a chore, and by the end I was having fun customizing my combos and taking enemies down in different ways. Puzzle solving to get through a level was consistently fun.\n\nThe story revolves around a search for identity. Memories have become digitizied and commodified; memory hunters (like the main character) can steal and manipulate memories to change others' perception of reality. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter whose memory has been almost completely wiped, but who escapes her captors and spends the rest of the game attempting to discover who she really is (with the help of her faithful assistant / boss, Edge). Though occasionally predictable, the story is told well, helped by good voice acting and tough, thoughtful writing. And the ending, if bittersweet, is very satisfying.  A key part to the concept of memory and motivation is the fun puzzle-system "the memory remix." You are presented with a memory and need to alter a sequence of events to change a character's memory of events - and their motivations in the story.  Memory Remixes are very cool, Inception-like sequences that occur multiple times (to the game's credit, it is not over-used). Easily one of the best parts of the game.\n\nRemember Me is a fun experience whose story and memory-manipulations just edge it towards the unique. And there are other games (like Alan Wake) whose progress is extraordinarily linear but still manage to tell a unique story via a fun experience. Pick it up on sale for six dollars, and prepare for a fun 8-10 hours.","September 21, 2014","true","35.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you don't like mashing left and right click several hundred times every few minutes, it will be very unpleasant.\n\nYou can customize your combos in limited ways. Performing the 2nd-8th maneuver in a combo can give you either bonus damage, health, or reduce the cooldown on your S-Pressins (special attacks).\nThe combos are as follows:\nPunch-Punch-Punch\nKick-Punch-Kick-Punch-Kick\nPunch-Kick-Kick-Punch-Kick-Kick\nKick-Kick-Kick-Punch-Punch-Punch-Punch-Kick\n\nYou will unlock a number of the Pressins (slotted combo pieces) as you progress through the game, and each one is restricted to kick or punch. So if you only have free 2 health punch Pressins, you cannot make anything more complex than the simple 3-punch combo.\n\nEach stage of the combo does progressively more of the perk (i.e. a step 5 health Pressin will give more HP than a step 3 one), but don't expect to regularly reach anything beyond the 5-combo, because you will get interrupted all the time. You have to hit a stun S-Pressin or have 1 enemy remaining to get a long combo to completion.\n\nSome of the combos can just be easy cheesy, like Punch-Health Punch-Chain Punch. Such a combo will give you significant more HP than you lose by attacking an enemy that damages you when you hit them.\nUsing a  6 combo of Punch-Cooldown Kick-Cooldown Kick-Cooldown Punch-Cooldown Kick-Chain Kick will allow you to completely remove the cooldown on the stun S-Pressin before it even wears off (you do have to perform it twice during the stun).\n\n\nThere is some serious platforming, but the camera will change to fixed locations when you do certain areas. This can make it hard to see the indicator that you can make a jump or whatnot because you're looking at a 2D indicator from the side. When in these fixed camera locations, when you turn a corner, the camera jumps to a new fixed location and it can be disorienting, as well as your character will keep going on inverted controls for a second (pressing A to go left, then the camera changes, you character will go right while holding A until you let up for a second).\n\n\nThe bosses LOVE to turtle. They will be unattackable unless you hit them with the stun S-Pressin, and will otherwise hurl explosives and minions at you endlessly until the stun S-Pressin comes off cooldown. Once you have managed to injure the boss to a critical state, the finishing move will be a Quick-Time Event. Failing the QTE will return them to non-critical health and you will be on cooldown for the stun again. A cooldown-heavy combo is highly suggested if you don't want to hear the boss repeat their lines for half an hour.\n\n\nRemixing memories is what we're all here for, and they're amazing how you can change little details to change a person's memory to a more favorable outcome for you. Unfortunately there are only 4 of these events, and pausing the memory on the glitches that you can interact with can be frustrating, as sometimes you have to hit the pause button before the "glitch here" icon appears onscreen.\n\n\nAll-in-all, a fun game to get on sale. Replayability would be pretty subjective to the player, but I would think it to be low unless you just want to get all the collectables, as the cutscenes are unskippable and the fights tedious.","October 23, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's combat is very Arkham-esque, and it's very counter-intuitive. Unlike the Arkham series it draws from, combos are pre-determined and have to be timed. This leads to a really stiff and unforgiving combat system.\n\nThe story itself is interesting at first, but it struggles to keep you engaged.

It's just "press button to do this specific remixing".\n\nThe parkour and platforming elements are pretty rough, in my opinion. They don't feel very fluid, and tend to be frustrating.\n\nI'd give this game a hard 5/10.

However, as the game begins, she is in the process of being memory-wiped herself, and with only the barest of memories still left, she manages to escape the facility she was being held in, and finds herself fighting for a cause she doubts, against people whose crimes she doesn't understand.\n\nThe laser-guided amnesia trope is played straight in this game, but well, since the game is about deleting and altering memories, it is actually justified. Speaking of which, part of the game revolves around altering people's memories to change their allegiances or motivations, with the other part taking place in the real world, focusing on exploration and combat. The memory remixes, as they are called, aren't always intuitive (you don't always know what consequences altering a single memory fragment may bring), but of course, that makes sense, since we don't always know the consequences of small actions in the real world either.\n\nWhen Nilin isn't rooting around in people's brain boxes, she makes her journey through Neo-Paris, a dystopian future city (aren't they all) with a massive gap between rich and poor, and an underground population of monstrous ghouls, cast-offs whose memories have been so vandalized and corrupted they have become nothing but deformed animals. Most of the time, Nilin makes her way to her objective by platforming, dangling off ledges and leaping from one handhold to the other, and while it can get frustrating to fall to one's death because of a wrong button press, thankfully the game creates lots of checkpoints, making the occasional mis-press not disastrous.\n\nDuring her journey, Nilin is often attacked by enemies, because of course she is. In combat, everything depends on how well you can string combinations together and which effects you've assigned to which button press. The combat system, despite being combo based, is relatively easy to get a hang of, because no matter which animation or attack Nilin performs, the timing of the button presses is always the same. The only thing that takes more work to master, and which is paramount in the later sections of the game, is to perform mid-combo dodges and continue the combo right after. Once you get this down, though, combat becomes fun and engaging, with only the camera movement eliciting the occasional frustrated grunt.\n\nCombat, however, isn't the main strength of the game, though. In DONTNOD tradition, the main focus is on the story, and Nilin's journey to understanding who she is has a profound effect on players who like to be immersed in a good story. There's the occasional cliché, and yes, also the occasional slightly predictable plot twists, but all this can be easily glossed over because of the fine voice acting (and this time not by the Usual Suspects, but by unknown actors) and the highly credible moral ambiguity the story brings. You'll often find yourself questioning Nilin and the people around her as they achieve their ends by very dubious means.\n\nThe Right of It\n\nAs mentioned, the story is Remember Me's strong point, as are the scenery and environments, which can be truly gorgeous at some points, and Olivier Derivière's music is memorable without stealing the attention. Combat can be fun, but also frustrating when you're still learning to Miracle Dodge. Once you get it down, though, most of the frustration is left behind, and you can enjoy stringing long, spectacular combos together. But, once again, this game is, in the first place, about story, and again, it's delivered very well. Haters of the Grizzled, Square-Jawed White Male Protagonist will rejoice.\n\nThe Wrong of It\n\nA few of the sequences in the game qualify as DIAS: Do It Again, Stupid!. There will be a few sections where the game makes you fail over and over again, with no negative consequence, until you 'get it right', using foreknowledge of where the pitfalls will be. The part where you have to flee from Captain Trace in his gunship in particular is an egregious DIAS offender. A few of the battles, mostly against bosses and mini-bosses, also incorporate quick-time events, and we know how much we all hate those. Botch the QTE, and the boss will resist your 'execution move', forcing you to do the last bit of the boss fight again. Well, at least it doesn't cause a game-over.\n\nAlso, 32 seconds of unskippable logos.\n\nThe End of It\n\nRemember Me may have its clunky bits, and I know it got a bad rap by 'professional' reviewers, but the actual user reviews don't lie. Yes, it's a console port, but you hardly ever notice that it is, although playing with a controller is highly recommended. It's worth the buy if you like the genre, or if you're a fan of a good story told through a video game. It suffers a bit from the games-as-movies syndrome, but Hell, if it's a good movie, I don't mind.","September 8, 2015","true","15.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Altough combat gets less and less exciting the further you progress, the impressive detail gone into the design of Neo-Paris and the storyline accompanying draws your attention away from the more minor flaws.\nPros:- Stunning visuals\n- Runs well on low spec CPUs\n- Interesting storylines\n- Memory remixing mechanic is well built\n- Customisable combos with different moves\n- Voice acting is not too bad\nCons:- Fighting is easy and reptitive\n- Little variation between enemies\n- Camera angles can be ambiguous\n- Controls while scaling walls are awkward\n- You can backflip away from enemies any time you like?\n- Very linear storyline\n- Arrows are constantly telling you where to go: all difficulty of finding your way is lost.\n\nMy favourite part of the game so far is being able to admire all the scenery and effort that has been put into the level desing - especially while climbing up pipes (you get some of the most amazing views while climbing up pipes on the sides of buildings). The tall, majestic buildings of the city and the deteriorating pits of the slums. I only wish fighting wasn't so easy. You can beat your way through several enemies very quickly by simply spamming the LMB and RMB keys. Even once you have defeated an enemy, if you keep clicking, Nilin will backflip straight to another enemy and continue fighting immediately. There is a very low level of difficulty between most enemies, the hardest being those that can disappear at will.\nOn the other hand, I do enjoy the fact that you can customise your combos with different moves, or "pressens". However this also can make fighting simple as there are pressens that can regenerate your health. As soon as you equip these very close to the beginning of a combo, any damage you happen to take has virtually no impact as you can just brush it off by beating up more enemies.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you enjoy games with very appealing graphics and games which aren't CPU intensive, this is the game for you. It has a good storyline, but fighting is too easy and repetitive.","December 29, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Seriously. I've purchased almost all of the recent games and given them each a few hours to win me over and none of them have done it. It's confusing to me because I really enjoy sprawling dramatic RPGs. I spent over 100 hours on the Fallout games and another 200 on the Mass Effect series. I think my problem is the fantasy setting; thees, thous, spells and swordplay never seem to resonate with me as much as the future (dystopian or otherwise).\n\nThat's how I found Remember Me. I was reading some of the forums posts about the recent port of Deus Ex: The Fall and someone recommended it instead. Thankfully it was also part of the Steam Sale.\n\nRemember Me takes place in the Sci-Fi Dystopian Future of 2084. We've figured out how to backup, restore and replay human memories. These memories can also be bought, sold, shared or stolen. You play Nilin who is a memory hunter in New Paris who has the ability to manipulate and "remix" memories. Oh and she doesn't remember her past!1! So yeah - dramatic political intrigue, conspiracy, etc. Fun stuff. No swords.\n\nThe city reminds me of Deus Ex except it is 3rd person and not gold tinted. It's really pretty beautiful. The gameplay is really reminiscent of the recent Batman Arkham games. There's a simple, but fun combo system interspersed with counter-attacks and some gadget weapons. I enjoyed the flow of fighting in the Batman games and this really scratched that itch. You can also customize your combos so that as they stack they'll do different things, such as do extra damage, refill your health or recharge your gadgets. For the most part it is really well done and has full controller support.\n\nI've played the game for about 6 hours and I've had two chances to "remix" memories and that mechanic is pretty fun to. Kind of reminds me of the crime-scene mechanic in Batman Arkham Origins. You can rewind and replay the memory to notice and interact with certain items. As you do so - that person's memory may change in ways that further the story. Fun stuff.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that Nilin is a cool main character. She's in good company among Jade (Beyond Good and Evil), April/Zoe (Longest Journey) or Kate Wilson (Hydrophobia). So far the story is interesting and the voice acting is good.\n\nThe two downsides for Remember Me are 1) it is only available for Windows and 2) the Steam Sale has ended so the game back up to $29.99.  Other than that I highly recommend this as an alternative to a game with swords or gold tint.","March 28, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The environments are beautifly detailed and complement the free running elements of this title, even if it can turn into a "look at the pretty skybox" stlye staright path a times. On the subject of free running, you might expect a free running brawler to include some moves that include jumping on your enemies from a higher point, but this is sadly not the case, despite some of your early enemies utilizing this exact tactic. Instead you, playing as asmall, skinny woman, must stand on the same level as larger, sometimes hulking, enemies. Of course the protagonist does this with great ease, you don't want to design a game to be too frustrating, after all. I'm not saying Nilin should be weak and helpless like so many other female characters in games, in fact, I think she maybe the best example of a female protagonist in a video game yet. That said, while I can imagine that anyone of her size who can run and jump all around the obstacles Nilin encounters just on her way to the local bar to have the endurance and speed to hold up in a fight, the boss fight against X-Mass Kid is a mahor breaking point of this logic.\nRegardless, the combat is simple, yet fun. Besides, the size difference isn't the biggest problem with the game, the problem is that Remember Me desperately wants to be a movie. I may have only just started episode 3 (something Valve can no longer use as an excuse), but a good chunk of the game, about 1/3 of my playtime, has been spent in cutseens, scripted sequences and "pretty skybox" segments. I know this might be the "no" moment for those considering playing this, but hold on just a second. It turns out that the story is really good, so the "want to be a movie" problem is very neglegable. Also, in my opinion, the exploration and combat parts (you know, the game part) of the game show up enough to keep the movie bits from overstaying their welcome.\nAll in all, this is a nice story with some fun, anarchist-cyberpunk brawler action. There are some flaws, as there are with any game, but nothing that can't be ignored when put next to the better elements.","November 12, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's much more on rails.","November 15, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnglishTeacherPlays/recommended/228300/","EnglishTeacherPlays","Mr. Jacobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnglishTeacherPlays/","414 products in account","So, this game has a solid dystopian Science Fiction premise, a likeable protagonist, reasonably varied enemies and a solid fighting system. Puzzles and platforming exist but are not extremely arduous.\n\nThe story is tol from the point of view of Nillin, who has a lot of interesting qualities. I really like that she reacts to situations in a reasonable manner. When she jumps down a flight of stairs she stumbles and cries out, because she just jumped down a flight of 10 stairs.\n\nGraphics are beautiful, the game runs great on my machine and is bug free. Controls are gernerally intuitive.\n\nThe most interesting idea in this game is the memory remixing. Altering people's memories to change the way they feel currently feels exactly like cheating. One of the first times you do it, an enemy becomes a friend. It is awesome.\n\nSometimes the fighting feels clunky, which I think is part of the design. Everytime you mess up her combos the music stops to let you know that you have messed up. This is great but it feels like her combos are more often messed up than not. I just came from playing Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and the combat there is much smoother.\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys Dystopian Science Fiction, or action games in general.\n\n7/10","November 14, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The remembrance mechanisms are well thought of and enjoyful.\nThe game also brings forth important questions, and (unlike some games) is not really afraid to try and answer.\n\nCons:\nHowever - the linearity of the game is obscene. Doors lock down and open to lead you in a straight line through the city.\nYour character can jump from ledge to ledge (assasins creed style / farcor style), but can't go over a 2 inch cardboard box on the floor.\nThe fights are a bit repetitive and there's not enough remembrance mini games (perhaps 5 throughout the game).\nI also have an issue with the fact that it's a future paris with robots and virtual reality, but there's only one gun in the entire city (and someone shoots himself with it). Only bots and gunships seem to have real guns.\n\nAnd lastly - at some point during the endgame, you get attacked by a horde which shouldn't really be there, isn't a real obstacle at that point (you finished a far harder horde 5 minutes before), and has no real point. That single fight scene really damaged the immersive experience that was a big part of the end game.\n\n\n","November 14, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/228300/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Before I get into the actual review for the game I'd like to place some comments that I think should've been in other reviews prior to me buying this game.\n\n1. If you're looking for a game where you really get to know all the characters and lore of the world, then this game is going to be a bit of a disappointment.\n\n2. This game is not open world and is relatively short.\n\n3. I believe other reviewers overhype it a little. I am NOT saying this is a bad game.\n\n4. This game is not worth full price. Wait for a 70% to 80% sale.\n\nBefore I continue I want to make clear that I am not smiting this game; nor will I make it sound like sci-fi Heaven. Remember Me is actually a hard game to place certain judgment. Like my comment said, you don't get to know any of the characters in depth except for the main character herself, Nillin. Neo Paris is definitely a work of art and it's torture to see how it looks in the background and knowing you will never explore it. But boy does it look beautiful. If you've played Mass Effect it would be most comparible with that series. The graphics in general is well done and detailed.\n\nThe story is where I believe other reviewers overhyped. You start off lying on the ground being wiped of nearly all of your memory and a strange man named 'Edge' speaks to you over the intercom you have telling you what to do to save yourself. It starts off really confusing which I actually prefer since it adds interest rather than 'Okay here's exactly who you are and here's your exact destiny and goal'. I realize I've said this for the third time now but a huge factor in a story for me is getting to know allies and enemies well which doesn't happen. To be honest, I sometimes wondered how this got an M rating. Most of the things your friends and enemies say are very childish and rather laughable and/or annoying.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't top of the line but it is unique. You can customize your combos to give you either health, reduce your special skills downtime or increase the effect of one of these elements with a chain move. While this is unique, this isn't the highlight of this game. The highlight is the memory remixing. As Nillin you have special technology to go into people's brains and rewrite their memories by changing details; changing their outlook on life entirely. You can also steal memories to use yourself or drain enemies of their memories completely and kill them.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is worth about $5-$8 dollars. There are aspects to it that I will definitely remember and I would recommend it on a hefty sale. To narrow it down, this is a combination of the combat style of the Batman Arkham games (minus the counters), the art style of Mass Effect, and the acrobatics of Uncharted and Tomb Raider (2013). If the developers made this an open world game with a much deeper background story and more content it would easily have been one of the greatest games ever released. If or when you play, you'll realize very quickly it had that potential.","September 12, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely beautiful story, beautiful setting and some interesting mechanics.   As the game starts, Nillin is completely amnesiac, so you know just as much of what's going on as she does.  It's hard to write a really positive review about this game when its strongest point is the story, so I'll move on to some of the other aspects of it.\n\nAside from the story, one of Remember Me's best points is the combat.  It's a free-flow, combo-based system reminiscent of the Arkham series, except that YOU choose the effect that the attacks have.  Extra damage, health regeneration, and a reduction in your special ability's recharge time (more on that in a minute) are the three choices you have, but in addition to that you can use a chain effect which mimics and magnifies the effect of your previous hit in the combo.  These can be changed mid-combat via a menu in the pause screen, to suit your needs in a particular fight.\n\nNillin gets a TON of character development, but most of the other characters you meet don't really get explored.  Early on you meet someone who is supposedly one of your closest friends, but he never appears again after Episode 3.  This is, understandably, Nillin's story, but the game could have done with a bit more character development.\n\nMy only other big complaint is with the climbing.  When you're first introduced to the climbing mechanics, it feels like a tutorial, but the training wheels never really come off.  It has the look of Assassin's Creed-style parkour, but it feels very restrictive and not at all fluid, in several cases almost to the point of immersion-breaking.  I think that if DONTNOD had put some more time into the climbing mechanics, it could have been better than it is.\n\nAll in all, weighing the bad with the good, I'd give this an 8.5/10.  The few issues I have with the gameplay aren't enough to really take away from the phenomenal story that this game has to offer, and I can honestly say that I was at the edge of my seat for a fair portion of it.","March 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even at full price this game is worth it compared to many AAA titles that are $60 plus.\n\nIt has an engaging story with likeable characters that you grow to care about and the voice acting is spot on.  The atmosphere in the game is really well done.  The game is set in a futuristic Paris where people's memories are a hot commodity and an evil company misuses their power to create a gap between rich and poor.  Overall I liked the story and it last about 7 hours (my gameplay time is higher because I alt+tabbed for a while).\n\nThis game would have benefited from being more open as the futuristic paris looked great, I just wish I could have explored it more.\n\nI've seen a lot of people complain about the fighting mechanics, I suspect this is because they couldn't get to grips with them because I really liked them.  You can devise your own combos adding in different elements to change what your attacks do.  You also get a select few "special" attacks which do different kinds of damage.  At the end of the story with them all unlocked you can really pull off some cool combos and techniques.\n\nUnfortunately the game has little replayability value given its very linear story, save for going back to collect things you missed.  Unless you're an achievement hunter though, I doubt you will do this.  There's not much to be gained.\n\nPros:\n- Strong female lead\n- Well written and voice acted\n- Interesting and at times philosophical story\n- Intriguing combat and cool combos\n- Great atmosphere and good graphics\n\nCons:\n- Quite short (7hrs, max)\n- Not much replayability","March 6, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The memory remapping is neat too once I figured out the controls(move the mouse in circles, dont just twist it :P ). Death, so far isnt frustrating, seems to be many checkpoints and no negatives to it. The only thing some people might not like is that it is not open world. There is a set path to follow, so dont expect freedom to explore like in Batman. There have also been instances where I want to spare someone, but it doesnt seem like I have a choice.

It felt like I was part of the future of humanity and although the game didn't have the best graphics, I felt it was good enough to pull me in and place me in this grim future where you play as Nilin, a Memory Hunter. The story was great and the atmosphere only added to it.\n\nCombat was kind of repetitive but they do continue to add new or stronger enemies throughout the entire playthrough of the game. Unlocking pressens, which are basically just extra moves in your combos, to combine with other pressens will allow you to customize the way you fight, but only to a degree. There are only 4 combos in the game but you are able to re-arrange or change how your combos work. One that will heal a great deal or do as most damage as possible. There are also 5 abilities you unlock throughout the game that can change the course of a battle entirely. Setting a bomb on the chest of an enemy or using an enemy mech to do damage for you.\n\nExploring is limited as it's quite a linear game, however there are collectables hidden throughout the game that you will only find if you actually try to find them. Some are hidden off the main path and not easy to see. Others are right in front of you.\n\nMemory Remixes allow Nilin to change how someone might behave in their life. Changing someones memory in order to change the way they feel about someone, or something that happened in their life will change the path they choose to follow in the game entirely. Although there are many different outcomes in each memory remix, you can ultimately only choose one to complete the remix.\n\nI played on Hard Mode and finished the game 10 and a half hours with 30/50 achievements. The game also offers a New Game+ where earning PMP to do your skills is much harder to get. At $49.99 I would hold off, however, I paid $33 for it and was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend anyone into Action games to give it a try.

He belongs to a group called the Errorists, people determined to cleanse a society that uses memories as a form of tradable commodity, and experiments with memory itself to produce a stable, segregated city. As you venture through the game, you come across the nightmares of such experimentation and ultimately begin to take part in the most fun aspect of the game --remixing memories of certain people you come across and changing elements of what they recall to get them to join your cause.\n\nIt's really hard for me to figure out the kind of game Remember Me is trying to be. It gives this rich and interesting world but confines you to a linear path. It develops a wealth of interesting characters, but such flat development that at times feels forced. It tries to put together a unique combat system, but with such simple mechanics, most matches devolve into acrobatic button mashing. The coolest element of the game, memory remixing, doesn't happen nearly enough for it to hold the game up on its own. The worst part about it is a certain amount of pretentiousness with how it knows it's an artsy, smart game. Still, the music and atmosphere are astounding, and I have to give credit where it's due --it's a damn good story.

After being commanded to follow a drone to a chair to complete the final process, a voice guides her on how to escape. The voice is that of Edge and he'll remain with you throughout the entire game as he instructs Nilin from each objective while Nilin herself isn't too sure if she trusts him.\n\nOnce Nilin has escaped, Edge aids her further by telling her to meet another agent by the name of Tommy who gives Nilin her trademark outfit and a device that will help her remix the memories of others. Nilin is a memory hunter and has the ability to go into the minds of others and change their memories and as she is attack by Olga, a bounty hunter, this is where one of the games more interesting gameplay mechanic comes into play.\n\nDuring these remix sections, a scene will play out as a typical cutscene but once over, players are then given an objective to complete. Control is then given to the player who then must rewind through what they’ve just seen by rotating the left analog stick and interacting with part of the scene when a glitch appears. These can play out in completely different ways as experimenting can lead to its own rewards. Unfortunately these parts are so few and far between, half of the game goes by before encountering another. While it would've been predictable to have these remix parts for every episode, I found the ones there extremely enjoyable and would've happily done a dozen more if not only to spice the core gameplay up.\n\nFor the most part, Remember Me plays out like the combination of a bad Uncharted with a bad Batman. You’ll do a bit of dull platforming for a bit then reach an area that looks like a fight will happen then a fight happens. The fighting mechanics do offer a unique take as combinations can be changed to suit how someone plays the game. For example, you can have one combination that focuses on attacks while another focuses on health regen. However, it only remains interesting for the first few episodes as the game just dolls out wave after wave of enemies. Even on the easiest difficulty this becomes as chore.\n\nThe same too can be said of the games characters. Characters such as Olga and Tommy seem interesting at first appearance but nothing is done with them, especially Olga who is seemingly written out after the second episode only to randomly appear for a few brief seconds at the end of the game. Episode two goes one step further as players are introduced to X-Mas Kid. He’s given quite the spotlight as you’re given an idea of who he is and how he behaves through TV ads all with himself boasting all which lead up to a very special boss encounter.\n\nWhile the core gameplay is bad impression of other much better playing games, it can at least stand proud of its art design and visuals. The game grips you with the slums you first find yourself in to the beautiful streets of Saint-Michel but I quickly found myself very bored of the locations by the latter half of the game after visiting similar locations and running around very familiar looking hallways.\n\nThe game is a very mixed bag and really falls in the last half of the game as the story becomes a mess that’s weirdly hard to follow and is at odds with the intrigue and mystery of the beginning but in the end, I wish I could remix it into a better one as the ironically titled Remember Me is a forgettable brawler that fails to deliver on its own premise.\n\nI would still really recommend this game though but only to those who know that this isn’t a great game by any means but to see the potential of what’s on offer here. There’s a really great Remember Me somewhere but this isn’t it.","September 13, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Throughout the game there is French graffiti and with antagonists like Madame, it's hard to miss. This is by no means a bad thing; it adds to the character of the game, and the references to the French Revolution (La Bastille) are a nice, albeit overt, touch. However, it may have had a negative effect on the game - I don't know if it was lost in translation or if it was just the way it was written, but the game's attempts to have shocking and reality-altering revelations fell a little short. That being said, the story is captivating and made me want to play if only to find out what happens next. In addition to a solid plot, the game is quite stunning. The level design is original and the cinematics are beautiful. Playing through a level is a mix of Assassin's Creed parkour, Arkham-Asylum-like combat, and a Bioshock kind of atmosphere, all with a soundtrack that complements the fast-paced feel. There's even the occasional puzzle. Clearly, this game has a mix of everything, which kept it refreshing and entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/recommended/228300/","chronicles5","chronicles5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/","335 products in account","A fantastic, and incredibly underrated game. I remember looking forward to this before it released, but then being discouraged by all of the negative and mixed reviews. So unfortunately, it took me a while before I finally bought and played the game. Moral of the story: don't listen to the critics! The developers have created a beautifully imaginative future, complete with stunning graphics and a captivating soundtrack. Gameplay mostly consists of platforming through the streets of Neo Paris, battling enemies with an innovative combat system, solving puzzles and generally interacting the environment with augmented reality tools. All together, it's an incredible concept, and a joy to play. It feels a bit like the mechanics of a Prince of Persia game, with graphics reminiscent of Mirror's Edge and a setting and story not unlike Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness. This reviewer finds that to be an excellent combination.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, I now have a better understanding of why some players may have become easily frustrated with the combat system. I did not understand it for the first hour or two of gameplay, and I very nearly quit the game for good. But after the first memory remix - easily the best concept in this game and sadly underused - I was determined to keep playing to continue unraveling the story. With a bit more patience, I came to love the combat system and realize just how fun it could be (and, mind you, I'm not usually a melee/combat sort of gamer). By the end of the game, I had pretty much mastered the combat system, and found myself customizing combos on the fly depending on the battle at hand. So if you're struggling with the combat, be patient with it and don't let it ruin the whole game for you.\n\nI do however have one major gripe with the game, which is how excessively linear it is. You're in this incredibly vibrant world, and 9 out of 10 of doors are closed off to you, steering you down a narrow path to your objectives. And it's a one way street - almost every single time you go through a door, it closes behind you, sealing off any secrets or powerups you may have missed. The game uses a unique premise for offering powerups - you catch a glimpse of where they are and have to remember the location before you pass it by, which is trickier than it seems. And as far as the platforming goes, you're limited to climbing on very specific objects the whole way through, indicated in orange. With how vast the world is, I suppose this makes sense or otherwise you could be climbing in every direction. As much as I want another massive open world game, (what can I say, I've been spoiled by Assassin's Creed) I understand that that may have been beyond the scope of the debut of this IP. At the same time, considering the immense amount of time that must have gone into this meticulously designed city, it's a shame to breeze through it all in a matter of hours. Me personally, I finished the game in about 10 hours. I look forward to replaying it again at some point- it's definitely worth it. Remember Me does allow you to reload chapters so you can find powerups and secrets that you missed the first time through - and I may end up doing just that.\n\nOne thing that I must applaud this game for, in stark contrast to many other games out there, is how it continues to innovate and evolve over the course of its 8 chapters. New enemies appear and old ones grow stronger, you gain new abilities and unlock more powerful combos, and the tools and puzzles grow ever more complex, right up to the end. Boss battles and memory remix scenes add an extra challenge that serves to end each chapter with a satisfying resolution. The memory remix dynamic is very original, I really don't think I've ever seen anything like it. It's just a shame it only appears four times in the game. The soundtrack is also fantastic, built from notes of somewhat familiar classical Parisian orchestra, remixed with what I can only describe as futuristic and chaotic glitches - in a way that feels natural. The music also is well-weaved into the combat. I was reading that the composer wanted the soundtrack to feel as chaotic as the world of Remember Me itself - a world where memories can change or be erased at a whim. I think they did an excellent job in that endeavour.\n\nI was also very impressed with the story, which kept me hooked, surprised, and emotionally engaged all the way to the end. This is a story that does not feel too far off from our own world, and closes with a powerful and appropriate ending. I found the final boss battle to be a bit strange, and perhaps a bit too easy, and at the same time I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nPersonally, I think this game is worthy of a strong 9/10, however if I end up posting this review online anywhere I'd bump that to 10/10 to even the scales a bit. I honestly believe that the game is short on flaws, and the only ones that do exist are most likely a reflection of what particular gamers like and don't like in their games. I see many bad reviews from those who tried an hour or two of the combat and gave up, just like I almost did, and missed out on the rest of a great game. And I acknowledge that not every game has to be open world, and that I'm a bit spoiled to expect that. So even my biggest complaint does not really stick. So now that I've completed the game, perhaps this review finds me doing a bit of my own memory editing, to put some of my own minor gripes into perspective. This is a fantastic game, one of my top favorites of the year and one I won't soon forget. Highly recommended. 9/10","July 20, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He belongs to a group called the Errorists, people determined to cleanse a society that uses memories as a form of tradable commodity, and experiments with memory itself to produce a stable, segregated city. As you venture through the game, you come across the nightmares of such experimentation and ultimately begin to take part in the most fun aspect of the game --remixing memories of certain people you come across and changing elements of what they recall to get them to join your cause.\n\nIt's really hard for me to figure out the kind of game Remember Me is trying to be. It gives this rich and interesting world but confines you to a linear path. It develops a wealth of interesting characters, but such flat development that at times feels forced. It tries to put together a unique combat system, but with such simple mechanics, most matches devolve into acrobatic button mashing. The coolest element of the game, memory remixing, doesn't happen nearly enough for it to hold the game up on its own. The worst part about it is a certain amount of pretentiousness with how it knows it's an artsy, smart game. Still, the music and atmosphere are astounding, and I have to give credit where it's due --it's a damn good story. Just wish the other elements had more thought put into them.","August 24, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign should take anywhere from 8-10 hours and is broken into 8 episodes. Each episode generally brings new, more difficult enemies along with some fantastic top of the line scenery. Seriously, one of the best features of this game is its environment. It's absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe game's story is fullfilling as well. Despite what others may say, the story is captivating and emotional. You can feel the main character's pain, Nilin, as she attempts to cope with relearning all her past actions as a memory hunter. You'll finish each episode yearning to know what happens next.\n\nThe combat is crisp and rewarding, and plays similarly to Batman. The variety of pressens available - aka the types of combat moves (power, regen, cooldown, and chain) - add variety to the combat system. On top of that, each combat move is unique so you can customize your combo bars in which ever manner pleases you most.\n\nThere are also S-Pressens, which are special power moves on a cooldown. These allow you to activate powerful abilities that will come in very handy during boss fights or other tough situations. There are 5 unique S-Pressens that come with their own special effects and purpose throughout the game.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any gamer who enjoy a story centric campaign with fighting elements.","June 28, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, the gameplay mechanic that is truly novel is the memory-hack, where you repiece someone's memory for a different outcome. It comes into play only at very important story milestones, so they're few and far in between, but that makes them special. Perhaps if the game had been longer and more open ... I am not sure.

This would not be a problem if you were able to attack more than one foe at a time, but that is not the case. In a game that has such a strong focus on making your combos have useful effects it is really sad that it is rare to complete a combo. You will have to dodge an attack from some other dude before you can complete the combo you crafted that heals your character as well as lowers the cool down on other abilities. I ultimately just made all my combos three or four moves instead of the eight or so moves possible in some of the combos. The fact that there was no way to really do crowd control without your special abilities (which have a cool down timer after use) really just made the millions of crowds this game threw at you annoying. Fights were awesome when it was one on three or even one on four reasonable enemies, but once hoards of leapers came in or guys who when you hit them electicuted you, the fun left and was replaced by tedious dodging and little jabs here and there. I turned down the game difficulty towards the last hour just so I could use my combos without worry.\n\nBut I did manage to have a good time with this game. Despite the flawed combat, it was sometimes still really fun, especially when using special powers or performing takedown moves. All your powers in this game look like cubist modern art and it's so awesome. Boss battles were fun as well, while not on the caliber of Metal Gear Rising, still nice multistaged fights in some really slick environments.\n\nNeo Paris is just such a well realized world. Orange lights just are glowing everywhere surrounded by urban decay except for in the richest part of town with the pure blue skies and pristine clean buildings. It helps that the graphics are just dazzling. The port is very solid without framerate hitch or stutter even once with everything cranked up all the way with to many enimies on the screen. I played this game to explore this city. To do genaric style "grab the ledges and poles" platforming over a destroyed factory with that orange glow under my feet. To fight to many enimies in a dream esc cubist world inside somebody's head.\n\nOne more aspect of this game that kept me coming back was the plot. While the story wasn't perfect, the main character was well written and was forced to explore a lot of moral grey area. A lot of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you do end up helping you, and never bite your ♥♥♥. The plot does not stick to karma in a boring way most videogame plots tend to do, but rather just tells a mostly realistic-ish story with realistic-ish results for the character's actions. Also, the plot is closely tied with these segments called "remixes" in which you change a person's memory. While they don't happen that often, when they do it is a real treat. They tell good little stories and just let you play around with variables to change the end. Of course there is a desired set of variables, but I had fun playing with the wrong ones and seeing what happened.

Weaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/connorjweaver/","624 products in account","Remember Me is an underrated rare gem within all the other AAA games out there. But of course it's not perfect. Really not perfect.\n\n+Unique ideas such as Remixing, which means reading someones mind, then altering a specific memory, creating very different outcomes, altering that persons personality and personal past which changes the present and future. With 2 words:  Butterfly Effect.\n\n+Customizable combat. You can create your own combos from Pressens. And there are 4 types of Pressens: Healing, Block Breaker/Stronger hit, reduces cooldown of your special abilities, and the final one which increases the effect of your latest Pressen in your combo\n\n+Variable enemies\n\n+Beautiful visuals\n\n+Comfortable controls (with Xbox 360 Controller, I never tried with KB+M)\n\n+Challenging bossfights, where you always have to have a unique tactic\n\n+Speaking of tactics, when the game senses you're struggling with a boss/puzzle, after a while it will help you, but at first it will only help you a little bit, and then you still have no idea what to do it will tell you the soulution. Saves you from searching it on YouTube\n\n+Many cool abilities. "Memory gun" to telekinetic powers, and lots of more.\n\n+Story is very good, not that mind blowing type, but still very good with many twists\n\n+Tickets to the feels train! I warned you\n\n+Music is very well composed. Slightly futuristic, but (thanks god) not exaggeratedly\n\n+/- Many bosses have QTE finishers. Personally I like QTEs but many people don't so yeah warned you again\n\n+/- I found kind of enough the memory remixes, but it wouldn't be a problem if there would be...let's say 5 more...or at least one in every episode.\n\n+/- Kinda average optimisation. Not that Ubisoft type slideshow, but not that impressive\n\n-The game uses Unreal Engine 3, which wouldn't be a problem, but it uses a very old version, which has it's problems. Common in-game streaming, which causes FPS-drops like hell; sometimes textures are missing, invisible/stuck enemies etc. Certainly not a problem on a personal nuclear power plant, but still...\n\n-I found the included binkw32.dll pretty outdated, which caused some annoying echo during cutscenes. This could be easisly fixed by replacing it with a newer one.\n\nIn overall: As I said before it's a gem, certainly a must have one. The bugs can be forgiven, because this is Dontnod's first game and later they gave us Life Is Strange, which is for me the one and only GOTY. But turning back to Remember Me it's one of the most refreshing big budget title for years, which will suck you in so much that you won't want to make the acts you have to do, because of some heavy pre-remorse. It really worth it's full price. Dontnod deserves it.","August 16, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is perhaps the most meticulously detailed that I've ever seen. The story is, although slow at first, fantastic once it's fully set up a few hours in. And the customizable combat system is a pretty cool idea that was well implemented.\n\nHowever, this game has many downsides to it. Mainly on the gameplay aspect. The combat basically consists of button mashing, QTEs, and the occasional dodge, which means it gets repetitive and old really quickly. The platforming is fun, but gets a bit repetitive halfway through the game, since the platform design gets somewhat reused.\n\nI'm tired of typing sentences... Here's it's pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+Great Puzzles\n+Original Combat Customization\n+Good Story\n+Memory Remixing Ability\n+Beautifully Crafted World & Atmosphere\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Epic Boss Fights\n\nCons:\n+Platforming Is Clunky And Rarely Reuses Areas\n+Combat Gets Repetitive And Boring\n+Only 5 Memory Remixes (They were so interesting, it was an injustice to not add more.)\n+The H30 Puzzle\n\n6/10","September 1, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the more of the game I played, the more I liked it.\n\nDONTNOT Entertainment made several design choices in this game that made it very unique. The result was a game that may not have been fine-tuned to satisfy the masses' desire for a cookie-cutter game, but instead a work of art. The world that you are immersed in while playing this game is stunningly beautiful; a cyberpunk universe that's not just gritty but also gleaming is rarely touched upon by world designers, and it really paid off. The characters are all well-thought-out as well. Though some of the diologue gets cheesy and some lines are fairly predictable, there's a lot of effort that was done to stay true to an artistic vision, and that's something I really like.\n\nNow, on to the gameplay! This game has a little bit of everything--you have uncharted platforming, some third-person shooting, the unique remixing mechanic, some puzzles, and the fantastic combat. While the combat can get repetitive, it's very polished. The ability to create and manage your own combo strings is really cool, and encourages you to explore the world to level up faster. The wide variety of abilities you can select really do a good job of making you feel powerful and in control. To call it 'immersive' would be a stretch, but you get more of an ability to 'choose' how combat will flow (similar to say...Prototype).\n\nMost of my issues with the game are it's pacing; the levels are pretty linear, and the long platforming sections are sort of distracting from the combat. Can I call it a perfect work of art? No. However, it is a game that I would recommend people to take a look at. The gaming industry should certainly take a look at this game, because we need more innovation and new ideas out there.","October 26, 2015","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has some great built environments from the flooded paris slums to the misture of "classical" and futuristic architecture in the city centre. The soundtrack is also very good and plays well with the art style.\n\nIf you like casual arcade-style gameplay. This game isn't a super-hardcore one. The main controls involve chaining combos in order to attack enemies in different ways. I think the way that the game uses this is pretty well executed, especially in that you can customize how the combos are built [each combo 'hit' can be an attack, a heal, a power regen, etc.].\n\nIf you like trans-humanism. The story revolves around implants that let people share their memories, and the inevitable moral complexities that arise in this. The technologies involved allow overlays on the screen, a la "augmented reality", which is how most of the UI is played, but it brings up an interesting point: The technologies involved are what lets characters fight each other. If you didn't have one of these implants, would you still be affected? If you like to think about these kinds of things, I'm sure the game will give you lots to work on.\n\nOverall, just a very good action game.","November 9, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game i waited so much time... when it was about to come out. The fighting system is good, but the combo`s could`ve been better. I mean the healing it`s not that supreme at the begining of the game you are so easy to be killed by the enemy.\n\nAt least you can shout from a distance, that`s kindà cool. And yet the game isn`t that easy as it seems. Way much different that i had expected. It needs brain -> strategy + to be aware of the numbers of enemies and always dodge their atacks. When they surround you .. you cannot even hit them, cause they`ll always stop you from doing atacks. Yeah yeah... you have skill that flashes them or stuns them for a while, but the cooldown is really big, and you cannot use both skills - like freeze them and use your punch arm.  The story is really interesting. Once i started this game than i stopped it, don`t know why... - maybe too much raging on some missions  .. just kiddin` .\n\nAnyway this game deserves 10/10 - Graphics are really good, story line is interesting - various ways to defeat enemies - like for example more defensive and wait for time to use skills or just fight them and dodge non stop almost, which is kindà not cool. Hmmm it`s good that you cannot jump - i mean die while you do the climbing because she isn`t goin  to jump when there is no shown spot to do it - which is really great. She is a really good climber. The sounds are great tho. Nilin is always communicating with the others. You can always guess the ways which you must go or you should go. Too bad it isn`t open world to get all the stuffs you didn`t collect, but hey who cares - it`s your choice.\n\n\nYou should get this game if you are interested in that kind of fighting system. Also that female story is great - because she is " God of Destruction " . Can get so much information from the others and even kill them, at least some of them. You are a real " Mind Reading Hunter " - Killer for example, cause there are many bad guys.\n\nI think that`s all i can say. Oh and yeah enemies to be easy !? - That`s not even true.

So  just turn off your brain and keep on trucking untill you reach chapter 4-5.\nYou need to parcour your way through a city, but it's all pointed out for you so you just follow a path. They don't even give you the illusion that you can figure your own way out. So that's really sad.\nThe combat is fun for how long it lasts, which isn't long at all.\n\nWhen you reach chapter 4-5'ish the game really starts. The combat gets fun, rewarding and challanging. The story starts to blossom and the parts inbetween become shorter and less of a choar and more of a puzzle.\nSpeaking off puzzles, there are some really cool and thought through puzzles in the game where you rearrange memories of people and solve riddles. The combat gets awesome because you learn different combo's and sick cooldown moves.\nYou'll hopefully notice a lot of winks and references to all sorts of things in the game which is always fun.\nThe environment is so well put together that it's a shame they didn't make it open world for the player to discover.\n\nIt's hard to explain why you should buy and finish this game without spoiling anything.\nBut I can say you will enjoy awesome boss fights, beautifull environments and graphics and the best part about the game\nis the great storyline which is like a mix between Inception and Memento in the best way possible :) This game could've easily been a great movie.","June 14, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the end I will recommend this game but it has some major flaws.

The sounds and game environment are rich and immersive. Gameplay is good, especially with a controller. I used an XBox 360 controller. Was a bit difficult with keyboard/mouse, probably because I don't play many linear games like this one.\n\nIn fact the one complaint I'd have about this game is how linear it is. You go from one fight sequence to the next. Your character Nillin spends most of the game on route to an objective. There are lots of corridors to navigate and every 3rd or so hallway opens out into an arena/courtyard of some type where something always falls down behind you to trap you until you defeat several foes, after which some forward obstruction miraculously falls away allowing you to continue.\n\nThis formula gets a bit tiring and persists throughout the game but when it was done, I realized that I had enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. So given that this is not my favorite genre, I have to give it a thumbs up. In fact I didn't even come to the store page to write a review but to see if there was DLC so that I could continue.","November 25, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Capcom have gone above and beyong the call of duty to make this most likely the best looking game out there. Seriously, this is something special. The world constantly changes and every section feels unique. You sometimes stop to take a closer look.

You don't always get that sense of doing damage or chaos happening. Well, you do, but it could have been so much better.\n\nOnce you start playing the game, the first bit of issues pop up. Controls are not as slick and fast as for example Batman Arkhum. Yet it requires a way faster response time in combat. Climbing around also does not feel fluid. You get amazing views, but sometimes it is as if the camera wants you to see the view and not the character, making navigation a bit difficult. The real problem is all the bugs. Now, some bugs one can live with, but here we have a few that get you stuck. For instance, not killing all the enemies before terminating a boss when he is subjected to overload, will combat stuck the game and you will have to restart. Even if you follow those rules, you sometimes still get stuck and have to kill the boss from checkpoint restart. This is such a HUGE shame for this game, since...\n\nThe story being told in Remember Me is of epic proportion. Many games try to have a great story. Only few succeed. This one goes beyond succeeding though. If you are willing to go through the bugs (which are not a lot, but they really break the game at times) you will be treated with an original and gripping story that you will not forget easily.","April 15, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbarrett00/recommended/228300/","sbarrett00","LameWalletChain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbarrett00/","441 products in account","Confession time: I've really tried my best to like the Elder Scroll series. Seriously. I've purchased almost all of the recent games and given them each a few hours to win me over and none of them have done it. It's confusing to me because I really enjoy sprawling dramatic RPGs. I spent over 100 hours on the Fallout games and another 200 on the Mass Effect series. I think my problem is the fantasy setting; thees, thous, spells and swordplay never seem to resonate with me as much as the future (dystopian or otherwise).\n\nThat's how I found Remember Me. I was reading some of the forums posts about the recent port of Deus Ex: The Fall and someone recommended it instead. Thankfully it was also part of the Steam Sale.\n\nRemember Me takes place in the Sci-Fi Dystopian Future of 2084. We've figured out how to backup, restore and replay human memories. These memories can also be bought, sold, shared or stolen. You play Nilin who is a memory hunter in New Paris who has the ability to manipulate and "remix" memories. Oh and she doesn't remember her past!1! So yeah - dramatic political intrigue, conspiracy, etc. Fun stuff. No swords.\n\nThe city reminds me of Deus Ex except it is 3rd person and not gold tinted. It's really pretty beautiful. The gameplay is really reminiscent of the recent Batman Arkham games. There's a simple, but fun combo system interspersed with counter-attacks and some gadget weapons. I enjoyed the flow of fighting in the Batman games and this really scratched that itch. You can also customize your combos so that as they stack they'll do different things, such as do extra damage, refill your health or recharge your gadgets. For the most part it is really well done and has full controller support.\n\nI've played the game for about 6 hours and I've had two chances to "remix" memories and that mechanic is pretty fun to. Kind of reminds me of the crime-scene mechanic in Batman Arkham Origins. You can rewind and replay the memory to notice and interact with certain items. As you do so - that person's memory may change in ways that further the story. Fun stuff.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that Nilin is a cool main character. She's in good company among Jade (Beyond Good and Evil), April/Zoe (Longest Journey) or Kate Wilson (Hydrophobia). So far the story is interesting and the voice acting is good.\n\nThe two downsides for Remember Me are 1) it is only available for Windows and 2) the Steam Sale has ended so the game back up to $29.99.  Other than that I highly recommend this as an alternative to a game with swords or gold tint.","March 28, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/recommended/228300/","chronicles5","chronicles5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/","335 products in account","A fantastic, and incredibly underrated game. I remember looking forward to this before it released, but then being discouraged by all of the negative and mixed reviews. So unfortunately, it took me a while before I finally bought and played the game. Moral of the story: don't listen to the critics! The developers have created a beautifully imaginative future, complete with stunning graphics and a captivating soundtrack. Gameplay mostly consists of platforming through the streets of Neo Paris, battling enemies with an innovative combat system, solving puzzles and generally interacting the environment with augmented reality tools. All together, it's an incredible concept, and a joy to play. It feels a bit like the mechanics of a Prince of Persia game, with graphics reminiscent of Mirror's Edge and a setting and story not unlike Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness. This reviewer finds that to be an excellent combination.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, I now have a better understanding of why some players may have become easily frustrated with the combat system. I did not understand it for the first hour or two of gameplay, and I very nearly quit the game for good. But after the first memory remix - easily the best concept in this game and sadly underused - I was determined to keep playing to continue unraveling the story. With a bit more patience, I came to love the combat system and realize just how fun it could be (and, mind you, I'm not usually a melee/combat sort of gamer). By the end of the game, I had pretty much mastered the combat system, and found myself customizing combos on the fly depending on the battle at hand. So if you're struggling with the combat, be patient with it and don't let it ruin the whole game for you.\n\nI do however have one major gripe with the game, which is how excessively linear it is. You're in this incredibly vibrant world, and 9 out of 10 of doors are closed off to you, steering you down a narrow path to your objectives. And it's a one way street - almost every single time you go through a door, it closes behind you, sealing off any secrets or powerups you may have missed. The game uses a unique premise for offering powerups - you catch a glimpse of where they are and have to remember the location before you pass it by, which is trickier than it seems. And as far as the platforming goes, you're limited to climbing on very specific objects the whole way through, indicated in orange. With how vast the world is, I suppose this makes sense or otherwise you could be climbing in every direction. As much as I want another massive open world game, (what can I say, I've been spoiled by Assassin's Creed) I understand that that may have been beyond the scope of the debut of this IP. At the same time, considering the immense amount of time that must have gone into this meticulously designed city, it's a shame to breeze through it all in a matter of hours. Me personally, I finished the game in about 10 hours. I look forward to replaying it again at some point- it's definitely worth it. Remember Me does allow you to reload chapters so you can find powerups and secrets that you missed the first time through - and I may end up doing just that.\n\nOne thing that I must applaud this game for, in stark contrast to many other games out there, is how it continues to innovate and evolve over the course of its 8 chapters. New enemies appear and old ones grow stronger, you gain new abilities and unlock more powerful combos, and the tools and puzzles grow ever more complex, right up to the end. Boss battles and memory remix scenes add an extra challenge that serves to end each chapter with a satisfying resolution. The memory remix dynamic is very original, I really don't think I've ever seen anything like it. It's just a shame it only appears four times in the game. The soundtrack is also fantastic, built from notes of somewhat familiar classical Parisian orchestra, remixed with what I can only describe as futuristic and chaotic glitches - in a way that feels natural. The music also is well-weaved into the combat. I was reading that the composer wanted the soundtrack to feel as chaotic as the world of Remember Me itself - a world where memories can change or be erased at a whim. I think they did an excellent job in that endeavour.\n\nI was also very impressed with the story, which kept me hooked, surprised, and emotionally engaged all the way to the end. This is a story that does not feel too far off from our own world, and closes with a powerful and appropriate ending. I found the final boss battle to be a bit strange, and perhaps a bit too easy, and at the same time I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nPersonally, I think this game is worthy of a strong 9/10, however if I end up posting this review online anywhere I'd bump that to 10/10 to even the scales a bit. I honestly believe that the game is short on flaws, and the only ones that do exist are most likely a reflection of what particular gamers like and don't like in their games. I see many bad reviews from those who tried an hour or two of the combat and gave up, just like I almost did, and missed out on the rest of a great game. And I acknowledge that not every game has to be open world, and that I'm a bit spoiled to expect that. So even my biggest complaint does not really stick. So now that I've completed the game, perhaps this review finds me doing a bit of my own memory editing, to put some of my own minor gripes into perspective. This is a fantastic game, one of my top favorites of the year and one I won't soon forget. Highly recommended. 9/10","July 20, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely beautiful story, beautiful setting and some interesting mechanics.   As the game starts, Nillin is completely amnesiac, so you know just as much of what's going on as she does.  It's hard to write a really positive review about this game when its strongest point is the story, so I'll move on to some of the other aspects of it.\n\nAside from the story, one of Remember Me's best points is the combat.  It's a free-flow, combo-based system reminiscent of the Arkham series, except that YOU choose the effect that the attacks have.  Extra damage, health regeneration, and a reduction in your special ability's recharge time (more on that in a minute) are the three choices you have, but in addition to that you can use a chain effect which mimics and magnifies the effect of your previous hit in the combo.  These can be changed mid-combat via a menu in the pause screen, to suit your needs in a particular fight.\n\nNillin gets a TON of character development, but most of the other characters you meet don't really get explored.  Early on you meet someone who is supposedly one of your closest friends, but he never appears again after Episode 3.  This is, understandably, Nillin's story, but the game could have done with a bit more character development.\n\nMy only other big complaint is with the climbing.  When you're first introduced to the climbing mechanics, it feels like a tutorial, but the training wheels never really come off.  It has the look of Assassin's Creed-style parkour, but it feels very restrictive and not at all fluid, in several cases almost to the point of immersion-breaking.  I think that if DONTNOD had put some more time into the climbing mechanics, it could have been better than it is.\n\nAll in all, weighing the bad with the good, I'd give this an 8.5/10.  The few issues I have with the gameplay aren't enough to really take away from the phenomenal story that this game has to offer, and I can honestly say that I was at the edge of my seat for a fair portion of it.","March 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even at full price this game is worth it compared to many AAA titles that are $60 plus.\n\nIt has an engaging story with likeable characters that you grow to care about and the voice acting is spot on.  The atmosphere in the game is really well done.  The game is set in a futuristic Paris where people's memories are a hot commodity and an evil company misuses their power to create a gap between rich and poor.  Overall I liked the story and it last about 7 hours (my gameplay time is higher because I alt+tabbed for a while).\n\nThis game would have benefited from being more open as the futuristic paris looked great, I just wish I could have explored it more.\n\nI've seen a lot of people complain about the fighting mechanics, I suspect this is because they couldn't get to grips with them because I really liked them.  You can devise your own combos adding in different elements to change what your attacks do.  You also get a select few "special" attacks which do different kinds of damage.  At the end of the story with them all unlocked you can really pull off some cool combos and techniques.\n\nUnfortunately the game has little replayability value given its very linear story, save for going back to collect things you missed.  Unless you're an achievement hunter though, I doubt you will do this.  There's not much to be gained.\n\nPros:\n- Strong female lead\n- Well written and voice acted\n- Interesting and at times philosophical story\n- Intriguing combat and cool combos\n- Great atmosphere and good graphics\n\nCons:\n- Quite short (7hrs, max)\n- Not much replayability","March 6, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However the world the game inhabits is extremely rich, the sounds and graphics add to that. The story is fascinating and gets pretty far out towards the end. It's what I lazily deem "high concept" with some of the ideas - something that rarely goes down well with the mainstream reviewers. It's a real shame though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/criptych/recommended/228300/","criptych","¢®¡¶±¥©#","http://steamcommunity.com/id/criptych/","1125 products in account","TL;DR: 11/10 needs remix edition\nBut seriously, I actually enjoyed this game so much that I couldn't help giving it a full review.  (Please don't take this to mean that my typical brief reviews indicate any lack of enjoyment!)\n\n\n\nSummary:  An eccentric-but-enjoyable mashup of Tomb Raider, Inception, and Trace Memory, Remember Me features phenomenal storytelling, artwork, and voicing, marred only by some loose ends and slightly buggy controls.\n\nStoryThe story begins, as most do, with the introduction of the protagonist.  Nilin is preparing for induction at La Bastille, a maximum-security prison in Neo-Paris, A.D. 2084.  Inmates there are stripped of not only their belongings, but their memories as well, thanks to Sensen technology developed by the Memorize Corporation.\n\nSensen allows users to capture, remove, and share memories as easily as digital photos, but like any technology, it can be abused.  Memories are the new recreational pleasure drug, and an entire culture has built up around buying, selling, and stealing them.  Nilin, however, possesses the rare ability of changing them....\n\nOf course, there's a lot more to it than that, which I won't reveal in the interest of keeping spoilers to a minimum.  But, all told, it's attention-grabbing, thought-provoking, and has some curious twists that actually make sense in retrospect.  My major gripe is that there are a few loose ends left dangling:  for instance, what will happen if and when Olga discovers that her memory has been altered?  But I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe they're just leaving options open for a sequel.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay switches somewhat regularly between three modes (or, really, one mode split up into stretches of different types of actions), with an additional fourth mode that appears only at certain points in the game.\n\nThe first is what I call "Exposition Mode," and consists mainly of walking through a relatively safe area while listening to someone (usually the mysterious "Edge") giving instructions and/or backstory.  This is the first mode introduced as you stumble through the prison hallways, and comes up several times per episode, usually as "breathing room" between high-tension scenes.\n\nThe second is an "Adventure Mode," involving lots of climbing, jumping, and other dangerous acrobatics dozens of feet above the ground -- if there is any ground.  This is typically more a puzzle than a test of skill, as Nilin will automatically perform the maneuvers if you press the proper direction and action buttons, so you needn't worry much about your aim.\n\nThird is "Combat" mode, in which Nilin unlocks her "Pressens," a variety of combat skills.  You start with a limited set of Pressens, but collect more through the course of the game.   You can customize Nilin's attacks by chaining Pressens into Combos, with each strike having effects such as extra Power, Regenerating health, or accelerating the Cooldown of Special Pressens (S-Pressens).  Pressens have greater effect further down the chain, so modifying Combos can be a valuable strategy in certain situations, especially at Memhunter difficulty.  Mechanical enemies can't be attacked with regular Pressens, though:  you'll have to rely on a weapon or certain S-Pressens for them.  Combat is mostly about timing and strategy, as Combos only work properly if you attack a single enemy with them, but you'll need to keep an eye on the others so they don't blindside you.  N.B. Combat occasionally includes QTEs.  It's just a few button-presses usually, but they can catch you off guard, and missing them may force you to replay a segment.\n\nFourth, the defining special mechanic of the game, and, sadly, appearing only rarely (four or five times altogether) is the "Remix Mode."  You don't play Nilin directly in this mode; instead, you watch a scene from a character's memory, then rewind it and alter details to "remix" the memory according to your objective.  (Keep in mind that this alteration occurs only in the subject's memory -- it doesn't change reality.  This is a minor plot point a couple of times, as well as the key to a few achievements.)  I really wish this had been used more, as it's really what makes this game stand out from others in the genre.\n\nAs mentioned above, I had a couple of control problems.  The main one is navigating choices with the mouse:  when making a selection (such as menu items, or selecting a target with some S-Pressens), the game handles mouse motion like a gamepad rather than giving you a cursor, and moving the mouse continuously moves the selection continuously.  This gets very, very frustrating after a while.  As a workaround, I found that WASD also changes the menu selection, so I stuck to that.\n\nAnother problem is that, at times, the camera would "stick" at a certain angle and be difficult to adjust, and sometimes at extreme vertical angles it would start to flip rapidly (i.e. possibly symptoms of no vertical angle limit).  These particular problems were only occasional, and for the most part I actually found the camera worked extremely well, keeping everything you needed to see in view.\n\nGraphicsI actuallly went and bought a new graphics card to play this game (and others) in its full high-definition, all-settings-maxed glory.  And I'm glad I did, because while my old card might have managed to play the game, it would only be at about half the resolution and the lowest quality settings, and even then would've been a bit slow.\n\nThe real-world graphics are amazing, hyper-realistic, artfully blending high-tech holography with backdrops of run-down slums and high-fashion districts alike, somewhere between cyberpunk and "cyberpreppy," if you will.  In contrast, the realms of memory realize the fuzzy, fragmented nature of human memory:  still detailed, but disconnected and unstable, dominated by empty space and shifting features.  In short, even if Remember Me had no story at all, it could probaby still sell as an art piece.\n\nSoundI'm no audiophile, here, but I will say that I had no issues with sound quality.  The voicing was beautifully done, and I noticed very few instances, if any, of awkward dialog.  Music was interesting, though I mostly remember (haha) the credits song, a classical-style piece with some rock/metal worked in and quite a bit of glitching that I think was intentional.\n\nOverallRemember Me includes a number of elements familiar from other titles, uniquely "remixed" into a pointed story about the importance of remembering the past; the settings and characters are well-crafted and believable, even whilie the story rides the bleeding edge of science fiction; the gameplay introduces a new, but underused, mechanic that provides a refreshing shift in perspective.  If you like hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, Inception, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell -- or just about any science fiction ever -- this is a game to pick up, for the story alone if nothing else.","December 21, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

These are scenes in which you go into someone's memory and change small pieces to create an entirely new course of events that can completely change their personality. This is one of the most original gameplay elements and it only happens a handful of time. While, I wouldn't want them to over do it and take away the magic of when it does happen, a few more scenes would have been cool.  All the power upgrades will leave you feeling like a badass, but never like a god where fights seem to lose their challange and only seem to slow you down from finishing the story line. The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing. They create a beautiful world, with a style all it's own. I strongly reccomend pulling out your credit card and throwing it at your monitor to buy the game!","April 4, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slak44/recommended/228300/","Slak44","Slak44","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slak44/","25 products in account","StoryThis game revolves around its story. It contains a couple "OH ♥♥♥♥" moments, and everything you knew about the characters is proven wrong. I literally left the computer in the middle of a level to take a break once, because the plot twist was so unexpected. The characters are believeable, each of them with their secrets.\nCombatIt's not that complicated unless you play on hard. The enemies are relatively diverse. After a while, it feels lackluster, but it's not the main focus of the game. The customizability of combos tries to make up for that, and it succeds to a degree.\nVisualsThe graphics are good enough, for a 1.5 year old game. Neo-Paris' appearance is appropriate: a city where wealth is highly valued. The way signs and information are displayed via your Sensen is pretty nice too.\nGameplay ElementsThis category is represented nicely in Remember Me. Most notably through memory remixes: these allow you to alter other people's memory in order to have them act in specific ways. Unfortunately, there's not that many of them. However, they have a big impact on the story. Then there's remembranes: a nice way to convey information to the player while fitting in the story. The platforming you have to do is similar to combat: not good, not bad, and boring after a while. There are QTEs in this game, but not enough to have much of an impact, be it negative or positive.\nControls, UI and UXI found that a controller is more appropriate for the game. The menus seem to built for controllers as well. They are a bit clumsy at times, but you shouldn't be spending much time in the menu anyway.\nOtherYou can obtain relatively valueable trading cards. There are many unlockable stories you can read, as well as concept art and 3D models.\nConclusionPersonal Rating: 9.25/10\nObjective Rating: 7.75/10\nI personally liked the game a lot, as I find story-oriented games such as this one interesting. If you enjoy a good story, you should pick it up. Otherwise, it's still a pretty solid game, worthy of being picked up on a sale.","January 18, 2015","true","31.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely beautiful story, beautiful setting and some interesting mechanics.   As the game starts, Nillin is completely amnesiac, so you know just as much of what's going on as she does.  It's hard to write a really positive review about this game when its strongest point is the story, so I'll move on to some of the other aspects of it.\n\nAside from the story, one of Remember Me's best points is the combat.  It's a free-flow, combo-based system reminiscent of the Arkham series, except that YOU choose the effect that the attacks have.  Extra damage, health regeneration, and a reduction in your special ability's recharge time (more on that in a minute) are the three choices you have, but in addition to that you can use a chain effect which mimics and magnifies the effect of your previous hit in the combo.  These can be changed mid-combat via a menu in the pause screen, to suit your needs in a particular fight.\n\nNillin gets a TON of character development, but most of the other characters you meet don't really get explored.  Early on you meet someone who is supposedly one of your closest friends, but he never appears again after Episode 3.  This is, understandably, Nillin's story, but the game could have done with a bit more character development.\n\nMy only other big complaint is with the climbing.  When you're first introduced to the climbing mechanics, it feels like a tutorial, but the training wheels never really come off.  It has the look of Assassin's Creed-style parkour, but it feels very restrictive and not at all fluid, in several cases almost to the point of immersion-breaking.  I think that if DONTNOD had put some more time into the climbing mechanics, it could have been better than it is.\n\nAll in all, weighing the bad with the good, I'd give this an 8.5/10.  The few issues I have with the gameplay aren't enough to really take away from the phenomenal story that this game has to offer, and I can honestly say that I was at the edge of my seat for a fair portion of it.","March 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even at full price this game is worth it compared to many AAA titles that are $60 plus.\n\nIt has an engaging story with likeable characters that you grow to care about and the voice acting is spot on.  The atmosphere in the game is really well done.  The game is set in a futuristic Paris where people's memories are a hot commodity and an evil company misuses their power to create a gap between rich and poor.  Overall I liked the story and it last about 7 hours (my gameplay time is higher because I alt+tabbed for a while).\n\nThis game would have benefited from being more open as the futuristic paris looked great, I just wish I could have explored it more.\n\nI've seen a lot of people complain about the fighting mechanics, I suspect this is because they couldn't get to grips with them because I really liked them.  You can devise your own combos adding in different elements to change what your attacks do.  You also get a select few "special" attacks which do different kinds of damage.  At the end of the story with them all unlocked you can really pull off some cool combos and techniques.\n\nUnfortunately the game has little replayability value given its very linear story, save for going back to collect things you missed.  Unless you're an achievement hunter though, I doubt you will do this.  There's not much to be gained.\n\nPros:\n- Strong female lead\n- Well written and voice acted\n- Interesting and at times philosophical story\n- Intriguing combat and cool combos\n- Great atmosphere and good graphics\n\nCons:\n- Quite short (7hrs, max)\n- Not much replayability","March 6, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A very strong story with some very original mechanics specifically woven with the concept of the game's story which is completely original to my knowledge. Musically charming, fantastic artwork and quality conceptualisation with a very believeable background running up and side offering of readables building it's universe. Unlike a lot of modernized futuristic games, it does bear it's own unique identity that is very appealing about it and makes you stop and look if you're into Sci Fi and games that offer something more than point click (bang) shoot em ups. But it only falls short of the open world side that obviously allows titles like Deus Ex to triumph due to it's designing, but you can still miss in game upgrades and artsy things by not going down dead end corridors or rushing through, which at no point are you really forced to, (I'll certainly be replaying sections).\n\nIt incorporates fighting that is very similar to the Batman series and boss fights, with some exceptional fighting extras that are very fun and interesting to decipher including a design it yourself fight move User Interface. You have climbing that is very much similar to the Assassins creed series, puzzles reminiscent of both the previous titles mentioned but delivered wholly & uniquely enough to stand on it's own merit. You do have an environment with a set path and story to go through, you can't unless just for admiring purposes stand on one spot or go down every alley way or on every rooftop like Deus ex for example, it's a 3rd person view and if the second title is bold enough to be first person and then third person for fight sequences (or optional) it will save itself and make it with all the previous title's exceptionaly strong ingredients probably one of the best anticipated future titles due as a contender, it has so much of a world to offer it's designated format unfortunately cuts it short and limits it's immersive appreciability making it underrated and not fully able to deliver every nook and cranny of excellence it truly is, - thank you it was awesome!\n\n-Industrialism (Thiervery TuT) UK","March 14","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This would not be a problem if you were able to attack more than one foe at a time, but that is not the case. In a game that has such a strong focus on making your combos have useful effects it is really sad that it is rare to complete a combo. You will have to dodge an attack from some other dude before you can complete the combo you crafted that heals your character as well as lowers the cool down on other abilities. I ultimately just made all my combos three or four moves instead of the eight or so moves possible in some of the combos. The fact that there was no way to really do crowd control without your special abilities (which have a cool down timer after use) really just made the millions of crowds this game threw at you annoying. Fights were awesome when it was one on three or even one on four reasonable enemies, but once hoards of leapers came in or guys who when you hit them electicuted you, the fun left and was replaced by tedious dodging and little jabs here and there. I turned down the game difficulty towards the last hour just so I could use my combos without worry.\n\nBut I did manage to have a good time with this game. Despite the flawed combat, it was sometimes still really fun, especially when using special powers or performing takedown moves. All your powers in this game look like cubist modern art and it's so awesome. Boss battles were fun as well, while not on the caliber of Metal Gear Rising, still nice multistaged fights in some really slick environments.\n\nNeo Paris is just such a well realized world. Orange lights just are glowing everywhere surrounded by urban decay except for in the richest part of town with the pure blue skies and pristine clean buildings. It helps that the graphics are just dazzling. The port is very solid without framerate hitch or stutter even once with everything cranked up all the way with to many enimies on the screen. I played this game to explore this city. To do genaric style "grab the ledges and poles" platforming over a destroyed factory with that orange glow under my feet. To fight to many enimies in a dream esc cubist world inside somebody's head.\n\nOne more aspect of this game that kept me coming back was the plot. While the story wasn't perfect, the main character was well written and was forced to explore a lot of moral grey area. A lot of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you do end up helping you, and never bite your ♥♥♥. The plot does not stick to karma in a boring way most videogame plots tend to do, but rather just tells a mostly realistic-ish story with realistic-ish results for the character's actions. Also, the plot is closely tied with these segments called "remixes" in which you change a person's memory. While they don't happen that often, when they do it is a real treat. They tell good little stories and just let you play around with variables to change the end. Of course there is a desired set of variables, but I had fun playing with the wrong ones and seeing what happened. It was a cool mechanic.\n\nSo overall, the gameplay is the worst part of this game really, which should be criminal. But somehow, the super slick polish and the smart story won me over.

The campaign should take anywhere from 8-10 hours and is broken into 8 episodes. Each episode generally brings new, more difficult enemies along with some fantastic top of the line scenery. Seriously, one of the best features of this game is its environment. It's absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe game's story is fullfilling as well. Despite what others may say, the story is captivating and emotional. You can feel the main character's pain, Nilin, as she attempts to cope with relearning all her past actions as a memory hunter. You'll finish each episode yearning to know what happens next.\n\nThe combat is crisp and rewarding, and plays similarly to Batman. The variety of pressens available - aka the types of combat moves (power, regen, cooldown, and chain) - add variety to the combat system. On top of that, each combat move is unique so you can customize your combo bars in which ever manner pleases you most.\n\nThere are also S-Pressens, which are special power moves on a cooldown. These allow you to activate powerful abilities that will come in very handy during boss fights or other tough situations. There are 5 unique S-Pressens that come with their own special effects and purpose throughout the game.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any gamer who enjoy a story centric campaign with fighting elements.","June 28, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only just hit the final hours of the game, and it's definitely not worth the full price. Get it on a sale, it's too short to merit anything beyond $15, but definitely worth your time.\n\n-The graphics of the world are amazing in some areas, even with them on low I found the world to look rather stunning, it's a shame there's so little going on where you're supposed to be. I would have to interact with the enviorment more. It is indeed extremely linear, so if that turns you off just stop right here.\n\n-I personally loved the music and sound effects, though I do wish they had used some scores in more location or at least not where they did. I sometimes found myself listen to what seemed to be battle music in an average climbing section, though the majority of the time it fit the mood. I don't know if it was just me, but I experienced quite a few audio bugs. Multiple times I had duplicate sounds playing over each other, and the audio cut out entirely in some sections.\n\n-The story is definitely alright, but having just finished DX:HR my expectations may have been a bit high :P There are a few plot twists and I really enjoyed it, though I did wonder why I had to revist so many areas.\n\n- The combat, everyones favorite gripe. I recommend playing with a gamepad if you have it, I found some difficulty in managing everything, as unlike Arkham City or the majority of other games you dont have large amounts of time to react, or a counter. Unfortunately the dodge mechanic is rather lacking. I often found myself trying to dodge an AOE attack only to rebound over the back of the guy next to me and still be in the blast radius. Which is sad considering it's your only escape tool. The 3 hit combo is rather useless in my opinion, but being able to see the moves you'll use in the combo lab makes it fun to create the flashiest combos etc. I loved the design of the S-pressens, but losing all of your focus if you die was incredibly frustrating.\n\n-The controls are a bit finicky, as you can tell from my difficulty with the dodge in combat. Often in climbing I found myself headed back the direction I came when I wanted to back eject instead. Overall it definitely felt like it was designed for consoles in mind, but it's nothing too difficult.\n\n-DLC I found the majority of the dlc moves to be rather useless, but the Spinning Bird Kick is incredibly handy as the last hit of a combo, as it's rather an aoe meelee move, and as the last hit does alot of damage. The rest I never really used, but I loved that one.\n\nIt's definitely not the greatest game ever, but its a fun few hours of distraction, and I hope we'll see a more expanded universe from this IP in the future.","March 22, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not perfect, but it's engaging, it's gorgeous (especially if you've got a rig that can crank the settings up), and the story is solid with punctuated moments of impressive depth.\n\nThe combat and traversal isn't wholly unique or innovative, really, but it's done well enough that it doesn't feel prohibitive to progressing through the story. The combat in particular, while it can take some getting used to, does allow for some creativity on the player's part, and can be customized through the swapping of individual strikes to form combos to suit your playstyle, or different situations.\n\nThe memory sweeping mechanic is an interesting one, and probably had the most promise of anything in the game, however it winds up being under-utilized, with only a few points during the game giving you the opportunity to use Nilin's signature skill. The process itself is neat at first, but sort of unravels into a time-consuming trial-and-error experiment, with no real indication of which triggers that the player can control will actually have any desirable effects. Honestly, my one hope is that DONTNOD get's another crack at a game set in this world so that they can really hone this particular aspect of the game maybe create something really cool the next time around.\n\nAnyway, this game wound up flying under many radars, between the fledgling developer, the new IP, the middling reviews...

Unique art, interesting gameplay mechanics and a creative/fresh-blood story. I'm especially surprised by the female protagonist, I can count on my one hand how many games have that currently. What was kind of a bit disappointing is the tunnel-linnear route of each chapter, probably because most of the games nowadays is going towards sand-boxing theme even if sometimes its filled with nothing (yes I'm looking at you Maffia 2), so I cannot really complain, but to be honest I dont think many people will play this game more than once. The combat mechanics is pretty much Batman-Arkham style, with this combo-lab improvement, interesting although the fights were quite frustrating from the 1/3 of the game even on normal! Invisible enemies? Enemies who constantly reflect damage? Gang-rap? There is no real tactics here, but teeth-grinding. I must admit by the end of the game I was pretty much at the verge of chucking my controller at the wall, eh oh yes, its seriously a controller-game, I warned you. Closer to the end of the game I have found some tricks, and it got a bit easier, although I always hated games where the common/filler fights were 3x harder then the boss fights. And one more thing, directed at all game companies: DO ENABLE US SKIPPING CUTSCENES! Hordes of angry mob of videogamers will storm your castles, if you do not stop making games WITH achievements AND unskippable cutscenes!

There is honestly a lot of thought that went into making this world, it feels really massive, despite being a linear game.\n- None of the characters felt underdeveloped\n- Combat system is decent, I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's not as great as other games, but it's like a slightly more combo based version of Arkham, I suppose.\n- The art is great. Not the graphics, the actual art style and world created. The game feels linear, but still feels as if it's massive\n\nCons\n\n- Feels a bit empty - besides coming across some people early on, the only people you get to see are either those relevant to the plot, random robots continuously doing tasks or those whose faces you'll be punching in.\n- The camera can bug out sometimes, and hoooly ♥♥♥♥ is it annoying. Doesn't matter what it is, if you're in battle and you just took damage because the camera ♥♥♥♥ed up, or if there's a view and you can't see it because the camera is fixed for some reason. It's all pretty much annoying. This is the major gripe I had with this game, if this got fixed, then I genuinely think most of my frustration with this game would be fixed with it.","May 24, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/recommended/228300/","jackxblack","JackxBlack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/","149 products in account","Tl;DR - beautiful game with medicore gameplay, very good setting and a pretty good story. Overall 7/10.\n\nThose are the 4 elements I'll be writing about. Let's start with what this game surprised me the most - the visuals. Art direction in this game is astounding. The colors, light, graffities, models, all tell the story of the Neo-Paris. Despite the fact that the assets themselves are not really good quality (not bad either though, especially considering it was a previous gen game) the game still has a lot of wow moments and it's all thanks to a very smart and beautiful usage of the listed elements.\n\nThat, alongside multiple dialogues, fluff announcments audible in the background and notes found as collectibles creates a very detailed, believable and scary vision of the late 21st century. However, the world was not used correctly, in my opinion. Personally I wish we'd spend more time on the streets of the city, watching how the people live, what problems they have etc. We've only heared or read about the world (which again, was done very well), but almost never saw it, spending most of the time in some labs/prisons etc. That was one of my big issues with the game, lots of wasted potential there.\n\nLearning about the world and seeing the beautiful environment was what kept me playing most of the time, as the rest was rather obvious from the start.\n\nStory set in this world is not as good as it could be. It's full of cliche solutions, lacks any choice and sometimes it's hard to emphasise with main character's actions. The story itself lacked something more inventive, unusual.\n\nFinaly - gameplay. Most of the game is split into 2 sections - Batman-esque fights and exploration. Both aspects are done poorly. There's very few enemies and most of them are more or less the same. Instead of introducing new, more complicated opponents, at later stages the game becomes more difficult just by throwing in more enemies. It clearly tried to go full Batman, but failed (also, it gets boring at this point too). Combo system associated with the combat also felt lackluster. By the time I've finished the game I had 3 full combos and 1 unfinished one. Instead of building a database of my combos that I could use as I see fit, depending on the situation, in the end I just built 2 universal ones that I used all the time, depending if I needed utility (most of the time) or damage (rather rarely). Exploration left some to be desired as well - you can only climb the very specific objects that the game allows you to, so pretty much if you can climb something - you should. It was done similarly to Enslaved: Odyssey to the west, where you just moved the stick, pressed the jump button and watch your character perform animations. No room to fail, no challange, no threat. Just a filler.\n\nThe unique gameplay element, that also has to be mentioned, was the memory rewriting. Sounds very cool and about half of the time it was, but the other half, at least to me, felt rather unlogical. The solution to the problem felt random, which led to continous rewinding just to try another, sensless combination. Additionaly it lacked a functionality that would improve the system in general (not the unlogical sections, though) - ability to quickly jump to identified memory glitches and changing them much faster that way.\n\nIn the end I still recommend this game, a bit. It's not great, but it's good. It has increadibly well done elements, some pretty good ones and if you don't bounce off the medicore ones, you might still have fun.","February 7","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is quite literally dial-a-combo, with the only interesting choices being the on-hit effects (healing, cooldown or extra damage) you assign to each attack in the chain. The highlights of the game are the memory remixing segments, though there are only 4 or 5 of them in the entire game. Still, the gameplay between remixes is compelling enough to warrant a playthrough. It's just a shame they didn't make memory remixing an actual gameplay mechanic instead of an occasional setpiece.","December 30, 2013","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s very rare that I get this emotional about a game but the bittersweet story and the well done plot twists ended up engrossing me it and and just ripping at my heart strings, especially the moral it all lead up to. This is definitely one to throw on the evidence pile in defense of games being art.\n\nI also loved all the interesting game mechanics the whole VR aspect of the Sension system the plot revolves around inspires. The glove Nilin uses to interact with the world can interface with various computer and security systems in the environment to unlock doors, manipulate objects, steal memories, damage enemies, and even execute them via overloading their memories.\n\nThe two main mechanics are the memory stealing, and memory remixing:\n\nOnce you’ve stolen a memory you find beacons in the environment that allow to you reply them in order to see things like correct paths through dangerous areas or to gain access to locked devices via syncing the memories access to them\n\nThe other is the bigger one, memory remixing:\n\nThere’s key times in the plot where you get to remix other character memories via accessing and changing key things about the ensuing cutscenes until the changes create a kind of domino effect that forces the memory to play out the way you want and thus. This is generally used to manipulate someone’s perception in a way that heals their mind via showing them the potential evils of their actions or allowing them to let go of their anger.\n\nThe combat system was also interesting with the custom combos (you use “pressins” give special effects to each attack with the combo), acrobatic dodges, finishing moves, and special attacks.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat is also where the mixed feelings come.\n\nLater on the game some insanely cheap and difficult enemies get thrown and often get used in areas and in combinations that make the fights feel unfair and artificially difficult instead of rewarding or fun.\n\nOne of the most glaring examples is a type of soldier that that has something like an electrical shield and thus you take damage every-time you hit him. There’s no way save for using a  certain special move (which has a long cooldown unless you adjust your combos around decreasing cooldown on specials, thus greatly decreasing their damage) and you’ll often fight two or three of them at once. This guy also soaks up an obscene amount of damage.\n\nIt will also often swamp you with weaker enemies that over-run you while a couple strong ones teleport around and curb-stomp you in the confusion.\n\nI often had to basically cheat by constantly re-adjusting my combos mid-combat to do whatever kept me alive at or dealing damage at that moment and it really broke up the flow of combat as ai went in and out ot the menus constantly.\n\nSo yeah, I guess verdict is a cautious recommendation to pick it up on sale as long you’re okay with playing for the story and can tough-out some frustrating and and unfair fights to see said story.","July 2, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has some great built environments from the flooded paris slums to the misture of "classical" and futuristic architecture in the city centre. The soundtrack is also very good and plays well with the art style.\n\nIf you like casual arcade-style gameplay. This game isn't a super-hardcore one. The main controls involve chaining combos in order to attack enemies in different ways. I think the way that the game uses this is pretty well executed, especially in that you can customize how the combos are built [each combo 'hit' can be an attack, a heal, a power regen, etc.].\n\nIf you like trans-humanism. The story revolves around implants that let people share their memories, and the inevitable moral complexities that arise in this. The technologies involved allow overlays on the screen, a la "augmented reality", which is how most of the UI is played, but it brings up an interesting point: The technologies involved are what lets characters fight each other.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/228300/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Remember me can be best described as an hybrid between a fighting  and a platformer game. Developed by Dontnod Entertainment, it takes place in a futuristic version of Paris (known in the setting as Neo-Paris) from year 2084, where a new technology, the Sensen, has allowed men and women to influence their own memories and store or even cancel them as they please. The protagonist, Nilin, is a memory hunter, a woman capable of interfering with the others' minds easily. The beginning of the game shows Nilin suffering a severe case of amnesia and finding herself into a terrorist group seeking to destroy the Sensen and free Neo-Paris. The story of Remember Me therefore revolves around Nilin trying to recover her memories back.\nThe main beef of the game is about navigating the various levels and survive the fistfights you are thrown in at times.\nNilin is very agile and can get a good grip on many edges and jump between them easily: that's where the platform elements come from. There are always little visual clues on screen to tell you exactly where you should jump or hang on next. As the game progresses you'll be asked to overcome some small stealth sequences (there are sometimes patrolling droids that will instantly kill you if you get in their range) and puzzles: as Nilin acquires more skills you'll have to use them all to carve your path. Remember Me also features a really large collection of collectables items, which unlock concept art and 3D models in the main menu: some of them are hinted at during gameplay with some sort of maps, but the majority of them are incredibly well hidden and my require more walkthroughs to find.\nThe combat in Remember Me is your usual fighting game fare: you must achieve combos on enemies for massive damage while being careful to dodge the attacks thrown at you. The game features an unique combo system: the in-game menu allows you to actually build your own combos, deciding how many hits each must contain and what each hit may actually do (while some hits just damage the enemies, others may heal you, for instance). Nilin can also use special attacks and temporary boost called Sensens: they are available after achieving enough focus and have different results (using some of them become mandatory to overcome some bosses). Many enemies in Remember Me can't be really taken on using sheer force and require special attacks or strategies first. While this element always keeps on your toes, on later level such enemies become more and more common and therefore more and more frustrating (they are also always escorted by lesser mooks who will disrupt your combos, making your job even harder). The game also features four boss battles, each with its unique flavor and rather challenging too.\nAn unique gameplay element from Remember me are the Memory Remix sequences, which are more akin to an adventure game: you are presented with someone's else memory and have to change some particular details in order to change the ultimate outcome and proceed. Such sequences aren't that hard to overcome and are mostly trial and error in nature.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the presentation in this game is absolutely gorgeous: the landscapes are very faithful to Paris itself and well crafted; the enemies design is original and extremely detailed; the soundtracks makes a great job at enhancing the overall mood.\nIt can be argued that Remember Me tries to throw in many elements from different genres and doesn't manage to produce something truly unique for itself and the story could had been made far better for the truly incredible setting, but I still find this game to be severely underrated and I'd advise pretty much everyone to try it out regardless","June 18, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is perhaps the most meticulously detailed that I've ever seen. The story is, although slow at first, fantastic once it's fully set up a few hours in. And the customizable combat system is a pretty cool idea that was well implemented.\n\nHowever, this game has many downsides to it. Mainly on the gameplay aspect. The combat basically consists of button mashing, QTEs, and the occasional dodge, which means it gets repetitive and old really quickly. The platforming is fun, but gets a bit repetitive halfway through the game, since the platform design gets somewhat reused.\n\nI'm tired of typing sentences...

The story was beautifully written, the protagonist was and will always be one of my absolute favorites, and the twists and turns in how the game played out kept you wanting to learn more, wanting to see how it would all end.\nThat being said, the ending was... Not perfect. Albeit it was decently epic and it introduced another interesting concept on top of the already interesting "memory industry" dynamic, it was also somewhat cliche, in all honesty.\nIn addition, I have to agree with some of the criticisms on the gameplay- my first playthrough was on Memory Hunter (hardest difficulty) and a lot of the time it felt like "see if you can time your dodges right while simultaneously throwing out punches between dodges to get your focus up". In other words, it sometimes felt kind of like *press space, okay, punch twice, space again, punch twice... and so on*. Then again, my standards for gameplay in narrative-oriented singleplayer RPGs is usually decently low, so I thought it was fun enough. Tedious at times, definitely.\n\nThe best way I can summarize how I felt/feel about this game is: it was basically another Dishonored with (decently) worse gameplay. Same immersive feel, both extremely interesting worlds, both well-written stories and characters, both beautiful art direction, etc.\n\nDo I recommend it?

But that's not the question... Here's why I'd recommend this game:\n\nI would start with a good story.\nThere's a backstory on how it all started, how the city was created etc. Okay, it's pretty linear but still it could be a great movie or so and that's what I love with games (just forget CoD things...).\n\nThen, graphics and backgrounds. Because every "new" games after 2004 need to be good looking and SUPER realistic and stuff like that (I hate it but it must be said).\nRemember Me is one of those futuristic games that makes you dream about the real life because of the background, wich is Paris (Neo-Paris), a real place. There's a lot of thing happening when you play, a lot of little details like people talking behind a window, robot playing piano, someone shouting at you from a balcony... And the devs want you to discover those little things by making you looking for "bonuses", that's pretty cool, actually!\n\nWell, I will end the evaluation by saying Remember Me is a good game that you can't really describe or argue on. It depends what you want when you play and this game could possibly give you that. ^^\n\nEnd of transmission!","May 26, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The environments are beautifly detailed and complement the free running elements of this title, even if it can turn into a "look at the pretty skybox" stlye staright path a times. On the subject of free running, you might expect a free running brawler to include some moves that include jumping on your enemies from a higher point, but this is sadly not the case, despite some of your early enemies utilizing this exact tactic. Instead you, playing as asmall, skinny woman, must stand on the same level as larger, sometimes hulking, enemies. Of course the protagonist does this with great ease, you don't want to design a game to be too frustrating, after all. I'm not saying Nilin should be weak and helpless like so many other female characters in games, in fact, I think she maybe the best example of a female protagonist in a video game yet. That said, while I can imagine that anyone of her size who can run and jump all around the obstacles Nilin encounters just on her way to the local bar to have the endurance and speed to hold up in a fight, the boss fight against X-Mass Kid is a mahor breaking point of this logic.\nRegardless, the combat is simple, yet fun. Besides, the size difference isn't the biggest problem with the game, the problem is that Remember Me desperately wants to be a movie. I may have only just started episode 3 (something Valve can no longer use as an excuse), but a good chunk of the game, about 1/3 of my playtime, has been spent in cutseens, scripted sequences and "pretty skybox" segments. I know this might be the "no" moment for those considering playing this, but hold on just a second. It turns out that the story is really good, so the "want to be a movie" problem is very neglegable. Also, in my opinion, the exploration and combat parts (you know, the game part) of the game show up enough to keep the movie bits from overstaying their welcome.\nAll in all, this is a nice story with some fun, anarchist-cyberpunk brawler action. There are some flaws, as there are with any game, but nothing that can't be ignored when put next to the better elements.","November 12, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wratts/recommended/228300/","Wratts","Wratts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wratts/","71 products in account","A unique action adventure game in the vein of your traditional hack 'n slash or brawler action adventures. If you're into games like God of War or Devil May Cry, you may take a liking to Remember Me. It combines a fluid brawling mechanic with the Combo Lab, which allows you to construct your own hit combos to your own liking. The combat controls themselves are simplistic, alternating only between punch, kick, dodge, special techniques that trigger unusual conditions in the environment against your enemies, and using a sort of blast gun. On top of this, you get to do some parkour-style navigation and platforming through the environments, which strongly resembles the Prince of Persia games but is fairly simplistic. It even throws in a handful of easy puzzles here and there to mix things up, most notably the ability to "remix" certain people's memories during the storyline to make them change their beliefs.\n\nThe setting, story and characters are by far Remember Me's strongest point. It's a very good cyberpunk scenario, revolving around themes of questioning the nature of personal identity and what kind of value you can place on memories. The graphics, sound effects, music, and overall atmosphere are excellent. The story concludes on an interesting ending and the journey there is at times unsettling—in all the right ways, as is appropriate for the scenario's genre.\n\nThe game's weakest point is its total length and replayability. I played the game on the highest difficulty from the start, and was finished with the story within 12 hours. Now, this is not to say that it's super-easy or I'm very good, because I felt adequately challenged considering the setting and some fights and bosses gave me quite a bit to chew on till I had figured out how to beat them. The game has an excellently smooth learning curve and maintained an entertaining difficulty throughout. The amount of hand-holding was kept to the minimum of what's expected of modern games and some of the fights and boss scenes surprised me in how the game designers wanted players to think outside of the box and inject some variety outside of the regular brawling with common enemies throughout the game. However, the issue still stands: the length and replayability is extremely limited. Outside of going back to hunt for all achievements and hidden items, because the level designs are very linear and there are no additional challenge modes or anything else to extend the play experience.\n\nEverything gels nicely in this game. Nothing feels contrived or redundant, which is often a problem with games in this genre, where you'll complete the game with abilities you never used or features that you ignored. If anything, I wish it were longer so I could get more use out of its many cool features, and I'm looking forward to any games that DONTNOD produces next. If anything about this game looks or sounds even remotely interesting to you, you should give it a try.","January 25, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I say art direction, I include graphics, sound and writing.\n- graphics: Neo Paris is stunning. Backgrounds are full of details. Architectural styles merge in both an organic and a fantastic way. Character models are not the main appeal of the game, but they're at least original.\n- sound: Music always feel adequate, and enhance the experience. It seems more like sound design than melody : it reacts to what your character is doing, action has its own music. Besides, environmental sounds are well thought and full of details (ie. you hear flies buzzing around)\n- writing: The world is coherent and overall well thought despite the quite unoriginal evil megacorp. Characters are well documented, they have their own agenda and believable motivations. As for the story elements, well, they managed to avoid many clichés. The plot isn't needlessly ambitious and ties the fate of the main character to the overall plot. It ends up more as a personnal journey than anything else and somehow managed to move me at times.\n\nAs for Gameplay, well, it sure could be better, but it has many merits. The game tries to be many things: an innovative beat'em up, a beautiful exploration game and a classical adventure one. Despite some new and original ideas, Remember Me never excel in any of this style of gameplay. But the whole is better than the sum of its parts. In conclusion, I'd recommend this game either to aesthetes looking for an original setting or to open-minded gamers looking for a fresh twist in a classical gameplay.","August 5, 2013","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am just in love with her, and it's always good to play with a female character (feminist alert). The storyline is simple, you are a person who lost her memory, can't remember a thing, you're trying to remember and everything just completes itself really. The world is set in Neo-Paris, very futuristic, but it has a dystopic vibe to it. You're feeling like you're in a chaotic world, which I liked. There are some puzzle bits in the game, they are enjoyable, complicated enough but not too hard too. There is a hospital bit which is very enjoyable, I never played a part like that and I absolutely loved it. My computer isn't great so I played in low-medium graphics but they were good, so I believe that if you have a good computer you'll enjoy the graphics very much. I think the soundtrack is very good, especially the main theme is amazing.\n\n\nFirst of all, I am not an action gamer, This paragraph is about the action of it. I am more like a simulator, casual, indie game kinda person. Euro Truck Simulator, Cities Skyline, Don't Starve kinda... I am not good with FPS games, or any kinda action games really. But I could manage the mechanics easily, they were easy enough for me to be comfortable with, I could arrange MY OWN COMBOS. Which was amazing, I litereally made combos focusing on gaining health and used them like 100 times in every single fight. The boss fights were bit tricky for me, I played each fight like 6 times but I did it, eventually. And I played on easy mode so if you're good with them you can always play them in harder modes, make more complicated combos, make more fancy moves idk. You can configure them according your skills, it's up to you! So I think that's good. Some people may think that the mechanics are not good enough but they were good enough for me. I'd give a solid 7/10 to it.

But it kinda made up for that with the fight sequences.\nQuite a linear gameplay, or rather more like a single path to a location sort of thing. Not that that's bad, but I'd figure there might be different ways to reach a certain goal.\nTLDR; Game's good.

There is honestly a lot of thought that went into making this world, it feels really massive, despite being a linear game.\n- None of the characters felt underdeveloped\n- Combat system is decent, I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's not as great as other games, but it's like a slightly more combo based version of Arkham, I suppose.\n- The art is great. Not the graphics, the actual art style and world created. The game feels linear, but still feels as if it's massive\n\nCons\n\n- Feels a bit empty - besides coming across some people early on, the only people you get to see are either those relevant to the plot, random robots continuously doing tasks or those whose faces you'll be punching in.\n- The camera can bug out sometimes, and hoooly ♥♥♥♥ is it annoying. Doesn't matter what it is, if you're in battle and you just took damage because the camera ♥♥♥♥ed up, or if there's a view and you can't see it because the camera is fixed for some reason. It's all pretty much annoying. This is the major gripe I had with this game, if this got fixed, then I genuinely think most of my frustration with this game would be fixed with it.","May 24, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had purchased the DLC, so I could do some customization of my Combinations to target specific enemies or situations. This was a big help. Some people claim this game is fast to play through. Maybe on "Script Kiddie", the easy setting for difficulty.  But if you want to get all the achievements, including MemHunter Elite, it will take some time just to replay to particular areas throughout the game.\n\nI enjoyed the combo fighting style, especially once I got the timing down. There were times I didn't think I would make it through the game on the Memory Hunter difficulty (hardest setting). I did just barely.  But it was all worth it. It was truly an accomplishment.\n\nI do wish that the game allowed skipping through cutscenes which aren't so useful on your second or third playthrough. The ability to turn off in-game hints/tutorial text would also be appreciated after the first playthrough of an area.\n\nYet at other times, important game hints flashed by so quickly I didn't even see them, nor were they in the "Journal" area for the game.

The combat is quite literally dial-a-combo, with the only interesting choices being the on-hit effects (healing, cooldown or extra damage) you assign to each attack in the chain. The highlights of the game are the memory remixing segments, though there are only 4 or 5 of them in the entire game. Still, the gameplay between remixes is compelling enough to warrant a playthrough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/228300/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","Remember Me is an action game set in a futuristic (and somewhat dystopian) Paris, with an interesting story centered around memories becoming the new form of social interaction. In the world of Remember Me, a company called Memorize has managed to digitize memories, allowing people to share them, which, theoretically, could lead to a more peaceful society. However, this is not the case, as society is still divided between the powerful and the poor.\n\nIn the game, you play as Nilin, member of an activist group known as "Errorists", who seek to stop Memorize, as they consider the digitalization of memories has led to a worse society. At the start of the game, you've been captured and have no memory of who you are, and it's only through the help of a mysterious ally, known as Edge, that you manage to escape. From there, you start searching for clues of your past, while helping the Errorist cause. The story is pretty good, with some interesting twists here and there, which is why I won't write more about it, as there's risks of spoilers. There's also lots of collectibles scattered around that add a bit of background information regarding the story of the game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, well, it's somewhat simple. The game is combat oriented, which means you'll be fighting plenty of enemies; it offers a certain degree of customization through the "Combo Lab", which allows you to modify four different combos with different skills that increase their power, or grant you things like regeneration; not to mention the different special abilities you'll unlock as you progress. There'll also be sections of the game in which you'll be exploring around (although this is a bit of an overstatement, as the game is pretty linear), climbing buildings and solving puzzles. I'd say both gameplay aspects are well balanced in their execution.\n\nThe environments are gorgeous, with a great level of detail; it is unfortunate, however, that there isn't much exploration, since, as I mentioned above, the game is pretty linear. Even then, I've got to appreciate the amount of detail they gave to Neo-Paris, you can even find some recognizable Paris landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, although you'll never access them. The soundtrack is excellent; I really loved the music, and it really set the tone of Neo-Paris being a sort of futuristic re-imagining of a classical Paris, if that sentence makes any amount of sense.\n\nStill, I must say this game had flaws, and, even though it's a good game, it could have been much, much more. The linearity isn't the biggest of its problems, as the game is somewhat buggy, which can cause you some trouble. Another problem I found is that the combo system isn't really effective against large groups, since the combo only works on a single enemy at a time; there's no freeflow between enemies (besides a special ability), meaning that your combo will be broken when switching enemies, not to mention that if an enemy hits you, the combo breaks as well. The camera can be a bit problematic as well, especially since there's no "lock-on" when fighting; sometimes you'll end up in a corner unable to see some enemies. Another big problem (at least for me) was the unskippable cutscenes. Now, I understand making them unskippable for the first time; but when I keep dying to the same enemy and being forced to watch the same (lenghty) cutscene over and over again, it gets annoying; however, I must say that I'm glad that, at least, they made it possible to pause the cutscenes, as that's another thing that annoys me, "unpausable" cutscenes.\n\nWell, despite its problems, I think Remember Me is a pretty solid and fun game, so I can recommend it.","March 24","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sounds and game environment are rich and immersive. Gameplay is good, especially with a controller. I used an XBox 360 controller. Was a bit difficult with keyboard/mouse, probably because I don't play many linear games like this one.\n\nIn fact the one complaint I'd have about this game is how linear it is. You go from one fight sequence to the next. Your character Nillin spends most of the game on route to an objective. There are lots of corridors to navigate and every 3rd or so hallway opens out into an arena/courtyard of some type where something always falls down behind you to trap you until you defeat several foes, after which some forward obstruction miraculously falls away allowing you to continue.\n\nThis formula gets a bit tiring and persists throughout the game but when it was done, I realized that I had enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. So given that this is not my favorite genre, I have to give it a thumbs up. In fact I didn't even come to the store page to write a review but to see if there was DLC so that I could continue.","November 25, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Me too!\n\nSeriously, this isn't the best game in the world but it does have a strong design and narrative backing it up with a strong sterile aesthetic that really brings Neo-Paris alive. Mixing all that together truly makes it a memorable experience.\n\nThe combat is reminscent of the FreeFlow combat mechanic of the Batman games which is always a plus in my books. Its nothing new but with the combo-lab giving you the power to create your own combinations of attacks it mixes up the combat immensly.\n\nThe controls are a bit wacky at times and the camera doesn't seem to want to be your best friend when you need it the most.\n\nThis game has made me a fan of Dontnod, I'm looking forward to what they do next! (I'm aware of Life is Strange that's an awesome game as well!)\n\nThe cyberpunk setting in my opinion is something that is a niche concept, considering that in games it's embraced.

Remember Me really had a interesting story line that grabbed my attention and engaged me from the very start. Aside from the the story the different characters and enemies grab you based on their uniqueness. I really enjoyed the combat system, and I reccommend playing the game on the hardest difficulty. It was fairly straightforward but kept me entertained the whole time. You don't waste time fighting through hordes of endless enemies, to win you must strategize how to beat the current battle. If you find yourself breezing through every battle then you should make sure you are on the hardest difficulty. When I lost a battle it's because my strategy was off, not my mechanics.\n\nThe settings and the music really led to a great environment to play in.

It has intriguing, well written story, really good graphics (Landscapes are stunning) and enjoyable, dynamic gameplay. The music is also nice. As for the combat system - in my opinion it's simple but enjoyable. Fights are dynamic, some of them are even quite challenging. Looking for hidden objects is a nice addition. The overall concept for game world is interesting and rich in medium and little details creating the full image of the fictional society and its' problems.\nThe worst part of the game are scripted behaviours of player character. Every few minutes you receive a call, which is of course very important for plot, but during the conversation you suddenly can only walk slowly, it's often impossible to jump through a gap, so you have to wait until the conversation is over. And some other conversations don't have such limits and you can run freely. And of course you can't skip any of the cinematics. Many players won't be annoyed by it on the first playthrough, but on the second it becomes quite irritating.\nTo sum up: It's a very good game, with great concept, but a few lacks in this concept's realisation. Definitely worth playing.","April 28, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A very strong story with some very original mechanics specifically woven with the concept of the game's story which is completely original to my knowledge. Musically charming, fantastic artwork and quality conceptualisation with a very believeable background running up and side offering of readables building it's universe. Unlike a lot of modernized futuristic games, it does bear it's own unique identity that is very appealing about it and makes you stop and look if you're into Sci Fi and games that offer something more than point click (bang) shoot em ups. But it only falls short of the open world side that obviously allows titles like Deus Ex to triumph due to it's designing, but you can still miss in game upgrades and artsy things by not going down dead end corridors or rushing through, which at no point are you really forced to, (I'll certainly be replaying sections).\n\nIt incorporates fighting that is very similar to the Batman series and boss fights, with some exceptional fighting extras that are very fun and interesting to decipher including a design it yourself fight move User Interface. You have climbing that is very much similar to the Assassins creed series, puzzles reminiscent of both the previous titles mentioned but delivered wholly & uniquely enough to stand on it's own merit. You do have an environment with a set path and story to go through, you can't unless just for admiring purposes stand on one spot or go down every alley way or on every rooftop like Deus ex for example, it's a 3rd person view and if the second title is bold enough to be first person and then third person for fight sequences (or optional) it will save itself and make it with all the previous title's exceptionaly strong ingredients probably one of the best anticipated future titles due as a contender, it has so much of a world to offer it's designated format unfortunately cuts it short and limits it's immersive appreciability making it underrated and not fully able to deliver every nook and cranny of excellence it truly is, - thank you it was awesome!\n\n-Industrialism (Thiervery TuT) UK","March 14","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/recommended/228300/","jackxblack","JackxBlack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/","149 products in account","Tl;DR - beautiful game with medicore gameplay, very good setting and a pretty good story. Overall 7/10.\n\nThose are the 4 elements I'll be writing about. Let's start with what this game surprised me the most - the visuals. Art direction in this game is astounding. The colors, light, graffities, models, all tell the story of the Neo-Paris. Despite the fact that the assets themselves are not really good quality (not bad either though, especially considering it was a previous gen game) the game still has a lot of wow moments and it's all thanks to a very smart and beautiful usage of the listed elements.\n\nThat, alongside multiple dialogues, fluff announcments audible in the background and notes found as collectibles creates a very detailed, believable and scary vision of the late 21st century. However, the world was not used correctly, in my opinion. Personally I wish we'd spend more time on the streets of the city, watching how the people live, what problems they have etc. We've only heared or read about the world (which again, was done very well), but almost never saw it, spending most of the time in some labs/prisons etc. That was one of my big issues with the game, lots of wasted potential there.\n\nLearning about the world and seeing the beautiful environment was what kept me playing most of the time, as the rest was rather obvious from the start.\n\nStory set in this world is not as good as it could be. It's full of cliche solutions, lacks any choice and sometimes it's hard to emphasise with main character's actions. The story itself lacked something more inventive, unusual.\n\nFinaly - gameplay. Most of the game is split into 2 sections - Batman-esque fights and exploration. Both aspects are done poorly. There's very few enemies and most of them are more or less the same. Instead of introducing new, more complicated opponents, at later stages the game becomes more difficult just by throwing in more enemies. It clearly tried to go full Batman, but failed (also, it gets boring at this point too). Combo system associated with the combat also felt lackluster. By the time I've finished the game I had 3 full combos and 1 unfinished one. Instead of building a database of my combos that I could use as I see fit, depending on the situation, in the end I just built 2 universal ones that I used all the time, depending if I needed utility (most of the time) or damage (rather rarely). Exploration left some to be desired as well - you can only climb the very specific objects that the game allows you to, so pretty much if you can climb something - you should. It was done similarly to Enslaved: Odyssey to the west, where you just moved the stick, pressed the jump button and watch your character perform animations. No room to fail, no challange, no threat. Just a filler.\n\nThe unique gameplay element, that also has to be mentioned, was the memory rewriting. Sounds very cool and about half of the time it was, but the other half, at least to me, felt rather unlogical. The solution to the problem felt random, which led to continous rewinding just to try another, sensless combination. Additionaly it lacked a functionality that would improve the system in general (not the unlogical sections, though) - ability to quickly jump to identified memory glitches and changing them much faster that way.\n\nIn the end I still recommend this game, a bit. It's not great, but it's good. It has increadibly well done elements, some pretty good ones and if you don't bounce off the medicore ones, you might still have fun.","February 7","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As for the combat system - in my opinion it's simple but enjoyable. Fights are dynamic, some of them are even quite challenging. Looking for hidden objects is a nice addition. The overall concept for game world is interesting and rich in medium and little details creating the full image of the fictional society and its' problems.\nThe worst part of the game are scripted behaviours of player character. Every few minutes you receive a call, which is of course very important for plot, but during the conversation you suddenly can only walk slowly, it's often impossible to jump through a gap, so you have to wait until the conversation is over. And some other conversations don't have such limits and you can run freely. And of course you can't skip any of the cinematics. Many players won't be annoyed by it on the first playthrough, but on the second it becomes quite irritating.\nTo sum up: It's a very good game, with great concept, but a few lacks in this concept's realisation. Definitely worth playing.","April 28, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept is great, and I love the multifaceted game mechanics. The combat is sometimes frustrating, but I found myself actually enjoying attempting to hit combos by the end.\n\nThe story is engaging and reflective of the human condition, and I enjoyed the game from start to finish. I wish however, that it had been more open-world, and that they had expanded a little more. The more open world vibe of 2013 Tomb Raider would have suited this game so well. Only complaint is that I wanted more. I was engrossed in the world.\n\nThat being said, excellent music, voice acting, graphics and a wide array of enemies to keep you on your toes.

The city of Neo-Paris has been rendered in a way that lends considerable creedence to their vision of the near future.  Lots of little details are included that make the environments believable.\nThat task was probably made easier by the highly-linear nature of the game.  On the one hand, you can lament how incredible this would have been to have the same level of detail in an open-world, but the linear nature allows for a high degree of polish on the path you follow through the world and story.\nThe story's competent, and told well enough, though I don't think I was invested as the story expected me to be.  Nilin comes across as introspective, yet more than a little cold.\nThere's a neat memory-remix mechanic introduced early on and it felt like I was nearly halfway through the game before it came up again, though there are several instances before all's said and done.  I'll echo the sentiments of several other reviewers who wished there was "more of that, please."\nThe combat itself is also competent, in the Arkham vein but with a dodge rather than a counter, with a few nice touches to spice things up.  Depending on your play style, it's easy for some fights to overstay their welcome, but once you become comfortable with the combo system and fight mechanics (or like me learn to stop hoarding your special attacks) you can dispatch with most battles relatively expeditiously.  It's got QTE's, and while the button you press corresponds to the action executed it still feels more like a match game than a act of skill, but they're used to cap off certain battles rather than as a routine mechanic.\nI played with a mouse and keyboard and occasionally felt like the game wanted me to be using a controller, but it was never a serious handicap.  (Here's a tip if you're using a mouse and kb like me - the "Rewind" motion is like drawing a counter-clockwise circle with your mouse.  Perhaps I missed a critical instruction, but that really threw me off during the first memory remix.)\nI think there was something else I wanted to say, but I just...can't remember.","January 8","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And Lord of the Rings is about a little guy who carries around a ring.\n\nLets get serious again... it has good art, very nice sound track, nice animations. The world is fancy and entertaining but the real star is the story, it is a rare example of smart scifi which touches heart and mind equally well. There are also some unique minigames like changing the memory of people. Also the balance between exploring, combat, puzzles and mini games is good.\n\nSurelly there is some bad stuff too, the game is totally linear (but trust me you wont mind), has only auto save points (but lots of em), has little replay value, a couple of little bugs (had to restart the game 3-4 times), things sometimes get a little repetitive (but only slightly) and some battles and quick time events are a little bit unbalanced. Also while the "old Paris" scenery was gorgeous there was too much "that sewer again" and "yet another generic scifi service tunnel". Sometimes I stepped through a door which immediatly locks and I lose my chance to explore some more rooms. No serious problems but definitly not perfect.\n\nWould I buy again? Absolutely.

It plays like "Tomb raider" meets "Deus Ex: human revolution", but it's lacking in environmental interaction, which doesn't alleviate the feeling of being on rails.\n\nWho is this game for? Mainly for science-fiction fans. Some of the dialogues could have been better, and there are a few questions left unanswered at the end of the story, but the plot would make a better movie than 90% of the current holywood blockbusters.\n\nAnd if you're french or would like to see a vision of Paris in the future, it's the perfect game.

You're coming in the right way about this game. This game is totally an action game combine with a little bit of strategy. You can mix up a little about your combo effect. You can go with real power to crush your enemy or you want to get some buff to support you to survive longer.\n\nmaybe not much combo for using but mixing them quit effect the battle a lot. you wanna fight to get special move or fight directly with your combat skill is your choice. Some type of enemy can't attack normally like other dude but that's your job to find the way to finish them.\n\nStory of this game is great. (personally, I play Life is Strange before played this game) It will confuse and annoy you at first. But it will going to be fun after that. Some part of this game have a clue to think about. It's quite good for thinking practice. if you stuck it's okay to have a hint that help you to get through. But in fact. You must have been stuck for a long time first. ( for me it's the good point to make people stop and using there brain a little)\n\nGraphic quit great. I like the way shader do in this game.

You can outfit your combos with a Damage Multiplier, Health Regenerator, Cooldown Regenerator, or Loop.\nAside from the combat there is Parkour. The parkour in this game is very straightforward, you cannot pick your path. The game is set on one path the entire time that you have to follow, no branching out on another for a different outcome in the end. While doing parkour there is an orange arrow that follows you around and tells you where to go, making the game annoying because it's always telling you where to go.\n\n7.5/10 I would recommend this game to you and all of your friends.","April 27","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel like it would have benefitted more from really focusing on that aspect rather than proceeding as it did, however.\n\nThe combat gameplay is akin to that seen in the Arkham Batman games, except without the countering or dynamism. It includes a system of designing your own combos that manages to feel very limiting as opposed to the freedom an idea like that should give. The combat camera is also less than helpful, often causing enemies to begin their attacks from off screen which obscures the visual warning. One aspect I did like however was the special "Pressen" attacks you could use. After charging a gauge in combat you can opt to unleash one of several special attacks for a variety of devastating effects.\n\nThe environmental traversal gameplay is a case of follow the clearly marked climbing path with literal flashing arrows telling you where to go and being unable to deviate in any way. Cinematically this is okay - watching someone climb is more interesting than running down a long corridor I suppose - but it would be nice to be able to actually explore the world a bit more or for there to be some kind of a challenge involved. The gorgeous landscape absolutely begs for it.\n\nOverall, Remember Me is worth playing for it's excellent sci-fi memory dystopia world and for it's memorable "memory remix" segments. It has some good cinematic set pieces and graphically looks great but don't expect to be impressed by the combat or climbing.","December 7, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although other games have done each of its mechanics better, Remember Me's concept and setting are unique and enthralling enough to overcome what might have otherwise been a mediocre game.\n\nThe game offers mouse control, but it's flawed; aggressive mouse acceleration and a small, artificial dead zone (re: controller centric design) make managing the camera awkward.  The worst technical sin, however, is that the gameplay and visuals are obstructed by the very narrow FOV.  Even on a 30" LCD panel, I constantly felt cramped.

Personally, I am not a fan of games where "you just press a couple buttons a bunch of times and eventually the bad guys will die" - even ones that have combos and stuff. But this game totally broke that barrier and left me wanting more after each play session. From the amazing story, to the intense music, to the awesome voice-acting, to the easy but fun combat system - it was just such a refreshment to see such a game do what it did the way it did. DONTNOD really pulled out all the stops with this one - and it was only their first game! I would like to note that this game is incredibly linear - so if you don't like being told exactly where to go and what to do, except for the bonus collectables you can get when you stray from the beaten path, it's possible that this game isn't for you. But I personally enjoyed this game a ton and will certainly be replaying it for Achievments later on - and I will definately be on the edge of my seat, waiting for what DONTNOD has in store for us in the future.\n\nThe art style is amazing, the writing is awesome, the music is super futuristic and crazy, the combat system is really fun and intuitive, and all of this comes together to keep you really engaged in what your doing. Some negatives I have for this game include the constant feeling that you're being herded in one direction by the game, the some combat CAN get kind of repetitive and dull, especially during Boss fights.\n\nOne tip I'd have for you if you plan to play this game is to use a controller. It doesn't matter what controller, as long as you don't use Keyboard + Mouse. This makes it WAY less confusing, especially since this game was made assuming the player is using a controller.","November 16, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a gorgeous world and level design with a beautiful soundtrack and great character / enemy designs. It also has an intriguing lore with good voice acting. Gameplay and combat are decent, but the game as a whole is short and many of the ethics and issues that are brought up in conversations are never fully discussed. This game could have been much more engrossing and thought provoking, especially when the best aspect of the game, the memory remixing, is under used. In the end, I am going to recommend this game (flaws and all) because of the need to support new IPs and female protagonists in gaming.

Funny enough, I played Life is strange without knowing who developed it and wondered why something seemed familiar....\nWhat is it? It\'s a 3rd person action/beat-em up/platformer set in the future. It has some heavy Bladerunner and Mirrors edge influences and you can tell from the color scheme.\nGraphically it\'s pretty decent for an U3 engine game, as you\'d expect and ran well for my rig. Some amazing city scapes, nice lighting and heavy reflections make this game look crisp and futuristic.\nNever mind the fact that you spend most of the time trudging through gritty lower level Paris neighborhoods and sewers but it makes the moments you are travelling though some very high tech looking areas more appreciated.\nThe sound and music for some reason reminded me a little of the Tron 2.0 game from way back, it suits the game, especially during the combat sequences, very punchy.\nSpeaking of combat, it\'s mostly hand to hand. You time your punches and kicks to form a chain (combo ), pre-determined by which button you press. See, using a gamepad, it would be something like xxx, or xyyxyy or yxyxy but the really great thing about this games combat is that you can program/create your own combo as long as it follows the button sequence. For example, pressens (damage, health, special attack cooldown and Multiply?) can be programmed to the button you press in the sequence. I could create an attack chain starting with damage, followed by health steal on the second hit, followed by a cooldown to my special attack on the third hit, then another damage and finish with multiply. Mix a combo any way you want! I mean it\'s not freeflowing like Batman Arkham games but it\'s close. And sadly that\'s also a bad point, there isn\'t enough combat or it\'s all or nothing.\n\nSadly, the game space itself feels a little narrow and linear. A lot of the time you\'re walking down a hallway to turn into an open room to follow another hallway. The platforming is pretty dull and it felt like the game was holding you\'re hand a lot as you play through it. Never-the-less, the game looks amazing while you are walking around in a straightforward manner.\n\nIt feels good to play though, very fluid movements as LONG AS YOU HAVE A GAMEPAD! I can\'t stress enough how much better it is to play with a controller. I much prefer using a keyboard and mouse with my games but I feel it\'s essential to play this particular game with a pad!\nThe character movements are nice, very fluid! I\'ve walked up and down stairs so many times and I\'ve got to say they\'ve nailed movement nicely!\n\nSo in a nutshell....OK combat, just not enough of it. Good music and sound effects. Fantastic graphics for an UE3 game. Story...ho hum, interesting concept with a couple of What the! moments.\nIt\'s a great game, maybe under appreciated.","June 1","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before I played Remember Me, I've been told quite frequently that it was a mixed bag, but nothing could have prepared me for this. After a short introduction, you find yourself in the incredibly stylised Neo-Paris, which is without a doubt its best asset. The visual design is one of the most beautiful locations I have ever experienced. Everything is perfect. The city itself, the buildings, the denseness of everything, the neon lights, the struggling people, the robots.  The atmosphere is amazing as well, both the environmental sound design and the soundtrack. Everything screams cyberpunk. But how about the inside, under the hood?\n\nThe Bad\nYou see, while the outside is one of the most gorgeous settings, the actual game is riddled with flaws. It's one of the very few games I wish had a film or animated film set in the same universe, because it doesn't play well. The incredible design of Neo-Paris yearns to be explored, to be discovered and appreciated. Instead, you're walking an awfully straight linear path, and most of the times basically a hallway with nice decorations. It's such a shame, and I wonder how greatly this game would have benefited from an open-ended design with a focus on exploration.\n\nBesides the linear level design, the combat system is also rather unappealing. Making your own combos sound pretty good on paper, but the fighting itself just isn't a lot of fun. Pardon the metaphor, but it feels like the mentally challenged niece of the Batman Arkham series. And to make matters worse, you'll be fighting pretty frequently. The enemy placements are illogical, there's no thought behind it, except for artificially increasing the game length.\n\nBesides those two big flaws, I've also experienced some smaller flaws. The story is pretty uninteresting, and the characters are even less so. Which is a shame, because th. Also, the collectibles are pretty useless, since you can easily and very quickly regain your Health and Pressens through the Regen and Cooldown moves in your combos.\n\nIn short:\n\n+ Incredible visual design, one of the most highly stylised settings I have ever seen.\n+ Soundtrack is good.\n+ HUD disappears outside of combat, which makes for a very clean screen.\n+ Mixing memories can be pretty fun.\n\n- Extremely linear, a huge waste of Neo-Paris.\n- Uninteresting story with uninteresting characters.\n- Mediocre combat system.\n- Fighting the same enemies with little diversity is tiring.\n- Final boss is stupid and misplaced.\n- Collectibles are basically useless.","February 8","false","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remember me is a fighting game with a lot of RPG elements in it - so much, actually, that a lot of players have critisized it for being too linear, forgetting it's true nature. It's a visual masterpiece IF you're into visual beauty but then again it's just one aspect that makes this game as awsome as it is. Some parts of the level design does feel like a rip-off from other games, for example the beginning totally looks like Dishonored and Bastille looks like Citadel form Half-Life 2 but instead of holding it against them, I felt happy to rediscover those places in another context. I agree with the overall consensus that the main character is one of the key elements, that make this game what it is. We have a female protagonist, racially diverse AND with a compelling history. She fights like a badass and makes tough descisions throughout the game. It's one of my all time favorites. Below are pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+ Incredibly beautiful cityscape (reminds the movie Fifth Element).\n+ Supreme level design.\n+ Interesting futuristic story.\n+ Interesting character build and choices she has to face.\n+ Customizable fighting combos.\n+ Really useful powers/ abilities.\n+ Visually the fighting sequences are a masterpiece.\n+ Tactical approach to battles.\n+ Build your own combos.\n+ Supreme dodging mechanics that make battles dynamic, rapid and visually marvellous.\n+ Apart from many other players, I actually liked the QTE endings of boss battles, that gave a meaning to the cinematic killmoves.\n\nCons:\n- One gamebreaking bug in the worst place imaginable - right after a boss battle, forcing you to replay the lengthy fight.\n- Main character's face should have been modelled, textured and animated better since you see it so often in the game.","January 23","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/228300/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Third Person Action game in a semi-dystopian world with intriguing story, but some buggy gameplay. The combat is mostly hand to hand with a simplified “combo” system where you alternate between punches and kicks. Overall it’s a fun game and makes you think about the benefits and drawbacks of memory manipulation.\n\nYou play Nilin, a “memory hunter” in a world where technology now allows the storage and deletion of human memories. Unlike the “Total Recall” movies, the technology can’t really make up new memories and implant them into people. Instead, it’s possible to selectively delete memories and/or remove them from people and give them to someone else. As a memory hunter, Nilin is able to do a whole lot of unusual things such as steal passwords from a person’s mind, “remix” memories, and use cyber power attacks in combat.\n\nThe game is mostly linear with a lot of free climbing like Assassin’s Creed or Tomb Raider games, and the combat is similar to the brawling in the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs. However unlike Batman, Nilin doesn’t “counter” attacks, only dodge. Also, note that unlike the Arkham games the reaction time is shorter (You pretty much have to dodge as soon as you see an attack warning). The combo system I mentioned earlier is based around unlocking punches and kicks as you “level up.”  These attacks can be chained into 3, 5, 6, or 8 hit combos which do increasing damage as they get longer. This is why the short reaction time to enemy attacks is so annoying (they keep interrupting combos).  Other special powers you can unlock throughout the story are Fury (short term damage boost), DOS (area effect stun), Logic Bomb (area affect damage) along with a couple others.\n\nPros:\n+A unique and complex world with a thought provoking story line.\n+The boss battles are interesting because of cyber manipulation of virtual worlds based around memories.\n+The “memory remix” sections of the game let you view and make subtle changes to a person’s memory, with the overall effect of making them remember things that never happened. It’s like the butterfly effect in action, tiny changes can change the outcome in drastic ways.\n\nCons:\n-The game has some noticeable bugs, like the sound suddenly cutting out, or not being able to aim your spammer “gun” at various points in the game.\n-The combat system is really annoying when you’re surrounded by enemies and can’t get a combo going because everyone keeps attacking. In the Batman games, the enemies usually attack one at a time (or you can use a multi-takedown). In Remember Me, you have to dodge and start your combo over.\n\nYou probably have Remember Me from the Humble Bundle last year so don’t be afraid to give it a shot.","April 21","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It features a genuinely entertaining world, decent storytelling, and a frustratingly monotonous combat system that is at the same time, satisfyingly intense. Its visuals are stunning and its architecture is absolutely superb. But how does this all gel together into one game? In this review I'll be going over the visuals, gameplay, game world, and some closing thoughts.\n\nVisuals Remember Me is absolutely gorgeous. It blends a unique art style, great lighting, realistic architecture and human faces, all tied up by fluid animations. The whole experience just breaths sci-fi/cyberpunk. The only thing I can knock on as far as graphics go are some of the textures which, while high res, are often very plain. What I mean by this is that everything frequently seems a bit too stark and barren. This in its own right is not a very strong argument though, as it definitely fits with the clean, futuristic look that DONTNOD was obviously going for, it just happened to get a bit old. Not really much else to say here, which is a good thing. I never found any graphical issues, Remember Me was simply an impressive sight to behold. And yes, I think the visuals hold up even now, in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nGameplay Gameplay is probably the most frustrating part of Remember Me. If the dev's could have simply put a little bit of extra love and care into the systems that govern the games mechanics, it would have gone a long way. The combat is fun to watch and a total spectacle, but is far too repetitive and samey throughout the entirety of the game. The only redeeming quality of the fighting in Remember Me is that it has some challenging battles, which forms some nice tense moments in the minute to minute gameplay. Other than that, I'd say the combat is totally mediocre. The next most prevalent part of the gameplay is the platforming. It is almost completely linear, which is a strike right off the bat. It takes absolutely no skill, and it's really just used as filler. Not exciting or fun in any way. However, the gameplay does have a certain instance in which lots of thought was put into, which was the remix puzzle sections. These are sequences in which your character enters a specific memory of another individual, and makes small adjustments that leads to their memory of a certain event becoming completely warped, which then helps you on your way through Remember Me's linear story. This is about all Remember Me offers as far as gameplay goes. I will, however, say that I don't agree with those saying it would have been better served by being a movie, as the game world is something that should be experienced by the individual, with their input rather than some director. And with that, let's get into what I just stated as the driving factor for this game, the world.\n\nGame World The game world of Remember Me is easily where it most excels. It's stylish, intriguing, well designed, and very fun to immerse yourself within. It is a world that proves its uniqueness, as well as its authenticity. I often had to stop and take in the layout of the levels, just to admire it all. Pair all of these points with the sci-fi atmosphere, and you have a world that is near irresistible to many kinds of gamers. If you value a games immersion and design, you will absolutely feel at home with Remember Me.\n\nFinal Thoughts While there are many things to criticize about Remember Me, I feel that when looking at the big picture, the vast majority of my complaints fade. This was the first project of DONTNOD Entertainment, and they have since release the episodic-adventure game "Life is Strange", which is critically acclaimed. With that fact, I think it becomes obvious that many of Remember Me's failings were bred from lack of experience, which the team has since gained. If you are able to look past some of the minor rookie mistakes, you end up with a well-crafted, decently realized, and compelling experience with a few cuts and bruises, mostly metastasizing from problems with the gameplay. All in all, Remember Me is a 10 hour adventure with some tense moments, decent storytelling, and an immersive setting, which I feel most gamers can appreciate.\n\nPersonal Rating: 8/10","March 3","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art direction on this game did very well on making the game less frustrating - I wouldn't mind fighting the same boss about three times if it meant I could experience that kind of eye candy again.\n\nOf course, a game isn't always just about the visuals - I love the variety of the gameplay. You climb, puzzle and fight your way through different levels and along the way you gain more skills and moves that you can combine in a variety of ways. It did take some time to get used to it, though. The combat is different from what you'd expect, so be prepared to fumble around a little bit.\n\nOverall, this game had everything I expected it to have. Character/racial diversity? Check.

The game's setting and world are definitely its strong point. From the streets of Neo-Paris to leaper infest tunnels, I'm enjoying it all. Everything is carefully detailed. Vendors have holograms advertisements, news screens highlight story details throughout. Androids can be spotted here and there doing various jobs. The graphics are great and the rendering of lighting effects and textures really compliment everything. Alleys of neon glow over wet concrete, the clash of metals and fabrics on Nilin. The aesthetic reminds me a lot of the style of Half-Life 2 / Dishonoured / Mirror's Edge.\n\nI think where this game didn't meet expectations was the combat mechanic. It seems the devs tried something new this time around instead of sticking to the normal combat in fighting games, and they should be appauded for trying, but it was probably better in theory. My experience with the combo system changed throughout the game. Early on they were intimidating, I thought I wouldn't be able to remember so many buttons. Later on it became tedious and took me out of the fun of combat, and late game I realized that combo building was crutial for some boss fights. Another thing that bothered me was the short delay between attacks or "slow-down". Nilin feels so agile and quick, I would have liked to see what it would play like had her attacks been real time. While the combo system can be annoying, for the most part you could get by just spamming the same attack, it just won't be as effecient.\n\nPlatforming is nice and fluid, so is movement in general. I found everything to be responsive, such as opening doors via Nilin's Spammer. As I said Nilin is very agile, she plays like she is very much on her toes. I found the game to be very corridor linear but this didn't bother me too much, except when you move forward past a point and can't backtrack because of a closing door, cutting you off from finding collectable items.\n\nNilin is a very interesting character. Just looking at her she seems unique and I want to know everything about her. Unfortunately the story doesn't allow for much to be revealed about her til later on. The other characters in the story however weren't very interesting to me.\n\nStory has some plotholes but I feel like it's unique. The idea of a memory hunter is pretty badass. Not sure how she can move objects though in people's memories. Sound assets were neat, lots of glitching going on. Really enjoyed the soundtrack too!","February 28, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was emotive, and when you summarise the story I think it's pretty cool.  Of course it's not a novel quality story, find me one game (aside from the first Deus Ex) that actually delivers that.  I don't think the story is completely the "regular cliche story" - there are archetypes for "journey" models that are pretty much the staple of computer games through time immemorial, hero, discovery, realisation, gaining power etc.  But I think this had a little more to offer.  When I was thinking through the story in retrospect it did haunt me a little.\n\nI would love to see a sequel, as all the faults that people mention (ie boring combat, sub par exploration etc) are all pretty valid, however it's just one of those games where if you go into it with no expectations, will take you on a great ride.\n\nAs an aside I would love to have Richard Morgan tunring this into a novel, that would kill. :)","October 10, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A book is linear, a movie is linear, can't a good game be it too?\n\nEven that you can't move freely through it, the environment is rich in details, the story is well narrated and the protagonist is so captivating that you want to discover her past and help her cause. For so many times I just relaxed and started to take screenshots to remember the places and the action scenes.\n\nThe combat system is quite fun. While you advance in the game, you can mix buttons to create COMBOS and easily execute them. But, this is not the BATMAN ARKHAM SERIES combat system, so you CAN'T have a free flow between enemies and link the created combos. So don't expect huge combos like DEVIL MAY CRY for example.\n\nThe Memory Remix is quite a piece of art. You really feel like you are in command. You can and you will modify people's memories to change history. And it's so easy and fun, that it invites you to try different combinations just to see what happens.\n\nIf you're not a big fan of Achievements, just let the game take you through the story. I started to look for colectibles like an Achievement Hunter and soon the game became boring. So I just started to play the game despite of looking for trophies and it was a much better experience.\n\nSo, to summarize it:\n\nNice story, great soundtrack, captivating protagonist, amazing memory remix moments and everything placed on a beautifull, yet limited, fantasy world.\n\nPlay it, you sure will remember.\n\n","September 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sure, its very linear; but not every game has to be open-world.  Games with a strong narrative, such as Remember Me, would not work very well as an open-world game (the devs would have to impose annoying restrictions on where you go in the open-world anyway to enforce any kind of narrative).  So, if you're looking for GTA or something, this isn't for you.\n\nThat said, the story is very compelling: you are a memory hunter whose memories have been stolen in a future-parisian city where memories can be traded, bought, and sold.  The gameplay reminds me of something like Uncharted or Tomb Raider where you have to climb around, jumping and hanging from ledges.  The fighting, which can get a little repetitive is like a not-as-good version of the fighting from the Batman: Arkham Asylum games with some sci-fi elements thrown in.  However, the memory remix sequences were some of my favorite parts and something truly unique to Remember Me.  Basically, you can scroll through someone's memory and make tiny alterations to change how they remember what happened; for example, you can turn the safety off on their gun and move a stool slightly, causing them to trip on the stool and the gun to accidentally fire, shooting someone else.  The soundtrack is also really amazing; I sometimes listen to it while working.  Graphically, the game is pretty impressive, especially the remix sequences and other memory areas, which are very stylized; especially when you use 3x1 Eyefinity :)\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that the fighting can get a little repetitive.","November 27, 2013","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art direction on this game did very well on making the game less frustrating - I wouldn't mind fighting the same boss about three times if it meant I could experience that kind of eye candy again.\n\nOf course, a game isn't always just about the visuals - I love the variety of the gameplay. You climb, puzzle and fight your way through different levels and along the way you gain more skills and moves that you can combine in a variety of ways. It did take some time to get used to it, though. The combat is different from what you'd expect, so be prepared to fumble around a little bit.\n\nOverall, this game had everything I expected it to have. Character/racial diversity? Check. Gorgeous holograms and environments? Check. Linearity? Check. That satisfying feeling when something works? Definitely check.\n\nI love this game.

Beginning with the "Remember Me". I'll try to keep the spoilers away.\n\nThis game, gameplay wise, is decent. It's not as amazing as I thought it would've been and, at least at the beginning, you have no influence on what's happening. But playing this game to see the beat'em up is the wrong thing to do. It's as if you were playing Deadpool for other reason but to listen to him.\n\nIn fact, you should play this game for its story. It just drags you in. It sucks you in. You will want more. It's like watching a good movie. I've had problems with stopping myself to play more and more, but I finally did. I really do love everything story related. Characters are amazing. Background is amazing. The gimmick that's in the game's description is amazing. I can't wait to play more of it, but... after the initial few hours, I'm damn amazed.\n\nGo get it.

Long time since I played a game and I said "Okay I stop now cause it is too good I don't want to finish it so fast...."\nThis is definitely one of those games that just makes you sit in front of it eagerly to see what is going to happen cause damn it is so interesting.... the story just sucked me in and gripped on me....... the athmosphere is amazing so are the soundtracks landscapes and the fighting aswell. The bossfights are cool almost each has something new. So much to say, but I don't want to make you bored if you spare time to read this, so I  try to be short.\n\nOverall there is no problem with this game everything just fits it really good the character became one of my favourite tho I did not finish the game yet. Maybe some little detail will change by then but definitely not my opinion about the game overall.\n\nBut ... nothing is perfect. On  the other hand it has some tiny issues. I rarely had some camera bug (maybe cause of the pc port or I dunno...) but sometimes I just turned the screen with mouse and boom stuck in wall no idea where the heck I am. O.O But it barely happened so it is forgetable. Lets see what else is here.... well yeah what I really did not like in the beginning is when the quick time events pop up the buttons are unique... I mean for instance the left mouse button is  for kicking and in the quick time event it shows a leg. At first I had no idea what the hell is the game asking me to do so I had to check the buttons in options.... it is not really something negative just if they really cared they could have make better signs for players like an actual mouse with a glowing right button like in other games as we got used to it. But okay this did not ruin anything in 2-5 mins you can get used to it. The most annoying was the lack of freedom. We have to stick to the storyline and there is no chance exploring Neo-Paris that really disappointed me cause it looks BEAUTIFUL. (okay not everything like the sewer is really not a fancy place xD) But seing the Eiffel Tower in game... lights on. (I never been in Paris and only saw pictures) it was amazing and I loved it.\n\nWell since I can't think of anything bad but a bunch of good things...

I really do not like the combat in this title, which is a shame, as that is a majority of your gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are ...okayish, I am not big on who has the flashiest styles, so I don't care, but you might.  It is built on a dated engine, but it performed well.\n\nSo with combat and graphics out of the way, let's talk about the camera...\n\nRather, let us recall the days of camera locks and auto follows that kill you.  That is where we are at here, absolutely malfunctive camera, I died a lot due to falls caused by unwanted camera movement and it is also locked at times so that you cannot position it how you would want to see. Combined with the controls and you find death happening quite a lot if you don't watch out.\n\nOkay, so camera, controls, combat... all suck, graphics are okayish... WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?\n\nWell, honestly... the voice acting is pretty bad too... but the story is good, cliche at times but there is a lot of interesting stuff to think about after playing, or while playing.\n\nI don't think this game was intended to be a blockbuster hit, but they did do a good enough job to interest me in their ideas and story.  The things they invisioned for the future of many technologies being worked on or existing today.

It is as playing through your favorite sci-fi book or film interactive. Visuals, colors and the whole neo-paris concept is great.

It is well balanced, and linear gameplay is really important for the story. The sandbox fever of nowadays would destroy it.

It certainly has been a while, and I just know you’re all itching to read another page long review (This is the part you skip to the end, read the summary and leave.) Today you’re going to suffer through a review of a game that got huge amounts of hype, but was neglected when it game out. “Why?” you ask. Don’t interrupt me; I’m going to tell you why. What’s wrong with you? I go to all the trouble to write a review for the game, and you just come on in like you own the place. God, the nerve of you readers. Anyway, let us begin.\n\nRemember Me is set almost 80 years in the future in “Neo-Paris.” (Which is future talk for “Paris.”) Society has been completely ruptured and as a result of new technology known as “Sensen” that allows real memories to be digitised, manufactured, sold, bought and traded. Because of this, people have chosen to remove or replace any bad memories. This has drastic effects on people’s personalities, which we see often in the game when a single altered memory can turn friend from foe. Throughout the game, we see too very distinct classes. The upper class, who live in a beautiful utopian society, without any cares. This contrasts with the majority of people, who live in decaying ruins, desperate for money, work, memories, Ect. As you can see, this game has an abstract, beautiful concept, above and beyond most games produced now (*Cough Cough FC3 Blood Dragon.*)\n\nYou take on the role of Nilin, an errorist agent who fights Memorise, the company who owns Sensen and have developed an immense power over 99% of the population, who are virtually addicted to Sensen. Nillin’s past shows her to be an elite errorist agent, capable of not only of stealing other’s memories, but altering and rewriting them. This power unlocks a unique mechanic that I’ll talk in a minute. You start the game in the clichéd manner of amnesia, having you memory recently been entirely wiped. The voice of the errorists, who goes by the name of “Edge” is the only thing that gets you out of the prison you and the other errorists are being kept in. As the game progresses, we see what the Sensen technology, despite having good intentions, has done to the world. In prisons, prisoners have their memories taken from them to prevent rebellions. People who have become so addicted to the technology, they’ve lost everything trying to afford it. However, as your actions, which are influenced by edge, have extremely negative consequences which impact on many innocent people, you start to doubt if you’re a vigilante, or a renegade.\n\nNow, moving on to mechanics. Remember Me’s combat is primarily based on combos, comprised of left and right clicks and dodging. The basic idea was, you were given a combo. (E.G Punch, kick, kick, punch, kick, kick) and you can change the effects on these different attacks (E.g., one of the punches could do extra damage, another could heal you slightly, Ect) The dodging system was integrated quite well into the combat, with the exception that if you dodged, you would have to restart the combo. The system was very good, especially when integrated with different unlockable abilities which were all creative and innovative, and a single ranged weapons, although, neither of these things was crucial to combat. I liked the combat system all in all, what I didn’t like was how clunky it felt. Often, because there was no particular was to select your targets (which I honestly didn’t mind, don’t get me wrong) you would attack whichever enemy was closest, in range and looking at. This system reminded me of the Batman: Arkham series, although, unlike the Arkham games, there was no easy way to move from target to target. In fact, it was almost impossible. Another problem was that sometimes you would try and fight an enemy, and the game would outright choose a different target. I don’t blame the developers for this, but allowing freeflow would’ve reduced this problem. Finally, I found that combat was often too busy, especially with enemies such as Leapers, who could jump onto walls and stay there before producing an attack that can only be dodged. This meant that, if fighting a hoard of leapers, one would constantly have to be dodging, and that can be a bit trying, especially when you were unable to complete any combos.\n\nThe platforming aspect to the game had its problems as well. Every level design, regardless of how unique the art style, felt linear, like the world was closed, and didn’t exist short of this one path. The game even threw in little arrows on platforms you were meant to jump on, which was nice of them but really did take away the challenge of a platformer with such a strong puzzle aspect, although it was, undoubtedly, necessary, as the paths didn’t stick out like a sore thumb like they do in Assassin’s Creed (Seriously, God in that game must’ve been a parkourist.) All I’m saying is that this game would’ve sold much better with a slightly more open world.\n\nI’m going to touch on the art style and soundtrack by saying that they’re both great. The art style really brought to life the contrasts of the classes of Neo-Paris and the soundtrack contributed heavily to the atmosphere\n\nFinally, the mechanic that allows Nilin to enter somebodies memory and alter it was simply astounding. The way it was structured was a little bit of a trial at the time, having to re-watch the same cutscène over an over again to find memory glitches (Things in the memory you can change) and having you go back and select different glitches to change the outcome was tedious, especially because you had to deselect everything before re-watching the cutscène to find out what was wrong. Not even mentioning how memory glitches were only fractions of seconds long. I didn’t miss any memory glitches (Their animation was just the right amount of subtle to make it difficult, but entirely possible to find them if you were paying attention) but rewinding and replaying and pausing and fast forwarding and rewinding again trying to land on the exact place where the glitch was, was severely annoying, especially later on when they become even shorter.\n\nSUMMARY:\nLook, this game really tried to be a classic. Its storyline, art style, soundtrack and voice acting easily qualify. However, the clunky mechanics and linear environment didn’t work in the games favour. I enjoyed playing this game, but only for its storyline. It almost felt like it would’ve made a better movie than a game.\n\nStoryline 10/10\nMechanics 4/10\nArt style & Soundtrack 9/10\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\nThanks for reading.\nP.S, the game is pretty demanding of your computer, maybe free up some space or improve the RAM.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/recommended/228300/","wudichao","谭松韵seven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/","514 products in account","Remember Me takes place in Paris, year 2084. In this context people has developed into a point where memories can be digitally stored and even modified, both good and bad ones. At this point of the history, some people gets full control of all those memores storage and hierarchy is still a never-ending conflict. You take control of Nilin, a young girl who lost her memories without knowing why (obviously) and wakes up into a prison cell. I won't speak more because of spoilers.\n\nNow the pros, cons, and specially why I disagree with official reviewers.\n\n- First of all, the mechanics of the game are simplistic and nothing innovative at all. Combat system is nothing from the other world and even though you can create your own combos the feature is not as squeezed as it could. Moreover the camera movement can become your greatest foe at some points.\n\nHowever... honestly, who would care about those mechanics? Almost all new games are just a remix from others of the past. All action games are inspired by other action games, just like FPS games (which is the best example). Was someone actually looking for something new in the combat system? As long as controls are tight and responsive, I'm OK with that. And they are in this game, so just move along.\n\n- Graphics are very beautiful. The city is astoundingly cool and I didn't expect to find this mixed aesthetics between old-fashioned, modern and cyberpunk. If you go for minor bugs, invisible walls and locked doors, you'll find plenty. But seriously, this game was crafted to follow a story, so why the hell would you enter into a clothes shop anyway?\n\n- Soundtrack is awesome. A mix between orchestra and future music suits perfectly, and so it's demonstrated into this game. It's a very cool feature and you probably won't be disappointed with it.\n\n- Average difficulty is insultingly easy. I've played action games on Easy mode harder than this game on the hardest settings. Chill out a bit and for your dignity just pick hard difficulty from start 'cause you won't have a trouble.\n\n- As I said, camera can be problematic. I'm fine that during the exploration, climbing and jumping parts the camera moves for me so it focuses on where should I be looking at, but during combat and some specific times it is just killing.\n\n- Length is OK. I've just beated the main story in about 9h, and I'll probably need another 3-5h to get all the achievements. Just the average for a story-driven game.\n\n- The game is linear as hell. No submissions, no shortcuts, nothing. The game just drives you where it wants to, so if you're looking for a sandbox-like, look elsewhere. As for me, I'm OK when games are linear if I ALREADY KNOW they're gonna be one.\n\n- The story is very catchy and will keep you for more. It's the main feature of the game and at least for me in wasn't disappointing in any state. It won't be the best storyline you'll play in a videogame, but it's a good one. A GOOD one.\n\nAll in all, Remember Me has been a very enjoyable experience and I wouldn't mind replaying the game. I seriously think that official reviewers can't enjoy games anymore. They just purchase them, grab their shotgun and instead of focusing on what's the purpose of a game, they simply try to find as many flaws as possible in order to make their "objective" analysis. FFS, if you look for flaws into this game, you'll find TONS OF; the thing is that no one should care at all. So stop looking for perfection in every aspect and play the game for the story.\n\nAs I'm ignoring these mechanics garbage, I'll tell you what actually would make the game not that enjoyable to you:\n\n- The most remarkable con I found is that the game constantly treats you like an idiot. It takes your hand in EVERY way, even on the climbing thing. There's no space for thinking; exploring; doubting; discovering. It's like you live in an endless tutorial. Hints are cool when you're familiarizing with the controls 'n' stuff but not for the WHOLE game!\n\n- [MAYBE SPOILER] The Memory Remix feature is incredibly interesting and sadly developers didn't take all the potential it had. I know you should just mix the relevant characters' memories, but goddammit it's so good it's actually THE THING that keeps you for more! I wish there were more stuff like this, since this is what can make me enjoy a triple A game.\n\n- Collectibles. I hate collectibles. They're usually an artificial way to keep you playing a game against your will so I put it as a con, as I'd do in any game.\n\nAll in all, this game caught my attention way to much time ago and now that I've played it I don't regret any euro I've spent in it. I'm a fan of cyberpunk games and dystopian backgrounds and this game has been a drug to me. In a good way. Don't let official reviewers fool you: this game is very cool and they're focusing their analysis in an unfairly biased way.\n\nFinal Mark: 8/10","November 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Heilvetica.\n\nThe plot focuses on a society where memories are a commodity to be transferred, bought, sold and traded and uses this plot element very sparingly in gameplay - mostly a handful of sequences where you get to mess about trying to alter someone's memories. Some attacks and special powers are "explained" by using the ability to transfer and alter memories as a catch all, but it's a complete joke. In practice the takedowns and abilities have Jack and ♥♥♥♥ to do with memories, and Jack left town.\n\nThe plot appears to have been written by someone throwing things together in an attempt to get you moving about, as though he or she came up with a vague idea for Paris in the 2080s and then just kind of tried to give you a reason to go around beating up random people and mutants with weird weak points and jumping over things.\n\nSo, meh. It's not a bad game. It's not really a good one either. It's a pretty game (design-wise).","January 19, 2014","false","5.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Levels are just straight lines with glowing pointers . You don't even need to search secrets, they are shown to you on big golographic screens. Combat is dull and boring. It's stripped from Batman series without any innovaton. The idea of Combo Lab (constructor of your own combos) is great, but poorly implemented: you have 3 preset combo chainas and you can't change the lenght of the chain or type of moves. And btw you have just two types of moves (hand strike and leg kick), so all your combos wil look pretty identical. Also it's nerly impossible to chain combos in the large group of enemies, because switching between targets breaks your combo.

Does developers have a challenge between themselves who can think of most ironic title for a game? Do they then have little award ceremony where the most creative dev gets awarded with a box of Jack Daniels tells acceptance speach and drink himself to the sleep? But I digress, Remember Me is a classic beat 'em up game that is set in not so distant future where everybody is sharing the memories through new technology called SenSen. I can't imagine myself sharing any of my awkward memories with anyone, but in this game it feels like memories are being shared like unflaterring pictres of you on facebook. Game starts with a commercial of different people telling about their experiences with the memory sharing technology and how it has improved their lifes to some extent. After that you see the protagonist somewhere in hospital with her memories being erased. From there you progress regaining her memories and special abilities.\n\nThe Plot\nThe protagonist is a memory hunter, a person, that steals and sells certain memories of certain individuals. But Nilin is special, she can also remix memories as she pleases. In the very beggining of the game, Nilin's memory is wiped and someone called "Edge" helps her to escape medical facility she's in. As Nilin progress she enters a sever where she encounters her first enemies. Mindless and deformed, these things is an example what happens when you overdose on the memories and overload your SenSen technology. You will meet many variations of so called "leapers" with specific way to dispose of each them. There's plenty of characters you encounter in the journey, but unfortunately, all of them are boring, stale and you can't relate with them on any level. The new task is given to a player: to regain all memories. And so the quest begins.\n\nGameplay\nFrom the first look the gameplay resembles what would we get if we frankenstein Deus Ex: Human Revolution visuals with Assassin's Creed (1) clunky controlls, but with fists. I wouldn't call it good since it gets boring real fast due to linear corridors and repetitive nature of the game.The only redeaming feature I really liked is assembling your own combination when you want. There's different types of hits you can add to your combination: healing, to slightly reduce cooldown of a special skill, hit that deals more damage and a hit that doubles the effect of previous hit. You then can add them in particular slots which are marked with 'fist' and 'foot'. I found myself using short combos that you get at the very beginning because they are easy to pull off and with good timing you can land them easily, dealing great amount of damage. I expected better scaled difficulty as my first play through I was Memory Hunter difficulty (hardest possible), but all I got was artificial difficulty when enemies deal more damage, you do less damage and it takes a lot more effort to kill bosses. Unfortunately, the unique parts of the game were so short that they were over in a blink of an eye. Thats right, Memory remixing. Another thing I didn't like was quick time events in boss battles. It's especially irritating when you see a strange icon on the screen and you can't tell which button to press and the only way to know is by trial and error. And lastly, the cutscenes are unskippable and it ruins fun for those who already completed the game once. Overall gameplay is pretty poor, but bearable enough to finish it at least once.\n\nConclusion\nThe reality is that the game is bad. You can't skip cutscenes, combat quickly becomes a chore, quick time events, lack of customization, poorly written, uninteresting characters and dialogue, boring boss battles. This game won't be temembered, as title suggest.","March 24, 2015","false","32.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","10","19","3","0"

The Soundtrack could win an Oscar. Boy, what could they have achieved with it. But when it comes to interaction: Zero.\nAs marvelous the world may look like, there is nothing you can do beside walking and climbing the marked path. There are even screens indicating the locations of secret items, though it would be hard to miss them without the hints. And even the fighting scenes are boring and repetitive.\nThe whole game consists of cutscenes, predefined paths, cutscenes, innovative but stupid minigames and cutscenes.\nThe gamer’s part is minimal. If you are in to cinematic games with minimal interactions, grab it.

Hope it helps for those considering to purchase this game!\n\nStory, Art, and Characters - Simply amazing. Everything in the game has great textures and you can see the developers really focused on making sure the graphics in every scene were done carefully to ensure a complete masterpiece. The story is very interesting, as you watch the main character struggle to find her identity, struggle with morality, and the broken society. If you like philosophy, you may enjoy this game as it quotes some historic guruus.  The cutscenes are unskippable which makes replaying some levels a pain. Also this is a straightforward, single-result (meaning no different endings) type of game with no side-missions or quests.\n\nGameplay - Standard fights are repetitive, relying on the same button combos and limited variety of enemies. Often, I had to put the game down because the gameplay was too repetitive and not fun. However, the "remixing of memories" a feature used 4-5 times in the entire game was a blast and I wish the developers made that more prominent in this game. In addition, it took me about 8 hours of gameplay to beat it once through without searching for hidden items or achievement hunt.\n\nIf you like a game that has beautiful art that takes "Inception" to a completely different level and that you don't mind putting down due to repetitive fighting and moving around the areas, then this should definately be a consideration to add to your library:","October 14, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From slums to the heights of society, every level is exquisite and well designed. In the nicer parts of Neo-Paris the enviroment has this polished clean look that adds to juxtaposition of the ramshackled slums and sewers. Overall graphically it is a very stunning game.\n\nNow gameplay. There are few things to talk about here. One is combat mechanics. This game takes an interesting approach to melee Arkham like combat. It has customizable combos, which can be accessed and altered at any time through the Combos Lab. This is a really cool idea and I love the game even more for it. The second thing to talk about is the memory remix sections. This is where you remix a person's memory so that their perception of reality is shifted in one case turning enemy into ally. This is a part of the story and part of the more morally questionable aspect of the protagonist Nilin.\n\nLastly the story. I have to say I loved it. But then again I'm a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre. If you don't like cyberpunk stories than you probably wont like this one. I thought is was a brilliant depication of a dystopian society masquerading as a utopia.\n\nLast advise: If you plan to get this game use a gamepad. With these melee combo centred games I prefer to use a gamepad. It just feels better.","November 1, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A bit too little explanation about how to fill in your combos in the combo lab. Not nearly enough space showcasing the fascinating memory remixing. Some of the indicators make it almost embarassingly easy to get through areas.\n\nUpsides: Original mechanic in remixing memories, parcore like Assassin's Creed, attractive graphics, pleasant voice acting, rememberane mechanic as a story element and challenge.\n\nAll in all, I was expecting more out of this game.

My expectations weren't just met, but blown out of the water. While there are many aspects of this game that closely resemble Oni, it has been created with all the gusto and complexity one can expect from a modern game. The gameplay was overall intuitive and straight forward. The combat was lots of fun. It felt just as nice and flows just as smoothly as Oni did, but with more.... everything. More moves, more dynamics, more customization, more varying gameplay, more challenges, just... more!! It is a brilliant mix up of action and adventure.\n\nThe only reason i give it a 9 and not a 10 is because of the limitations set. I wish there was a greater ability to go exploring. In a game that's as well finished as this one i don't want to be stopped.\n\n...And i wish i could zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.\n\nGame ambiance: 9/10\nThe sound ambiance initially seems somewhat minimalist, but play a little longer, and you'll find it's just right for where you are at any given time. Great use of post production effects, subtle noises, and dynamic music helped to create a convincing reality that is easy to be immersed into. The visual ambiance was fantastic. People, birds, rain, sunshine, fog, day, night, wind, water, flies, bugs, i could go on.\n\nReliability/Stability: 10/10\nThis game was created with the Unreal Engine and i had no issues with stability or CTD.\n\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nA good action/adventure game needs a strong plot and Remember Me leaves nothing to be desired. An emotional roller-coaster; It's deep, touching and enthralling. The story is well written with all the twists and turns needed for an epic tail. Just when you think you have it figured out something new is thrown into the mix to keep your attention and maintain enthusiasm. It encourages you to want to know more, and it's not until after hours of gameplay you finally blink, take a breath, realize it's 4am and that you probable should get some sleep.\n\nNot a game for kids though. Violence, suicide themes, language and alcohol use warnings apply here.\n\nConcept: 10/10\nWhile the idea for the gameplay isn't original, the concept on which the game is based is very creative. I can't say much about it without giving anything away, suffice to say there's nothing more it needs. Well conceived, extremely well finished, exceptionally well done.\n\nConcept execution: 10/10\nThis game was created so beautifully that i wanted to explore places that weren't plot related nor necessary.\nThe way this game takes you on a journey is truly awe-inspiring. Evey where the plot takes you, every emotion it conjures, every environment explored and every skill it calls upon is a reflection of the high quality, high standards and an extraordinary ability to convey an idea through a game. The Capcom/Dontnod team has really delivered what might be called a master piece; change little, continue the story and bring on Remember Me 2!!!!! This is possibly the best action/adventure game in the last 10 years.\n\nTextures: 10/10\nVery, very nice. The textures add exactly what is needed in this complex 'Remember Me' world. Not once did i think "that could have been done better". Variations, lighting, subtleties, randomness, bump maps, ray-tracing. So much eye-candy it's breathtaking. Enough said.\n\nModelling: 10/10\nOne word, spectacular. So much work has been put into the modeling in this game it's unbelievable. It's been a long time since I've played a game that has left me smiling at every turn while I gasp in astonishment. It is so well constructed i was only too happy to walk through the game rather than run. I felt compelled to really take in the whole picture, detail and scale of what has been created. I feel privileged to be able to witness game creation on this level.\nThe use of motion capture adds a fantastic element of realism and fluid movement to the people and adds to the game's overall charm.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nThe execution of the graphics as a whole is just awesome. HDR lighting was just right. Volumetric effects were spot on. In a word: Seamless.\n\nSound: 10/10\nExceptional production quality in Dolby with lots of different sounds throughout the game. I can't think of a place where a sound was needed or out of place. Dynamic, big and precise.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nExcellent production quality and dynamically changing the music adds just what is needed. Very well written and creative compositions by Olivier Deriviere and the Philharmonia Orchestra. It gets the blood pumping and the heart beating. What more could you want? ...Possibly the soundtrack.\n\nAdjustable shadow mapping: No\nBonus/Extras: unlockable in-game concept art.","July 8, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This eerily convincing dystopia has elements of Deus-ex, Ghost in the Shell and Mirror's Edge at times.\n\nNote: Recommend using a Gamepad\n\nPros:\n- The world is stunning with a lot of care and attention to detail put into it.\n- The storyline and characters are excellent.\n- The soundtrack is excellent and compliments the world perfectly.\n\n\nCons\n- There are QUICK TIME events on boss fights that ALMOST ruin the entire experience (They are infrequent enough to allow the rage to subside though). Whoever thought putting those in was a good idea needs a wake-up slap!\n- Players of Rocksteady's Arkham games will find the combat frustrating due to a lack of counter in particular.\n- The world cries out to be explorable, so it's disappointing it isn't.\n\nThe gameplay features a well paced mixture of physical puzzle solving, combat challenges and memory-remixing puzzles (one of the more interesting and thought provoking-parts of remember me) and although the sequence-based combat takes a little getting used to, it IS pretty satisfying when mastered, especially due to the dynamic music that follows the combos.\n\nI feel critism has mainly been raised against the combat system as players have been spoiled by the (exceptionally good) combat in Rocksteady's Arkham series. However it is worth noting that the lack of counter and quick cut off when trying to continue a combo after dodging can be frustrating.\nThat said, Nilin, while capable of pulling off some ridiculous jumps, feels very 'human' as a result.\n\n\nI also think the main reason this has received critism is that it had the potential to be so much more and so perhaps did not quite live up to the expectations of some. For example:\n\n- The memory remixing could have had multiple outcomes in the current day depending on your choices (rather than just finding the "Right" solution)\n- The world is so well presented that everyone wants to explore it and interact with npcs, but can't.\n- WTF QUICK TIME EVENTS?

Beautiful set pieces, a nice soundtrack, interesting original story, well realized setting, and a main character who is both powerful and vulnerable, and defies a lot of game character norms, really make it something special. The only things that the game is let down by is being extremely linear and not having the best combat system ever devised. Neither of which bothered me tremendously, especially since the combat isn't broken, it just gets repetitive. Oh, and the dialogue outside of cutscenes is a little... awful to the point of being unintentionally funny in places.

Just as she is about to be sent to a jail cell, she is broken out. It is revealed that she is a memory hunter and is a key asset to help a rebel group take down a big corporation that wants to mind-control people.\n\nThe combat wants to copy the free-flow punching and kicking that was present in the Batman games, but it falls completely flat on its face. You are given set combos consisting of punches and kicks that are stronger as the combos become longer. However, longer combos are only unlocked as the game progresses. As soon as you unlock a longer combo, the shorter ones become obsolete. So you end up only repeating the one combo over and over again throughout the game.\nYour combo is also interrupted if you are hit by enemy attacks or by taking too long between hits. You can dodge the very telegraphed enemy attacks, but some dodge animations are so long that your combo is stopped anyway.\nThere are also no AoE attacks except a few special moves that are used very rarely. As the game progresses, there are more and more enemies in any given battle, so it becomes very difficult to actually perform a combo.\nThis becomes very frustrating and artificially inflates the difficulty of the game.\n\nThere is significant platforming in this game. However, unlike Tomb Raider, you have arrows telling you where to jump, which defeats the purpose. It's a series of 'follow the instructions'.\n\nThe story is interesting for the middle part of the game, but becomes extremely contrived towards the end. It feels like the developers tried to put in as many plot twists as possible.\n\nThe redeeming feature of the game is the memory remixes. You are able to view the memories of some people and change small details to change the outcome of the memory. In one instance, you change a man's memory to make him think that he killed his wife, which drives him to commit suicide.\n\nYou could play this game if you have a spare 10 hours, but honestly, it's really not worth your time nor money.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting aesthetic style\n- Memory remixes - a pity that you can only do this 4 times in the game\n\nCons:\n- Boring and frustrating combat\n- Platforming is disinteresting and is used to pad out the game\n- Story picks up slowly and then becomes contrived towards the end.\n","August 5, 2014","false","14.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You're playing a lot for the environment and plot. If you've missed playing combo games, perhaps you're playing it for the fighting. Once you get the hang of how to time combos, the battles become interesting and not too challenging on the normal mode.\n\nDownsides: Learning the symbols and remembering the controls if you aren't playing in one long stretch. A bit too little explanation about how to fill in your combos in the combo lab. Not nearly enough space showcasing the fascinating memory remixing. Some of the indicators make it almost embarassingly easy to get through areas.\n\nUpsides: Original mechanic in remixing memories, parcore like Assassin's Creed, attractive graphics, pleasant voice acting, rememberane mechanic as a story element and challenge.\n\nAll in all, I was expecting more out of this game. It was an excellent idea and there are beautiful scenes and cute 'puzzles', but a lot of times the mechanics managed one way or another to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game as opposed to providing an interesting challenge.","February 11, 2014","false","10.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Then to only to be rewarded with the game not proceeding and having to repeat the entire experience.\n\nThe premise of this game is interesting enough, you have a memory hunter, an "errorist" of the most extreme sense a political terrorist to take down the big bad corporation. Yadda yadda ya. First big problem: game crashes on Ch 0. Worrisome. Game cache to fix, downloads 1.1gb of missing data.... okay? How on Earth was that not installed?\n\nThe story gives an illusion of choice. There were huge forks in the story where a good/bad moral choice system good have been implemented but Capcom decided to go on an rails route- which really makes for a wholey underwhelming story. The character debates through internal dialogue scenes about how her floating head compatriot Edge might be "good or bad" and he's "super militant"- that's great- but we literally have no say, and we're shoved around in the story to do his bidding. If we just had our memory wiped (this is no spoiler, you're literally exposed to that in the first second of game play) wouldn't we approach things with a different perspective?\n\nThe game mechanisms are boring, the combo system is boring and has no rewards. I just set up the 5 and 6 combo to basically be healing and maximum PMP/recharge gain. Never died unless I wanted to.\n\nSummary of this stupidity:\n\nGameplay: 4/10- at least you could combo somewhat seamlessly, the finishers had no variability and no bonuses for using them\nStory: 7/10- interesting premise, horrid execution\nOptimization: 2/10- when it worked it was incredibly pretty... when the bosses didn't bug out and you were stuck running around in an arena with the bodies of the slain\nProtagonist: 4/10- Boring and repetitive, could be interchangeable with any of the other "mainish" cast members, suffers from a marionette storyline and dialogue\nOverall character design: 8/10 pretty interesting of like... the 4 people you get to interact with. -2 for stupid enemy design with MMO gradient leveling (i.e. this bug is red instead of blue so is therefore higher level)\nOverall: 5/10\n\nWould not recommend.

These are not wholly visible until suddenly they bring the game to a standstill. You are thrust into fights with enemies and combinations of enemies designed like puzzles but which are ultimately frustrating when presented to you over and over again.\n\nRemember Me suffers from curious game design choices which leave the player confused, when simply working through menus or when he or she should be having fun. The memory remix puzzles are at first exciting, but without any clear goals and precise understanding of cause and effect, you soon realise just how prescriptive the puzzles are and thus dependant on trial and error.\n\nSo that's a huge caveat. Why then, do I recommend it? The combat can be worked through with patience. The irritating bosses and memory remixes can be solved with guides. After all that, there is a very interesting world to experience (to a point, as almost nothing is interactive unless its an enemy or game resource) and the story is memorable.\n\nThe gameplay, however, can evoke memories you might prefer to erase.","March 7, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game introduces the mechanic of 'memory remixing': entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained.\n\nStory:\nThe game begins as Nilin, an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize.

You do not know who you are. You know you are alive. But your memories are long forgotten. Thrown into unfamiliar territories and shaken by orders in the face of adversity. How do you adjust to the reality you are confronted with?  A piece missing from the shift of boxes labeled blank and new and old. Constantly triggering new emotions, reactions, and actions, and all that remains? To Remember...\n\nDontNod developers seek to engage gamers in a unique third person action/adventure game featuring a amnesiac female struggling to regain her memories in a world of corrupted corporations and the lingering doubts that plague her consciousness. Remember Me is a fascinating third person, action, adventure, plat-forming game. Featuring Nilin, a memory hunter with the power to remix memories, subjected into a world where memories become products in the daily sci-fiish dystopian world of 2084 largely taking place in Neo-Paris. Where memories are an integral part of human society that can be tweaked, bought, corrupted, and made.\n\nAre your memories truthful? Or filled with nuances in memory?\n\nJumbled, fragmented, hacked, and tweaked. Imagine any precious memory you hold dear, become erased or tweaked to suit the user willingly or unwillingly.\n\nKeeping that train of thought we emerge with Nilin, in an ironic sort of twists starts off with having her memories erased and it is up to you to restore them and take down the corporation called Memorize because a dude compels you to. That’s it. But wait! That’s not all; enter a uniquely crafted world built by DontNod in their own depiction of Neo-Paris which I found to be strangely inviting albeit colorful in the design aspect of the game. No two places I came back to have the same environment used in the graffiti, advertisements, the paintings, slums, the vibe of the combined essence of sci-fi buildings coupled with merging it with past architecture in a sort of high tech, but with a stroke of homage to the works of old. The combination that resides from mélange (meaning mixture) creates a very awe-inspiring setting to behold. Attention to detail not only in levels and cinematic places were carefully fleshed out that for a moment I felt like I was in Neo-Paris a la 2084.So much so that I had “Woah,” “Wow,”during my blind playthrough on Hard difficulty and even moments of “meh.” These moments of “meh,” are primarily in the game-play elements...\n\nThe Wow and Meh\nFirst off, I would like to highlight a unique aspect of Remember me in one of their game-play mechanics to go back into a person’s memory; re-live the memory through a 3rd person omniscient observer playing god. You can troll the users in the memories by tweaking it, a nudge of a folder, an open product of which was originally shut-off, or perhaps kill the client outright. It is an interesting mechanic the likes of which I can’t seem to remember a similar game like this. These moments are where the game truly shined. For not only does the memories give some insight into the story itself, it allows a great respite from the tedious combat levels.\n\nHowever, the game is not just built on a point and click adventure where you can re-mix memories at your disposal. Using punches and kicks only.\n\nWhile, I raise an eyebrow at such a design choice, I have mixed feelings for the brawling mechanic, not that it’s bad far from it, but it isn’t certainly exceptional in my eyes. To be frank I spent a lot of times hitting my enemies through the punch and kick style only. Through most if not all the game. My enemies were ridiculously hard. I was limited to only kicking and punching them along with 4 special abilities (60 sec cooldown’s) different from my combos. I mixed and matched my combo’s with a punch here and kick there with a combo spared in there. I felt it was tedious albeit tiresome to complete a level after a cut-scene, plat-forming a bit, walk and gawk at some artwork (Mona Lisa comes to mind) and then come back full circle against spongy enemies just to progress through the main story. I spent a lot of time mixing up my combos one’s that give health, extended combo times, and a lower cool down reduction combo’s helped tide the minor annoyance. In retrospect I think I should’ve gotten the dlc to get more combos... But... I’m a cheapskate so I didn’t think I need it. Nevertheless the game play brawling style didn’t hold a large amount annoyance to merit a negative in the game; I’m just “Meh,” on it.\n\nSince, there were different enemies that progressed in the story that made me think of ways of how to effectively kill or shut them down made such an annoyance to a dull and mixed satisfaction when coupled with intervals of the cut-scenes to move the story along, with an interesting short cast of 10 not including the enemies. A cast of which told enough dialog to get me to become intrigued enough to be focused into the story and enough to move the story that had me guessing of how did Nilin lose her memories and why I have to take down Memorize. The soundtrack also helped keep my interest within the game throughout all of the game which was a plus in my book in adding atmosphere to each level. The boss battles too were versatile enough to not be a generic run of the mill buffed up enemy you see from around the corner. And troublesome in a good way to be different from the previous bosses and later bosses that allowed me to bear a grin on my face after countless failures most of which were my fault for being slow on the Quick time events to finally succeed.\n\nWhat is Remember Me?\nFor Remember Me,\n\nIs a bold new i.p.  game that quite frankly is an underrated game. Remember Me stands on a plateau with her head held high that can with time can become a truly great franchise with time and effort. It’s by far not a horrible game, and holds a certain amount of originality to its name to entice newcomers to try Remember Me and satisfy gamers with an appreciation for new Ip’s and action adventure games.\n\nA moment of peace in a troubling world where the past can become anew, something marvelous, something enjoyable and pleasurable, beyond the scope of horrible reminders of grief or horror is that not a worthy memory to have?

Very interesting.\n-No bugs, total controller support on Win 10.\n\nCONS:\n-It's completely linear (well, I don't really care if it's linear, but I hate when games constantly shut doors behind you so you can't go back for, say, missed collectables, unless you start over the entire chapter).\n\nAll in all, a good underrated game, even though it's not the best.

Genius innovation let them change their memories... and corrupt society with that. Gameplay is medicore - there's a lot of building jumping that resemble lower class Assassin's Creed mechanics. Combat is nice, as you can make your own combos. Still, it's pretty easy most times, except could enemies that has worst design ever and will take your time only because you need to wait for your abilities to get off cooldown. Overall it's medicore game, with nice idea, but pretty medium execution. If it's low price (I got it for less than 9 euro) and you want something for no more than 6-8 hours in this setting, then go for it.","November 1, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skullsgate/recommended/228300/","skullsgate","Skinner Sweet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skullsgate/","199 products in account","This is a great game, one of my favourites. From slums to the heights of society, every level is exquisite and well designed. In the nicer parts of Neo-Paris the enviroment has this polished clean look that adds to juxtaposition of the ramshackled slums and sewers. Overall graphically it is a very stunning game.\n\nNow gameplay. There are few things to talk about here. One is combat mechanics. This game takes an interesting approach to melee Arkham like combat. It has customizable combos, which can be accessed and altered at any time through the Combos Lab. This is a really cool idea and I love the game even more for it. The second thing to talk about is the memory remix sections. This is where you remix a person's memory so that their perception of reality is shifted in one case turning enemy into ally. This is a part of the story and part of the more morally questionable aspect of the protagonist Nilin.\n\nLastly the story. I have to say I loved it. But then again I'm a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre. If you don't like cyberpunk stories than you probably wont like this one. I thought is was a brilliant depication of a dystopian society masquerading as a utopia.\n\nLast advise: If you plan to get this game use a gamepad. With these melee combo centred games I prefer to use a gamepad. It just feels better.","November 1, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're playing a lot for the environment and plot. If you've missed playing combo games, perhaps you're playing it for the fighting. Once you get the hang of how to time combos, the battles become interesting and not too challenging on the normal mode.\n\nDownsides: Learning the symbols and remembering the controls if you aren't playing in one long stretch. A bit too little explanation about how to fill in your combos in the combo lab. Not nearly enough space showcasing the fascinating memory remixing. Some of the indicators make it almost embarassingly easy to get through areas.\n\nUpsides: Original mechanic in remixing memories, parcore like Assassin's Creed, attractive graphics, pleasant voice acting, rememberane mechanic as a story element and challenge.\n\nAll in all, I was expecting more out of this game. It was an excellent idea and there are beautiful scenes and cute 'puzzles', but a lot of times the mechanics managed one way or another to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game as opposed to providing an interesting challenge.","February 11, 2014","false","10.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I've read lots of bad comments about this game on steam forums before it's been released. All the ppl were complaining about short story(5-8 hours) and boring repeative gameplay. At first i worried about it. After completing this game all i want to say is: stop listening all these gaming community "review" made by CoD fanboys! This game is all about story, this is not another dumb-♥♥♥ action-shooter-call-of-duter with lots of explosions and no sense at all. Gaming site reviews are false too. You can't review this game by a demo or few first missions. And about gameplay... Yes, it's good if you'll play at least half of this game. Remix memory puzzles, awesome boss battles which are pretty diffirent and not repeative. But as i said before this is not about gameplay, this is story-based game. If you're going to play it just for lulz - skiping all cutscenes and not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about what's happening in game - do not buy it, save your money for another dumb shooter about bad russians or islamic terrorists. Also 5-8 hours is false too! I completed it on medium difficulty in 10 hours.\nSo what was idea of my review? Don't listen to all these kids screaming on steam forums and buy this game for 10 hours of great story.\n9,5/10 for a not as great fighting system as it should be. I think it's totally worth-buying game. And i also think it's gonna be one of most underrated games of this year.\nThanks for reading!","June 6, 2013","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Yeas, the game has its problems, but it makes up for it big time.\n\nThe Good– The atmosphere and the level designs are top-notch. The future is futuristic but not far-fetched, and the memory-excange aspect is really thought out on how it may affect society. The graphical design really helps too.\n– Remember Me is almost purely story-based and it shows. The voice acting is decent at worst, great at best. The story itself unfolds in a perfect rythym and the two large and several smaller twists are not too clichéd to make them tiresome.\n– The Memory Remix minigames add an easy but very unique puzzle type in a somewhat "timetravel changes the future" kind of way. Depending on your taste they may be the absolute high or low point of the game. (Though in latter case you probably wouldn't pick it up in the first place.)\nGranted, the combat difficulty may vary for people. It's usually pretty easy even on highest difficulty but there are two ro three arena fights that are gimmicky and really frustrating.\n– The music is just plain awesome.\n– The achievements beside "kill n enemies" and "do x move n+1 time" are really fun to do, a rare thing in most games.\n\nThe Bad– Unskippable cutscenes. And since the game is story-heavy it makes up almost half of NG+. It really hurts replayability.\n– Linear level design. The levels are very unique and make up for it somewhat but you are always on a corridor no matter what.\n– Short. Playing it casually can net an about 8 hour gameplay, I finished every achievement in little less than 20 with two playthroughs.\n– Combat and camera system can be against the player soometimes.\n\nThe Neutral– Though many people complained about the controls I found the PC controls very well ported, combat was easier for me than in the Arkham games. The only bad point is the Spammer (your "gun") which most of the times would simply not go into aim mode.\n– Combat may seem repetitive as you use only four combos over and over but the Combo Lab customization system is pretty  innovative and makes combat a somewhat tactical challenge that can be adapted to various play styles.\n\nAltogether I'd say that the game is worth it for the story only, it's so good that you can replay it over and over again just like your favourite movies.

The lore and backstory to the world is a different take on usual dystopian scenarios. On the downstide for the most part the game couldnt' get much more linear if it was a simple straight line. And I'm sure "invisible walls" went out many years ago. Or are at least better disguised. But those are minor points.\n\nSoundtrack is also awesome and fits in well with the game.\n\nStory was great. (I'm sensing a theme here :) )\n\nThe combo system was an interesting mechanic I haven't really come across in other games. It worked well, albeit somewhat frustrating. In fact, my main peeve with this game was the damn combat as it's mostly nothing but mashing the left or right mouse button (with a few special actions thown in as you progress). Another letdown was the combat scenarious as time and time again they would trigger some foes to fight, then as soon as you dusted them off, they doubled the number of foes and had you go at it again. I didn't enjoy that, although the difficulty wasn't that hard really.\n\nGameplay wise was nothing special - lots of platforming and with some akward camera angles at times. It worked though.\n\nAs I said, the story was interesting, thought provoking, and easily capabably of producing a range of emotions. Without going into specifics for spoilers, I found one aspect of the remix sequences to be somewhat disurbing, doubly so when it was revisted towards the end of the game. However, as with so many things, it's down to personal experiances - and if you've never experianced this thing in RL, then you probably won't be fazed by this sequence in game either.\n\nSo I found the combat flawed and the story disturbing at times but everything else top notch and well worth the play time.\n\nHopefully some other games in this world will be released in the future.","October 19, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was hyped up about this game for several reasons (female protagonist for one! As a  gamer who happens to be a girl I can't have never enough of female-centered games) and I really, really wanted to like this one, but I just...can't.\n\n-The game design is not ideal (ie some camera angles while interesting and "artsy" could hide visual clues about the path you have to follow, not to mention they may cause motion sickness esp during fights, there is almost no interaction with the environments and ZERO with NPCs, etc)\n-The combat system isn't that good either\n\nThese are just two examples of why the whole experience isn't particularly pleasurable, nor satisfying. And besides, I found it buggy. NGL, I lost count of the number of times I kept kicking or punching and the controls weren't responding for long seconds (funnily enough, dodging worked fine all the time). That said,  I HAAAAATE how the bossfights have been set up. Actually, this is the main reason why i'm rage-quitting Remember me even though it pains me to do so: the bossfights. UGHHHHH. I'm really not interested in playing the same thing over and over just because random glitches were freezing some of my controls or because at the last second I messed up the QTE sequence. And speaking of, QTE sequences. Seriously?!?\n\nOn the plus side, the memory remixes? Niiice! The combo lab was a good idea, but I wish TPTB had made it more flexible (more combos with no restrictions on the assign-able slots).\n\nI can't tell much about the story or characters' backstory cos I got stuck before I could form a solid opinion. They seemed promising though.\n\nI would have LOVED RM had it been Open World. Seriously, Neo Paris looks so good and interesting.\n\nTL;DR. It could have been an amazing game. It's not. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's certainly lacking in some regards. My heart says give it a positive review for the effort (and it does look GOOD) but my brain says nope, solely for the less-than-stellar fight system.

Neo Paris is simply stunning. The presentation and artwork "Remember me" offers isn't seen very often and I can't praise the level of detail enough.\n\nWhen you start the game your character Nillin had forgotten nearly everything. She has to escape from a dystopian prison in which the prisoners are robbed of their memory. In the grand scheme the story is nothing really new, but I really liked the character development Nillin undergoes and the the fact that all the characters in the game have a real motivation for their actions which you can understand. The twists in the story aren't as obvious as in other ganes but at some point you'll know in which direction the writing will go. And while the story may be not original, it is told really well while it doesn't start to get boring. Overall I needed about 10 hours to beat the game and I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nYou acquire a variety of skills and abilities which you can use while fighting or while solving little puzzles. All of the abilities are enjoyable and useful. You will need every combat skill from time to time which is assured through the variety of enemies you face. While the combo system could have been a little bit more thought out, it still was fun to switch around the different kicks and punches.\n\nThe boss fights were memorable, at least three of them were really great. The amount of enemy waves you have to face sometimes can get a bit tedious but most of the time I didn't thought that I was just fighting for the sake of it. I'm not really a big fan of platforming so Remember me did it exactly right for my taste which means, it is easy as hell. It's really hard to miss jumps and even in situations where you're under pressure you can always count on the auto save system of the game which is never far behind in case you die.\n\nThe most fun I had in the game was when I mixed my first memory. With the help of a mind controlling glove you can go into the mind of certain NPC where you're able to play with the memory of a certain event. I really felt like I was playing "Final Destination - The Game". You try out different scenarios in which you try to kill certain characters. While all only happens in the memory of the person you're mixing at the moment it still has big consequences in the end. Mixing plays a huge part in the story and is really well implemented.\n\nOverall I had a great experience, the game may not be perfect in every aspect but it did a lot of things really well. I was satisfied with the ending and the experience I had. In the second half of the game I became emotionally invest in the characters and how their story might turn out which doesn't happen very often in those type of games. If you're remotely into brawler games with a good portion of platforming and a great story, you should try it out.","October 24, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The controls feel sluggish too which makes it even worse.\n2. Fights: The fights aren't terrible but winning mostly comes down to your dodge timing. The configurable combos are cute but not really interesting all you do is "low health => regen, need special ability => cooldown reduction, non of the former => damage"\n3. Memory remixing: These sequences - in which you have to change somebodys memory of an event - usually allow you to interact with 1 to 5 objects in the memory to change their outcome. What the result of an interaction will be is however usually impossible to guess and so you end up brute forcing them.\n\nThe story isn't particularly good either. Pretty average video game story with a few extra plot holes.\n\nThis game loses to Batman: Arkham City in every aspect.","October 25, 2014","false","11.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You will find yourself climbing more than Nathan Drake and Lara Croft ever had to in their entire life till you face a battle scene with henchmen who call you ''lil lady'' even tough Nilin (main protagonist) is like 30 year's old, you try to fight them but you realise that you can only do 3 thing's punch, kick and dodge. There are 2 things that try to fix the boring combat first a menu called combo lab wich lets you augment your punches and kicks with different properties like healing or cooldown decrease for powers. Then Powers wich will buff you with more strength or stun all enemies around you but these are not enough to save the combat from feeling boring and repetitive.

Nice graphics, world design, concept and music. However, the gameplay is the definition of mediocre, with the main gimmick of memory remixing not being utilized enough, and not quite delivering in execution. It's quite a trial and error affair with some really absurd, illogical solutions. It can be fun to see the different outcomes, though. The "combo customisation" is arguably false advertising, you're just placing effects in pre-defined slots. The game's worst crime is it's mercifully irregular QTEs because they tell you what to do rather than what key to press (As in it will display a kick symbol rather than the right mouse button). This just makes them less intuitive and more difficult than they should be, meaning you might have to do them a few times.\n\nGame seems to be reasonably well optimised, it runs pretty good for me (i5 4690, GTX 960, 8GB, Win 10).\n\nPick it up heavily discounted if you're curious.

I kept going back to it in the hopes it would get better or grow on me.  I really did want to like it.  The graphics, music, story and characters truly are all great and I loved the artistic world that has been created.  The game truly does *look* great.  What lets it down is everything else.\n\nThe trailer gives you the impression that the game centers around being able to modify peoples memories.  From that I had gotten the feeling that you could "stealth around" enemies or convert them rather than rely on direct confrontation every time. Sadly though the memory remix moments are few and far between and they are (like the game in general) far too linear, there being only one "right" way to remix the memory.  This seems like a bit of a missed opportunuty in my opinion, there could have been so much more focus on the memory scrambling and altering abilities in the game.\n\nWhat little story there is between chases, telegraphed bosses and too-long quicktime chain cutscenes made me want to carry on to see how it went. The story is actually compelling and interesting and I wanted to see if/how the character could grow.  But time and again the QTE based fighting and QTE based running away along with the stiffling train-track limited "open" world the game was just ruined.\n\nI liked the main character, her self questioning, her reassessment of what she had become forcing us to question our own motives and morals.\n\nBut with a combat system that is more an exercise in futile button mashing and enemy avoidance than actual combat I really cant recommend this to any but the most die-hard of QTE fans.","October 23, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"remember me" is basically unplayable.\ni had hoped the game gets better but at episode 3, i have lost all hope.\n\nwhat is the problem? well, first of all it is a long corridor of a game, there is no exploration, the world is dead and cannot be delved into. occasionally, the game throws two choices of directions at you, one will lead to a bonus pick-up, the other continuous the corridor. it is not obvious which is which but if you are unlucky to choose the continuous path first, the game will put a wall behind you which prevents you from getting the bouns from the othe path.\nsome of the vista look interesting with people and shops, but these cannot be interacted with, so there is practically a detachment between what you do and what is going on in the world.\nThis is re-inforced by the way of traversing the environment. climbable areas are marked by flashy graphics or distance indicators. this could be a horizontal ridge in 2 meter height. this you could jump to. but don't expect to travers a small barricade of 1m cardboard boxes. these are insurmountable barriers in the game.\noccasionally you will reach the end of a corridor, surrounded by high walls. from the konowledge of the world you would know because of lack of indicators that you couldn't possibly "escape" that area. yet, the game will bring up a cut scene which makes it somehow possible. this becomes predictable soon.\n\nthe point is, the game is completele unintuitive, things that should be logically possible are not, impossible things are somehow possible. eventually, you feel mucked by this, because the game forces you onto a path that you couldn't possibly comprehend as a person in the world in advance. you are stumbling through corridors...\n\nthan, there are fighting scenes. the system is kind of intruiging, but umplayable because of the out-of controll camera. it basically surmounts to panic clicking of buttons while the camera gives no view of what is going on.\n\nfinally, there are scenes of "memory manipulation" while the control mechanism is a joke, this was the only part that was interesting in the game, because you get intrigued about what effect each manipulation had.\n\nperhaps the game would have been more interesting if they had cut the traversing in corridors between memory manipulation mini games.\n\ni cannot recommend this game.\n","November 15, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would however like to see a sequel made where they improve the flaws in this game's design.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are many good things about the game: such as the setting, the graphics, the story and the main character (it is nice to have a brown coloured main character for once and the main character's design is really well done).\n\nBut the good things aside, it is the flaws of the game that really hold it back for me and ruined the overall experience, for me.\n\nThe first issue is the combat; it uses preset combos that you can customise, from the moment the game introduced the combat in this way I knew immediately - oh boy this game's combat is going to get very repetitive very fast! The issue when you have combos that are completely fixed with the same identical animation and same identical button combo each time is that it means you just have to keep pressing the same button combinations over, and over, and over the entire game long. Yes, you can change the combos but all it changes is the effects and the animations of the combo; the button presses remain the same. E.g. left click, right click, left click, right click. Sorry but I can only stand repeating this so often.\n\nThere is a power for Batman style freeflow combat, but it is only temporary and feels a lot less satisfying than doing a combo which actually seems to do more damage than the freeflow power. It would have been cool if the freeflow power allowed unlimited combo as long as you could keep the combo going without a break in the combo (yes, I know, like Batman). This would have helped quite a bit. There are other powers you can use and if you damage some opponents enough you can use finishers, which are cool. But these only go a short way in helping the overall issue that is the combat in this game. It may have been interesting if you simply could customise the combo effects at different stages of the combo and the animations simply cycle through the ones they have made for that effect - this way at least you have more animation variety and this would allow them to give greater customisation to the combos. E.g. you could pick speed over damage and such too, which currently is not the case. Picking the same type of combo attack with a different animation does only that - same damage, same speed, just different animation.\n\nIn addition, they could have allowed constant freeflow attacks but that do not give you a bonus effect and also reduced damage. These are just a few ideas and I'm not even a game developer.\n\nThen there is the platforming, in general it works but it has many issues with the controls and doesn't always work or do what you want. There are times I've made the same identical jump two times, one time she just randomly decides to fall right through the ledge she was supposed to grab, the other time she grabs it no problem. Then often while going around corners or trying to jump across a gap she just refuses to go the direction you want no matter what key press you push. I don't know if this is due to the port or if this was also an issue on the console versions but definitely is something they should have fixed. If not at launch, at least with an update!","November 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the storyline is excellent and the overall atmosphere was great. A few things that lack in this game like a parry system, there is no way to block incoming attacks. The chevrons that tell you where to go next take all the fun out of trying to get to the next area and the lack of exploring (none of the shops, etc) you only have a set path to follow. Also, the mobs are the same and are a little annoying and repetative. This game also has a function where you can rewrite the past and tap into peoples memories. This happens 4 times and is challenging but makes the game feel as if it lacks content as it is limited. Overall, the lack of open world explorability combined with the repetaive mobs and the lack of game content made me sad.

But putting my rant aside its worth a play!\n\nIt has 8 Chapters and even though the game looks like a constant Neo-Paris look all the time (Thanks to screen shots and trailers) it actually has a nice amount of scenery ranging from soaking wet metal tiled fortresses to the grassy wastelands fules with toxic pools and it is by no means a P.N.0.3 styled game (If you dont get that reference then its something you have to play to understand).\n\nAll in all it has a story that will suck you in with no effort required and a control system you will adapt to just by starting the game so..... get this game!","May 25, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It commits nearly every cardinal sin of gaming. It's repetitive, annoying, spammy and every single bossfight is done via quicktime events. There isn't any point in the combat system that i'd say "Yep, it's fun". It's just a series of endlessly respawning dudes while you mash the LMB. I say mashing the LMB because at a certain point in the game, it just becomes too much work to actually get a combo out without being interrupted or having the system spazz out and switch your combo halfway through.\nAnyone who was thinking of buying the game for the story, like I did, think again. The premise is interesting but the game has plenty of plotholes, along with the long despised "Get the story narrated in the load screen then never speak of it for the rest of the level" style that so many people seem to go with.\nNot to mention, Nilin isn't incredibly interesting. For all the hype the game got about "demanding a female character" I can't think of a single reason why, other than to make their game completely parallel with Tomb Raider. Nilin has little to no personality. Not once does she stop and ask herself WHY she's doing the things she is. She escapes the people who stole her memories and then just automatically listens to the first guy she meets. For all she knows he's actually the evil one, but not once in my entire playthrough did she even consider it.\nMind you, I only got in halfway to the game cos I was so infuriated by the first half. It was not fun, and I have no intention of dragging my way through the muck for an ending that may or may not ever redeem the rest. Buyer, you have been warned.","April 4, 2014","false","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is just so beautiful!  But it is just so painful to play!  The biggest problem is that the core of the game is the fight mechanics, which are terrible button-mashing gymnastics to get the right combo for the right enemy at the right time.  Meanwhile, the parts of the game that are actually /awesome/ -- editing of memories, and exploring the beautiful world -- is only used a tiny number of times.\n\nI really want you to spend your money on this game, because I want some stuffed shirt in an office somewhere to think that building great neo-cyberpunk is a safe bet.  But I just can't in good faith recommend it.\n\nYou know, there's an art book for this game.

I kept going back to it in the hopes it would get better or grow on me.  I really did want to like it.  The graphics, music, story and characters truly are all great and I loved the artistic world that has been created.  The game truly does *look* great.  What lets it down is everything else.\n\nThe trailer gives you the impression that the game centers around being able to modify peoples memories.  From that I had gotten the feeling that you could "stealth around" enemies or convert them rather than rely on direct confrontation every time. Sadly though the memory remix moments are few and far between and they are (like the game in general) far too linear, there being only one "right" way to remix the memory.  This seems like a bit of a missed opportunuty in my opinion, there could have been so much more focus on the memory scrambling and altering abilities in the game.\n\nWhat little story there is between chases, telegraphed bosses and too-long quicktime chain cutscenes made me want to carry on to see how it went. The story is actually compelling and interesting and I wanted to see if/how the character could grow.  But time and again the QTE based fighting and QTE based running away along with the stiffling train-track limited "open" world the game was just ruined.\n\nI liked the main character, her self questioning, her reassessment of what she had become forcing us to question our own motives and morals.\n\nBut with a combat system that is more an exercise in futile button mashing and enemy avoidance than actual combat I really cant recommend this to any but the most die-hard of QTE fans.","October 23, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"remember me" is basically unplayable.\ni had hoped the game gets better but at episode 3, i have lost all hope.\n\nwhat is the problem? well, first of all it is a long corridor of a game, there is no exploration, the world is dead and cannot be delved into. occasionally, the game throws two choices of directions at you, one will lead to a bonus pick-up, the other continuous the corridor. it is not obvious which is which but if you are unlucky to choose the continuous path first, the game will put a wall behind you which prevents you from getting the bouns from the othe path.\nsome of the vista look interesting with people and shops, but these cannot be interacted with, so there is practically a detachment between what you do and what is going on in the world.\nThis is re-inforced by the way of traversing the environment. climbable areas are marked by flashy graphics or distance indicators. this could be a horizontal ridge in 2 meter height. this you could jump to. but don't expect to travers a small barricade of 1m cardboard boxes. these are insurmountable barriers in the game.\noccasionally you will reach the end of a corridor, surrounded by high walls. from the konowledge of the world you would know because of lack of indicators that you couldn't possibly "escape" that area. yet, the game will bring up a cut scene which makes it somehow possible. this becomes predictable soon.\n\nthe point is, the game is completele unintuitive, things that should be logically possible are not, impossible things are somehow possible. eventually, you feel mucked by this, because the game forces you onto a path that you couldn't possibly comprehend as a person in the world in advance. you are stumbling through corridors...\n\nthan, there are fighting scenes. the system is kind of intruiging, but umplayable because of the out-of controll camera. it basically surmounts to panic clicking of buttons while the camera gives no view of what is going on.\n\nfinally, there are scenes of "memory manipulation" while the control mechanism is a joke, this was the only part that was interesting in the game, because you get intrigued about what effect each manipulation had.\n\nperhaps the game would have been more interesting if they had cut the traversing in corridors between memory manipulation mini games.\n\ni cannot recommend this game.\n","November 15, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would however like to see a sequel made where they improve the flaws in this game's design.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are many good things about the game: such as the setting, the graphics, the story and the main character (it is nice to have a brown coloured main character for once and the main character's design is really well done).\n\nBut the good things aside, it is the flaws of the game that really hold it back for me and ruined the overall experience, for me.\n\nThe first issue is the combat; it uses preset combos that you can customise, from the moment the game introduced the combat in this way I knew immediately - oh boy this game's combat is going to get very repetitive very fast! The issue when you have combos that are completely fixed with the same identical animation and same identical button combo each time is that it means you just have to keep pressing the same button combinations over, and over, and over the entire game long. Yes, you can change the combos but all it changes is the effects and the animations of the combo; the button presses remain the same. E.g. left click, right click, left click, right click. Sorry but I can only stand repeating this so often.\n\nThere is a power for Batman style freeflow combat, but it is only temporary and feels a lot less satisfying than doing a combo which actually seems to do more damage than the freeflow power. It would have been cool if the freeflow power allowed unlimited combo as long as you could keep the combo going without a break in the combo (yes, I know, like Batman). This would have helped quite a bit. There are other powers you can use and if you damage some opponents enough you can use finishers, which are cool. But these only go a short way in helping the overall issue that is the combat in this game. It may have been interesting if you simply could customise the combo effects at different stages of the combo and the animations simply cycle through the ones they have made for that effect - this way at least you have more animation variety and this would allow them to give greater customisation to the combos. E.g. you could pick speed over damage and such too, which currently is not the case. Picking the same type of combo attack with a different animation does only that - same damage, same speed, just different animation.\n\nIn addition, they could have allowed constant freeflow attacks but that do not give you a bonus effect and also reduced damage. These are just a few ideas and I'm not even a game developer.\n\nThen there is the platforming, in general it works but it has many issues with the controls and doesn't always work or do what you want. There are times I've made the same identical jump two times, one time she just randomly decides to fall right through the ledge she was supposed to grab, the other time she grabs it no problem. Then often while going around corners or trying to jump across a gap she just refuses to go the direction you want no matter what key press you push. I don't know if this is due to the port or if this was also an issue on the console versions but definitely is something they should have fixed. If not at launch, at least with an update!","November 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Between an unfocused story line, weak dialogue, a hamfisted approach to making the game cinematic, a repetitive combat system, a poorly thought out exploration system (exploration is downplayed because the game is completely linear but there are little pick ups for those willing to take a few steps off the path, some of them flesh out the lore of the game, which could just be available to the player from the start) and a basically non-existent attempt to blend the story and the game aspects, the only real thing going for Remember Me is the distinct visual style. The game is gorgeous but bland, the only gameplay aspect that really mixes things up is the memory remix mechanic, which is utilized in game 4 times throughout the entire thing, for a total of less than an hour of any kind of unique experience.\nJust don't bother.","May 30, 2015","false","13.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Enjoy hanging on rails, an awful combo system, and a stupid remixing memories gimmick videos.   Its like a video game made by people that have only heard of video games second hand and did an awful job of mimicking what they think video games might be.   The plot is stupid, the soundtrack awful, and is basically an awful mix and match of parts that don't work together.\nNo amount of memory remixing could make you think this game is good.\nOh and the camera is laughably bad.","May 14","false","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Horrendous! Got of to a good start then turned to crap at kid xmas battle. What an annoying piece of crap, it seems not to fit with the rest of the game.I think they should have put more time into making more out of the puzzle solving in the game, there is so much going for the game overall. Its pretty interesting and occaisionally challenging trying not to fall to your death! That is what is unique about this game, and it has such a great interesting main character, and is very original, and has a fantastic style. I am continuing playing it, as the good outweighs the negative slightly, such a shame to add in the generic boss battles when it already has such cool atmosphere and protagonist!  I dont recommend due to the boss battles, which i think sucked.","May 31","false","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
