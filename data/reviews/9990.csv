Don't get me wrong, the game up until that point is barely a borderline 5/10 as it is. I tried the demo and thought well the mixed reviews are probably just fanboys hating on it. Turns out the demo is the only good thing about the game. After level 6 it goes downhill bad. This game is sooooo generic. Painfully bad graphics, animations, and the weapons are horrible. There are no hit indicators when you shoot something or it hits you other than your lifebars decreasing. That's it. The beam is good but the yellow wave weapon is bad and the blue single shot weapon is god awful. So the part where this game finally got a quit/uninstall for me was the graveyard, around level 8 or maybe it was 9. The levels are all recycled by the way. You revisit levels throughout the whole game. So in a certain section in that level it swarms you with blue flyers and yellow ground things and you can't move to the edges or yellow hands will down you. It is probably the hardest part of any game I have ever played. I tried probably 30-40 times for an hour then by luck got to the next section. The next section was the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing: getting downed quickly then the rest of the team gets wiped out. I have seen the game over screen in this game more than any game I have ever played. I don't care who you are, you are going to get downed over, and over, and over again. In later levels, good luck ever getting picked up by your teammates. They do way less dmg to enemies than you do and if there are enemies on screen while you are down they most of the time won't pick you up. They can't anyway because one hit stops the pickup bar and thats it, they are basically dead by getting swarmed.\n\nI have never seen the difficulty spike so fast in any game, ever. If you had 4 real people playing that level might be doable. Might be. This may be the hardest game I have ever played and for all the wrong reasons. All of them.\n\nCrushingly generic, without the difficulty spikes into nearly impossible sections without 3 other human players, this game would barely get a 6/10 from me, maybe a 5.5. With those problems considered, it lowers the score for this horrible piece of ♥♥♥♥ down to a 3/10. Pass on this even if it is free.","July 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","30","36","4","3"

Those rookies battle a supernatural menace in the form of an ancient demon who comes back to life, bringing with him to New York City hundreds of ghosts.\nThe tasks are always the same. Walk into a room, get locked into said room and defeat ghosts - repeat. The  mechanics are incredibly broken, the AI is terrible and the mission structure is incredibly backwards.\nGraphically, Sanctum of Slime is acceptable but unimpressive. All the items on the screen, from the Ghostbusters to the enemies to the environment, are well-drawn and colorful, but there isn't a whole lot of personality, detail, or realism to the art style.\nThe sound does not fare much better. The lack of voice acting hurts and the music is repetitive and not memorable. The only good thing, however, is that the original theme song is included.\nSanctum of Slime is a real bad game. If you want to enjoy a good Ghostbusters game you better should check out Ghostbusters: The Videogame.

In this game you get NONE of those you get four new generically designed politically correct multiculture pals to play with.  The ghosts repeat themselves, the bellhop ghost makes sense in the hotel level, but what is it doing in the Sewers, or in a sanitarium?  The game feels like its made by third graders, or some comp sci project for an undergrad more than an actual game.\n\nThe core mechanic of the game revolves around shooting different colored beams at different colored enemies.  This would be interesting except when all those colors are on screen at once, making the core game mechanic annoying.   No patch, and no bug fix will fix the core game mechanic of the game being annoying.  But hey the game has a high score counter!  in fact your not allowed to finish a mission until you smack the keyboard entering random letters to show off your high score.  Must be made by devs who worked on old atari games because I guess they never got the memo that high scores dont matter in modern games.\n\nWho ya gonna call?

This could have been a very good game if the game had more development time and some patches, if it was more of an RPG style shooter, or if the money you earn could actually be spent on weapon upgrades then it would be so much better.\n\nThe A.I is terrible,  you don't get nearly enough health before being downed and then it takes far to long to be rescued, on boss fights its pretty much 'game over' and you'll have to start the entire boss fight from scratch resulting in a signficant amount of frustration.   This game desperately needed online co-op to have any form of success.\n\nIts far too linear for its own good, often revisiting the same location with newer and tougher ghosts to kill,  the end of level bosses are exceptionally frustrating and take waay waay too long to weaken, all the time the boss can easily one shot you and your entire team leading to more game over screens -  get used to seeing those game over screens by the way, it happens way too often.\n\nThe only saving grace and I mean this scarcastically, is the Ghostbusters comic book style story, and the original Ghostbusters soundtrack - - thats its, the actually gameplay is very poor.   I don't recommend this game unless its part of a sale or bundle.\n","July 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

Short version: It's not good.\n\nYou play as four Ghostbusters... but not Egon, Ray, Peter, or Winston. Four other Ghostbusters. The game was designed entirely with 4-player multiplayer in mind. On the consoles you could play online, but for PC they decided to remove that feature. Single player means 3 AI partners...\n\nHere's how the game will go. Enemy attacks can knock you down sometimes in a single hit, and you have to wait for one of your partners to help you up. What will happen is that when you go down, then the AI Ghostbuster nearest you goes to help you, and they will be knocked down by that same enemy. Then the third one does the exact same. Then the last AI partner does the exact same thing. Game Over. This will happen every time.\n\nThe other Ghostbusters game, however, was excellent... but it's been removed from the Steam store.","October 27, 2011","false","0.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game was on sale for $1.99 when I bought it, and that makes it worth playing.  If I had paid the full $10 for this, I would be as disappointed as the other reviewers.\n\nThe game has alright graphics, the controls are fluid and easy to use, and it's Ghostbusters...but other than that...man, this game is hurting.  The camera angles will get annoying really fast, the ghosts throughout the levels are jokingly easy to kill, especially when playing the single player because the AI locks on to them as they are spawning, except for the "boss" battles which is annoying in it's own way because they have a huge amount of health and kill you in one hit...Another small thing is the fact that you play as some no name, random "new" Ghostbusters because the original crew is just "far too busy and tired".  But you know what is the worst part...all of the small things aside...the game is meant for four player multiplayer but some brilliant person decided to make it local multiplayer.  Cramming four friends on one keyboard is just dumb, one person gets ASDW and the mouse and the rest have to figure out how to play around that person.  Luckily I have a wireless xbox controller and only ONE other person that wanted to play with me, so we were able to do it with little problem...but seriously, if I wanted to play with a few friends, this would just be ridiculous.  I'm going to give this game a recommendation only because I paid $2 for it, and I feel that it is totally worth that...but if you are thinking about buying it I would wait until it goes on sale again.","November 26, 2013","true","0.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Ghostbusters!!  Is a twin stick shooter and it's pretty damn fun, but one of its major appealing options is also its worst.  Coop.  Yes, it's fun local 4 player couch coop, but nothing is online and that's too bad.\n\nThe game has 12 stages in total and even on normal difficulty it can get quite challenging.  You have 3 different weapons at any given time.  Each weapon is color coded toward the enimies you are fighting.  There's Red, Blue, and Yellow guns.  Easily toggled between each other.  And the final weapon is the ghost trap.  These are only usuable on the end of stages bosses.  Who ever throws the trap out gets a mini quick time event challenge in order to trap the ghost.  It's not hard and it awards the player with more points.\n\nEach stages story progresses from the last in a comic book style story telling including the end game credits.  All which were kinda boring especially when all I was looking for was more twin stick shooting.  Pretty fun and worth a shot if you have friends coming over for some couch coop action.","September 13, 2015","true","11.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

Local COOP only, no online but I knew that going into it.

This game took me about 3 hours to finish and i got 8/12 acheivements. lol\n\nSo for the bad - At first I thought the idea of different colored weapons but in the late game this is more annoying because the AI team doesn't seem to "get it".  The boundries of each screen are not clear and you find yourself hitting an invisable wall when being chased.\n\nThe AI team was so bad in the graveyard that I beat that entire area each wave when my three teammates died in 1 minute.\n\nI would recommend if you have a friend in your house and some beers for a fun - ONE time action filled afternoon.

Naturally I bought the game due to my love for the Ghostbusters franchise, but the gameplay is imbalanced and boring.  Between levels you are forced to endure a comic which isn't bad, but it does take too much time.  I do say forced, despite the option of skipping the comic, but there is an achievement for sitting though them all.\n\nOn the plus side I do like the design of the game.  Though the level design was repetitive with you revisiting the same map on a few occasions I still enjoyed the atmosphere the production team created.  My main complaint about the game is the movement.  The playable characters move very slowly, and the game play consists of you and the other three members of your team being swarmed by fast moving specters.  These apparitions are also capable of shooting swarms of projectiles and can cause your movement to be slowed, creating a situation where your death is inevitable.  So common is your death in this game it seems to me that the developers tried to compensate by incorporating your innumerable demises into the overall gameplay.  This combined with the moronic AI for CPU players makes the game nearly impossible to complete on your own.  "Why don't you get your friends to play with you?" might be the obvious question, to which the answer is, I am the only person I know dumb enough to spend money on Something with as bad a rating as this pile of ♥♥♥♥♥ merely because it's a product license I like.\n\nBottom line, I would not recommend this game as it is to anyone.\n","July 13, 2014","false","4.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Second like I mentioned above it's a Twin Stick shooter, they don't work that well with Keyboard and Mouse, so you must play it with a controller. Third, there no online co-op so if you don't have a friend or four additional controllers your left playing the game with the A.I. companions, who would rather revive you than shoot the boss with 1% health left.\n\nThe game feels more like a cash-in for another Ghostbusters game because the 2009 one was so successful, like Ghostbusters 2 it lacks the magic and charm of it's predecessor. I only mildly recommend this to those who are obsessed with all things Ghostbusters (like myself)\n\nAlso for the the longest time this was the only Ghostbusters game on Steam, thank goodness the 2009 on made it back, so get that one instead.\n\nPS.

This can be due to most ghosts targetting you, instead of which ghostbuster is closer.  Healing becomes impossible because AI ghostbusters (like most AI) are stupid, and don't have good prioities.  Also, ghosts get insanely ramped up in damage and in numbers.  Nothing much missed if you don't buy.

And it just ain't good enough.\n\nTough game, I don't recommend it.  The top down style is okay, the AI controlled ghostbusters are not.\n\nI don't think it is a big deal that you don't play as one of the original 4 ghostbusters.  If they do Ghostbusters 3 with an all-female cast, are people going to say it is terrible because we won't see one of the 3 surviving 60+ year old Ghostbusters alumni getting slimed?  No, we are going to say that it is terrible because they will try to glossy it up with sex appeal or something else that doesn't belong in the Ghostbusting universe (except it was kind of funny when Ray got head from that vapour).\n\nBack to my thoughts on the game...well frankly I'm already bored of thinking about it.  That's just the problem, there is no attachment to the characters or much of a storyline, it just doesn't capture the spirit (no pun intended) of Ghostbusters.  This is more like Smash TV, just shoot and dodge and move on.\n\nSomething a little closer to the Nintendo DS version of the Ghostbusters game would have been good.  Actually getting to drive (and control) ECTO 1 would be good.  Using traps to catch the ghosts would be good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehnuffster/recommended/9990/","tehnuffster","Nuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehnuffster/","302 products in account","To be honest, my hopes were not high when I picked up this game on sale. It looked pretty simple and pretty bloody ugly but surely it'd be worth a quid or so? The game powered up and there was the sweet, sweet sound of the Ghostbusters theme, my eyes teared with joy and I danced. Hopes were raised and then instantly dashed as soon as I started playing it.\n\nIt seem that the theme was what they spent 90% of their budget on because it sure as hell wasn't the game itself. It fails at the most basic of tasks with the weapons more often than not completely missing where your crosshair was aiming, this is especially noticeable on the blue plasma gun thing. Yes that's right they decided to give you fancy new weapons. They are utter ♥♥♥♥, but they are there. The other alternate weapon to the classic proton pack is a spread fire yellow monstrosity that is about as effective as attacking ghosts with a wet sock.\n\nWhat makes it worse is you don’t even get to ignore these less than stellar bonus weapons as for some bizarre reason the game devs decided that busting ghosts required us to play a fun, fun game (read: entirely not fun) of match the colours. You see ghosts have decided to bring out their summer range of ghostly glows and are colour coded in Red, Yellow & Blue. Red can only be slain with your proton pack, yellow is reserved for the wet sock gun and blue is for you misaligned plasma weapon.\n\nAll this high octane 'gameplay' is spread over something around 11 levels. Only there is only 5 maps (excluding the last boss battle map) so you play through the dull selection of maps, Hotel, Sewer, Graveyard etc. only to have the pleasure of playing them again, with minor changes. Not that'll you notice any of the changes because they are still uglier than a pitbulls ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Special mention goes the to the half on rails shooter sections in which you are driven around on the back of ECTO-4WD, a 4x4 version of the iconic Ghostbusters car only this time driven by what can only assume is a London cabbie off his face of crack. Just when you think things can't get worse the final level before you are faced with the uninspiring giant demon last boss baddie is a map where you get to fight each of the bosses you have defeated one by one. OH FUN!\n\nMaybe things wouldn't be so bad if the AI was apparently programmed to act like baby ducklings. Baby ducklings with highly dangerous weaponry and suicidal tendencies. When they aren't all trying to hug each other for warmth (while unleashing proton beams into each other faces) they are pinning you to the wall so the ghosts get to chew your face off, or my favourite, using the wrong gun to attack ghost. See, even the AI thinks it's a ♥♥♥♥ idea to have colour coded ghosts! It probably wouldn’t be as bad if every ghost on the screen seems to target the human player, leaving you sprinting around with a comical conga line of monsters behind you while the AI 'busters discusses amongst themselves the finer points of window licking.\n\nNow I suppose this could be solved by having three friends play alongside you, which I suppose is true. Yanno, if you have some friends you really, really hate because they won't be friends with you after enduring this. Thank Christ it’s short.","June 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
