Good variety of enemies and bosses.\n+ Randomly generated levels guarantee a fresh experience for each consecutive run.\n+ Great variety of unlockable items, upgrades, weapons and other goodies.\n+ Perfect balance between tension build up and carnage.\n+ 3 difficulty modes, each with their own specific treats and handicaps.\n\n- No multiplayer support.\n\nThis game is an absolute must have. If you have skipped previous sales, by all means add this one to your wishlist so you can get it for a cheap price once it gets a big discount (or gets bundled) in the future.\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas is an Arcade title that puts your reflexes to the test. You have to drop all the way to the bottom of an evil tower filled with deadly traps, mobs and boss fights. Each tower you run through is randomly generated. There are new weapons and items that can be unlocked by meeting certain requirements. A timer keeps the tension present all the time; if you let it drop to 0, you'll lose a live, however there are items that will let you either freeze or reset the counter.\n\nI have played this game for over 20 hours and I still haven't gotten tired of it. It is so good! If only it allowed multiplayer runs or challenges. Oh well, maybe for the sequel.\n\nGet this hidden gem. You will definitely enjoy it.","June 30, 2014","true","22.4"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","45","49","0","1"

There's a timer, as well as score bonuses for chain killing enemies encouraging you to go as fast as possible and kill as many enemies as possible without slowing down. It's very offense oriented, with not much dodging and a very strong emphasis on just blazing through everything without making any mistakes (a bit of a minus for me personally, since I prefer complex dodging, but it's definitely an interesting play style).\n\nThere are not many flaws that I can think of, as it overall feels well thought out. My biggest complaint is that the various traps and levels the rng gives you often feel a bit same-y, and lack strategic variety. Things do get harder as you progress, but once you've seen one set of hazards, you've pretty much seen them all, and that's all you really do throughout the course of the game. The ultra fast move speed also feels a bit unwieldy during some of the boss fights as well, though that could just be me.\n\nIt's a good game for sure, just not one of my favorites (play style is interesting but not really my style, and the slight lack of variety hurts it a bit too in my opinion). If you're on the fence, I'd recommend watching a gameplay video, because it plays exactly the way it looks. If it looks like something that'll scratch your speed running arcade ninja itch, than pick it up because you'll probably enjoy it a lot.","June 2, 2014","true","3.4"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

I should not have waited so long to pick this up. Watching videos doesn't really do this game justice. The thing is, the game makes you feel sooo bad*ss. Alot of people compare it to Ninja Gaiden, which is a good comparison. It is fast and furious. There are lots of awesome meta-game unlockables which is where the 'meat' of the game is. Achievements are all appropriate and really give alot of life to this game. It also lends itself really well to speedrunning.\n\nKeep in mind that I would not recommend playing this without a controller. I played with the keyboard for a bit, which was fine, but ultimately the experience is much better with a controller.\n\nIf you like roguelites, this is a no brainer. I even recommend the cheap DLC.","March 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/224820/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I love feeling like a badass in video games, especially since I am very much not one in real life. "Badass" covers a lot of ground, though... anything from nailing a tricky level in Super Meat Boy to slo-mo capping a room full of soldiers in FEAR. Super House of Dead Ninjas is so enthralling because it hits so many badass sweet spots, and does it in a rich, clean package that even does SNES nostalgia right.\n\nYou're a ninja, there's a giant tower of evil, time to kill things. Armed with your sword, shurikens, bombs, and screen-clearing ninja magic, killing things comes fast and hard. Floors of the tower are mostly empty hallways to dash down with a demonic foe or two occupying them, and though the enemies are incredibly varied in how they attack, you can reduce all of them to a fine mist with only a strike or two. Your downward attack in particular turns you into a whirling dervish of murder, and there's really no reason not to lightspeed cartwheel cuisinart through everything in your way. Speedy, bloody kills also build your Rage meter, which makes you invulnerable and even more lethal as long as you can maintain it.\n\nThough we're talking hundreds upon hundreds of randomly-generated floors, they pass in such a flash that even a good run only takes 10 minutes or so. Every 150 floors there's a boss, but they all have very simple patterns you can master after only a few encounters. There's not a ton of variety to the actual murderous descent, but there are tons of weapons and bonuses to unlock by reaching various milestones and achievements. You also have three difficulty levels and multiple challenge modes once you really start to master the game.\n\nAll of this is presented in a shockingly faithful Super Nintendo graphical style, right down to the logo design. The audio is definitely not limited to 16 bits, but the sinister narrator and elaborate sound effects do wonders for the dark, Ninja Gaiden-lite aesthetic. If you like platformers at all it's a good pick, and if you like feeling like a sword-swinging avatar of death, it's a great one.","December 16, 2015","true","4.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","1"

Then an even harder mode to get out of DLC (on sale now). Finally a never ending mode to go for high score or just because you are having so much fun.\nSmall tasks to do in a game or through games that challenge you to do better (or just keep playing) to unlock items that can help you out. All optional for the most part.\nNumerous weapon and bombs to try out as you unlock them. Kill dead ninjas with a handgun or a light saber or a boomerang and plenty more.\nBehead a giant chicken.\nSmooth action all the way down in the best side scrolling action game that the SNES never got.\nIt's fast and frantic, driving down numerous floors of a huge tower or through a hell like dimension, killing or avoiding enemies in such a hectic pace the actual SNES would never have been able to process it fast enough. For the player, you can get in just such a groove that you barely notice the speed as it feel just right.\nHowever for those that want to take their time, it has enough leeway once you get good enough to take your time to kill everything with a variety of weapons so you can go at a slow speed. You will still need to collect a time power up to reset a clock ticking down, but outside of the harder modes, it's not worrisome at all.\n\nUnsure though?

The lightning fast combat and sensitive controls can seem a bit unwieldy at first, but they ultimately lead to a uniquely adrenaline-charged "ninja" feel that only hurtling through the levels at a breakneck speed can create. There is a wealth of unlocks as well, the only problem being that after showering the player with new weapons and upgrades during the first few hours of gameplay they slow to a mere trickle. Add to that the unusual order in which upgrades unlock, and you have a recipe for potentially unsatisfying progression.\n\nStill, the meat of the gameplay is, like a fine steak, rare and delicious. Although the game suffers from "roguelike repetition" the randomly generated levels and enemies each present unique obstacles which push a player's reflexes to the maximum as they adjust on-the-fly. Gamers who love this genre will find Super House of Dead Ninjas to be a superb entry with many hours of replayability as they race to survive long enough for that elusive high score.","May 11, 2015","true","10.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

At $6.99 usd, it's super affordable and for that price there's alot of bang for your buck.\n\nFirst things, first! There's virtually no storyline to this game but it's so fun to play that you won't care. The point of the game is to reach the bottom of the tower. You have a few lives and no continues so once your low limited number of lives run out, you have to start the game over. One thing that is cool is that each time you play the game you unlock new things to play the game wuth next time. Outfits, weapons, items, and power-ups! This makes for some great replay value.\n\nMy playtime varies from 5 to 20 minutes a sitting which may explain the 2 hours on record at this time of my reviewing. The controls are tight and the frame-rate is great, this game plays more like a modern game than a retro game though. Looks can be and ought to be decieving when it comes to the medials of this industry.\n\nGameplay wise, you are a ninja and you go down deeper and deeper into levels as you slay various creatures and interesting creatures along the way. Your ninja has many moves to help traverse you through the environment, you can run, jump, double-jump, charge jump, wall jump, slide, crouch, crouch-run, and more. The game's speed is quite fast so you'll have to master these moves abd the flow of the game to help you survive the harsh envirobments and deadly foes.\n\nPros  Female protagonist\nCool retro art style\nTons of unlockables\nCustom level integration\nDigital Comic Book\nInteractive Narrator\nController support\nCons  Same basic gameplay throughout the whole game\nNo in game dialogue\nMultiplayer would have worked really well with this game, co-op and versus modes\nLevels have same basic overall look\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis is my go to game for short bursts of killing time, at its base price this game is a steal, on sale it's even more so. It's a great return to retro style nonja game but with a modern unlockables system and other things thrown in.\n\nRating (8 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","March 23","true","3.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

Fast paced and challenging, with perfect controls! Controls can make or break a platformer and these are just great. You move and attack so quickly, but you feel in total control of your ninja the entire time.\n\nYou need very good reflexes for this game and the ability to watch a lot of things at the same time. Enemies can react VERY quickly to your character. Good thing the game has a great built in mechanic. When you kill a lot of enemies in a row, in quick succession, you will activate your Rage ability. You become invincible during this and kill everything in 1 hit, not counting bosses.\n\nThe game also has an awesome unlock system. I don't know the exact number, but somewhere around 75 different unlockable equipment, abilities and powerups are in the game. I really like this unlock system, because the better you do in the game, the better unlocks you will get access to for your next run. Expect to die a ton when first starting out, then when you start getting access to the upgraded equipment and things, you will get a lot further and eventually complete your first run through the tower.\n\nThis game can be beaten in around 4 minutes (go watch the speedrun on Youtube, it looks amazing)! The replay value is extremely high though. Lots of different modes to play, including a boss rush and speedrun mode. The unlockables will keep you busy for a long time. Leaderboards to try and improve your best times and scores. Not to mention the game is just extremely fun to play.

Anyway, I heartily recommend this game and enjoy it more the more time I spend on it.","May 31, 2013","true","22.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There’s a short timer that you have to be constantly regenerating to stay alive, so you’re forced to move quickly and rely on your reflexes. It’s kind of intense. I sometimes turn off sound effects for a more zen platforming experience. Lots of unlockables and upgrades to keep bringing you back. Crisp graphics. Cool soundtrack.

Turns out that I loved playing it. The game is simple - you must get down through a tower as fast as possible (you have a timer which you can find item pickups to extend) and fight bosses and, well, reach the bottom.\n\nBut, the tower is randomly generated each time that you play. The height of the tower remains the same, and you encounter the same number of bosses (though they have a small chance to change too, except for the final boss), but the rooms themselves and the enemies that you come across will shift a ton. Some of the rooms you get are super easy to get through quickly; some are just terrible pains. For a while it's just up to luck.\n\nHowever, you get to build yourself up the more you play. There are a tonf of weapons and power-ups you can obtain by meeting certain goals, some of which are actually negative goals - for instance, you gain more lives after you die certain numbers of times, or you gain extra time on the timer after you reach certain points in the tower. Some of the upgrades are permanent like the ones just mentioned, or the weapons you unlock, while others get unlocked but are randomly found by killing enemies or destroying objects.\n\nWhile it certainly takes some getting used to, the game is a lot of fun and can be played for a good amount of time for some challenge. However, once you unlock most things and have successfully completed the game numerous times, I don't think it has that much of a long life. I still have the DLC to get and try out with some new content, and I tried the side-world that requires collected tickets to play in, and while it all is still fun to varying extents, I don't think I'll play the game in big time periods much - there isn't enough longevity to it. But others may find that to be different! (Especially people who love extensively speedrunning.)\n\nEither way, the game isn't that expensive, so you should be willing to give it a try if it looks like it'll be some fun for you.","May 4","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have only seen the first 2 bosses and about half of the third area, so I dont have much knowledge past that point.\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas is a fast paced platformer with rogue like elements. I don't feel like it's the most random rogue like out there, the levels feel generally the same each run. the thing is, the speed of the game makes up for that. you are going too fast that level generation doesn't really seem that important.\n\nwhy is the game so fast paced? first off, there is a timer in the bottom right that counts down from 35 seconds. if that timer hits 0, prepare to get chased by a demonic figure until you get another timer pickup. this function makes you rush as fast as possible through each level. another thing that makes it fast is that your character moves at a speedy rate. also the reason I play ridiculously fast is because honestly, the only gameplay I've seen is speedruns ( which SHODN is perfect for ).\n\nitems are not a big part in this game; the items on the floors are only pickups that increase amount of magic, projectiles, and time. there are starting weapons you can unlock, but so far they don't really seem that different? they are fairly balanced as well. the unlock system is nice, like some unlocks you just get from simply doing runs normally, but some require different challenges to do. no weapon seems necessarily OP, they just have a longer range or some other small bonus.\n\nenemies aren't very varied, which is one of the only cons to SHODN. they add 2 or 3 new enemy types for each "zone" and that's it. the thing is, enemy variation isn't needed! you tear through each enemy so fast that it really doesn't matter!\n\nbosses are challenging, but aren't grinding bosses with loads of health. they are just simple bosses with a couple patterns to master, so honestly, they are more of a miniboss than a full fledged boss. again, I haven't fought the final boss myself so I don't know if he's any more interesting than the other bosses.\n\noverall, I give this game a 9/10!\n","December 3, 2015","true","8.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Imagine one (three total), big, random Super Meat Boy level. This level will have you go down instead of up. There's also a timer that will force you to keep going. You can extend the timer by killing enemies and collecting their power-ups, or by unlocking certain achievements. The levels become harder the further down you get, and there are some cool boss fights that will remind anyone of the earlier Mega Man games. There are also in-game achievements that will unlock new weapons, abilities and outfits, making the game supposedly easier later on.\n\nThe screenshots had me worried this would be 'one of those' games (you know, simple graphics and gameplay, zero heart and fun), but I'm so glad I gave this a try. Super House Of Dead Ninjas is really the opposite. It's a brilliant little hardcore platformer.\n\nAnd now that the game has proper controller support it's even more fun to play it.\nHighly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","March 2, 2013","true","7.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Still, this one is yet again entirely different from the others - here, not careful planning (DoD), not smart resource management (FTL) not even pure luck (Binding of Isaac) will help you in this game.\nHere, the only clearly visible rogue-like element is the random generated floors. And the fact that you will die and die a lot. Still, this is much, much more fast paced than any rogue titles I have played, going in similar with Super Meat Boy if you couldn't stop moving.\nIn this game, you controll a ninja, going downwards a huge tower. All the equipment you need is chosen from the lodge, the screen before the start of the game. Any other items you get inside the tower are ammo refills or boosts. So, every piece of equipment you get is permanent. And although you do need to choose which weapon/piece of equipment to use before the game, the items are usually better versions of older pieces; some of them are even direct powerups of previous weapons. This and the fact that almost everything you do (yes, even dying) counts towards an achievement which awards you with new and better equipment will lead to a "power transfer", where you will go farther and farther down the floors not only because of your own skill (which is one of the main reasons of a rogue title) but also because you will have much better equipment.\nStill, it is really satisfying to clear a floor with ease and defeat the floor boss without losing a single life when you used to take up all your lives just to get to the darn bugger.\nAlthough it slightly lacks the witt the developers Adult Swim are known for, the gameplay is way too satisfying to pass up. Honing your ninja skills and defeating baddies that killed you countless times with a single overhead strike feels absolute.\nThe action is amazing, the items are different and spaced out enough to keep you interested, the fact that every single achievement gives a new item adds replayability and the awesome price makes this little indie title a bargain of the decade.\nOh, and get yourself a controller. Bothering with a keyboard will make your ninja fingers commit seppuku.","July 14, 2013","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's a short timer that encourages the player to move faster through the level. Killing enough enemies with melee attacks, in short amount of time, will send the player into Rage Mode, giving the ability to kill all enemies with one hit.\nDefeating a mini-boss will set up a checkpoint for the player to start from in subsequent games.\n\nI enjoy the retro graphics, and fast gameplay most. The enemies crack me up, my favorite being the monkeys. Another fun feature is that the game will randomly create a special baddie named after someone in your friends list.\n\nThe game has a bit of a learning curve and it takes some time to figure out how to take on the enemies, traps, and mini-bosses.  For example, the Butt-Face Horse Pigs take a bunch of hits to kill, there are numerous traps that will catch you off guard, etc.\n\nContinuous play rewards you with buffs like cosmetic colors, extra lives, ammo, weapons, and buffs. This helps soften the learning curve.\n\nI highly recommend this game :)","November 25, 2013","true","0.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised. Almost endless replayability, the tower you try to descend from top floor, except for the first short tutorial level, changes every playthrough and so do the bosses you encounter (except the final one). You unlock new gear and power-ups by doing achievements in-game, some power-ups are permanent, while others unlock the possibility to find them in game, while the gear, you unlock melee weapons, bombs, magic and throwing weapons. You can customize your gear before going to try to beat the tower and choose one for every category stated above, you may change your costume too and off you go. The gameplay itself is very frenetic,  but satisfying, I personally don't like platformers very much because I tend to get angry with them after a while, but not this one, most of the time you're like "ehh, that was my fault, I can regain that heart if I play carefully."

Throughout your subsequent playthroughs, you will unlock new weapons that will add some variety to the game. There's so much to do with ample challenge placed every step of the way. Controls are precise and smooth and there are lots of weapons with upgrades that act as objectives. You can unlock power ups by completing other objectives as well as upgrades to items / lives.

The pacing is super fast as you work your way down the hundreds of floors that make up this enemy- and trap-infested tower. The mechanics are simple to get a hang of yet can be difficult to master and will test your reflexes constantly. Thankfully the game controls nicely with a 360 pad because I couldn't imagine executing some of these precise maneuvers on a keyboard. A strong variety of weapons/explosives/powerups at your disposal will aid you on your trek downward. Floors are randomly-generated, but for the most part each section feels mostly the same from one playthrough to the next. This could result in some repetitiveness over time. In spite of that, SHODN has a very addictive feel to it thanks to the overall pacing and arcade-style gameplay. Strikes me as a great "Pick up and play" type game for short 30-minute bursts in the same vein as The Binding Of Isaac.\n\nIn all, this is a highly enjoyable rogue-like that features some frantic action, crisp controls, and fun/satisfying combat. A nice throwback to the old-school hack-and-slash days that's well worth the bargain basement price.\n","May 28, 2013","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Super House Of Dead Ninjas is kind of like that. It's not a perfect comparison, but it provides a general idea of what you can expect.\n\nSHODN is a platformer without levels in the traditional sense. The game is one long level, which is semi-procedurally generated as you descend ever lower. It is not fully procedural because the game creates this super-level by drawing from an inventory of handmade "rooms". The enemies that populate the rooms are fixed in some cases, but for most are also selected randomly, as are the majority of the pickups to be found within. The types of rooms to be found range from simple corridors with an enemy or two, to labyrinthine beasts that will have you scratching your head trying to figure out how you're expected to make it through without dying.\n\nThe fact that the rooms are premade, but populated and thrown at you randomly, makes every run unique, and allows you to get better with practice through sheer muscle memory like a traditional platformer while still keeping you on your toes regarding what's coming next. No game provides player feedback quite like SHODN, with the voice of the final boss insulting you for making mistakes and praising you for impressive feats throughout the game, providing the game with a unique kind of personality.\n\nWhile you're practicing the game (mainly by dying a whole bunch), you can also unlock new weapons to start your runs with, as well as new pickups that will spawn in future runs. You unlock these by accomplishing goals listed in the loadoat screen while playing, very similar to achievements, only better because they provide new content to play with. (There are also standard achievements for those who like them.) Most of these unlockables are designed to make future runs easier, but certain weapon unlocks can provide entirely new approaches to the game. There's a nice variety of weapons to unlock, and even an option to start with a random loadout, providing a large number of ways to play the game. Be aware that some of the goals required to unlock things actively revel in their extreme difficulty, just like the game as a whole.\n\nThe fast-paced nature of the game is enforced by a timer. When the timer hits zero, Death himself will start chasing you through the level with a scythe. It's possible to outrun him for a little while, but you cannot outmaneuver him. Whereas Spelunky gives you 2 minutes before its ghost appears, SHODN only gives you 30 seconds to find a timer refill pickup to avoid this fate. If that sounds unforgiving, note that you start with multiple lives, which is good because you'll probably need every single one of them.\n\nBeing an indie game, it has some bugs and is unoptimized in a few areas, but I strongly encourage you to not let that put you off. With the near-infinite replayability provided by its random generation and addictively-difficult gameplay complemented by silky-smooth controls, I highly recommend SHODN, particularly to any fan of platformers.","March 28, 2014","true","67.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised. Almost endless replayability, the tower you try to descend from top floor, except for the first short tutorial level, changes every playthrough and so do the bosses you encounter (except the final one). You unlock new gear and power-ups by doing achievements in-game, some power-ups are permanent, while others unlock the possibility to find them in game, while the gear, you unlock melee weapons, bombs, magic and throwing weapons. You can customize your gear before going to try to beat the tower and choose one for every category stated above, you may change your costume too and off you go. The gameplay itself is very frenetic,  but satisfying, I personally don't like platformers very much because I tend to get angry with them after a while, but not this one, most of the time you're like "ehh, that was my fault, I can regain that heart if I play carefully."

The game is meticulously developed with intense care. Although it lacks immersion, it's an arcade game; who the f**k cares? There is also a comic, which I encourage you to read, or even glance at, to accumulate some insight into the game.\n\nThe degree of scrupulousness in this game is eminent. The developers have taken high precision into the construction of this game. If there is a conspicuous glitch, please notify me, because I am impressed with how smooth-running this game is. I am fastidious myself, or in other words: show symptoms related to OCD, and I commend the developers for being conscientious.\n\nAugmenting on that note, for a 2D game, the graphics will prevail over most art-style games that I have played. The particle systems are astounding; as I mentioned above, the developer is very diligent and takes care of his work. SHoDN also incorporates blood into the game, albeit, if you dislike it, then there is an option to disable it.\n\nNow, let's discuss the game itself. What makes Super House of Dead Ninjas miraculous; what is so significant about its gameplay? Well... there is the adrenaline of escaping a mansion, and if you take too long, a demon emerges to eviscerate you. I am unsure whether it is conjured, or if it just simply catches up to you. Anyway, there is the exuberance of racing through each level, and fighting the boss which concludes it. SHoDN will make you feel zealous; full of energy, with the incentive of completing each level.\n\nThe plethora of achievements also motivate players to continue playing; if you want to unlock a new weapon or item, you must perform a strenuous, but rudimentary task (e.g. kill 100 enemies using an inaccurate bomb). Obviously, more powerful items require a more onerous task.\n\nThe world itself is randomised, eerie and ominous. However, some would argue that it lacks immersion. My following argument is contentious, but I believe that an arcade game, especially a 2D one, does not require immersion. Arcade games derive from the style of "arcade machines", and if you have ever played on an arcade machine, then presumably, you would understand. If you disagree, please enlighten me; conceptualise this game as an arcade machine, and tell me that it requires immersion.\n\nTo conclude, Super House of Dead Ninjas is an action-packed platformer with a myriad of amusement. The game is well-developed, and I will personally punch anyone in the face who disagrees. This game is truly memorable, and I encourage you not to be prejudice based on the concept. ~ Rating: 9.4/10","August 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

When I first bought SHoDN during the summer sale, I played it about three times and I didn't get it.  There wasn't a lot of explanation to the game and with the over stimulation that the summer sale brings, I didn't have the attention span to sit down and give it a chance.  I wound up shutting the game down, vaguely wondering if I wasted $3 and proceeded to waste my time in other things.\n\nCut to three weeks later, I see people talking about SHoDN on the forums a lot and I figure I paid $3 for it; I might as well give it a shot.  The first time through, I thought the keyboard controls were a little cumbersome but I was starting to understand the game concept; score points, extend your time, get us far down the tower as you can. Seemed solid, it was starting to sink its claws in.\n\nLater that morning, I was messaged by someone on my friends list, urging me to submit my scores so they had somebody to compete against on the leader boards.  I hadn't even realized there were leaderboards, so I played through again and submitted.  That's when the claws sunk in even deeper; competing against your friend’s high scores is super addictive.  I figured I was in there, so I started clicking around in the menus and that's when I discovered that there's controller support in SHoDN!  Around this time, a game I thought I might have wasted my money on turned into a full on addiction.\n\nSHoDN is dead simple in concept, but with challenging maps and tight controls it turns into a great little time attack platformer.  It's difficult in all the right ways and its design of getting ever farther down the tower, combined with trying to outscore your friends list makes it a game you'll return to.  It’s simple nature makes it a perfect fit for those times when you want 10 minutes of distraction instead of 3 hours of character development, but there's a strong chance it's going to suck you into that dreaded, "just one more try" state of mind.\n\nI've yet to try the new DLC that was added this week, but it's officially on the wish list!\n","August 8, 2013","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

It's fairly easy to learn and especially difficult to master. Even when you think you've gotten to a point where you can just plow through the floors as quickly as possible, the game says, "No," and hits you in the face with a hidden saw blade, or a flying enemy, or the challenge of the bosses each of the way through.\n\nIf I'm rating the game on a number scale, I'm probably going to give it in the range of 8-9 out of 10. But the game is not without its flaws. First, there's the hit box: it's inconsistent. Most of the time it's exactly as you'd expect. You swing your sword (or 'chuks, or whip) and you hit your target. But there are times where I see the weapon sprite contact with the enemy sprite and it does no damage. This happens enough for it to be an issue, but not so much that it's a game stopper.\n\nThe other big issue has to do with telegraphing. The enemies don't really do a good job of it, and you'll very easily find yourself dying or getting hit by the enemies and bosses because there's little to no indication of a telegraphed attack. Compound this with a double jump that's a little low and you'll find sometimes that you have to be perfect more often then you should need in some cases to proceed. (Edit: I just found the super jump after writing the review, so that makes some boss fights potentially a bit easier.)\n\nNow these aren't really "big" issues in the normal sense; but in the context of the game, they can add up to some pretty frustrating moments.\n\nAll in all though, the game is a fantastic platformer with a super progression path and you should definitely check it out.","November 28, 2014","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

The game is meticulously developed with intense care. Although it lacks immersion, it's an arcade game; who the f**k cares? There is also a comic, which I encourage you to read, or even glance at, to accumulate some insight into the game.\n\nThe degree of scrupulousness in this game is eminent. The developers have taken high precision into the construction of this game. If there is a conspicuous glitch, please notify me, because I am impressed with how smooth-running this game is. I am fastidious myself, or in other words: show symptoms related to OCD, and I commend the developers for being conscientious.\n\nAugmenting on that note, for a 2D game, the graphics will prevail over most art-style games that I have played. The particle systems are astounding; as I mentioned above, the developer is very diligent and takes care of his work. SHoDN also incorporates blood into the game, albeit, if you dislike it, then there is an option to disable it.\n\nNow, let's discuss the game itself. What makes Super House of Dead Ninjas miraculous; what is so significant about its gameplay? Well... there is the adrenaline of escaping a mansion, and if you take too long, a demon emerges to eviscerate you. I am unsure whether it is conjured, or if it just simply catches up to you. Anyway, there is the exuberance of racing through each level, and fighting the boss which concludes it. SHoDN will make you feel zealous; full of energy, with the incentive of completing each level.\n\nThe plethora of achievements also motivate players to continue playing; if you want to unlock a new weapon or item, you must perform a strenuous, but rudimentary task (e.g. kill 100 enemies using an inaccurate bomb). Obviously, more powerful items require a more onerous task.\n\nThe world itself is randomised, eerie and ominous. However, some would argue that it lacks immersion. My following argument is contentious, but I believe that an arcade game, especially a 2D one, does not require immersion. Arcade games derive from the style of "arcade machines", and if you have ever played on an arcade machine, then presumably, you would understand. If you disagree, please enlighten me; conceptualise this game as an arcade machine, and tell me that it requires immersion.\n\nTo conclude, Super House of Dead Ninjas is an action-packed platformer with a myriad of amusement. The game is well-developed, and I will personally punch anyone in the face who disagrees. This game is truly memorable, and I encourage you not to be prejudice based on the concept. ~ Rating: 9.4/10","August 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/224820/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","The tower of a thousand deaths\n\nAfter climbing down 350 floors of traps, monsters, and ninja ghosts, not to mention the extra levels seemingly without end, I've come to one conclusion: I should never become a ninja. Sure, I should have known that before I even started playing Super House of Dead Ninjas, but it's nice to have confirmation.\n\nI've died a lot. Countless times, really. Not enough to earn the achievement "Dedication," which one gets for dying a whooping 1000 times, but that achievement should tell you that this is a game about living for mere minutes. Thankfully, those minutes are filled with blood-soaked joy, certainly enough so that dusting one's self off and starting again isn't too great a chore.\n\n\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas (PC)\nDeveloper: Megadev\nPublisher: Adult Swim Games\nRelease: February 18, 2013\nMSRP: $6.99\n\nNintai Ryoko, the super-charged ninja and title's protagonist, is a woman on a mission. Her goal: to travel to the bottom of a hellish tower, one apparently filled with treasures and the promise of glory. She doesn't want any of that, however; instead, she intends to discover what happened to the one ninja who succeeded before her, the one-armed ninja.\n\nGetting to the bottom is easier said than done, what with it containing a myriad of horrors, from undead warriors, evil spirits, dragon guardians, and crazy monkeys, to traps ranging from floor and ceiling spikes to laser cannons. It's no easy task, but Nintai has a plethora of violent tools at her disposal.\n\nShe starts of with a basic katana, some shuriken, bombs, and one magic spell, but a vast array of unlockable weapons and tools can be earned for completing all sorts of challenges. Unlocks and upgrades can be picked up at a shop run by a sour old woman. She's dismissive and doesn't think you'll get very far. I didn't like her, and instead of seeking the fate of the one-armed ninja, I really just wanted to show that hag who the boss was. Her and the omnipresent voice that crops up from time to time judging my actions and mocking my many, many failures.\n\nAt the shop, you can see what needs to be done to unlock any of these items or upgrades, but most of them can really just be earned by playing the game without sparing them a thought. Finding out that I could use grenades or had a new pair of nunchucks that I could snatch after yet another death really softened the blow. Who doesn't like presents?\n\nAll the cool toys in the world won't make a difference without skill, however, and that's the area where I found myself rather lacking. Dead Ninjas is an insanely fast game, with Nintai being, more often than not, nothing but a blue (or whatever color her ninja robes are, there are several to unlock) streak, speeding across the screen. This speed is a necessity, too, as the game is on a timer, counting down to failure. Pick-ups can be discovered which add more time to the counter, but there's always the feeling that you're running low.\n\nHaste inspires recklessness, unfortunately, and that lack of caution spells death. Nintai can sprint past some enemies, slicing and dicing as she goes along, but others have shields, require more than one hit, are covered in spikes, fling projectiles, teleport, or are exceptionally fast, and they require a split-second analysis before tackling -- there's no time for more. So speed becomes dangerous, despite being key.\n\nAt first, this led to an agonizing amount of frustration, as Nintai continually got turned into a red smear on the floor of this unwelcoming tower, but I was getting irritated by my own failings, not the design of the game. I got carried away by the delightful 16-bit violence and extreme pace, and would just run into confrontations without a second thought. Practice and experience made me a slightly better ninja. Make no mistake, however, I'm still terrible.\n\nIt's all about getting into a rhythm, and when you start to recognize enemies, it takes less than a second to recall the best way to slay them. Continually slaughtering the tower's residents in quick succession builds up Nintai's quickly diminishing rage meter, and when it's activated she becomes an unstoppable force of destruction. Those moments are the game's best, sprinting down the tower as an invincible, deadly whirlwind. And the more enemies you kill while in rage mode, the longer it lasts.\n\nThe floor layouts, enemy placements, and item locations are all randomly generated, making each new game after a death a fresh experience. Sure, it means that you won't be memorizing the levels, but it also means you won't have to play through the same section over and over again, which would certainly happen in a game this tricky.\n\nFilling out the roster of ghastly enemies are a bunch of rather unfriendly bosses, and a very traditional bunch they are, too. They all come with special abilities, patterns that must be memorized (usually simple ones), and weaknesses that can be exploited. While challenging, most of them have a fairly small amount of health and can be dispatched quite quickly once you figure out how to deal with them.\n\nI'm not the most patient of fellows, so I appreciated the fact that these villains didn't outstay their welcome. Die while fighting them, though, and you'll be sent back to the beginning of the section, a hundred floors above them.\n\nAppropriately for a challenging game such as this, Super House of Dead Ninjas sends you into the fray with only minimal instruction. There is, however, a rather novel tutorial in the form of a comic, accessible from the main menu. Contained within are little tips and tricks that the main game doesn't really share with you, and one one occasion it even offered me the key to defeating a boss I'd been struggling with. It's well worth reading, and even rewards players with a new costume.\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas can be played for free on the Adult Swim website, but getting it on Steam nets you an upgraded version. The map editor and player-created dungeons offer up tools for you creative types and a bounty of new levels for those that can't get enough of the main game and its extra, transdimensional tower. It also comes with added items and unlockables, as well as an upgraded soundtrack. The latter is cracking, as well, containing some wonderful oriental-themed chiptunes.\n\nThis is one game that I know I'll be playing long after this review is finished with. The instant challenge and frantic pace makes it perfect to just pick up and play for 15 minutes, while the tight controls and potentially limitless number of floors makes it easy to pour hours into. If you're not convinced, then check out the free version and see if it floats your boat.\n\nI do have one caveat, however. Whatever you do, don't play this with a keyboard. It's possible, but you'll just be giving yourself another unnecessary and fairly unpleasant challenge. Thankfully, Super House of Dead Ninjas comes with native controller support, and after a few initial hiccups, it seems to work perfectly now.\n\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas reviewed by Fraser Brown\n9/10\nSUPERB\n\nA hallmark of excellence. It may have some flaws, but they are negligible to what is otherwise a supreme title.","May 16","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The story is very minimal in this game. It’s an arcade game, the gameplay is the most essential. You're Crimson Ninja, a deadly assassin who wants to descend a 250-Floor Tower filled with all sorts of hostile monster in order to prove her honour. That's preety much it. There is a nice and very well drawn comic book in the game, but it won't explain anymore than what I just wrote in the previous sentence.  Super House of Dead Ninjas combat system gives you a couple of options to fight with. You can use your main weapon, perform a dive attack, use a throwable consumable, use an explosive consumable (careful not to blow yourself up with it though) and use an ultimate powerful magic trick.  You will feel like a fast and skilled ninja. Don’t get attacked too much, you only have a handful of health points.\nEnemy variation is good but it could always use more. Killing the same enemies isn't boring and some will require a special trick. The feedback is good, enemies get dismembered in a psychotically beautiful way and the blood splatters like paint into a canvas. You even have a narrator similar to that of Quake who compliments you if you’re awesome and tells you off if you suck.\n\nThe bosses are a big meat of the game, get ready to rage a bit. They’re all very unique and require some strategy and skill to finish them off. Even though they’re hard, they’re fair but I do believe that Colossus is too hard. In order to dodge him, you have to jump over him while he charges at you. But even if a pixel of your character touches the Colossus then try not to throw your monitor or laptop out of the window. This boss is ridiculously hard!\n\nThe upgrades are where I have a couple of problems with the game. I like that you have to unlock the items in a specific challenging way instead of simply grinding for the items like in RPGs. When you upgrade your health, for example, you can't turn off the upgrade and we encounter another issue. The leaderboards are therefore unfair because it doesn't take into account the upgrades you used. In Serious Sam games, the score will be influenced by the difficulty you choose. For example, if you chose easy, your score won't have a multiplier counter as high as of that of a player that chose a harder difficulty. Also, during the levels you can't check the requirements of unlocking certain; you have to remember them by heart. Now, you think that using new and different items helps the gameplay be more dynamic than it is, but that isn't the case. I find myself using the boomerang and the nunchucks more than other equipment. Furthermore, the game doesn't have preset equipment choice.\n\nOn the technical level, the game looks like it was made in the 1990’s. The graphical style is pixilated and has so much charm for it. It even has effects to it to show your character’s momentum and speed. It runs preety well but it can tank when there is a lot of effects on the screen. Still though, this version of House of Dead Ninjas, is better coded and has more configuration options. The game has an in-built Steam Workshop, but honestly, the custom made levels are too short.\n\nRegarding the expansion, if you think that the base game of Super House of Dead Ninjas wasn't enough for you then I recommend the True Ninja Pack. It’s worth it really for the price. You even get to play it with a new ninja with different stats.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is great! I think it would be better if it would be played on a mobile device. It’s a small game that should be played more than once and on the go. Still though, the game is worth it for sure and the price is fair! I recommend it!","June 13, 2013","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The lightning fast combat and sensitive controls can seem a bit unwieldy at first, but they ultimately lead to a uniquely adrenaline-charged "ninja" feel that only hurtling through the levels at a breakneck speed can create. There is a wealth of unlocks as well, the only problem being that after showering the player with new weapons and upgrades during the first few hours of gameplay they slow to a mere trickle. Add to that the unusual order in which upgrades unlock, and you have a recipe for potentially unsatisfying progression.","October 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are intresting and it's easy to quickly determine what's quickly coming towards you. Every single element that is in this game pushes forward a single theme for being an awesome extremely fast-paced action arcade game.\nBasically the gyst is you endlessly drop down and down through randomly generated enviromnents. The goal is to get as deep into the game as you can get. But to do that you have to slice the blood out of everything that moves. It even has freaking boss battles! Love it.\nIt's got a really good sense of action. First of all the controls are tight, and that's the most important thing really. And then they also have really cool combo systems where you can become invincible and just wreck everything all day. There's lots of differnet weapons too add to replayablility. and just slicing enemies feels really good. It's just the way the game feels, the particles, the sound, and the animations. The way that all meshes makes slicing dudes feel slick. Really slick.\nAnd personally I like that the game is really forgiving. In a lot of these types of games you get 1 life and then have to restart, but in this game you can die multiple times. You get like 15 lives right off the bat or something crazy like that. I really like that, it helps keep the action going.\nIt's one of those games that you'll lose, and then be like.... ok just 1 last run... i mean this time is the last time for sure.... oh but that run was crappy so it doesn't count... I get to keep playing until I get at least 1 good run....\nthat sort of game.\n\nAlso this game feels pulled out of time almost. It feels like and old classic arcade game from another universe that everybody knows and loves, like pacman... only for some reason our universe didnt get that game... it's perfectly retro.\n\nI wouldnt reccomend this game to people who won't be able to keep up with all the action. It's a hard game and it move FAST, and it can be really overwhelming really quickly. So I reccomend checking out some gameplay vids first to see if the pace is too fast for your taste.\n\nHowever, if you can handle the difficulty and speed of this game please go buy it. I'm not sure if Its gonna be like my personal favorite game ever or anything like that, but it's definitly a perfect game by all standards.\nOH, and you'll probably want to use a controller for this.

Nuff said.\nGraphics: 10/10 - The graphics are SNES-likely and they're better than the original first game, also the blood is perfect...\nMusic: 10/10 - 2 words to describe this: VERY EPIC!!

Very fun.  Very fast paced.  The rogue like feel doesn't impede the fun because you are given multiple chances to clear each board until you must start over.  This is more of a rogue lite because you get to change your gear after you die.  You unlock gear by just playing the game and dying alot.  Some of the upgrades are only given after you've died 100, 200, 300 + times etc.\n\nFor 7 bucks you can't beat it.  Fast paced action platforming.  Not too complex.

It's not even a decent game. Passable? Maybe. But beneath it's addictive kill system, there isn't much to it. There's just so little variation in everything, and the weapons are horrifically unbalenced. Perhaps unexpectedly, I'm not bitter over it being a formerly free game. I think there's actually enough added to make it worth, if not the exact price, being put up for sale at all. But the additions are too little too late and don't help much. Plus, what's with the DLC? It's so cheap, and hits a weird balence between not adding much yet locking things you'd really think should be in the base game. When not on sale, Super House of Dead Ninjas is roughly 6.99 and the DLC is 2.99. Couldn't they be 9.99 and come together by default? Even if the DLC came later, it's a weird situation. I guess it doesn't make much of a difference, so whatever.\n\nHaving gotten it while it was really cheap, I can't complain too much. Hours not quite well spent, but spent doing something at least, and sure, I'll pay a few bucks to at least not be bored for awhile, until the creeping boredom of the game itself starts to set in. Otherwise, I can't reccomend it.","February 9","false","15.6"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"

I still beat the game on normal in about 2 hours (it is very short), but never felt like I was having a good time, just pure frustration. The problem that blocked me from enjoying this game are the loose controls. I mean VERY loose. You slide around constantly and careen into enemies, environmental hazards, and bosses which are eventually beatable without taking any dmg because they are based purely on memorization. Because of the extremely slippery controls it is very tough, but it is do-able. I was taking about 1-3 hits per boss. The bosses take a long while to get to so the only real way you can get any practice on them is to get a user-made map that lets you boss run.\n\nI love platformer games and the reason I was able to beat the game so quickly without too much trouble was because I have always played platformers since I was a kid so I have some skill built up. Even so, I just did not enjoy the experience because of the incredibly loose slippery controls. If you look around, there are platformers out there that have much tighter controls without sacrificing the difficulty. Personally I hope we see less and less of these platformer games like this one and also “They Bleed Pixels” that are only difficult for one single reason: loose slippery sliding controls. Example of a game with tight controls: Megaman games, or Super Time Force Ultra. If Megaman's controls felt like this, it would to this day be debated whether it was a good game or not, rather than unanimously be hailed as a good game like it is now. It would have been inexcusable and would not have been tolerable by most people and there wouldn't be as many Megaman's as there are now.

I really enjoy playing. You start at the top of a tower, and you go down each floor, hacking and slashing your way through the enemies as fast as you can. You only have 30 seconds maximum, BUT, you may get more time as you move along. SHODN may seem like a fast game, but not really.

I struggled using the keyboard, so I hooked up my wireless Logitech and it has been nothing but a blast!  The controls are very responsive and the gameplay is incredibly fast.  Normally, I like to go at my own pace when it comes to platforms, but Super House of Dead Ninjas really makes it enjoyable to be a speed demon.  What really helps is the extra moves you are allowed to perform such as the down thrust as you fall and the extra jumps in mid-air to avoid traps.  I would love to see this on multiple platforms, because it deserves the spotlight.  With all the endless Ninja games on mobile platforms and consoles, this one deserves to have a franchise with multi-sequels just like Ninja Gaiden, Tenchu, and Shinobi have.  $6.99 is more than a fair price.  I could see anyone paying $40.00 for this back in the days of the Nes, Super Nes, and Sega 8/16 bit consoles.  I'm surprised it isn't on other platforms like the Ouya, Gamestick, etc...

Was I suprised when I started just to end up playing several hours without stopping. This is a simple game that focuses on few things, but those few gameplay features are extremely tight, precise and fun.\n\nThis is a rouge like platformer. While a death doesn't mean game over if playing  normal mode. Just to save you time play hard mode from the start, so you can get the most amount of unlocks as quickly as possible. Your entire goal is a to get to the bottom of the tower. Sounds simple, but you have a time limit. You have to pick up time power up to extend the time. You also have plenty of weapons and gear to chose from. A melee weapon, a ranged weapon, a bomb weapon and a magic spell. You choose these four things and off you go. The controls for the platformer are extremely tight and responsive. If you died it's your fault. Game is a perfect balance of fairness and challange. Your pace determines how well you do, if you go too quick you will run into a trap or a problem, going to slow and your timer is gonna tick down. When time goes down you don't die, the grim reaper shows up to kill you. You can evade him, if you are quick and skilled enough.\n\nFranky there doesn't need much to be said about this game. If you watch a trailer of 30 seconds you can get the gist of it. I'm just writting here to asure you that it's superb. A simple addictive rouge-like platformer that is jam packed with skill paced action humor and satisfaction. Get this.","December 14, 2013","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a ninja warrior who wants to kill things. I'm totally 300% sure that's the story. You can read the story in comic book form in-game. I couldn't pull myself away from the actual gameplay for long enough to see that option in the main menu, though.\n\nThis game moves so fast (or, at least, you can move so fast). You just run through the tower killing anything that gets in your way and go for the boss. Simple, but very addictive.\n\nI should mention it's really easy to die in the game. Well, more accurately, it's really easy for me to get too complacent and reckless in the game. I died. A lot. I got the bonus lives perks really quickly (you can unlock them for dying a certain number of times in excess of 100) because I just died so much. I died because the game is incredibly fun to try and move through as fast as possible.\n\nThe game has a good way of knowing where you're going to do something silly too. The game really discourages you from moving quickly without knowing what certain enemies do. Man, what do those fast spiney things do? Oh, they kill you and kill you and kill you. There's good news. Since you lose a life in one hit, it becomes of paramount importance to avoid as many enemies as you can... while still trying to build rage.\n\nRage builds up by killing a certain amount of enemies while not dying. When the rage meter is fully charged, you are invulnerable until the meter depleats. This gives the player the ability to make a decision about moving quickly vs killing things to build up rage.\n\nAfter all the stuff I said about dying, I should mention that the game does deaths in a perfect way for this type of game: you regenerate where you are. While it might seem pretty obvious that that would be the case, it's important to distinguish this game from Mario type games. There are no checkpoints, but instead you can insantly revive where you died and even if you spend all your lives and get a game over, you can still rejoin the game where you are.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice too. It's certainly no Bit.Trip Runner, but it's still pretty thematic and well done.\n\nThe visuals are done in a retro-esque style which is a good design choice; it allows the whole game to be loaded all at once taking nothing away from gametime and player tempo.\n\nOverall, this game was an extremely fun expense of time. I cannot get over how well it was designed and just how fun it is.","December 25, 2013","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of the early examples of roguelite platformers inspired by Spelunky, but it is however definitely very unique and stands out in its own right.\n\nFirst, it's extremely fast paced. Games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy usually expect you to be slow and cautious - here, you also need to be observant, but you've got short time limit to find a timer pickup or you die- so you need to think on your feet, judging what is the fastest way to scale dangers ahead of you without getting hit. In fact, it's very arcade styled - winning the entire game shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes if you know what you're doing, but the game is extremely hard so you will spend hours practicing and learning your enemies to reach that point.\n\nSecond, it's very focused on action. Combat is meat of the gameplay, with a lot of depth to it - you are always equipped with three kinds of weapons and two special abilites (Zelda 2-like downstab and a jump spin attack) that let you approach any enemy encounter tactically. Platforming isn't too shabby either, since the game will require you to jump over spikes or swim through water, and you can wallslide, walljump, double jump (or even triple jump with the right item), super jump by crouching for a long time, crawl and glide.\n\nThird interesting feature are unlockables. Unlike most roguelite games winning the game on Normal difficulty isn't that hard of a task and can be accomplished in 6-10 hours - but this isn't what the game is truly about. See, unlike most of these games there IS a pernament progression to this game - unlocking new stuff. You unlock bonuses that extend your timer or give your new lives, but most unlockables are new weapons. This is also where most depth of the game comes in - you have plenty of melee weapons to replace your standard katana, including a baseball bat, whip or lightsaber; instead of throwing shurken like most ninjas you can simply get a gun, a boomerang or even do a Hadouken from Street Fighter; and replace your bombs with molotov coctails or dynamite that allows you to blow up the terrain! All these weapons have unique properties that make them interesting choices in some situations. And of course you can mix things up with Chaos Mode that allows you to pick random weapons every session, requiring you to adapt to new situations.\n\nFourth unique things is level design - unlike most Roguelike games levels of the tower aren't completely randomly generated but tower is instead built from premade "blocks", combining best of both worlds - each playhtrough will still be unique and unpredictable, while game allows finely crafted and polished challenges and moments that only a human designer can create.\n\nOf course, by its very nature this isn't a game you can sit down and play for hours, it's more suited to short sessions. But I assure you, the bite-sized frantic hard-as-nails (but never unfair) addictive action will keep you coming back everytime you need a coffee break. I should know, as of writing this I clocked over 30 hours just from these short sessions.\n\nIs it worth its price? Being honest, I gotten more enjoyment out of this game than from Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, much more popular games, and it is over two times cheaper than them. It's not perfect - there are couple weird design decisions like Parachute bonus that slows you down when falling (a bane of speedrunners) - but you can literally count them on fingers of one hand.\nIf you like fast-paced arcade platformers, you will definitely fall in love with this game.\n\nOh! And if you want a glimpse of what you're getting yourself into, you can try the games predeccesor, House of Dead Ninjas, which is a fully free online flash game.\nhttp://games.adultswim.com/house-of-dead-ninjas-action-online-game.html","November 21, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are tight, music and artstyle are spot on, gameplay is fast paced and the levels are randomly generated. The goal of the game is really simple: go down the tower and survive. The goal being simple doesn't make it easy; YOU WILL DIE A LOT.\n\nYou are equiped with a main sword, projectiles, bombs and magic. You unlock different weapons, power-ups (random drops you get from killing enemies), permanent updrades and alternate costumes by completing various challenges like getting 250 000 points or killing a certain boss without taking damage. There is 3 difficulty levels and 3 different towers to choose from. There is also a Boss Rush and a Speedrun mode with online leaderboards. The game also comes with a level editor that works with Steam Workshop so you can share your maps with everyone.\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is that some weapons (4-5 in total) are made obsolete by stronger versions of the same weapon. For exemple, the Katana: if you unlock the Katana+ there is no point in using the default one. I just wish the updraded version would replace the default one so we could have 4-5 extra weapons instead of them being basically duplicates.","February 27, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are debating with yourself whether or not to get this game, save yourself the headache, and just buy it, it is worth every penny! The only bad thing about this game is that the "Level Editor" has some glitches/bugs (Or at least with me it does) where not everything you put on the level you created is loaded when you try playing it. For example, I made a map thats 80x160. That's a REALLY big map. But there are certain traps such as spikes and fire breathing statues as well as monsters that I also put on a lot of levels, that don't show up. I don't know why, but aside from that, it's still a great game!","February 28, 2014","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PLaying like an old school gem title of the SNES, (hence the name and the retro box art for the title) it has all the magic and nostalgic fun that lies there too but with a modern day shuriken to make it feel fresh.  With the mission of getting your customizable ninja to reach the bottom of a seemingly infinte dark tower, you get your kicks out weaving your way through out the different levels, batting demons, dragons, and killer frogs using your katana, throwing stars, and bombs, with a shinobi reminiscent special moves that can get you out of jam and quick.  you have a timer that counts down throught, and instead of progressing traditionally from one stage to the next, spotting clocks and picking them up increase your timer, allowing you to continue your descent (the latter is a demon dragon that comes to eat you and theres nothing you or your ninja prowess can do about it if the time runs out).  With a traditional 3 quarters and its game over rules to play by, the upside is that you can customize your weapons, abilities, even the ninja yourself, so there plenty to keep pressing contine about. Although it lacks a multiplayer component, which for a game like this would be pretty freaking awesome, it does well without.    The controls are tight for the most part, and supports full joystick compatibilty, which i would recommend for this fast paced downard dungeon explorer. My only gripe is that controls seem to depend widely on which weapon you use (i found that the scythe tends to slide me along a little further than i would bother when i attack) but all in all, a stellar modern retro game at its best, and does a genuis job at clashing the old with the new.\nThe Verdict?\n\n9.25/10\n\n","March 1, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a ninja with a primary weapon, a secondary throwable weapon, one bomb variant as well as another form of magic. The game has only one difficulty, which is pretty hard all on its own. The only difference between the difficulty levels is the number of continues that you are able to use.\n\nSHODN plays like other rogue-likes in the manner of games like Spelunky or Risk of Rain, where you gain new weapons, abilities and other modifiers by playing more and more of the game. As you reach the end of a section, you will fight a boss (some stages have up to two randomized bosses) who have a particular gimmick to their attack patterns. Once complete, you proceed to the next area until you complete the game.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, as it gives you the feel of a badass ninja through the game mechanics, level design, and the responsive nature of the game. The game runs at a cool 60 FPS due to its relatively low graphics requirements, and the controller input is also much more responsive as well. With this in mind, remember that your enemies also react at the same speed, so rushing down into the next room without checking the area is usually a really bad idea.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of replay value as you are only allowed a single weapon, projectile and gadget per session. This will inevitably lead to a lot of experimentation as you find the weapons that best suit your playstyle or your speedrun attempt. Definitely enjoyed this game thoroughly.\n","March 3, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It controls smoothly, it introduces new elements at just the moment you've mastered the old, unlocks occur at a decent click for completing challenges, and most importantly, it gets the difficulty just right - it doesn't start ♥♥♥♥ hard and get harder; it starts easy, and gives you generous checkpoints so you can practice just the section that's giving you grief without going through the motions for five minutes beforehand. Then, after it's given you room to practice and learn its mechanics - that's when it gets ♥♥♥♥ hard. It never feels cheap or unfair because of the breathing room it gives to beginners. Additionally, because you are DEscending a tower, there is always a strong sense of momentum, so the 30 second time limit doesn't feel punitive, but rather acts as a mechanical reinforcement of the play style most people will gravitate towards anyway. In short it's a well programmed, thoughtfully designed game that's a great deal of fun to play. Easy to learn, hard to master, I recommend SHODN strongly.","February 12, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The addition of the level editor is always nice, although I have not yet delved into it enough to fully pick it apart.

Camera, 9/10\nGameplay 10/10, a good challenge. How about a little more story, to back it up? My only complaint though. Kudos!","March 22, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game can be beaten in a very short amount of time, about 10 minutes.  However, the game is extraordinarliy tough, and you're going to fail many, many times before you get to that point.  It will take many hours of play to master the mechanics needed to win.  However, the fact that the game is so short also ensures that the level of difficulty is never frustrating, and the unlocking of power-ups and upgrades through completing challenges gives the game a nice flow, as even failures can help you progress in the future, both from learning from your mistakes and gaining those unlockable boosts.\n\nAll in all, SHODN is one of the best examples of how to make a retro-style game with all of the challenge and almost none of the frustration.","June 21, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PLaying like an old school gem title of the SNES, (hence the name and the retro box art for the title) it has all the magic and nostalgic fun that lies there too but with a modern day shuriken to make it feel fresh.  With the mission of getting your customizable ninja to reach the bottom of a seemingly infinte dark tower, you get your kicks out weaving your way through out the different levels, batting demons, dragons, and killer frogs using your katana, throwing stars, and bombs, with a shinobi reminiscent special moves that can get you out of jam and quick.  you have a timer that counts down throught, and instead of progressing traditionally from one stage to the next, spotting clocks and picking them up increase your timer, allowing you to continue your descent (the latter is a demon dragon that comes to eat you and theres nothing you or your ninja prowess can do about it if the time runs out).  With a traditional 3 quarters and its game over rules to play by, the upside is that you can customize your weapons, abilities, even the ninja yourself, so there plenty to keep pressing contine about. Although it lacks a multiplayer component, which for a game like this would be pretty freaking awesome, it does well without.    The controls are tight for the most part, and supports full joystick compatibilty, which i would recommend for this fast paced downard dungeon explorer. My only gripe is that controls seem to depend widely on which weapon you use (i found that the scythe tends to slide me along a little further than i would bother when i attack) but all in all, a stellar modern retro game at its best, and does a genuis job at clashing the old with the new.\nThe Verdict?\n\n9.25/10\n\n","March 1, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a ninja with a primary weapon, a secondary throwable weapon, one bomb variant as well as another form of magic. The game has only one difficulty, which is pretty hard all on its own. The only difference between the difficulty levels is the number of continues that you are able to use.\n\nSHODN plays like other rogue-likes in the manner of games like Spelunky or Risk of Rain, where you gain new weapons, abilities and other modifiers by playing more and more of the game. As you reach the end of a section, you will fight a boss (some stages have up to two randomized bosses) who have a particular gimmick to their attack patterns. Once complete, you proceed to the next area until you complete the game.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, as it gives you the feel of a badass ninja through the game mechanics, level design, and the responsive nature of the game. The game runs at a cool 60 FPS due to its relatively low graphics requirements, and the controller input is also much more responsive as well. With this in mind, remember that your enemies also react at the same speed, so rushing down into the next room without checking the area is usually a really bad idea.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of replay value as you are only allowed a single weapon, projectile and gadget per session. This will inevitably lead to a lot of experimentation as you find the weapons that best suit your playstyle or your speedrun attempt. Definitely enjoyed this game thoroughly.\n","March 3, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are tight, music and artstyle are spot on, gameplay is fast paced and the levels are randomly generated. The goal of the game is really simple: go down the tower and survive. The goal being simple doesn't make it easy; YOU WILL DIE A LOT.\n\nYou are equiped with a main sword, projectiles, bombs and magic. You unlock different weapons, power-ups (random drops you get from killing enemies), permanent updrades and alternate costumes by completing various challenges like getting 250 000 points or killing a certain boss without taking damage. There is 3 difficulty levels and 3 different towers to choose from. There is also a Boss Rush and a Speedrun mode with online leaderboards. The game also comes with a level editor that works with Steam Workshop so you can share your maps with everyone.\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is that some weapons (4-5 in total) are made obsolete by stronger versions of the same weapon. For exemple, the Katana: if you unlock the Katana+ there is no point in using the default one. I just wish the updraded version would replace the default one so we could have 4-5 extra weapons instead of them being basically duplicates.","February 27, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get to unlock a plethora of weapons and sub weapons by killing in the most ninja-esqe of fashions, such as multiple consecutive assassinations, Destroying mobs of enemies with a single bomb, or speeding through the first level in UNDER 30 seconds.\nNow there is a time limit given, due to a demon overwatching you that'll come down to chomp on your flesh, but keep an eye open and you'll find time extenders to keep him off bay. Feel like you're doomed and surrounded? Blast off a barrage of Ninja Gaiden-esqe magic that'll completely obliterate your opponents. All items are limited, but also can be found around the map, which is wonderful.\nThink Spelunky + BAD ♥♥♥ NINJA acrobatics and mutilation with fair but terrifying boss fights. Truly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good rush of carnage in the glorious midst of battle.","February 20, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unserious/recommended/224820/","unserious","Hagelbreaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unserious/","62 products in account","Lovely platformer that mixes old school conventions with newer standards. On a sale this game (including dlc) goes for about two bucks, it's a steal. If you're getting it - a controller is highly recommended. Be warned, it's a pretty challenging game, but a fun one.\n\nClosest comparison I can think of is "Spelunky" in terms of being a rouge-like platformer. But Super House of Dead Ninjas is faster, harder and to me just a better game. It's simply fun unlocking stuff and the speed of gameplay you can reach is great. The difficulty can be unappealing to some, and the random elements of the game sometimes do feel unfair, but overall for me randomness is one of the reasons the game is so enjoyable and replayable.\n\nThis game also does retro right, with reminiscent sound effects, controls, enemies and just overall presentation. Those things that puke when you run under them from Ghost & Goblins? Those tower enemies from Megaman 2? The axe throwing weapon from Castlevania games? All there. There is even a "scanlines" TV filter.\n\nAs for the newer things, there's online leaderboards, a map editor and a number of "self imposed challenges" such as a speedrun mode (with splits!), achievements and an endless mode for highscores.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but for what it does it is polished and fun!","November 7, 2014","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get two coinplays, and some hearts, so it becomes bearable. This can probably be attributed to the loose controls of your character to keep the player's frustration in check. Nonetheless, a wide variety of unlockables to keep you going at it.\n\nSome boss levels can be quite annoying, since you don't know how to face them as you haven't learnt their movement/attack patterns yet. Once you die, you will definitely be frustrated at the fact that you have to traverse the entire level again to get to the boss, and hopefully memorized the boss by then. If you didn't, be prepared to traverse the stage again.\n\nI'd give this a 8/10, for the nice retro graphics and storyline behind it. Gameplay wise, nothing game breaking. I am glad this game doesn't have any 'pixel-accurate' obstacles, it'd definitely make the game more frustrating.

That's Super House of Dead Ninjas.\n\n+The game controls perfectly. For a fast game like this tight controls mean everything, and SHODN has that. Reminds me of the old mega man games, with the exception that it's much faster.\n\n+Lots of unlockables. 'nuff said.\n\n+You can make your own tower via level editor and upload it to the workshop\n\n-The game's DLC is where it's at. I don't think i'd have put in 40+ hours if not for speedrun and bossrush modes, not to mention the extremely satisfying hookshot.\n\n-Not updated frequently. I have already unlocked everything to unlock, i've reached top 15 in speedrun mode, and now, there's nothing left to do. Really wish this game recieved ANY kind of update to keep me playing.\n\n-Weapons are heavily unbalanced and most of the time you don't even use a weapon scince you can just jump and press down to instantly kill any enemy or deal 3 damage to a boss.\n\nPersonally, I think i got my money's worth. I really recommend you get the True Ninja DLC, because this game was meant for speedrunning. Although I don't think another DLC or update is on it's way, i still recommend you get this game\n\n-->9/10<--","March 12, 2015","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BUY THIS DAMN GAME RIGHT NOW, smooth, sharp, quick, fluid, tight, agile, blazing hot, fast-paced bloody madness wrapped up n packaged rather beautifully... keep running, jumping, slashing n ♥♥♥♥ing straight up killing n beheading ppl with also 4 different types of magic to choose from, lots of different explosives to pick from, all different types of projectiles/throwables n sorts (flamethrower is my favorite) n tons of great melee weapons even ones that decap those bloody crazy creatures... that is all you really need to know cuz chances are if you are reading this you are either very interested and just need to make sure that this game lives up to its word & that other ppl love it well they do and I do and I was in that spot too less than a week ago (tho i got it on sale) it is simply and utterly amazing even if you start out with a rough time like i did and there are tons of unlocks that take thoght and effort along with some that are pretty basic that u get just by playing the game n the more u play the more addicted u get the more weapons/upgrades/"other" items u collect the deeper the experience will get and your own experience coupled with this will make the game nothing but complete badassness & the best part of all of this is... YOU CAN PLAY IT FREE!!! (if u wanna test it out for sure to make sure it is worth buying) but paying for it has a few benefits and supports the devs & yeah that might be pushin it for some people but hey i rarely ever buy any form of media even as a hardcore movie, music, n video game lover it's very rare taht i find a game truly worth it meaning that its so well made n fits the purpose of the game so good n has a fair price at the very least & it isn't hard to catch a really good sale (most of them are high discounts) but is well worth full price and did i mention...? FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! ♥♥♥♥ YEAH BABY!!! Even a DS4 controller works (I've also played it with an x360 controller but prefer ds4 but like to try xbox1 n if u change the keys u can make this game amazing with mouse n key) makes it harder in some ways easier in others like many games but its all prefence but being able to use a controller or MnKey is always a huge plus n being able to map ur buttons (tho u cant use the triggers i dont see the need for them anyways)... A great settup for me that ive told to some friends is using L1/L-bumper 4 jumping, R1/R-bumper for melee (square 4 throwables since that is used the most besides melee but the rest are comfortable wherever u program them if u decide to try this) and the dpad is my favorite by far, so when u get this game or if u already have it try using both joystick & d-pad enough so that u find ur fav n same goes for mouse n key/controller trying to find which u prefer cuz honestlly MnKey can be extremely good when mapped best towards what suits u cuz u dont need many controls n u have that whole ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard to use, u can use WASD & right side of keyboard like N, K, L or something like that whatever is most comfortable, but ive talked way too much already, if u dont wanna pay go play it free n if u still dont wanna pay keep playing it free n if the difficulty seems to hard jsut keep playin trust me it really isnt n im a newb wit a  long way to go haha, step 1. buy the game step 2. get good step 3. become a ninja step 4. become a ninja in real life...","October 28, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'nuff said.\n\n+You can make your own tower via level editor and upload it to the workshop\n\n-The game's DLC is where it's at. I don't think i'd have put in 40+ hours if not for speedrun and bossrush modes, not to mention the extremely satisfying hookshot.\n\n-Not updated frequently. I have already unlocked everything to unlock, i've reached top 15 in speedrun mode, and now, there's nothing left to do. Really wish this game recieved ANY kind of update to keep me playing.\n\n-Weapons are heavily unbalanced and most of the time you don't even use a weapon scince you can just jump and press down to instantly kill any enemy or deal 3 damage to a boss.\n\nPersonally, I think i got my money's worth. I really recommend you get the True Ninja DLC, because this game was meant for speedrunning. Although I don't think another DLC or update is on it's way, i still recommend you get this game\n\n-->9/10<--","March 12, 2015","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On to the real review.\n\nThis game is speed platforming at its finest. With a 30-second timer pushing you along, you really have to think fast to progress through the floors of the tower while killing enemies and replenishing the timer along the way. You have several tools in your arsenal: melee weapons, ranged weapons, and bombs all have their uses, and you also have magic spells to help out in a pinch. Melee and ranged weapons will be your main combat tools, because you have a limited number of bombs and magic to use. Some enemies will kill you before you can reach them with a melee attack, so you'll have to use a ranged attack to kill them. This adds an element of strategy, because you need to decide when to attack with which weapon. And as you progress, you will unlock other weapons to use beyond the standard katana, shuriken, and bombs. For example, I use "Death's Gleaming Scyth" for my melee weapon, which beheads all enemies, and "Scorpion's Hookshot" for my ranged weapon, which is essentially a deadly grappling hook. Bomb upgrades are a little harder to come by, so I just use the standard bomb for now. There are 11 melee weapons, 14 ranged weapons, and 12 bombs to choose from, plus 4 magic spells, for a total of 7,392 different weapon combinations to choose from. Add to that all the various item and weapon upgrades, such as adding extra lives or being able to carry more bombs, and you have quite an incentive to keep playing the game because there are just so many things to unlock.\n\nGameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a ninja game with a 30-second timer: hectic and fun. There are lots of different enemies to face, and they each act a little bit differently. Some will throw ranged attacks at you, others just run back and forth in an area, and many more. This makes playing the game a lot more interesting than just "melee attack anything that moves" because you'll need to be smart and know when to duck to avoid a ranged attack, how to counter enemies that can block your attacks if they see you coming, etc.\n\nThe physics in this game are perfect for a frantic platformer. Gravity must be higher in this world, because you fall really fast, which helps you progress more quickly but also makes it harder to plan for sneak attacks from above. You can also cling to walls or double jump to slow yourself down or reach higher places, which is a nice touch.\n\nSHODN's music is great, very Oriental-feeling but with a nice upbeat tempo that reminds me a bit of "Kung Fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas. Perfect for a ninja beat-em-up (or in this case, cut-em-up).\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite modern platformers. It's fun and crazy, with enough strategy and variety to keep me interested and coming back for more. Definitely recommended for any fans of platforming games, or anyone who wants to kill lots of pixelated ninjas and die a lot. Because you will die A LOT, especially when you're first starting out and learning which enemies do what.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

BUY THIS DAMN GAME RIGHT NOW, smooth, sharp, quick, fluid, tight, agile, blazing hot, fast-paced bloody madness wrapped up n packaged rather beautifully... keep running, jumping, slashing n ♥♥♥♥ing straight up killing n beheading ppl with also 4 different types of magic to choose from, lots of different explosives to pick from, all different types of projectiles/throwables n sorts (flamethrower is my favorite) n tons of great melee weapons even ones that decap those bloody crazy creatures... that is all you really need to know cuz chances are if you are reading this you are either very interested and just need to make sure that this game lives up to its word & that other ppl love it well they do and I do and I was in that spot too less than a week ago (tho i got it on sale) it is simply and utterly amazing even if you start out with a rough time like i did and there are tons of unlocks that take thoght and effort along with some that are pretty basic that u get just by playing the game n the more u play the more addicted u get the more weapons/upgrades/"other" items u collect the deeper the experience will get and your own experience coupled with this will make the game nothing but complete badassness & the best part of all of this is... YOU CAN PLAY IT FREE!!! (if u wanna test it out for sure to make sure it is worth buying) but paying for it has a few benefits and supports the devs & yeah that might be pushin it for some people but hey i rarely ever buy any form of media even as a hardcore movie, music, n video game lover it's very rare taht i find a game truly worth it meaning that its so well made n fits the purpose of the game so good n has a fair price at the very least & it isn't hard to catch a really good sale (most of them are high discounts) but is well worth full price and did i mention...? FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! ♥♥♥♥ YEAH BABY!!! Even a DS4 controller works (I've also played it with an x360 controller but prefer ds4 but like to try xbox1 n if u change the keys u can make this game amazing with mouse n key) makes it harder in some ways easier in others like many games but its all prefence but being able to use a controller or MnKey is always a huge plus n being able to map ur buttons (tho u cant use the triggers i dont see the need for them anyways)... A great settup for me that ive told to some friends is using L1/L-bumper 4 jumping, R1/R-bumper for melee (square 4 throwables since that is used the most besides melee but the rest are comfortable wherever u program them if u decide to try this) and the dpad is my favorite by far, so when u get this game or if u already have it try using both joystick & d-pad enough so that u find ur fav n same goes for mouse n key/controller trying to find which u prefer cuz honestlly MnKey can be extremely good when mapped best towards what suits u cuz u dont need many controls n u have that whole ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard to use, u can use WASD & right side of keyboard like N, K, L or something like that whatever is most comfortable, but ive talked way too much already, if u dont wanna pay go play it free n if u still dont wanna pay keep playing it free n if the difficulty seems to hard jsut keep playin trust me it really isnt n im a newb wit a  long way to go haha, step 1. buy the game step 2. get good step 3. become a ninja step 4. become a ninja in real life...","October 28, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just defeating a different boss usually unlocks a new weapon or ability for you to use the next time you play.\n\nThe music and visuals are decidedly 8 bit styled, but they are not without their own charm. Your ninja character beautifully slices and dices and shurikens all of her enemies into explosions of pixelated carnage (which you can turn down/off in the options if you'd like).\n\nDon't expect anything incredibly deep here, but there is plenty of quick satisfaction to be had, and the customization options grow the more you play and unlock new features.

It's one of the early examples of roguelite platformers inspired by Spelunky, but it is however definitely very unique and stands out in its own right.\n\nFirst, it's extremely fast paced. Games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy usually expect you to be slow and cautious - here, you also need to be observant, but you've got short time limit to find a timer pickup or you die- so you need to think on your feet, judging what is the fastest way to scale dangers ahead of you without getting hit. In fact, it's very arcade styled - winning the entire game shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes if you know what you're doing, but the game is extremely hard so you will spend hours practicing and learning your enemies to reach that point.\n\nSecond, it's very focused on action. Combat is meat of the gameplay, with a lot of depth to it - you are always equipped with three kinds of weapons and two special abilites (Zelda 2-like downstab and a jump spin attack) that let you approach any enemy encounter tactically. Platforming isn't too shabby either, since the game will require you to jump over spikes or swim through water, and you can wallslide, walljump, double jump (or even triple jump with the right item), super jump by crouching for a long time, crawl and glide.\n\nThird interesting feature are unlockables. Unlike most roguelite games winning the game on Normal difficulty isn't that hard of a task and can be accomplished in 6-10 hours - but this isn't what the game is truly about. See, unlike most of these games there IS a pernament progression to this game - unlocking new stuff. You unlock bonuses that extend your timer or give your new lives, but most unlockables are new weapons. This is also where most depth of the game comes in - you have plenty of melee weapons to replace your standard katana, including a baseball bat, whip or lightsaber; instead of throwing shurken like most ninjas you can simply get a gun, a boomerang or even do a Hadouken from Street Fighter; and replace your bombs with molotov coctails or dynamite that allows you to blow up the terrain! All these weapons have unique properties that make them interesting choices in some situations. And of course you can mix things up with Chaos Mode that allows you to pick random weapons every session, requiring you to adapt to new situations.\n\nFourth unique things is level design - unlike most Roguelike games levels of the tower aren't completely randomly generated but tower is instead built from premade "blocks", combining best of both worlds - each playhtrough will still be unique and unpredictable, while game allows finely crafted and polished challenges and moments that only a human designer can create.\n\nOf course, by its very nature this isn't a game you can sit down and play for hours, it's more suited to short sessions. But I assure you, the bite-sized frantic hard-as-nails (but never unfair) addictive action will keep you coming back everytime you need a coffee break. I should know, as of writing this I clocked over 30 hours just from these short sessions.\n\nIs it worth its price? Being honest, I gotten more enjoyment out of this game than from Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, much more popular games, and it is over two times cheaper than them. It's not perfect - there are couple weird design decisions like Parachute bonus that slows you down when falling (a bane of speedrunners) - but you can literally count them on fingers of one hand.\nIf you like fast-paced arcade platformers, you will definitely fall in love with this game.\n\nOh! And if you want a glimpse of what you're getting yourself into, you can try the games predeccesor, House of Dead Ninjas, which is a fully free online flash game.\nhttp://games.adultswim.com/house-of-dead-ninjas-action-online-game.html","November 21, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are blissfully responsive.  Also, it's only second to Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) in ninja-feel gameplay.  Many try to make games with ninjas and fail.  It's risky business being a ninja and just like the aforementioned best ninja game, you are going to die over and over, continue over and over, and even when you succeed, you want to boot it up again and try to do it a little better.

Pity me and my poor time management skills, then praise me for my foresight.  That being said, now onto the randomizer!\n\nToday's review was one that I have quite a bit of familiarity with, though not necessarily through Steam.  Super House of Dead Ninjas was originally a flash game Megadev released via the Adult Swim website.  In that game, you play a female master of the ninja arts, utilizing various bladed methods of slaughter to plow your way downwards from the top of the tower, never stopping to wonder why you didn’t simply try to knock on the front door, or whether or not any of the various tower denizens would rather just let you waltz on by instead of offending you enough to cause you to split their skulls open with a melee weapon.  The Steam version is not that different, that is to say that it is still an excellent example of platformer madness, that it still has wonderfully easy controls, and that it still whups lots of butt.  The game is very reminiscent of the games released during the 16 bit era (hence the Super prefix in the title) and has definitely got the 'Nintendo Hard' difficulty thing down, especially in the lower levels.  The game does an excellent job of ramping up the difficulty level as the floors progress, making the randomly generated floors more infuriating as the levels go on, and with the scaling limited lives and continues, the game does place an emphasis on precision over brute force without making things inaccessibly difficult.  All in all, the game is one that you should definitely put time into, whether it be here or with the flash version.  A buy from me.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept.  This is a platformer I can get behind, addictive, fun and infuriating.\nBuy/No Buy: I would support this one with a buy anytime.  That being said, it does have a flash version that is similar.  If you have games you want more, keep this on your wishlist till it goes on sale and play the flash version till it does.\n","February 20","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not unfair like some other 2D platformers that try to be hard for the sake of being hard, this game is very fun and satisfying to play. Controller is highly recommended. You go down a certain number of floors in the tower then fight a randomly selected boss for that level, by performing certain actions during gameplay you can unlock extra weapons & items which randomly drop as you kill enemies.
