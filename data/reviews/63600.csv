For a game originally released in 1993, it actually looks and plays quite well - it will require a little bit of work (including one patch) in order to play properly on modern machines (the QT plugin isn't correct) so don't assume it will be plug-and-play.\n\nControls are a little floaty, and the puzzles are not changed at all from the original game, so people who have played Myst before won't find anything all that compelling about playing through again. For people who are on their first play through but don't want to pay for the Masterpiece edition, this may be more to their liking (Channelwood, in particular, is a lot less obtuse when you're actually walking around).\n\nBeyond that....it's Myst. It's a very good point and click adventure game that manages to balance being obtuse without being unfair.

I loved it then and devoured not only the game and its sequels but also the novels and the soundtracks.\n\nNow, many years later, I've revisited the island. realMyst ran well for me: no crashes or other issues on my modern hardware. Sometimes I saw some artifacting around the edge of the screen but this was minor. Navigation and clicking was a bit wonky at times but not too bad for what I expected. My only real complaints are that the Steam overlay never worked, I couldn't take any screenshots with either the Steam function nor the Print Screen key, and alt-tabbing was a bit finnicky.\n\nThe game shows its age texture-wise (I will probably buy realMyst: Masterpiece Edition for the updated textures later) but content-wise it still held together well. It's been long enough that I didn't really remember the puzzles (was even stumped a few times despite knowing I should know the answer) and even the content of the remaining journals in the library was only partially familiar.\n\nThe two sons evoke the right kind of emotional response—Achenar especially. For a game that isn't violent or frightening, it nevertheless has its disturbing moments, and this is perhaps made more potent because of the extra freedom of movement to get up close. There's a curtain in one room, and given the other paraphranalia present...I couldn't help but wonder...what's hidden behind that curtain...? Certainly not a window. And then I decided I didn't want to know.\n\nI enjoyed what to me seems to be enhancements from the original. Stumbling across the grave marker for Ti'ana in particular was an "oh wow" moment that has me wanting to reach for the books again. The bats in one of the underground tunnels were a nice touch too. Discovering the additional content after the original "desired" ending was a real surprise and quite satisfying.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","February 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

I came into the game knowing it age, and realizing that I would be dealing with compatibility issues because of it. So, after a bit of tweaking- thanks to the Steam forums for help on discovering that disabling scaling on high-DPI in the compatibility issues would keep it from freezing- I was able to dive right in.\nWith no death or real failure- mostly- in the game, it is a nice change of pace from most games in one's library to explore and investigate the ages, or worlds, bridged into by the linking books found on the island of Myst.\nThe worlds were beautiful, the sound was excellent- though repetitive in some areas, and the atmosphere of the game was excellent down to the very end. While the interface took some getting used to, and remained a little clunky even after I got used to it, Myst is enjoyable when you play it for what it is. The puzzles may be easy to some, boggling to others, but its a fine little game if you come to appreciate it for what it is. If anything, I am a little saddened that the game was limited in its scope by the technology of the time.","September 12, 2014","true","6.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

After installing the game, just make sure you find the RealMYST.exe program file, right-mouse click it, and troubleshoot compatibility first before launching the game for the first time. Running as if in Windows XP SP2 works for me. Due to rundll32.exe related issues, you may need to find the RealMYST.exe running process in the Windows Task Manager and end it before attempting to launch the game again. I can also choose any of the video graphics options on the RealMYSTSetup.exe; they all work as they should (I have two Titan Black cards in SLI). I didn't need to do any crazy hex mods (as purported elsewhere on the internet) and the game doesn't crash for me.\n\nAs for the game itself, this is probably my all-time favorite version of Myst. I had only briefly played the original at a friend's house a few times, but played and beat this version in the early '00s. I also like it better than the realMyst Masterpiece Edition as I think it does a better job of fully realizing and visually achieving the setting and mood of the game. Though the graphics are more dated looking in general, I think it still looks aesthetically pleasing and appropriate overall. Some of the textures, especially wood, can still hold their own more than a decade later.\n\nIn the original Myst they had a very limited color pallet and resolution to work with by today's standards, so objects and visual features needed to stand out more to be seen and identified in a scene. This was largely corrected in realMyst with textures that made more sense, making it more of a true update. realMyst Masterpiece Edition seems like more of a nostalgia motivated rerelease of the original, but doesn't really hold its own nor make sense by today's standards. Things like the flashlight/excessively dark areas, marker arrow indicators, "tower rotation" being displayed on the Myst island map in the library, and so on just seem out of place and don't really add anything to the game.\n\nEven though I already own realMyst on disc, it was worth getting another copy of it on Steam for the current price.\n\nEnjoy.","January 1","true","14.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Some people have complained about some texture issues, but I haven't noticed it, but it is possible that there is more graphics quality inconsistency than the original, but everything is still better than the original.  I found that having fluid movement helped my immersion of the game.\n\nControls:\nSome people have complained about the game's controls, personally I found them better than the original.  You can adjust several control settings such as mouse speed and dead zone size in the options to suit your needs.  I found the game easier to play when using just the mouse and ignoring the keyboard, left clicking to move forwards.\n\nCompatibility:\nBe aware that some people have had some compatibility issues with the game; you should be able to get the game running, except maybe with some bugs.  Expect more issues if you have a 64bit system.  I personally ran the game with Windows XP SP3 32bit and the game ran perfectly for me, so if you can fall back to an XP system, that will work for you. I will update the review when I upgrade to Windows 10 64bit.\n\nRecommendation:\nI would recommend this version of Myst to any newcomer of the series.  The only issue is that it doesn't cater to nostalgia as much as the original version, so if you are playing the game purely for a nostalgia trip; you might prefer the Myst Masterpiece Edition.","February 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Although the new lighting makes it so that a certain area that you wouldn't think of going into with the lights off in the original is now suddenly somewhat acessible as there's just enough light in there to make out where you are.\nThe addition of the day and night cycle, while neat and athmospheric, makes it tough to progress on some Ages as you can't see ♥♥♥♥ and thus have a harder time getting the puzzles done.\n\nIf it weren't for the added content I wouldn't recommend this but maybe check realMyst ME before buying this and see where you'd rather spend your money.","January 22","true","9.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/recommended/63600/","fngsdd","fungusdude4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/","330 products in account","You awake on the dock of a mysterious island. The air is clear and there's not a soul in sight. You find a few buildings and an assortment of levers, wheels, and buttons. You see a looming tower, overlooking a small, wood-paneled room. There is a shelf of books inside the room, but most of them have been charred and are unreadable. A few remain, still intact. You open one and begin reading. You soon realize there's much to uncover about this world on the isle of MYST.\n\n(Before we go any further, you should know that this 15 year-old game doesn't like to cooperate on modern hardware, so you'll need to mess with some compatibility settings or other workarounds to get it running decently) I'd heard about MYST for years. People always complained about its difficulty or praised it as one of the classics. After toying around with some settings, I got the game running fairly smoothly and I felt...confused. MYST is infamous for its lack of instruction, so I didn't find myself off to the best start. Unfortunately, this was a somewhat common theme for me, as I had to look up a couple hints and solutions along the way. Aside from a couple short video clips and some writings, you're pretty much on your own. Despite my early troubles, I think MYST's puzzles are generally very fair. Yes, they can be difficult, but most are straightforward and very logical. Most of the challenge comes from figuring out how to put together what's directly in front of you. MYST doesn't give you a lot of tools to work with. All you can do is walk around, open doors, manipulate objects in the environment, climb ladders, and pick up a small handful of items. This isn't really a problem, however, since the puzzles are focused and the small number of elements are very efficiently used. Overall, the gameplay is simple and challenging, and the mechanics are sound.\n\nNow MYST is already a great puzzle game, but the game's sound and visuals are what really makes it special. realMYST takes the original's pre-rendered static scenes and replaces them with a fully rendered and animated 3D world. Though this is a contentious decision, I think this change really suits the nature of the game and, from what I understand, it still preserves the original look and feel of the world. A movement speed setting would have been a nice addition, though. realMYST isn't exactly a pretty game by modern standards, but the graphics do convey a very desolate and eerie atmosphere. The textures, while dated, still make the world look fairly realistic. There are even day and night cycles in most of the environments, though their inclusion isn't exactly necessary. The sound design is top-notch, with howling wind, flowing and rippling water, chattering birds, creaky walkways, and more. The sound cues are even necessary for some puzzle solving, but they're used sparingly and expertly. An ambient soundtrack occasionally plays when suitable and it too greatly enhances the atmosphere of the game. Overall, the aesthetics combine to create moods of tranquility, fear, and melancholy, as well as a constant state of lonliness that really immerses you in the environment.\n\nThis was my first real experience with MYST and it will not be the last. While the game is relatively short and it's ending abrupt, I'm more excited than ever to experience the other titles in the franchise and hone my puzzle solving skills. If you're a fan of games with puzzles or a great atmosphere, you should definitely play MYST in some form. I can now clearly see how much MYST has impacted both classic and modern gaming. If you consider yourself a general fan of games or a games enthusiast, I highly recommend you play this treasured (rightly so) adventure of the past.","January 19","true","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

On computers with lower memory and graphics capabilities, Myst has a tendancy to crash.  On machines with higher graphics capabilities and newer opperating systems and more memory, Myst runs smoothly.  It is the mother of all 'escape' games. By that I mean the user must complete various and seemingly unrelated puzzles to move around between 'ages.'  I wish more of the story were told through a short video or pictures or even a vocal narration.  Most of the story is in books, and although books are the basis of travel between 'ages' it is tiresome to read book after book to get all the details.\n\nOverall, Myst is a great puzzle/logic/thinking game where everything you do has a consequence.

Compared to modern games, the Myst series can be merciless in how vague it can be about what to do next. I'm not joking when I say I'd suggest playing this game with a pen and paper available on your desk is almost mandatory. Essential clues are dotted about which can be visual or aureal and sometimes you won't need the clue until much further into the game, so taking notes about every significant sound or unusual symbols or every scrawled peice of text you is a very good idea. The Myst storyline is somewhat light so don't do expecting much but if you enjoy good brain teasers and solving mysteries I'd highly recommend this.

No modern game has come close. That is until this game was released.\n\nThe graphics are top notch and very realistic. The addition of trees and bushes since last year improved the visuals a great deal. The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s graphics technology.\n\nOnline play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to play with up to 8 players. You can stop and resume your round at a later time. There are loads of different play modes available. If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online. The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last round from a number of different angles. Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.\n\nAnother big plus for the game is the freecam mode. Take a virtual tour of the entire game from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.\n\nThis game has lived up to its potential. Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month. This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come. Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.","April 4","false","0.5"," 1 of 15 people (7%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","7","1","15","2","4"

Mostly, the video sequences are much better in Myst Masterpiece; here, due to the real-time 3D (as opposed to pre-rendered screens), they look pixelated and are sometimes hard to hear. However, nearly everything else is fantastic, and you really do feel like this is Myst the way it was meant to be played. I'd recommend this version above all others (make sure you run it in the proper compatibility mode, though), and if you want to see how the video sequences were originally, you can probably find them on YouTube et al.","January 5, 2012","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/63600/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","I'm a real hardcore Myst fan. Have read all the books, got the OST CDs and played all the games mulitple times (Except Uru.. hated that one), so I'm coming at RealMyst as someone very passionate about the games as well as the genre.  It had been a while since I last tackled Myst, so the puzzles were vaguely familiar, but not easy to solve: e.g. I knew the way to solve the generator puzzle on Myst, but not the specific response.\n\nThe translation to full 3D brings this game back to absolutely fresh. It was great to be able to experience this all over again from a completely new perspective.    I'd say that many of the puzzles were a lot easier thanks to the ability to spin around and see the status of switches and pipes without having to step-move-turn-step-etc  to see.\n\nThe graphics are all quite rudimentary for a 3d game - polygons as well as shading and fogging artefacts show up a lot, reminding you that this is quite an old game.   Saying that, the translation to full 3D has been done in a really sympathetic way:  the ages all feel the way they used to, and the addition of atmospheric effects, variable lighting, day/night cycles and so on really adds that "well loved" feel to this remake.  The world feels exactly the same, basically, which is a remarkable achievement considering the time span between the original and remake, the different teams and technologies.\n\nThe new team has added in some new content as well, including a new "Age" which helps to link to the next game, Riven.  There's a nod to "Ti'Ana" from one of the books, and other small additions here and there.  Very nicely done.\n\nThe music and sounds have been lovingly ported over.  The music is exactly as I remember it, and the videos in the books look to be direct copies of the original video files: No upscaling or re-taping has been done, so the grainy feel of the books is perfect.\n\nThe game plays through virtually seamlessly (see Crashing notes below).  The ability to only move forwards and backwards and spin is probably some way to make it 'feel' more like the original, so you gently slide into the "myst groove" as you move through the world.\n\nOK, so the game itself has clearly been remade by a team dedicated to the faithfulness of the original.. But how did they do technology-wise? Well if you're playing this on a modern PC (windows Vista or above) you're gonna run into problems.     The game really needs to run as administrator in XP compatibility mode to reduce the number of CTDs.  Secondly, the format of the videos in the books is the exact same "Indeo v5" that was used in the original game, so I'm guessing the video files are the self-same video files!   Unfortunately Steam doesn't install Indeo.  I had to hunt about to find an appropriate install. The "official" ones didn't install properly, so ended up going to cucusoft to get theirs... Once that was done, the book videos started to play, and I didn't get the wierd "1FPS" bug when I was facing towards the "library".\n\nOnce that was all sorted, the game crashed on me about 5 times during the playthrough, so I advise saving every 10 minutes or so.  Set an alarm clock or something to remind you... Once I played for about an hour and it crashed.. not too pleased.\n\nGetting to the end was a real joy.  Totally enjoyed the addition of "Rime", but it confused the heck out of me when the game didn't "End", I was just left at (basically) a dead end.  This is intentional, and Even Atrus says that's what I should do, so I can't be too gripey, but it was a bit "hunh?".\n\nThis is a fantastic remake. Anyone who enjoyed the original should get this and re-enjoy it all over again.  It doesn't take long to finish.  Just remember: save often!  Two-thumbs-up!\n","January 25, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like to think back to this game with nostalgia, as it was the first computer game I played and am very glad I purchased a digital copy, rather than fighting with the old disk.  I did not buy this expecting the graphics to live up to the standards we see more modern games, and in that Myst had not lost one ounce of its charm.\n\nAfter completion of the game: I did not encounter any problems running this game in Windows 7 (no freeze-ups, no dropped saves, no glitched books, etc…).  Certainly there were a few frame issues stemming from the 3D port, but it did not affect my appreciation for the preservation of this classic. For those of you who have had issues running the game, I suggest reading up on the solutions in the forums.  My advice is to (1) make sure everything is up to date (your computer and the game itself), and (2) insure this game launches itself in compatibility mode (I chose Windows XP service pack 3).","July 17, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a much slower pace than modern equivalents, there really is no "death/game over" involved, it's just a game about solving simple to complex puzzles while making use of intuition, memory, observation, curiosity and just general knowledge. You follow a very intriguing story about a father and his two sons all the while trying to figure out why they have been trapped in their respective books (ages).\n\nThe concept is amazing, where with the appropriate knowledge you can literally write worlds into existance and travel to them. I would highly recommend reading the books if you find the Myst series to be your cup of tea aswell as playing the other entries.

Have read all the books, got the OST CDs and played all the games mulitple times (Except Uru.. hated that one), so I'm coming at RealMyst as someone very passionate about the games as well as the genre.  It had been a while since I last tackled Myst, so the puzzles were vaguely familiar, but not easy to solve: e.g. I knew the way to solve the generator puzzle on Myst, but not the specific response.\n\nThe translation to full 3D brings this game back to absolutely fresh. It was great to be able to experience this all over again from a completely new perspective.    I'd say that many of the puzzles were a lot easier thanks to the ability to spin around and see the status of switches and pipes without having to step-move-turn-step-etc  to see.\n\nThe graphics are all quite rudimentary for a 3d game - polygons as well as shading and fogging artefacts show up a lot, reminding you that this is quite an old game.   Saying that, the translation to full 3D has been done in a really sympathetic way:  the ages all feel the way they used to, and the addition of atmospheric effects, variable lighting, day/night cycles and so on really adds that "well loved" feel to this remake.  The world feels exactly the same, basically, which is a remarkable achievement considering the time span between the original and remake, the different teams and technologies.\n\nThe new team has added in some new content as well, including a new "Age" which helps to link to the next game, Riven.  There's a nod to "Ti'Ana" from one of the books, and other small additions here and there.  Very nicely done.\n\nThe music and sounds have been lovingly ported over.  The music is exactly as I remember it, and the videos in the books look to be direct copies of the original video files: No upscaling or re-taping has been done, so the grainy feel of the books is perfect.\n\nThe game plays through virtually seamlessly (see Crashing notes below).  The ability to only move forwards and backwards and spin is probably some way to make it 'feel' more like the original, so you gently slide into the "myst groove" as you move through the world.\n\nOK, so the game itself has clearly been remade by a team dedicated to the faithfulness of the original.. But how did they do technology-wise? Well if you're playing this on a modern PC (windows Vista or above) you're gonna run into problems.     The game really needs to run as administrator in XP compatibility mode to reduce the number of CTDs.  Secondly, the format of the videos in the books is the exact same "Indeo v5" that was used in the original game, so I'm guessing the video files are the self-same video files!   Unfortunately Steam doesn't install Indeo.  I had to hunt about to find an appropriate install. The "official" ones didn't install properly, so ended up going to cucusoft to get theirs... Once that was done, the book videos started to play, and I didn't get the wierd "1FPS" bug when I was facing towards the "library".\n\nOnce that was all sorted, the game crashed on me about 5 times during the playthrough, so I advise saving every 10 minutes or so.  Set an alarm clock or something to remind you... Once I played for about an hour and it crashed.. not too pleased.\n\nGetting to the end was a real joy.  Totally enjoyed the addition of "Rime", but it confused the heck out of me when the game didn't "End", I was just left at (basically) a dead end.  This is intentional, and Even Atrus says that's what I should do, so I can't be too gripey, but it was a bit "hunh?".\n\nThis is a fantastic remake. Anyone who enjoyed the original should get this and re-enjoy it all over again.  It doesn't take long to finish.  Just remember: save often!  Two-thumbs-up!\n","January 25, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get used to disappointment. This game crash simulator is SO realistic you will think they brought back Windows Vista just for you.\n\nI have to admit, I prefered the original WORKING version of the game, but that's not what I purchased.","December 13, 2015","false","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Yes, there are performance issues with RealMyst on Windows 7/8. When I first ran it, it was very choppy in certain parts, and crashed every 5 minutes or so. I tried a few solutions online, but none of them seemed to work. However, after setting the game to run as an Administrator and in Windows XP Compatibility mode it runs smoothly, and without any crashes. There is no guarantee that this will work, but it seems to solve the issue for most people.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is the same old Myst that you know and love, only taking the time to add a small (but cool) age at the end of the game, and to update the graphics. The new graphics on highest settings look similar to the screenshots, though it is worth noting that you can add anti-aliasing and resolutions at least up to 1366x768. They add a refreshing coat of paint to the outdated visuals of the original, making it more than playable even in this day and age. Also, the new control scheme is pretty nice, allowing you to mouse and keyboard, though I preferred using just the mouse. Granted, the controls aren't perfect, but they aren't horrendous either.\n\nNow would I recommend this over RealMyst Masterpiece Edition? I only own this edition, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. However, it seems to me that the Masterpiece Edition's graphics jumble and confuse things more than they ought to. Watching videos of the Masterpiece Edition makes it seem like certain elements are harder to see, but that of course is up to personal taste and perception. It seems to me that this version is a fine version of Myst, and it's price is hard to beat. I don't know that the Masterpiece Edition's graphics are worth the extra $12.\n\nBottom Line: If you feel like replaying Myst, or want to experience it for the first time, I think this game is the one for you.","May 30, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The upgrade to a "live" world totally transforms too, and makes it much more fun to play.","November 5, 2012","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
