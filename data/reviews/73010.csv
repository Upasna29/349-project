See if you can do better.\nCities in motion is a simulator game where you can be the one to work out the public transport of a city. Sounds easy enough, just some bus lines here and there. A tram line on this road here, and everything is connected.\nAnd then you give it a while, and there's 8 busses waiting for that one bus stop with a waiting line of 250 people. Clearly you didn't think that one through. But that's okay, where a normal job as public transport planner would have you fired for that, here you can try again or fix it somehow. So then you can add subway stations, boats, and helicopters, and before you know it you're covering the city and hours passed.\n\nThe interface and controls are easy to learn(If a little odd at times), and the game mechanics are easy enough as well. However, mastering the game mechanics and planning out the city public transport is much harder. You'll have to go through several attempts to figure out what goes wrong and how to fix it, and you may want to take a look at the actual public transport system in your city for ideas.\nEdit: Also, it has some inaccuracies. Amsterdam does not look anything like that. And you can just build a subway tunnel under the Berlin wall. Replacing old vehicles is a pain too.\n\nAs for the technical details, it's surprisingly good. Every citizen appears to be modeled*(*I didn't count them. at least a large enough amount of them to make the cities feel alive), and you can follow them through their morning commute, shopping trips, and visits to others. And this is all supported by the game mechanics, you can set a citizen as interesting person, and the game will show you a portrait of him where he goes. (Warning: Long) In my latest case, I looked at a factory in Vienna, and found a red car driving from the top of a parking garage(Mentally following it through the roof as it drove down) next to it down to the ground floor and onto the streets. So I asked, why is this person not using the public transport system to work and back? Wilhelm Klein, factory supervisor - Drives by car from his home, connected to the public transport, to work, also connected to the public transport system. He then went shopping at a big department store, which too was connected by public transport.\nAfter that, he went to a church far outside of Vienna, in a smaller village where I did not yet expand to. He then returned home.\n\nI didn't have the money, but I figured I'd have to connect that place somehow when I did get money. So I went on to look around town, just watching people board the bus and go around. After a while, Wilhelm was moving again. Another day at work. This time, he wandered to the tram stop down the street and was quickly picked up by one of the passing trams. He then got out at a connection to the subway, but instead took the bus at that same subway station, and rode it all the way down to work.\nA while after, he boarded the bus again and I watched him go back to the tram station for what I assumed to be the way home. But not this time. This time he went into the subway, so I look at his info screen and see his destination is a ministry building near the town center and then back home with a direct tram line. I connect the extra village with a busline, and I speed up time a bit.\n\nWhen I check back on Wilhelm, he has a new job. He is hired as secretary in the ministry building he went to way back then. Perhaps he couldn't handle his supervisor job at the factory, or perhaps he never really wanted it in the first place.\nBut either way, Wilhelm is happy now, and he can go with a direct tram line from his home to his work, and from there, anywhere in Vienna he wants.\n\nMission succesfull, the citizens of Vienna can stay in motion","October 23, 2014","true","49.4"," 73 of 78 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","73","78","8","2"

I am a huge tycoon / sim junkie and I was able to grasp the basics right off the bat.\n\nHowever, the main issue I have is the sim engine itself is incredibly difficult to work with.  To make money, you need to move passengers from point A to B.  Optimum lines for doing such tend to be a little too popular and in order to keep up with the demand, you need to add more vehicles.  More vehicles clog up the roadways (which don't seem to thin out no matter how many people you have using the public system in the first place), which deceases your efficiency even more.  In the midst of this entire mess, you have to constantly babysit your wages and ticket prices as the in-game economy fluctuates.  Too high, and your already angry customer base will ignore you completely, leaving you with no income.  Too low, and your lines get flooded, which then turns into a rinse and repeat of the first problem.\n\nI managed to successfully beat the first scenario after a countless number of restarts, and I am still hung up on the second after 22 hours of play.  In the end, you always end up broke and PO'd unless you did things 100% the way the designers intended.  Deviate just a little, and you're toast.\n\nIn the end, CiM is just a puzzler pretending to be a sim.  Avoid unless you have the Buddha's patience.","July 6, 2015","false","33.9"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","41","52","4","5"

This causes heavy jams in front of the stations where trains que up infinetly. People on subsequent stops can hardly enter the train thus get angry. Also you can not add more trains to the line because they will only add to the que in front of this one faulty station\n\nThis is messing with the whole (!) metro nework and there is absolutly nothing what you can do about it ...\n\nThe bug is known but the developers sadly don't care about it.\n\nAlso beware of high CPU Loads and memory leaks. After some time the Game will slow down as hell.\n\nThe missions are mostly funny, but instead of encouraging and guide you to build a reasonable network, it rather forces you to build non-profitable lines.\nThere is in general not much assistance or feedback to understand why your system is working or not as well as the statistics are not so useful.\n\nThe mod system is great - very active community.\n\nbottom line: In the beginn it's a good fun to play this game but it lacks long term motivation because of enoying bugs and lack of reasonable feedback.\n\nPS: The screenshots are very misleading about the actual gameplay!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/73010/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Cities in Motion is one of those games you just cant help but enjoy playing.  Its got a lot of positives going for it and then.... inevitability the longer you play it, the more frustation creeps in.  In the end it will wave goodbye to all that goodwill that it built up in the many hours of previous play.\n\nThe game tries to be at its core a simplified mass-transit simulator.   You take control of a company looking to build several transport routes across a number of recreated cities in the hopes of gaining enough money to expand the network and eventually complete a number of mission objectives.  All the while you have to deal with maintaining the infrastructure and vehicles, keeping your public reputation as high as possible and generating a profit to pay your workers.\n\nThere are 2 campaigns.  I only completed the first, which consisted of 12 scenarios, each of them stand-a-lone so you are not penalized when you begin the next one.  Objectives come in the form of petitions, which tend number around 12-18 per scenario.  Their content is a variation upon a theme, such as; build x number of lines, build a line from a to b, keep your vehicles maintained above y, transport z passengers, increase or decrease prices, remove n number of stops, stop a line for x weeks, etc.  For the most part these are all fairly easy to carry out and you are only restricted by money, at least at the start.\n\nThere are five types of transport lines which you can use to carry passengers around the city: bus (road), trams (lines), metro (underground), ferry (water) and heliports (air).  Each has several (around 35) vehicles in total with their own strengths and weakeness such as; carry capacity, reliability, speed, attractiveness, which provide benefits and weaknesses to your strategy.\n\nAdd to this the need to tinker with prices as an abstracted economy rises and falls, the ability to finance through bank loans your next big project and you get the picture.  Take all of these ingredients and you get what is a fun, enjoyable and not to difficult game to play.  For the most part the game works.   However... as you play more and more you get to see that the game isnt exactly well designed.  Or built.\n\nYou can essentially perform gamey actions to circumvent the restrictions that the developers have in store for you, allowing you to build up cash reserves quickly without any bad effects.  Once youve completed the first few maps there is little to tax anyone looking for something with a harder challenge.   The first campaign maps encompass four cities; Berlin, Amsterdam, Vienna & Helsinki but, once you have figured out the best strategy for each one, you can re-apply the same strategy over and over, despite the different starting circumstances.\n\nThe biggest let-down has to be the bugged campaign scenario 2 petiton that never triggers.  This means you can never complete the associated achievement, unless you find a user-made editor, that allows you to access the relevant file and edit one word in the code.  One word!!  Thats unforgiveable given that many patches were released for this game and this major fault is still not fixed!  The other major issue (if you are an achievement hunter) is that another achievement requires purchase of 34 base game vehicles.  Of which I have attempted to acquire twice.   The base game even includes more than 34 vehicles.  Unfortunately the counter stops at 15 for me.  I know others have had the same problem.\n\nDespite having many, many dlcs, you do not need any of them to get all the achievements.  The fact that the developers (and publisher) do not force you to buy all the extra dlcs they made to get 100% achievements would have otherwise been a great plus for this game.... but alas no..... I highly suspect  that you will need to purchase at least some other dlcs (with extra vehicles in them) to get this "all vehicles" achievement.\n\nIts really disappointing... because if not for these core issues I would say that overall Cities in Motion is an above average, if slightly lightweight mass-transit simulator.  One that I would have recommended to those of you interested in the genre or looking for something non-violent.  As it is all that good work was undone on the final straight.\n\n* If the developers ever fix these two achievement issue I will happily change this to a YES recommendation.\n** The Complete Collection achievement can be triggered by downloading a MOD (of all the vehicles reworked)  For some reason in their unpacked form they register.","March 5, 2015","false","75.4"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","40","60","4","0"

It is its own unique game, so you can't really compare it to another game. Its not without its bugs and annoyances though, which include Traffic Jams (Saving, Restarting and Reloading sometimes helps) and more passengers than you will be able to transport.. The DLC vehicles also get added into timeframes they do not belong in, making it unrealistic to the point where you will ignore the small vehicles and just go for the larger\bigger DLC vehicles which carry the most passengers and non DLC vehicles are stupidly slow and handle small numbers of passengers. However overlooking this, it is possible to play with an erection and you can find yourself either quick playing to complete campaign tasks or modifying, changing and adding to existing routes. A few have complained about DLC price but this often appears in sales and cheap on Bundle websites with the DLC, so keep looking and if you see it on sale with the DLC or in a bundle, its worth a go.","November 23, 2014","true","16.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Games like SimCity are high-level simulations that let you build services like trains and bus stops and then forget about them, trusting their operation to whatever imaginary middle-managers you have. Cities in Motion is the game for them, a simulation entirely concerned with developing and managing transit systems. And while that might not sound like the most thrilling thing in the world, it's presented in such a relaxing, charming way that it's hard not to find joy in.\n\nEach scenario in Cities in Motion sets you in a fully-realized 3D city, where every building and landmark is named and given uses to the populace. You run a startup transportation company, charged with arranging bus lines, tram routes, subway tunnels, and more to achieve goals and turn a profit. The first part is pretty simple and fun, as you get regular missions to connect different parts of the city in various ways. This can be anything from running trains from downtown to the suburbs, to building a bus stop for one very lazy fellow's house.\n\nThe second part, turning a profit, is where you might get stuck. There are a LOT of factors to consider when drawing a bus line or even just placing a stop. There are seven classes of people to ferry around, including blue-collar workers, tourists, and retirees. They all live in different parts of the city and have different transit needs, so just running lines from apartments to shopping centers might not cut it if those apartments are where students or CEOs live. There are also a mess of vehicles to outfit your routes with, each with different price tags, speeds, safety ratings, appeals, and fuel consumptions. Add to that your control over wages, ticket prices, and advertising, plus a full economic model for the city that can change the business landscape during recessions and crisises, and you may very well have trouble grasping why you're not making any money.\n\nAt least the interface won't be what's standing in your way. Cities in Motion has some very helpful information overlays for the city, as well as useful graphs and charts of your company's performance at all levels. Routes are shown in clear paths overlaid on the city, and floating tabs over your stops display all the key information you need to make informed decisions about your service. The 3D models of everything, from the buildings to the busses to the people, are surprisingly detailed and pleasantly animated. The sound design is exactly what you're expecting as well, with pleasing jingles and chimes over a mostly relaxed soundtrack. You'll find plenty of content to keep you busy as well, with loads of campaigns, scenarios, and sandboxes spread across the many cities of the world. It'll take some effort to break into, but Cities in Motion does everything it can to make the steep learning curve a fun one to climb.","June 6","true","1.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There's no rush and no competition, you can simply let the game run, amass money and build all over your city.\n\nIt's not a bad game overall but unfortunately it gets boring, bland and repetitive very quickly. I've played for 28 hours few years ago and never started it since.","January 21, 2014","false","28.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

If you enjoy city simulations and especially the old transport tycoon deluxe, this game is a must have.  The game has about an hour learning curve and I play with the "double capacity" mod.  The game focuses on Helsinki, Berlin, Amsterdam and Vienna throughout a fantastic campaign with enjoyable music.  The DLC adds many more cities and vehicles for hundreds of hours of fun.  This is the game I play when I need to relax and it was the first game I've ever bothered to 100% achievement on Steam.  It's that good.  I played this for many hours to distract me from the pain after a couch was dropped on my foot and blew my entire toenail off.  This game is losing your toenail distracting good!

Over the years, starting from the age of transportation, roughly 1930 onwards and you have a choice of either buses, trams, metro, ferries or helicopters and with the more money you make the more transport services you can add\n\nOverall the game is fun and challenging, however, I do feel that there were certain gameplay functions that were needed in this game but were added in its sequel, Cities in Motion 2. Also, sometimes I feel angry when I can't create the perfect transportation system, however, in the real life, none of the transportation services are perfect\n\nThe only thing I would complain about is it's game's performance. Once you add too many things, the game chugs like mad, it looks like the game couldn't handle it. Sometimes even crashing the game and losing your progress thus far, Also, the huge amounts of DLC is kind of ridiculous\n\nHowever, if you played such classics as Transport Tycoon or you would like to play a game where you manage your own transport company, then Cities in Motion is the game for you!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","April 7","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In this game, you can't randomly build anything and expect to make a profit, you have to inspect which kind of people will use your service, where they want to go, plan your routes so the vehicles can travel faster, which bank you'll get loan, which kind of advertisement you'll use and how long, it also has a single player campaign with mission-based scenario alongside with sandbox mode and map editor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/recommended/73010/","uncleyar","UncleYar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/","2124 products in account","Very good transport manager game. It has a very detailed simulation of passengers, who hop from one means of transportation to another to get to their destination: you can actually see them walk to leave the tram and take the metro, and so on. In that respect I like it better than classics like Transport Tycoon, since that one never bothered to properly model passengers traveling around (OpenTTD attempted it but IMO failed so far).\n\nI can be tough to manage the hordes of angry passengers waiting at your stops, but that problem is handily solved by raising prices for the corresponding transport type really high (thus attracting less users) and using the largest capacity vehicles you can. Don't use too many vehicles on a line or you'll cause traffic jams. Reading community guide on Steam or reading the official Cities in Motion FAQ is recommended if you want to understand the game mechanics in-depth.\n\nI don't find many faults to this game but there are a few:\n- Given a crowd of angry passengers at a stop, it's hard to figure out where they want to go. You have to check them one by one. Also some statistics that would be useful are not shown, but you can add a few more by the installation of the Line Statistics Plus mod (see this group for a mod archive: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/cimx ).\n- Missions are silly with writing that feels childish.\n- Game quits out of a mission as soon as you complete the last main objective. I would've prefered to keep playing around with my network until I decide I want to end the mission.\n- Placing tram rails can be fiddly, sometimes it looks as if the line should be able to pass between two buildings or across a curved road, and it doesn't.\n\nOverall though, very enjoyable. I do recommend playing on Easy if you're just starting out.","August 28, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the music is peaceful, and it is a relaxing game to play.  Playing the tutorial is great as it features a small modern city, and in time you are able to create a wonderful public transport system. But then when you start playing the actual missions, the first mission is Nazi Germany just before World War 2.  I mean, come on?!!  Isn't there a better city and time period to start with?  There were very few choices of vehicles, such a the only bus being a very slow bus that can only hold 10 people in a city with thousands of people wanting to catch a bus.  Have they never heard of a faster double decker bus like you can choose in the tutorial game?  Before long, hundreds of people are queuing at your bus stops, and you are losing money preventing you from building more transport lines.  Then there is a traffic jam which holds everything up.  Cars will randomly stop for no reason, or vehicles will stop to allow people to cross in the middle of the street, some vehicles will drive along at what seems to be 2mph.  In the meantime, all your empty buses are building up at the back of the traffic jam as they can't reach the bus stops!\n\nThis would be a brilliant game if they gave more choice to the vehicles such as faster vehicles, and vehicles holding more people, and improved the traffic system to prevent every car in the city stopping and driving so slowly that nothing can move on the roads!  Perhaps they should have started the first mission with a modern city with more transport choices, and perhaps a research lab to design new vehicles.","June 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You're hired to improve the public transit situation in a given city, and you need to perform. The game is pretty well put together, but the controls take some getting used to.

While in Sim City you have to manage everything about your city including zoning, roads, and utilities, in Cities in Motion you focus exclusively on public transportation.  Try to anticipate your citizen's needs and set up tramways, bus lines, subways, and water taxis... The game does have a significant learning curve, however, so make sure you go through the tutorials.","December 27, 2011","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't get to keep your stuff between scenarios. And the scenarios all end too soon. There's no way to lose - there's no due date on missions, and banks are willing to lend you money endlessly. You can even complete 'get X money' missions by borrowing from the bank!\n\n\nWhile you get different ways of moving peeps around, there's no balance. Underground, while expensive, makes you a lot of money. Buses and trams cause traffic jams everywhere they go (btw, trams have as much capacity as buses for some weird reason). Helicopters don't have enough capacity to service a popular route and are too expensive for unpopular one, and boats… there aren't many good spots for boats.\n\n\nBuilding interface isn't great either. With trams its just annoying. With metro it penalizes trying to optimize. Since every part of an underground line is so expensive, you can't really experiment with placements (for example you might think that building a short part of your line on the ground/elevated might be cheaper, but it requires so much trial and error to make it all fit, that it'll probably end up being more expensive).\n\n\nManaging prices is really boring and needs to be done pretty often. Every now and then you have to adjust ~10 values to make them green/white/bright red and that's it.\n\n\nDespite all this the game is playable and pretty fun. If you are done with Roller Coaster Tycoons, openttd and sim cities than sure, get this.","March 12, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game difficulty can be high as their are numerous options and menus to remember, but the presentation is polished and the tutorial is adequate to get you started.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported, and the graphics are servicable and comparable to other similar titles.  Fans of the Tropico series and Cities XL will find a lot to love about Cities in Motion, with the addition of helicopter and triple tiered underground transportation a welcome addition above and beyond what those titles offer.  In short, if you like a deep, lovingly detailed city management game, you will undoubtedly enjoy Cities in Motion.","April 13, 2012","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdleMuse/recommended/73010/","IdleMuse","IdleMuse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdleMuse/","301 products in account","Cities in Motion is a unique strategy game. On the surface it seems like a pretty standard business management sim, where for many in the genre, the business you are managing is rather simple, strategically: choose which animals for your zoo, which rollercoasters to buy, which employees to hire or fire, these choices don't make much of a difference overall. Not so for Cities in Motion: the route management section of the game is deep and involving; combining bus and tram routes to minimise traffic in trouble areas is an example of the meat and vegetables of a game which delivers challenges outside the economic norm for the genre.\n\nIt also helps that the graphics are gorgeous, the interface is, for the most part, slick and easy to use, and the play experience is restful and calm, without being boring in pacing. The city layouts are challenging and diverse.\n\nOn the downside, it could use some balance tweaks (particularly in the DLC), but these are easily obtainable online.","December 27, 2011","true","42.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You manage a citiy's public transportation network, including buses, trams, subways, helicopters and boats. The gameplay is definitely comparable to TG, but it seems slightly less professional. For example, you can't let buses and trams stop at one station. Buses only pick up passengers at designated bus stops, and trams need their own stop, too. Other minor cosmetic details the game lacks are the ability to place (longer) train stations diagonally, which makes it sometimes difficult to efficiently place elevated tracks and stations in cities with a round shape.\n\nThese minor things are however almost entirely neglected by the fact that the AI (e.g. the city's inhabitants) are far superior. They don't need a tram and a bus to stop at one specific station. They get off the bus, look around, see a tram station not far and they will go there by foot and then take the tram. This allows for realistic, central traffic hubs with a subway exit which people leave, then cross the street to get to the bus stop to continue their journey.\n\nIn general, the game looks great. Graphics are VERY detailed, I've spent at least 40-50% of my playtime doing nothing but watching my trains and trams going around town, picking up passengers, fighting their way through the (sometimes intense) car traffic and all the other little things you can observe.\n\nThere are 4 maps in the game, which you can play in a period of 100 years. In this time period, cities grow and change, just like the cars and vehicles you can use change. The managment of your business is not super deep, you can set the maintenance percentage of stations and vehicles, but not much more. You can get loans, but these things are somewhat simple, too. For example, after taking three loans of each 100 million $ from three different banks, the fourth bank is totally fine with giving you a fourth, giant credit wihtout even asking. So, the economic structures are there, but they are kept somewhat simple. Which is fine by me.\n\nSlight issue with this: atm chaning ticket prices doesn't seem to affect anything. You still have 300 people waiting in your metro stations. Maybe this will be fixed later. Nothing serious, though.\n\nIn general, this is not Sim City, it's not complex and deep and superior in any possibly way, but it is a very fun game for people interested in the subject. And for 20€/$/whatnot really worth its money.","May 26, 2011","true","53.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, even after all these years, the graphics still looks very well done, and you can always download some new maps and vehicles to further expand your game.\n\nThe only problem with this game is that it is only single-threaded. That means if you run a giant map and have tons of lines and vehicles running around, it will slow your game down to a choppy mess even with a fast CPU. But if you can overlook this point, this game is extremely fun to play as a sandbox transport sim.","December 27, 2011","true","201.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would possibly be a great game.\nHave tried several times just on the tutorial to learn this game to no avail.\nCouldn't be bothered to start a proper map.\n\nUpdate.\nPlayed The Paris city.\nI used Cheat app and provided myself $16,000,000. Couldn't stop playing, was actually quite enjoyable.  I am quite confident to start a normal game without cheats now.\nMassive subway system, and I reallly got into it.\nAdvise if possible don't start with Tutorial as it turned me away from the game. Use unlimited funds or similar and start a game in a proper city, until you get used to it.\nStart with a subway and work down to trams then buses.\n\nI will keep a thumbs down due to the fact that it took all this time to get into the game. And almost gave up on it due to the stupid introduction.\n\nAs a score would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars after becoming more familiar. It ended up being a hidden gem in the end.","February 13, 2015","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Events happen to the cities that will effect traffic and your company also which is pretty nice makes you think about your placement of certain lines. Nice detail in the cities and pretty fun if you are into management games. One con for me would have to be not having the ability to manage the time schedules of each vehicles so what you have is sometimes a backup of vehicles at the same stop, but it was added in the sequel which i havent tried out yet.

I especially like it because the game offers you the tools to come up with creative solutions to building transit (That house is in the way of your streetcar line? Tear it down!). The cities also look really good!\n\nThe only downsides are that this is a complicated game to get used to at first (especially if you're new to simulation games) and the tutorial isn't all that great. Also, this is a business game first and a transit management game second. More often than not you'll find yourself spending more time raising money to build new lines than you will be actually managing/building said lines.
