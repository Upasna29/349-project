The materials behave wrong, so there is no buckling of long thin steel, instead you see steel cables break from tension first.\nSometimes if you span a cable between two bearings (no load) it changes the behavior of your design (although this is mathematically not possible). Even better: when applying wind force on the described cable it broke! (This sounds like a bad joke but you can try it yourself)\nThe guy that made the algorythm has no no idea about structual calculations and/or the game designer didn't have common sense in noticing that there are GAMEBREAKING bugs in the simulation.\n\nWhen you have to build suspension bridges, the experience is the worst (refer to the cable above), as they in general behave unbelieveable random and unrealistc - many levels you can just finish with try-retry and error and not with your knowledge about structual engineering.\nAt the same point this brings the only challenge you have, as the levels are boring and uninspired.\n\nIt happens regulary that your bridge collapses in one test and then you delete a part, rebuild the same part and suddenly it works. This brings us to the only good point of the game. Bridge collapse spectacular- what happens often randomly.\n\nUltimatly the unprecise  (especially if you want to delete something) slow controls (icons spread over the whole screen) what makes retrying more frustrating than it should be.\n\nI tried to give this game a chance, because i actually work as civil engineer - but i really got disappointed by the fake realism.","March 5, 2014","false","7.5"," 158 of 183 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","158","183","0","0"

There is no consistency in how materials behave, the interface is infuriating, and rather than being fun to play, I find it a tedious chore.\n\nMany levels have identical setups; however, a bridge that just worked on one behaves completely differently on the other. The first will have zero stress while at rest and easily handles the traffic while the second will have red on all joints and will fail the instant any traffic touches it. The game shows no reason for this change in behavior. It simply is the way things work.\n\nAs for the interface, it is very difficult to edit a bridge. This results in my rebuilding the bridge from scratch each time or just using undo until it removes the part I want removed and beginning again from that point. The reason for this is that I can right-click a piece to remove it, but it doesn't remove the entire section that was added, just a portion of it. If I place down two sections to brace the bridge, I need to right click and remove around 10 different segments to remove those two sections. There is the ability to draw a box around sections to highlight them and them remove them, but many times, the cursor will change to indicate that it is select mode yet will still add new sections, making it difficult to use that tool. Even when the select tool works, it removes too much as it will remove joint placement points for remaining sections, making them unusable.\n\nI tried to like this game, but the flaws show me that this is simply a "us too" bridge simulator and not one made to be a quality and enjoyable game.","May 13, 2015","false","0.9"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","44","52","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/232950/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""This bridge falls apart rather quickly"\n\nSteam is starting to build up a collection of bridge building games for users interested in them, with Bridge It, Bridge Constructor and Bridge Project to pick from. It  took me a while to get this title, but I ended up getting this for a dollar from the Humble Bundle site during a Weekly sale. I'm beginning to feel I paid too much for the game.\n\nStory\nNo story to this, you are just some random idiot building bridges that can't support the weight of a feather. Why do they keep giving me this job?\n\nPresentation\nThe game looks nice for a bridge building title, but seems it isn't optimized as well as other titles, with me having to reduce graphics settings rather than leaving everything maxed. It does at least have different cars crossing the bridge, rather than several identical vehicles.\n\nThe game has a few basic tunes to listen to as you put together the monstrosity you call a bridge, along with different sound effects for the various vehicles, placing pieces and even a victory fanfare for completing a level.\n\nControls\nNot quite as good as the other games mentioned at the start of the review. Placing pieces works, but the pointer is inaccurate. You might have it aimed at a certain point, but the piece will be aiming at a different section of the layout grid. This really needs some work. Removing pieces is also an annoyance. You need to right click a piece to bring up a menu to remove pieces. Which would be fine, if it responded as it should. The inaccurate aim seems to affect this as well, meaning you may need to repeat the action several times.\n\nGameplay\nAlright, outside of the problems that the controls will cause, jut how fun is this game? Well, its alright. You lay down some pieces, send the vehicles across, watch it fail, then repeat until it works. You might notice I didn't mention a need to edit the bridge. Well, this game has some wonky physics. Just because the bridge didn't work the first time doesn't mean it won't the second time. Don't worry too much about building a perfect bridge, that failure still has a chance. Also, if you have an impressive failure, take screen shots now. I missed out my own chance because of the physics.\n\nThis game is starting to look pretty poor, but don't worry, it isn't all bad news. One thing it has over the other titles is what you can throw at your bridge. Think you have built a real sturdy beast of a bridge? Send out the tanks! That will crush it in moments. There is cars, buses, trains, tanks, earthquakes, high speed winds and the occasional boat if you are doing the right level.\n\nLifespan\nThis game has 4 different level sets, those being Rural, Cities, Canyons and Varied. Each set has 12 levels to figure out. Its not too bad, the later levels will have you working hard to find a solution that doesn't collapse. It also has a limited level construction tool so you can make your own levels to share on Steam. Lastly, there are a small number of achievements, related to game progress for the most part, with only one being a weird challenge. Constructor has much more interesting achievements if you care about these.\n\nAfter spending some time on this game, I'm going to have to say this is the worst of the three bridge building games. While it has the most vehicle options and even custom levels, the flaws of the game prevent it from being as good as Bridge It, or even the much cheaper Bridge Constructor. Save your cash and wait for one of the other two to hit a sale or bundle.\n\n3 / 10","March 2, 2014","false","1.4"," 129 of 193 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","129","193","0","7"

It's graphically polished however the physics (the main gamplay element for a bridge building game) are flawed.\nSymmetrical bridges will have massive stress on one side and no stress on the other even with no load.

Nice to see it's not just Aliens: Colonial Marines that sucked complete and utter balls. Ultimately this is another example of a good concept, poorly executed. You might surmise (from the awesome looking screenshot) that you would be building epic bridges spanning huge chasms with a wealth of materials at your disposal so you can build a bridge your way. No. What you actually get is a series of extremely similar small levels that require you to build a bridge out of the limited materials given (pretty much ruining any hopes you might have for grand designs). The controls are flawed and the similarity of the levels and the crappy physics engine mean 9 times out of 10 the correct solution to finish the level is to build the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing bridge, varied only by the material used in its construction and whether most of the support goes on the left or the right hand side. It's stale, boring and unimaginative when it could easily have been so much more. In other words, a typical German simulator cobbled together for the bargain bins of the world's game stores.","April 10, 2013","false","2.2"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

Watching the city buses smash into one another as the bridges fell apart was always worth a chuckle.\n\nIn simple construction mode it's possible to beat every mission in a single sitting (if you can dedicate most of a day off to that sort of thing).  This isn't a game you'll really go back to more than once or twice.\n\nThe user interface could also use a little work.  Sometimes you end up building pieces that don't quite touch and immediately fall apart once you start the simulation.  It's workable, but not great.\n\nThere's also one achievement that I think may be impossible in the game's current state.  The way a lot of people are achieving Wood Bridge Master is with a glitch.  I spent over an hour trying every design I could think of to no avail, but I never entered advanced construction mode either.  It may be possible, but I seriously doubt it.\n\nAs one reviewer noted, each simulation can yield different results.  If you get really close and don't want to redesign anything, you might be able to complete it by trying the simulation a few times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilppari78/recommended/232950/","kilppari78","Kilppari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilppari78/","224 products in account","First time I encountered a bridge building game was back in the time when Pontifex and later Bridge Construction Set came out. Messing with physics was intriguing even though the game stressed out my old hardware beyond its limits. Looong did I hope that a modern version of such game would appear and there Bridge Project hit the target. After all, it's the same developer. They've gone up with the size from 32 MB (Pontifex) to 511 MB (Bridge Project). New maps to play, more decent graphics, perhaps a bit more casual feel to it but still, the essense is there.\n\nThe basic interface is simple. Select the material to use, click on a joint and draw the piece where you want it to be. Simple mode helps you out quite a lot adding blocks, mirroring blocks and adding cross beams to support the structure. You can get far with it and be happy to see how the vehicles cross your newly built bridge.\n\nHowever, the most facinating part of the game is to scrap the simple mode and go expert. How far can you strip down the bridge and make it withstand the stress from the vehicles without it falling apart? To build a bridge with least number of elements, as light as possible, and with lowest budget is where you compete with yourself and globally with other players. The game has in-built global leaderboards where you can check out how well the best ones have done it.\n\nAnd this is where the interface gets in the way of the fun. You use the mouse to control pretty much everything (in addition to some keyboard shortcut keys). The left mouse button is for selecting and building, the middle button lets you dolly the camera, zoom works with mouse scroll, and the right button is for turning the camera and selecting the items for deletion.\n\nUnfortunately the last one simply doesn't seem to have any logic to it. The mouse pointer, humangous arrow, seems to be little off at all times. And despite of which item is highlighted on screen when mouse pointer is on it, the right click either selects another item or it simply turns the camera! Why?!? Why can't I select an item with LMB and then hit delete key from keyboard? That's how every other software works. No, here you need to find a specific spot of an item somewhere and then right click on it and select delete option. More often than not I was unable to find the correct spot and I ended up restarting the map instead. The cables seemed to be the worst. Using the separate select mode makes selection much easier and then even the delete key works. But why is it a separate mode? Fortunately space bar is the shortcut.\n\nThe game is fun and it'll keep me playing it trying to best myself over and over again. If you're into semi-realistic physics simulation and construction then you probably will like the game. However, if you're easily irritated by cloggy interface then I'd recommend testing the game before purchase.

There is no consistency in how materials behave, the interface is infuriating, and rather than being fun to play, I find it a tedious chore.\n\nMany levels have identical setups; however, a bridge that just worked on one behaves completely differently on the other. The first will have zero stress while at rest and easily handles the traffic while the second will have red on all joints and will fail the instant any traffic touches it. The game shows no reason for this change in behavior. It simply is the way things work.\n\nAs for the interface, it is very difficult to edit a bridge. This results in my rebuilding the bridge from scratch each time or just using undo until it removes the part I want removed and beginning again from that point. The reason for this is that I can right-click a piece to remove it, but it doesn't remove the entire section that was added, just a portion of it. If I place down two sections to brace the bridge, I need to right click and remove around 10 different segments to remove those two sections. There is the ability to draw a box around sections to highlight them and them remove them, but many times, the cursor will change to indicate that it is select mode yet will still add new sections, making it difficult to use that tool. Even when the select tool works, it removes too much as it will remove joint placement points for remaining sections, making them unusable.\n\nI tried to like this game, but the flaws show me that this is simply a "us too" bridge simulator and not one made to be a quality and enjoyable game.","July 24, 2015","false","198.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

It was originally $20, but was on a 66% sale. I decided that I'd get it. It might be an entertaining puzzle game. Long answer short: it wasn't.\n\nIt isn't very entertaining. I mean, I guess it is what it says it is, but there isn't enough to it. There should be more creativity and imagination involved. There really isn't any. I was hoping that I would be able to build these large fancy bridges, but you only make simple ones.\n\nThe look of this game is only okay. The graphics look quite dated. It's not terrible, but it certainly isn't good. I'm also disappointed that it wasn't more entertaining to watch your bridge break. Instead, the pieces just detach and fall. There's no breaking apart, splintering, cracking, or whatever. All things considered, rather boring.\n\n\nThe controls are not the greatest either. Placing pieces is not very smooth. It feels like I'm playing an old game. Also, deleting a single piece is a pain. You right-click the piece to bring up the options for that piece (including deleting it), but most of the time, that menu doesn't show up.\n\nMy final complaint is the sound. First of all, the soundtrack sucks. I turned it off soon after I started the game. As for the other in-game sound, it sounds like I'm playing a game that's 20 years old. I'm not a game designer, but I'm pretty sure it is not that hard to have higher quality sounds for a game like this (which essentially consist of bridge-breaking noises, car horns, and annoying cheering). That reminds me, why did you find it necessary to add that stupid cheering after a car makes it across the bridge? This isn't a pre-school computer program.\n\nAlso, where is this workshop that it mentions? That was one of the reasons I got this. So that was also a disappointment. People probably could've added some interesting things to this game, but whatever.\n\nSummary: This game is boring. There isn't enough creativity involved. The visuals are dated. The controls are not smooth enough when they work. The sound quality is awful. Overall, I would not even think about paying $20 for it. This game seems like it should be $5 dollars. The original price gave me a higher expectation, which it definitely did not come close to meeting.","August 7, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Counter-intuitive and just plain stupid. I can't single out anything in particular because there is not ONE THING this game does right in terms of control. Even just connecting two pieces together is frustrating at times.\n\nThe physics are beyond awful. They're not consistent and often nonsensical. I'd say half the time it works, the other half it's destroying itself. Honestly, if it wasn't so frustrating to control and build in this game I would give the physics a pass as barely sufficient enough, but as it stands it just piles it on.\n\nThe only difficulty that arises in this game is fighting the controls. The levels are boring, uninspired and too easy. The achievements also seem to glitch out. I was getting them too early at times and other times it took a while to register.\n\nThe graphics are dated but I suppose this is one of the better looking bridge building games  but it's also the worst to play so...yay?","March 1, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And the auto building which likes to put iron bars in the middle of the road for your vehicles to thrash.\n\nDon't forget the numerous bugs and crashes that also come with this game, for free! In two hours of play I crashed maybe 3 times.\n\nSo with this incredible bonanza how can I give it a negative rating? It's the music really.

The game, however, is extremely flawed. Some flaws are easy to ignore, others are not.\n\nThe interface is quite cumbersome. Having played the "Bridge It" demo a few days ago, I found this game's interface much worse than Bridge It's.\n\nThe worst part however, is the dynamics and physics. It is all wrong. I have a background in mechanical engineering, so this game has quite an appeal for me. This also makes me look at it with a more critic point of view, and my expectations are quite high in this kind of game.\n\nMy negative evaluation of this game comes exactly from the engineering parts of it. It is inexcusable for this game of game to not employ the proper structural calculations. Finite element analysis has come a long way, and it would be a great approach on a game like this.\n\nSo, my opinion is: if you want a game like this, go for "Bridge It": it has nicer graphics, a better and more intuitive interface, is faster and more precise calculations.\n","March 12, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you enjoy this type of game, you should know this one has great graphics but poor UI. To delete a simple part can be tricky and the undo button only goes back a few steps, not all the way to the start. This can be a problem in a big bridge with many parts. Still, the physics are good and there is an earthquake test and a few cute surprises. If only it was more user friendly. I have parts that are not explained ingame. How do I place it, how to use it, wheres the nasty walktrough ? There is also a nasty grid that does more harm than good. I struggle a bit playing it without getting into frustration. For those familiar with a flash game called Cargo Bridge from Armor Games, its alot easier and fun.

I got it on the Humble Bundle for only $1 with 3 other games. So for $1.00, this game is worth it (I spent about 6 hours playing until I completely beat all the levels and got all the achievements). The game has steam workshop so, even after you beat it, you can still play many user-made levels. However, I can't really recommend this game if it's more than $5-7, let alone the $19.99 it's retailing for right now. Controls are pretty wonky, some levels are frustrating, beating a level depended more on luck than skill,  and there is no point in playing through the main levels again after beating them. If you really want to play this game, I encourage you to wait and purchase it on sale.","April 24, 2014","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're up to some relaxing bridge building simulation puzzle, then I would recommend grabbing this game and play it casually or 'in one shot'. If played the latter way, it should take you no more than 2 days (possibly even less) to finish all the puzzles (there are 48 of them in total).\n\nAmongst the downsides is the glitchinness of physics, which causes two runs of the same build to be slightly different, therefore making some bridge configurations unreliable.\n\nIf you like getting achievements in games, this game also has them, although if you strive for getting 100%, there is one achievement which is very hard (even impossible) to get due to the aforementioned glitchinness of physics. At the moment of this writing though, it could be obtained fairly easily by exploiting one of the other glitches in the game.\n\nOverall, despite all negative details outlined above, I would recommend this game, just not at the current price of $20. My personal price for this game would be $5-7, so if you ever see it on sale at that price, get it and play it. Have fun!","March 6, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can build a symmetrical bridge, and when there are no cars on it, the stress is magically not distributed the same way on both sides as you would expect with a symmetric structure. This leads to frustrating collapses in later levels where materials are purposefully limited to make the game harder. Materials don't behave as you would expect them to. Everything is perfectly rigid. There is no soft body physics. The music sounds like it was pulled from a royalty free website and much of it does not fit in with the game and its environments. In order to get a reasonable frame rate, I have to run the game on the medium graphics setting at one fourth the resolution of my display. I don't have a gaming computer, but it is only one year old, so for a simulator game with no particle effects, and a low polygon count, and textures that are already low resolution to begin with, such poor quality is unnaceptable, especially for a game that costs $20.

Private showings of God of War III, Heavy Rain, Alan Wake. But at 4:00 on Thursday, I was wandering around the show floor, wondering what else I had to see. I saw a small little booth for “Bridge Project” in the Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment section. I mean, who goes to that booth? But I remember hearing about it on GAF, and so I decided to check it out.\n\nBest game of E3? Without a ♥♥♥♥ing doubt. Anyone who says otherwise did not play Bridge Project. Best game of all time? Jesus Christ, I don’t know, maybe. It’s a game that challenges your IMAGINATION. No other game has ever done that.\n\nSo listen to this story. I was in the early levels; I didn’t quite have an idea of how ridiculously in-depth the database was. I was summoning things like ladders, glasses of water, rayguns, what have you. But I reached a level with zombie robots, and the zombie robots kept killing me. Rayguns didn’t work, a torch didn’t work, a pickaxe didn’t work. In my frustration, I wrote in “Time Machine”. And one popped up. What the ♥♥♥♥? A smile dawned on my face. I hopped in, and the option was given to me to either travel to the past or the future. I chose past. When I hopped out, there were ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs walking around. I clicked one, and realized I could RIDE THEM. So I hopped on a ♥♥♥♥ing DINOSAUR, traveled back to the present, and stomped the ♥♥♥♥ out of robot zombies. Did you just read that sentence? Did you really? I ♥♥♥♥ING TRAVELED THROUGH TIME AND JUMPED ON A DINOSAUR AND USED IT TO KILL MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING ROBOT ZOMBIES. This game is unbelievable. Impossible. There’s nothing you can’t do.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.","March 27, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure its silly and challenging but its more annoying at how stupid frail the joints are it just simply ruins the entire game.\n\nAnother issue is the "undo" button only works for the last 3 things you did, so in other words useless when you have to go back more then that.  To make matters worse you cant right click / delete parts easily, always have to fight the UI to get it 'just right'.\n\nBy this time, I've seen other "bridge simulators" that I'd rather have one of those then this.

Don't buy this game, it's not worth anything and am amazed that Steam is even willing to publish a game like this.\n\nThe physics engine is pretty bad regardless of the fact that the whole point of this game is to be based around the physics of the bridge. The stress of the bridge is practically random and makes the game way too awkward to complete a simple task. The bridge sometimes decides to throw parts of the bridge away just by a car crossing it instead of showing any strain on the actual bridge or supports, making it impossible to know what part of the bridge needs improving.\n\nThe graphics are terrible and I highly doubt that the recommended PC specifications are completely correct. The shading works correctly but is done badly, the textures are bad, visual layout,ect. The visuals and overlay are terribly designed and makes windows XP scheme look good. You can even see the edges of the map you're designing on.\n\nAnother terrible aspect of the game is the audio. It's terribly done to the point it sounds like stock footage and has no variety what so ever, If I play this for more than a few minutes the audio begins to make me cringe.\n\nFinally, the setup of designing is over complicated and difficult to know where the tools are and throws additional tools onto your setup which you will never use or need and covers half of the screen space. The tools are awkward to use and is annoying to remove multiple parts of the bridge.\n\nThe concept of the game is a good idea, but it's already been done a ton of times with a lot more effort put into it and has been executed better with less awkward features including the ability to actually complete the game.\n\nI paid 1.50 on a third party site and yet I regret spending it, and somehow the creator thinks that they should sell it for £16? There are millions of games at a much cheaper price I would rather pay for than this with much better concpets, graphics, audio and general gameplay than this. If this was designed in 2003, there wouldn't be a problem, but this was released in 2013. You're 10 years late of a good game.","May 25, 2015","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some real nice challenges. The gameplay does take a bit of getting used to, you won't be the first one to accidently not connect a cable to a wall or to the actual bridge. But it's all in good fun, also a very nice and calm atmosphere. Even if your bridge crashes it is fun to watch (unless it is the 10th time, but thats the problem with bridge building games haha)","April 1, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loruxz25/recommended/232950/","Loruxz25","Cashew Chestnut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loruxz25/","74 products in account","The idea of building bridges and seeing how well they do under scrutiny is solid in concept, as proven by the myriad other bridge games on Steam. This one, however, is a complete dud. This game lacks any polish or depth whatsoever. Every asset in this game is completely stock, from the creaking of the bridges to the fake cheering played whenever you complete a hideously easy level. The physics are complete wank, and some of the building materials are weird to get the hang of. I attempted to use suspension cables on a bridge only to have it immediately collapse, at which point I just used regular old wood and beat the level just fine. Steer clear of this, even when it's on sale and especially at full price. Go instead for literally any other bridge game on the market.","April 28","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
