"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geredis175/recommended/442500/","geredis175","Aethle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geredis175/","713 products in account","I'll begin by saying...this game is rough. It's rough in many, many ways. It's not just a matter of difficulty, but also presentation, style, and a lot of aspects like that. It's a game that shows promise, but as it stands...is a very niche title. The game's premise is novel and far too rarely executed on. It's a game I wanted to like, and while I do enjoy it, it's a game that is lacking in some areas and needs a lot of improvement.\n\nHowever, I've found the game...is simple. The simulation aspects are there, the game is sutiably difficult, and the fights are bloody and exciting. Every fight can put your gladiator school to ruin. However, the game just doesn't (yet) have the depth that really lets you get into the nuances of the game. Variety feels rather lacking. There are only really 4 venues to fight - two in North Africa (Utica and Leptis Magna), and another two in Italy (Brundisium and, of ocurse, Rome itself). In each city things grow increasingly difficult as you go from city to city, climbing the ranks. The concept is great.\n\nThe management of the teams is simple. It's effective as you buy staff to train and heal and maintain your gladiators. The game lets you choose too how you treat your gladiators. Do you want to build a prison, or a high-quality training establishment? Or maybe something in the middle? Based on what upgrades you buy for your school, what ameneties you provide for your fighters, their skills be influenced rather heavily, though at great cost as maintianing such enhancements can become quite expensive. Thus your goal is to run the most effective school possible, but also a profitable one, and sometimes these things can be at odds, espeically given the rather sporadic nature of fight scheduling and their value (more on that near the end!)\n\nThe fights are suitably engaging, in a way, especially if you turn the combat text speed to 0.5 to really hype the suspense, or a more brisk but still intelligible 1.0 (by default it's at a blindingly fast 2.0), each fight can become quite tense, especialy if you're invested in your fighter. That said, the game feels very obtuse in terms of what a crowd's desires are. There's no indication until you're actualy committed to the fight what the crowd may be feeling - whcih is understandable, but you'd think that a city would have a certain 'flavor' or the crowd coudl be a little more predictable, at least over time. Instead, it seems that there's a straight up random chance (20% to start) that a gladiator will be spared at the end of a fight, which can only really be increased by investing perk points into them. More talk about those later.\n\nSadly, there isn't really many ways to invest in them. It's simply a matter of very hands-off training, increasing the facility ammenities, and giving your fighters weapons or armor. While armor feels like it's well-done, in that wearing armor is a trade-off of dexterity, stamina, agility... Weapons are lacking.  I just don't feel like weapons exist in a very engaging or interesting space. There are nominally over a half dozen weapon classes, but they merely exist to make you buy weapons as a gold sink, as there is no differentiation between them. A sica is no different than a gladius which is no different than a fascina (trident), or pugio, or any of the other weapons. And while any gladiator can use any weapon, there is a bonus to using particular weapons - and given that all weapons share the same damage ranges, have no speical characteristics, and generally cost the same...well, it feels like a missed opportunity mechanically speaking\n\nThe parks are a novel feature that I rather like; and the perks for the individual fighters feel well balanced. However, many of the Player Perks, designed to simulate, I believe the school's traditions, history, inclinations, over time, feel very unbalanced. There are a few (the Reputation Boost perk in particular) that feel outright broken! It states that it raises your reputation to the maximum simply by investing into it. That sort of bonus, naturally enough, just kind of kills any purpose for the mechanic. The same could be said of a lot of the other perks - such as being able to ignore fatigue, or retirement ages, essentially making your team into an emotionless juggernaught as you can choose to ignore morale penalties with certain perks. Things like that are wonderful boni, but they can seriously unbalance the game. That said, other perks, such as Opportunity Chance increases, starting level bonus, weapon bonuses of various types, gladiator health increases.  Things like that make a lot of sense and play into the whole notion of Ludus Traditions...the others just feel outright game-breaking and need to be reconsidered.\n\nIt would have been nice to fight across the whole Empire than merely North Africa and Italy. It could have also allowed for a degree of variety too in the fighting styles, or the sorts of fights you can manage, or increase the scouting possibilities, creating a regional fame system so that if your team fares poorly in one area you can move to somewhere else where your style is more interesting to the crowd - whether through the crowd's preferences of fighter style. It just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity to not be able to play with gladiator types, city preferences. Besides the obvious style choices, cities could have had meanignfully-sized arenas. Smaller venues would of course be less favorable to spear-wielders, for instance... Or massive arenas might be the only ones capable of putting on mass displays where you send your whole stable out to showcase an entire roster against an opposing school. Second, you always start in Utica, then advance, city by city, through Leptis Magna and then to Brundisium, and finally to Rome. It could have been more interesting if each city had a certain bonus or style or some other aspect to it, and then you chose where to start of the three other cities - and your goal was to 'conquer' all 3 of them, then move on to Rome. It's currently a linear path that I do wish had been a little more interesting.\n\nThere's also no way to arrange matches. A big part of being a Lanista, as I understand it, isn't JUST building your stable of fighters, training them, and keeping them in prime shape, but finding fighters to go against your men that will make for interesting battles.  It'd be nice if, instead of 'merely' choosing your fighters, and your chosen school, you could also 'suggest' in negotiations who you fight against. And based on relative skills, purse size, crowd attendance, venue, and other factors, the opposing Lanista will agree or disagree to the arrangement. ALso, not being able to fight non-arena fights, is kind of disappointing as well. While the schedule of fights goes primarily towards the main arena(s) in a city, it wasn't uncommon to have schools supplement their income by providing entertainment to dinner parties, funerals, and frankly - to not have this option can lead to massive gaps in the game where you sit there for days or weeks on end hitting 'next turn' until you find a fight that matches your needs.  And this isn't an issue that occurs only in the beginning when outmatched and seeking only less hyped fights. It happens also later on in the game too, when you find that it's simply not worth it to risk your less-skilled men in the less-hyped fights that occur.\n\nI'd also like to note that the developer is quite active and open-minded for suggestions in this game, and while the game is technically a full release, I see ample probability that there will be some major game enhancements, mechancis, patches, etc, that will make the game better over time. In full disclosure, I have talked with the developer relatively recently and have been in contact for modding purposes. Further, in the course of our discussions, he asked that I write a product review here - however, it has not affected in any way the content or my opinions on this game.","February 27","true","2.8"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","0"

Overcoming that early challenge feels very rewarding.  Don't be fooled though, this is a text and numbers management game.\n\nYour starting choice of perk is extremely strong, and makes the early game very enjoyable and challenging.  Once you get through the first couple cities though, I found that the game became a steamroll.  The occassional death of one of my gladiators did little to slow down the momentum that I had started to gain.  However, the Gladiator genre is very lacking, and Age of Gladiators is a welcome addition to it.\n\nPros:\nChallenging early game\nFun theme\nMany interesting mechanics\nAppeals to the business management type\n\nCons:\nEasy late game\nAlmost zero visuals\nLight content outside core mechanics\n\n\nMy winning strategy and tips (some a little spoilery):\n1. Buy a couple gladiators\n2. Don't pay them anything\n3. Run them into the ground for a few extra bucks.\n4. Invest your early perk points into increasing the starting level of new gladiators- new gladiators will be stronger than the survivors of your first batches and opponents pretty quick.\n5. Invest early gladiator perk points into being able to wear heavier amor- this will give them a clear advantage over the first few cities.\n6. When upgrading your school, turn it into a prison with guards, and continue to treat your gladiators like slaves and not pay them.- No matter how low their morale gets, as long as security is strong they won't escape and nothing bad will happen.\n7. Once you have a good system going, invest perk points into the +skill perk for gladiators you plan on keeping around, a decent mid game level 20 gladiator getting +5 extra points every level will be unstoppable by level 40 in the late game.\n8.  Once you have millions of bucks floating around, no reason not to get a full staff of trainers, medics, and blacksmiths.  Make sure your money machine is strong before investing heavily into staff though.\n9. A good perk to pick up once you really start rolling with some strong fighters is the one that removes gladiator fatigue, this way you can cycle through a smaller number of gladiators instead of trying to pay for a full stable, and train up some backups to step in when the occassional death happens.  This makes having 10+ gladiators irrelevant, as you will rarely need to use any but the first 5.  This was the final nail in the coffin in finishing the game once my deaths became very infrequent.\n\nVarious other tips-\n-The starting perk of showman is very strong if you are having trouble in the early game.\n-There is a perk that reduces wear and tear on weapons, 5 ranks removes wear altogether.  When a gladiator dies, you keep their weapon\n-There is another perk that increases the stats on new weapons in the shop, up to 50%\n-Blacksmiths increase the effectiveness of your weapons and armor.  Damage mitigation on plate can easily reach 65%+\n-Combining all of the equipment perks and keeping an eye on the shop you can give you a permanent upgrade even if you get into the habit of losing gladiators.\n-Most schools before Rome have only one or two strong fighters. it is possible to zerg rush past these gladiators since they still suffer from fatigue and injury the same way your fighters do.  Make sure that you have invested into getting fights more often.  When you do lose a strong gladiator to an opposing strong fighter, keep pouring it on, there is a good chance that the next time that fighter shows up he will be exhausted or wounded.\n-Intellegence and HP do not seem worth investing into, finding a smart recruit can be nice, but the level cap of 40 comes quickly in the late game and those are wasted points by max level.\n-Dexterity is a priority in my early recruits and points.  Misses are so common in the early game that just being able to land a hit is a huge advantage.\n-Once dexterity is decent, focusing on agility or reflexes is strong for being able to dodge yourself.\n-High strength becomes less necessary if you have focused on upgrading weapons and blacksmiths, but can be useful in the earlier game.\n-If you are planning on winning the game by being a cool dude, paying your gladiators, freeing them when they start to get a little sad, feeding them well, naming them after your loved ones, and trying to keep them all alive and happy... good luck, because that turns the game into a true challenge.","February 28","true","18.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

You don't get to control the battles and apart from some initial trouble starting up due to bad luck there is no challenge. While the concept is good the game is horribly unbalanced with some skills becoming useless.\nWinning the game is as easy as\n\n- Starting as showman for higher purses and more frequent fights\n- Buying lots of scouts for a good network (accuracy isn't that important)\n- Gambling on purchasing expensive gladiators with a high dexterity and good weapons for them available\n- Taking out a loan to help pay for everything\n- Upgrading the living conditions of the gladiators once you start making a profit\n- Repaying the loan\n- Increasing Intelligence to train much faster, dexterity to hit more often and Fast learner for more stat points\n- Getting armor skills and armor\n- Getting Blacksmiths with good armor improvement skills\n- Getting stamina up to around 80 and strength to around 60\n- Improve dodge or block to max  and then dumb the rest of your points into the other\n- Avoid the 10 point skills they are not worth it\n- Increase the critical hits of a character last grab whatever else you want first\n- Buy doctors to minimize down time from sickness or injuries which slows training\n- Make sure you keep at least 5 gladiators skilled enough to fight with others training to replace as needed\nYou now have an almost unkillable character able to take on max level opponents without much trouble. With a bit of luck this could be as early as the second area in the game.\n\nOnce you get past the initial area and understand the game mechanics it lacks depth. There needs to be a lot more events and other troubles rather than just paying the bills and waiting for the gladiators to recover. Gameplay becomes a grind too quickly rather than a challenge. There is a lot more that could be done like group battles, fleshing out the combat or having events that are more than just money it feels more like an early access game as it is rather than a complete $10 product.","March 5","false","13.9"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","31","45","3","0"

It is definitely a niche kind of game, but I really enjoy it.  It is easy to learn, but so many ways to play.  My first playthrough I didn't use any tips and ended up getting about halfway, but then just running out of money and fighters who could compete.  The second playthrough I won it all and ended up with 30+ million in the bank by using a few starting tips.  I will definietly go back and play again, and probably again after that - just trying different ways of getting places and adding to the realism each time.\n\nIt is a bit overwhelming at first because there isn't much of a tutorial, but jump in and know you're learning through the first time and then come back and play it for keeps.\n\nPros:\n- easy to learn\n- with the fighting you don't see anything but the play-by-play, but it can be pretty stressful and exciting!\n- Many, many ways to play, win, fail, learn\n- Can save often so you don't have to lose it all on one fight\n- Is addicting\n- Found myself actually attached to the fighters in my stable after a while, and losing them was a huge risk\n\nWhat's fine:\n- graphics, but it is more a dice roll type of experience\n- Interface is pretty standard, and gets the job done\n- price is good if you get into it\n\nCons:\n- no real tutorial, and the in-game (?) only explains the surface of things\n- the odds can sometimes make no sense when you look at the stats\n- does get a bit grindy towards the end in some cases\n- fighters in your stable can be moved around or hidden by a new page, meaning sometimes you have to hunt around\n\nAll in all I say go for it if you can get it on sale and find the concept interesting.  It isn't very historical, but you do get a lot of fun out of it and there are mail updates about actual historical events.

It's like a sports sim in which you, the owner, literally owns your team.\n\nGameplay is highly detailed and requires you to focus on several things at any given time. Nothing is static - fighters can become ill just before a big match that you were counting on them to win to keep you afloat financially, buildings need repairs, opportunities for trades and side quests arise, etc.\n\nHighly addictive, difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you will be driven to keep pushing your fighters through the map and all challengers. I personally found that, if you're lucky enough to get a star gladiator and train him well, managing loans and finances will be more difficult than winning fights (stars aren't cheap).

It will push you into studying your opponents, evaluating risk and reward before every fight. You can keep track of your opponent's gladiators, when they might be injured, fatigued, how they improve. It will let you decide when you send a weaker fighter into the battle, to grow him, or to weaken your opponents to give your superstar more chances to win in his next battle (you can also bet against your own fighter, if you decided to sacrifice him...but if he somehow survives, he won't be very happy about it!).\nAlso, try different gladiator builds, there can be a use for most of them.

It should be noted that rather than a negative, it should be seen as a positive. I want to let the developer know (since I know he reads these reviews) that I appreciate his hard work in trying to solve any existing bugs. his recent response to my original review, which was in fact negative and his helpful attitude go a long way. Recent posts also show that he is interested in using ideas from players on furthering the game.\n\nAs for the game itself, this is very much a manager game. You are the boss, not the actual gladiator. It would be cool if you had the choice of fighing, similar to a chivarly engine, but this is not that game. It is fun, but I would say that once you have figured out the initial learning curve and mistakes, the replay value is a bit lower. Only time will tell as the developer continues to work on the game. I look forward to seeing more from this developer. He has a fan!\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: 3.9 hours of playing and I have already crashed more times than I like to count.\n\nI want to give this game a BIG thumbs up. And I will if they fix the game breaking bugs.\n\nCurrently I am stuck in a game save that leaves the game crashing. If you play this game, at this point in time any time you trade away a gladiator, if you face him again as an opponent, the game will crash. In fact if you interact with any gladiator that you have traded away (get him back through trade or purchase) the game will crash. This unfortunately is a game breaking bug since transactions are a way to obtain some of the more powerful gladiators that would otherwise fleece you. I see the activity being posted by the developers about bugs and their future fixes, but don't see the fixes.\n\nI REALLY WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME, but can't in it's current state.\n\nEDIT: As of 6 pm PST on 2/28/16, the developer sent me a message asking for my save. Although I wasn't able to give it to him/her (i saved over it,) they are aware of the problem and trying to fix the bug that is my main gripe. This is a developer who cares and is working directly with the "little people."

It is unapologetically hardcore, and when it finally clicks, it is insanely addictive.\n\nGAMEPLAY:: Age of Gladiators puts you in control of a Gladiator stable and lets you manage them through their fighting career. First off, you create your character, choosing from a few character slides, you choose you're former profession whether it be former scout, gladiator, doctor, merchent or others. This gives you special bonuses, such as the ability to accurately scout a fighters real scores and abilities, or so your fighters never getting sick. Once you've chosen the economy you want (this games version of difficulty), you're thrown in the deep end.\nDon't let this get you down. You will fail, quickly and often. You will put fighters into competition, and learn through trial and error how to win them fights and make money and you will watch your favourite fighter, your best competitor fight and be executed by an unforgiving crowd, you will get frustrated. Actual fights, are text/turn based, you watch as each action is displayed infront of you and your fighters stats falls as he tires or gets hurt. Dispite how simple this looks, these fights are very engaging and suspenseful. Watching your fighter, begin to lose a winning battle, only at the end to hit a critical hit and win is as exciting as it is generally suspenseful, early on.\nThe forums, so far, have been a helpful tool. The developer has given handly tips on how to stave off bankrupcy, as well as the easiest way to learn the game.\n\nGRAPHICS:: This is a simple menu driven game. Dissapointingly, the game has no real animation, or even a real full screen. Simply put, it's not winning any awards  for art, but it gets the job done. Character pictures are well done, and the UI, while simple is adequate to what you need.\n\nSOUND:: The game's background music, is a long hum of wardrums and sets the mood perfectly for the game. Interface sounds, and even the fights themselves, are good. The sound of two men fighting is conveyed nicely, if not, albeit simply.\n\nOVERALL:: Age of Gladiators, is a game that looks simple, but soon becomes an intense cat and mouse game against you, the other bosses and bankrupcy. You won't like the game at first, and there is no tutorial. If you are into management style games in the vein of Football Manager, or are looking for a genuine challenge, pick this game up. The game is well put together, and the developer (one person) is open to feedback and responsive on the forums. If you have never played anything like this, I would suggest a lets play before picking it up.\n\n7/10","February 26","true","44.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

To advance your position as a Lunista you must have the business sense to know when to expand, the forsight to scout the right talent, and the tactical sense to risk the right gladiator int he right event.  This game simulates these mechanics in a simple, easy to play fashion, but it's deep enough that it kept me hooked.\n\n\nWhat I like:\n-Easy, straightforward management sim.\n-Options are in place to make the game tougher should you wish to.\n-No boring tutorials, everything you need to learn the game is in the game itself so you can just jump right in.  Learn when you need to at your own pace.\n-The portraits of the gladiators are well drawn and look really cool.   It would be nice if there was more of them and the weapon specialties matched up with the weapons the gladiators are holding in the portraits, but for $10 those are relatively minor criticisms to an overall cool feature of having this awesome artwork.\n-Economy is light.  Many would see this as a negative but it's pretty simple plus/minus type stuff you have to worry about.  Knowing when to expand is basically having the common sense to look at your costs versus what you stand to make per fight.\n-Risk/Reward gameplay is always fun.  You can put your best gladiator up for the biggest shows, but he might die... so...\n\nWhat I dont like\n-Endless clicking, but it comes with the genre\n\nI bought this game over the weekend and I had a blast with it.  I probably won't play it forever but I do like text based management sims.  And I've played games in this genre for $30 or more that aren't this polished and aren't this addictive.  My play time is a little inflated becuse this is the kind of game I keep up and walk away from for a few hours.   Or I'll have it open while I'm watching a game on TV so I'll play for a few minutes, look away for awhile, come aback to it 20 minutes later, etc.  It's not really the type of game I sit down and stare at for 10 hours at a time.  Though it's addictive enough that I could see how one might.  I did notice that the game is actually more difficult in the beginning than it is in the later phases of the game.  But that's how management games work.  You struggle to build something great, and if you do it well, you'll have a much easier time down the road.  I can't really say that's a gameplay flaw when thats how these games are supposed to be.  The artwork is limited but... it's a text based game.   Having any artwork at all is a huge plus and the artwork here is definitely nice to look at.\n\nThis game is pretty clever.  I like it a lot.  And the developer is very involved with the community.  It's easily worth $10.  If you like these type of games you should definitely support this one.  If you can pick it up for less it should be considered stealing.","March 2","true","81.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You wont see great graphics but it is fun.  Someone commented that there is limited skills and I disagree.  I find it is the exact opposite.  I prefer to keep a small professional group of gladiators instead of a large group of rabble.  In my group I have one who focuses on strength..another totally on defense.  My best gladiator has under 300 hit points which is very low....he focuses strickly on critical attacks....another focuses on dodging and has the highest stats of all my gladiators...she's also a woman and one mean B****.\n\nThere are little story lines and quests that sometimes pop up to break the game up.  If you want the game to be more difficult there are two options which really make it much harder...one is iron man mode which is the game saves after every fight....did you accidently lose your best gladiator to a tiger?  In Iron man mode he/she is gone.  Also you can let the gods pick what skills your fighters take randomly which is what I will do on my next play through...this will not allow me to specialize as much.\n\nTLDR:  Fun game worth 10 bucks...I'll probalby get 20 to 30 hours of play out of this.","May 14","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started playing at 1pm and before I realized it, it was 8pm and I still needed to fix dinner. Time just evaporates as you play this game.\n\nIt took me a few "failed" savegames to discover that you definitely need to manage your money tightly, and that you want to plan ahead for the Massive Hype fights by knowing what your opponent is likely to send against you and prepare accordingly. The stats of the gladiators have interesting dynamics and definitely allow a "weaker" gladiator to win a fight they are not "supposed" to, when you have everything else setup correctly. It's very satisfying to win a fight that has the betting odds stacked 1:4 against you :-D\n\nThe only thing I can field as a criticism is that you can "lose" due to circumstances that feel out of your control, such as not enough fights being scheduled to stay afloat. That said, just make sure you have a "runway" of 2-3 months to balance against this.\n\nI had so much fun playing this game, I made a video that shows about the first hour of gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4mFHBqVCtQ\n","February 28","true","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I hear you ask. Well honestly because I don't want to discourage people from investing in this game. With a few updates and patches here and there it could be good, my first impression is they've made the game they wanted and not had a chance to really get much outside input from the people who are actually playing it, if they choose to follow that input we could have a great game here (and if they don't I'll be changing this review to not recommended).\n\nAt the moment you'll get a few hours of fun from it as you progress through the bosses and cities, recruiting new gladiators and working their way up to becoming champions.\n\nWhat it's missing is a more open-ended game, my biggest gripe is how every fight your gladiators will take kills one of the opponents gladiators, he doesn't seem to replenish these and the aim is to kill off all of his gladiators and move onto the next boss killing his gladiators - as the game progresses these get tougher and toughter. It's fun but it's not what I want, I want a more realistic gladiator experience where the combatants involved aren't constantly becoming more and more tough, occasionally I want a great to come along and he'll reign at the top for a while until he's finally defeated but I don't want the champions to constantly be more and more and more challenging as we go. It feels like an RPG where I'm trying to "beat the game" more than a simulator.\n\nWhile you might expect the combat in a gladiator game to be a massively important thing it's actually just a series of "miss" or "damage dealt" flying across the screen.  I don't really mind it as I tend to use my imagination but it would be nice to have some descriptive text here instead so we can visualise what our gladiators are actually doing. While we're talking about combat it does seem to need tweaking but the games very new and I've read that balance issues will be sorted in the next patch.\n\nTL DR\nA nice little game but needs some updates and patches to become great.","February 27","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I realized you could change the gladiators names, and clicked on the name. Then I clicked 'next' to move to the next gladiator. The name field was still active, so it set that gladiators name to the one I had originally selected. With a few clicks all my gladiators had the same name. Seems like a (minor) bug to me. Having the name field selected and going to the next gladiator shouldn't change their name.\n\nWhen looking at new equipment it'd be nice to have a comparison to current equipment.

Still, that is to be expected somewhat in early access, but what is more troubling is that it seems to be following the EA SimCity model of requiring an always-on internet connection. Losing internet while playing currently results in the game closing itself, and it won't launch unless you are online in Steam. Hopefully this is an oversight and not a deliberate "unadvertised feature."\n\nUPDATE: It seems this is a bug. The team seems very good at providing updates & bugfixes so that'll likely be resolved soon.\n\nOutside of that the game has a certain charm, but is a little shallow at this point. The combat has no player input whatsoever, which turns all "fights" into long, drawn-out dice rolling contests. There is no customisation of gladiators aesthetically or reason to get personally invested in them ala troops in XCOM, which also detracts from the game somewhat.\n\nThe game as it exists currently is an interesting starting point, but it's not a polished product and it becomes somewhat repetitive. The developer has been frequently updating the game, however, and I feel comfortable in changing my previous review to a recommendation based on that.","March 1","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Was very fun, took a couple of failed run throughs early on to get the hang of it.  Here are some things I would like to see in game, as well as helpful tips that I would say may help you in your playthrough (no spoilers)\n\n- As others have stated, you only fight against other humans.  Having some special event where you can fight a lion or something to make it historically accurate would be good.  Stil very fun.\n- It can be frustrating trying to find the perfect 'prodigy' type of person that will just clean house after awhile...but when it does it's the best feeling ever.  With that said, age plays 0 factor, or at least it did nothing for me.\n- If you are starting out, if you are having isues with your Stables morale just make sure the guard and prison 'upgrades' are not selected, as this lowers morale directly.\n- If you are like me and like having an entire army of gladiators of level 40 at the end, it'll be good to invest your future fighters to have at least 40+ intelligence (I would not recommend leveling this up with some of your points, though).\n- Also, once you have 3-4 good fighters for your new fighters I would immediately upgrade the amount of skill points they get.  You'll thank yourself once you are in Rome and you have monster stats.\n- Save often.  And also worth noting there is only 1 save game on file.\n\nHope this helps you, definitely worth a play through if you like simulation management games as this one is very unique.","February 29","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was easy to learn, every screen is either self explanatory or has handy tool tips. The art and graphics provide impressive immersion to the atmosphere. You can watch the fights or skip them if you choose. Thumbs up to the developer for letting the player choose. You build your fighters, train, feed, cloth (barely), and sometimes put them to death.\n\nWhen I lost my first gladiator (not a recruit, I mean gladiator) it was like a punch in the gut.

(BUG) When switching from full screen from the first time, the screen can possibly go blank\n\n3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icewatercreek/recommended/442500/","icewatercreek","IcewaterCreekStudios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icewatercreek/","330 products in account",""Status;\n\n"IN PROGRESS"\n\nSo recently more art was added, and a few tweaks here and there, but still not what it can be.\n\nDone well, but too random in battle outcomes and needed more tweaking and testing to get it right because it seems there is no ryme or reason to outcomes but they are better.\nNot for bugs mind you, but for balance, which in fairness takes a lot of time to be done right and months of going back to the board.\n\nAs many people support the title, if you read there are redundant complaints that need fixing, so from a dev standpoint I will attempt to reflect on this as well.\n\n$9.99 is a good price for it, well done.\n\nGood music, nicely done.\n\nArtwork is decent, but redundant! They have added more, but still redundant for the large database file.\n\nFor the amount of Gladiators they have for the large csv, need more gladiator art variations. Also commented by many who reviewed with a thumb up. Spend some of the earned money on new artwork to keep the player interested. Seeing the same photo with so few is redundant at best and takes away from a beatiful gui.(gui is the pop up windows you use to execute a move in the game)\n\n\nConstructive Opinions;\nStarting off is way too hard. This opion has been worked better, but more tweaking needs to be done. The random rolls are not equating from a dev standpoint to reflect any chance to win at game start. I had in 15 fights for 15 losses so tired of playing now. Even one game had two weeks of training without a fight and had top trainer and great moral, but still cant past the lowest boss men, and there is a reason for this, ie my next reference.\n\nSince it seems to me you loose every match, go broke waiting to level and train, it seems even fighting level 2 boss, his men do not equate to a level 2 avg. For instance my Level 2 Avg boss had 5 level 3, 2 level 5 and 4 level 3. How that is an avg of level 2 gladiators for the lowest boss is beyond me. That is a 3 avg a worst to even level 4, which is the next boss you can choose to fight. They are as random in the csv (which I imgagine is HUGE) and with so many variables to random roll for, it now has become a severe balance issue. Also the prior stated artwork issue.\n\nForcing the player to get a loan to just loose constantly is not fun and then is broke. Not fun, even when an adult plays and manages every penny.\n\nRestarting the game because of its complete unpredictable nature, starting over and over, gets old as well. Are we entertained? Not yet.\n\nWe are all looking for a great gladiator game, so I supported them as many have because they have said the dev is active and thus far it shows.\n\n\nIn closing;\n\nI will recommend this game, since its one of the few options out there of this kind, and a lot of work was put in its development from a developer standpoint. I will never undermine anyones craft and hard work. So this Gladiator game has great potential with some more testing and some tweaking, artwork, to keep the start of the game more engaging.\n\nPlease dont quit working on it, because I will support anyone working hard, as long as they do not abandon their game and improve it. It seems you have and you won't, so you get our support.\n\nIn this state its playable, but really random and unbalanced because the csv is too big for the random rolls to start the game. % set for the player but not for the bosses?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direcction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

And it's more interesting because of that. It reminds me of Qvadriga.\n\nYou have to provide various levels of food, housing, weapons, armor, security and such for your stable. You hire staff (trainers, scouts, physickers, blacksmiths) and buy fighters, who you then have to train and equip with weapons they use. You also have to deal with your rivals, with random events, and all sorts of intrigue and competitive stuff. Fighters have many stats, which can be affected by training, fight experience, illness, morale, and likely other things I have not found yet.\n\nEach turn is one day of training or recovery for your fighters. Scouts turn in new reports a few times a month, and you can spend money to sponsor events, raising the chance of arranged fights for your guys (and gals) occurring (the dev is going to put female fighters in, I think). You can bet on either fighter in a match, and you can choose how much of your purse to share with your fighter. You can even free your fighters over time. And each day, you bleed money to maintain all your property and endeavors...\n\nFights are resolved textually, on a turn-based system. You can skip to the result; you have no influence on the fight beyond the skill of your coaches. It's still nerve-wracking.\n\nAnd it's fun!","March 2","true","0.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

At its core the concept is promissing, but it never really delivers on the main idea. The biggest source of disapointment, that for me would make all the tables and plain number crushing bearable, its the fact that the fights are never displayed, you dont see anyone fighting, its just text running endlessly saying "hit, miss, blocked, tired, hit, miss, attack, miss," and it goes on forever.\nIts a similar approach as games like FM in respect to the gladiator stats, the hiring, the facilities, it treats it like a sport but fails to capitalize on the drama that life and death offers in the arena. Too bad, the idea was good, but the game is unfinished and has a weak delivery of what it should be the climax moments of the game.","March 1","false","3.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

Once you figure out how to play, it's just no longer any fun to play. It's a shame. This could have been so much fun if some of the mechanics have been implemented with more depth. In my current playthrough, I just recruit high level gladiators due to the perks I put points on, wait for my high stat trainers to feed them with XP to get them to lv 40, and put them on fight events to rack up wins and kills. Also, leveling up gladiators are not rewarding and offers little to no choices. I got most of my gladiators exactly the same set of perks because why not? Giving gladiators different perks and skills are not interesting, because once the fight starts I have no say in whatever happens, and after some lines of texts the outcome shows who won and who's dead. I deleted the game after winning some hundred fights straight.\n\nI'm really disappointed . This game had a lot of potential.... But in the current state, it feels like a glorified web-based flash game... I hope the developers come up with ways to make the game more exciting... and since they are updating the game consistently, I am sure I'll play this game another day.","May 7","false","7.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The game cannot be run in full screen mode without turning into a black screen and needing to be restarted.\n\nThe interface is a little confusing until you get the hang of it. Once you start understanding the nuances, it becomes semi-fluid and easier to get things accomplished.\n\nMy biggest problem (aside from the constant graphical bugs) was getting paid. It didn't matter if I won a fight or a wager on a fight, my money would only go down. I would bet $15,000 on a fight, win the fight and the money would just disappear. I couldn't train, or afford my team anymore.\n\nI have no idea if my game was just bugged, but even when I started a new game it was the same. I would go to the fights, win, and go bankrupt. My team maintenance was only $500 but I was winning $10,000 purses! Still no money going into my pocket!\n\nHopefully they patch this a few more times because this seems like this could be a really fun game but as it stands, this is definitely not for me.","March 8","false","0.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It needs a lot of work. It's unbalanced right now, and usually the odds are arbitrarily stacked against you which makes it impossible to strategically play the game. You lose money daily which is okay. Fights are randomly scheduled in the course of a month. Some months randomly have a lot of fights but your opposition will be fighting their best fighters which means that you will lose certainly. So you have to start out fighting in the smaller fighters however those are randomly placed over the month, so you could go 16 days without fighting and lose 16k without anything you can do about it, only to finally fight in a match to win 11k  or even less. Then your fighter is fatigued and cant fight for a min of 7 to 11 days which is just absurd because you can only start out with something like 2 or 3 fighters. I really dont want to go all over the place saying all the flaws in the current system because I'd be bouncing all over the place. I guess it dont know where to start. So what I'm saying is this game needs works, a good amount of balancing, then it would be good.\n","February 28","false","8.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

All of the games interesting mechanics revolve around the fact that you are constantly forced to obtain money in order to sustain your Gladiator empire and the game is at its best during the establishing period where you have to wrangle your way to survival by killing off old Gladiators to steal their savings or betting against a sacrificial lamb you've sent to the slaughter.  But from there on out it's all down hill.  The more stuff you get the more meaningless everything becomes.  After a while I couldn't be bothered to even upgrade all of my Gladiators because it had become so tedious to do so.\n\nHow best to sum up the superficial nature of the game?\nAll Gladiators have an age.  And the game tells you if their age puts them as developing, in their prime or declining.\nGreat.  I'll buy some old guys to keep me afloat and some young guys to develop for the future.\nDon't bother.  It doesn't mean anything.  A complete play through of the game is not likely to cover more than 2 in game years.  And as far as I could tell the age had zero impact on the development of fighters.\nI signed a 17 year old to begin with and aged 18 with 39 fights under his belt he wanted to retire.  Meanwhile the 34 year old I signed was still there at 36 and had leveled up exactly the same without losing stats.  And there's not enough customisation of stats, fighting style and stratergy to really feel like you "own" any of the gladiators or that they have any degree of personality.\n\nThe grind is a problem too.  You fight all the time.  You have to in order to keep the money coming in.  Each turn is a day in game time so you're literally moving through the game at a snails pace, clicking into a fight every couple of days and hoping the random numbers come up in your favour.\n\nIf you like management finger crack, which I do, you'll enjoy this, which I did.  But I won't ever turn it on again.  So read into that what you will.","April 28","false","32.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I don't very much care for this game.\n\n1.  Fights take too long and they are just simulated.\n2.  Money is how you have to keep things going.  You can't earn enough to keep your stable going.\n3.  You don't know who you are going to fight and loses always end in death unless you waste develepment points to keep them alive.  You will need to be level 6 to have 100% to keep them alive.  With that they get nothing extra.  Just a chance to live.\n4.  Perks are silly and way over balanced.\n5.  You pay everyone each day.  EVERY ONE.  You own the fighters.  Why are you paying for them?  The staff is also paid every day which is expensive.\n\nThe games needs to be fixed.  I've tried many different ways to start playing.  Owning a very small amount of fighters lets you to have your money last longer but with a small amount of fighters they get hurt and can't fight.  You of course pay for EVERYONE and lose big money.\n\nI lasted a good amount of time by borrowing money and then betting it on one fight.  I paid back the loan and did very well in the first city.  Until I got to the last Boss.  He had an average of level 6 fighters.  At this time I had 5 fighters that cost a good amount.  They died one at a time to this last boss.  WIth not many fights, I watched my money go to nothing.  Then was left with only a few fighters at level 2.  Game over because I lost them shortly and was in the hole again.  You can't buy experinced fighters from the recruits and buying fighters from bosses is too expensive.\n\n$10 lost.
