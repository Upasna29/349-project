This game is right up my alley for style and I'd love to see a remake, but as it is it's old in all the wrong ways.  It's got a terribly clunky UI, the pacing is all over the place and at its heart it's basically a badly-obsolete old-school flight sim that takes for...ev...er to get anything done in.  (The tutorial mission involves doing two points of damage per laser shot against a capital ship with ~1200 or so shields; given that even skilled runs can take a full minute to pull off and you'll only get 5-10 shots per run, well, you do the math.)","May 4","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
