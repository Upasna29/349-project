The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.\nThe gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.\nThe unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.\nA couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.\nOverall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it.","December 6, 2013","true","15.0"," 69 of 86 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","69","86","0","0"

The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game.

I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.\n\nDo you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it.\n\nBefore you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything.\n\nThe graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game.","January 8, 2014","false","6.2"," 42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","42","59","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carasio/recommended/259510/","carasio","Carasio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carasio/","1243 products in account","Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.\n\nLong story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.\n\nSome people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a "Twi'lek" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).\n\nAlso the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p\n\n+ Cute design and characters\n+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content\n+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior\n\n+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy\n\n- The concept gets repetitive quickly\n- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)\n- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of variety\n\nAfter playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming.","July 4, 2014","true","24.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","4"

This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).\n\nIf you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale.","September 2, 2014","true","24.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

And what do you know, it works surprisingly well.\n\nWhat's there to tell about shufflepuck I hear you say ? Not much really. I think we all know how it works. But this game allows you to play it against aliens and by putting power-ups on the field to aid you or your opponent. Winnings allows you to level up which results in you gaining XP more often. There's also other stuff to collect and win like coins to buy biographies of characters or better pucks. You can also scratch tickets if you feel lucky and try to gain (more) XP and money that way. Completing certain challenges (i.e. buying 10 biographies) and mini-quests also reward you with XP and money.\n\nThere are many opponents to challenge, and several floors to unlock. The higher you go the more difficult your opponents will become. It actually becomes really challenging about halfway through. Wow.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that the money you earn after each successful game is just not enough. It literally takes hours before you're able to buy a puck or a set of biographies. That, and you'll be playing against the same opponents for tens of games. So it's also a variety issue really. Hopefully this gets fixed with a patch as I don't see a sequel appearing anytime soon (I mean, what more could they possibly add ?). Frustrating and it makes the game a little less fun to play.\n\nDespite those issues Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is still a fun and worthy addition to anyone's collection and I'd definitely recommend it.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","February 12, 2014","true","6.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","1"

It adds unexpected complexity and addictiveness to a rather menial game. The graphics are also super nice for an air hockey game. Especially the NPCs are really nicely designed and come with distinct personalities which makes them quite likeable. Unfortunately the sounds are too repetitive and they may get annoying.

You're basically playing shufflepuck over and over again against various opponents trying to save up enough cash to buy spaceship parts.  But each player is unique in the different special moves they do and the games are surprisingly challenging and faced paced as you make your way up in the world.\n\nThere are also "missions" that help you to earn a lot of coin so you don't have to play shufflepuck for years to beat the game.  Plus, you get to learn about all the strange characters.

In 2013.\n\nHow MUCH like the original?\nWell, I keep doing the thing where you'd smash the puck, only to have the baton or whatever it is called get in FRONT of the puck, and then I move backwards to reset - and smash the puck into my own goal.  That happened on the original, and it happens here.\nThe 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune.\nNow, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others.  Also I haven't seen my favorite, the character who'd get drunk gradually and then you'd beat the crap out of him because he was WASTED.  Oh wait, maybe he's on floor 2 - maybe he's the insect that is at the bar there.\nThe little guy with the eyes is named 'Furry' and he is essentially a cat.

I'm currently up to the second floor out of five, but you can unlock the new floors with their new opponents in any order(except for the fifth, which might require all of the others to be beaten by the looks of it).\n\nThis is the first video game adaptation I've played of air hockey, and it feels great.  Opponents can be challenging, but so far they haven't been unreasonably hard, with most of the difficulty variation coming from their specialty shots.  There are credits that you earn by playing and can be spent on biographys to give backstory on some of the other players, and also new paddles and pucks that have varying effects on the game.\n\nThe visuals are great, and the feel of being in that specific cantina that was obviously a large inspiration for the aesthetic here is very well developed.\n\nThe game is also only 65 MegaBytes, which is amazing for a game that looks like this, so no one should ever have to worry aobut download caps or hard disk space when buying this.\n\nEdit on difficulty: The higher levels do indeed get significantly harder, with oponents moving much faster and in a less predictable fashion, so there can be plenty of room for improvement.","February 20, 2014","true","9.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozftw/recommended/259510/","ozftw","Oz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozftw/","261 products in account","[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]\n\nThough not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.\n\nThe game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.\n\nEach of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.\n\nAs the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level.\n\nThe character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.\n\nAll-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer.\n\nI would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately.","December 8, 2013","true","22.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It can be very enjoyable and has a long life span. This life span, however, is allowed because of one critical feature.\n\nIt's all about the grind.\n\nOMG the grind man. If you are like me, and used to grinding, then this should not be a problem.\n\nI primarily have been playing this game for the cards so I can also unlock (the super insignificant chance of) booster pack drops. I have to admit, this is the first game that I have purchased and am seriously considering not playing to get all possible badges.\n\nI do not like air hockey THIS much.\n\nI've read reviews that this was originally an app game, and that makes sense because I've played other air hockey games for the touchscreen. That works REALLY well. I don't know if it's my mouse sensitivity (I play on 3200 DPI with +2 acceleration {whatever that means; it's REALLY sensitive}) or if I just really, really suck at this game, but the grinding for me is taking especially long. I don't know if I can do it.\n\nHere's a taste of what you have to go through:\n\nThere are multiple floors in the cantina, each with new, harder opponents than the previous floor. On the first floor, there is a small alien dude who keeps periodically saying: nonononono, and I want to stab him so badly because it is so annoying. There is a dancer alien girl who I haven't played yet, and there is a robot bartender. Cool.\n\nYou play the bartender, and let's say you win 4 points to 2 (it is first to 4 on the first floor at least) in Duel mode. You get around 100 or so currency points.\n\nA new puck costs 5000 points. A new mallet (the thing you hold) costs 5-15 thousand. Seriously. WTF.\n\nAlso, you can unlock biography codexes for each character, and after ALL the biographies of a character are unlocked, I'm guessing you unlock that character as a player(?). The tutorial explains that you will get their paddle and their unique skill. For example, the robo-bartender has a really annoying dodge shot skill where it will bank left or right and suddenly then go straight.\n\nDid I mention that there are 19 (NINETEEN!) biographies for the stupid robot?!\n\nOh and did I also mention that all of the biographies (except the 1st one, I believe) cost 500 points?\n\nThat's at least 9000 points. OMFG.\n\nIf you are proficient in this game, it should go by pretty fast, I guess. If you arent, like me, then you will hate this game.\n\nThere is also a gambling feature that I feel is seriously trolling me. You unlock these gamble tokens that you can use to reveal face down cards, and the bonuses are nice, however, if you reveal a skull, you lose everything you've revealed (including the tokens you spent). I swear I have gone 2 consecutive prizes ONCE, every other time, the skull is second to be revealed.\n\nI want to give this a recommendation, I really do. But I just can't, so this will be my first non-recommendation.","July 6, 2014","false","3.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","4"

Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.\n\nNow featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.\n\nThe Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.\n\nThis is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale. At £2 it's great value for money, but at the full £6.99 price i don't think i would be recommending as much.","March 10, 2014","true","14.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But despite that I found this game to be charming and easy to play. Basically you go around playing different people games to get parts to replace your ship that has crashed on some planet and you need to build a new one to get home. For a game as simple as air hockey the graphics are really nicely done. And the cast of players different with their own play styles and charm. You have to unlock parts of your opponents biography to progress through the game.  As you go up to nicer floors the competition also gets tougher to beat.\n\nThere's 3 game types duel, bet, and survival. And the missions each character will give you are missions of the survival variety. Although I genuinely enjoy playing this game it fails to give you a unique variation of missions / quests. In later missions it might change the puck you have to use but the developer could have had missions where you were forced to play with a mini mallet or puck, maybe some style of collect the most coins, just a missed opportunity to make the challenges more than "beat this player in survival mode for X amount of goals."\n\nThis is my go to game when I just want to play something casual. If you're an achievement hunter be warned that even though it's got plenty missions and goals and all that good stuff this game is a grind. Don't expect to get everything in 20 hours. Heck I've already spent well past 60 hrs and I'm only at some 75% completion. Multiplayer is also something that could have been a good addition to this game but perhaps in a future sequel the developer might consider it. If you see this game in a sale I'd recommend picking it up. It's something to do when you're not looking for something casual and pick up for a couple minutes at a time.","June 11, 2014","true","85.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The gameplay is simple and fluid. The graphics are nice and unobtrusive and working well with the atmosphere the developers tried to create: the game now takes place not in a Cafe but a Cantina on a desert planet - very reminiscent of a similar establishment in a certain wretched hive of scum and villainy. Even the music fits.\nThe game has recieved some sense of progression. The cantina has multiple floors and you need to earn credz to purchase access to them. The patrons you can challenge all have little quests (which basically require you to play even more shufflepuck), unlockable background information and eventually you can earn their special equipment and skills.\nIn a way recommending it is like recommending Pinball: can you see yourself playing the same thing over and over and over and having fun? If the answer is yes, then yes, the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended.","December 8, 2013","true","57.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Otherwise had zero issues as a Linux user.\n\nI love these kinds of games, and this one delivered:\n\nThe main thing here is the controls/gameplay are more fun than you would expect.  I mainly bought this game because of nostalgia from an old tablet game, but am already having a lot more fun than expected with a mouse.  There's enough variety in the gameplay that other similar games I've played seem a bit "flat" in comparison.\n\nThe second thing is how fast it gets you into the action.  There's a tutorial, but it's skippable.  The story stuff can barely bring down the pace, but does a great job of adding incentive to keep playing.  Ignoring all that, the game launches quickly and there's barely any clicks before you're quickly setting up a game.  It's a smooth and extremely well presented/executed process imo.\n\nThe personal nitpicks I have against are minor and rarely get in the way of playing.  It being a bit unclear of the "best" way to earn rewards.   If/how neutral power-ups impact the AI.  Stuff like I can't find a volume control (only music/sound on/off) and the default is probably loud because of that.  For the last one, I'm catching up on my own music collection in the background anyway, so adjusted that to the sound effects volume.\n\nOverall, Shufflepuck is a nice balance between getting you into the action and providing enough presentation/gameplay variety to keep you interested in one more match.  If you've enjoyed an Air Hockey type game before, digital or physical, this is worth picking up.","December 8, 2013","true","10.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It doesn't actually used any licensed IPs or real Star Wars names, but the inspiration is clear.\n\nAs air hockey itself is a rather simple game, this game livens it up with unlockable pucks and paddles that have different abilities, temporary buffs/debuffs, and skills unique to each opponent (different "power" shots that are harder to return).\n\nBeyond the first tier of opponents, the game feels like it gets considerably more challenging, but once you learn each opponent's "tell" that indicates where his serve or power shot will go, it gets more manageable. This is still a very fast paced game that noticeably benefits from Lightboosted 120Hz, as it makes determining the location and path of the puck easier. On iOS, this game was actually considered too difficult, and thus they added a "training" difficulty level to the Duel match mode. This mode is still available on the PC version for those having trouble.\n\nOverall a polished and challenging game, although a bit on the grindy / repetitive side (to actually finish the game would take quite a bit of time, several dozen hours probably), especially before you have the means/perks to win larger amounts of money to buy upgrades and unlocks.","February 7, 2014","true","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Learning the moves of your opponent is quickly done and than it's off to your own skill to defeat them. The learning curve is gentle and you're quick into the game. You have 19 different opponents to beat which scale up nicely.

Learn about somebody's uninteresting past?\n\nWell, some things you just have to purchase with credits.\n\nIf you loved Sufflepuck Cafe growing up as I did, then you'll probably like the Cantina version. The gameplay for me is fun and engaging, but the story is exceedingly tiresome. The designers descided to expand the game by injecting it with unnecessary hurdles to jump through in order to play the various competitors. The good part is you get access to 90% of the competition relatively quickly. The bad part is getting to that final 10%, it takes a while. A LONG while. The kind of while where you could easily finish two or three more reasonably paced titles in the meantime.\n\nSo, don't get this game if you don't like the original Shufflepuck or aren't really down with air hockey as a concept. That's all this is. It's got very smooth controls (I'm using a MacBook Trackpad, and it's buttery) and the physics is responsive and beautiful. The game looks great and the characters are fun... until they're not any more. The final boss isn't worth the wait.","February 2, 2014","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These inhabitants passed the time laying a modified version of air hockey known as shufflepuck. Shufflepuck Café it one of those games that remains iconic due to its quirky characters and the fact that there wasn’t anything else like it. Now a new version of the game has arrived a host of new and old faces to pit your wits against.\n\nThe plot is that you have crash landed on a planet and need to raise money to buy the parts to put your ship back together. You head towards the nearest building and inside discover a friendly robot, a musical homage to Mos Eisley and the game of Shufflepuck. The original game had you simply picking one of the café patrons to play against from the off but here things are a little bit more tiered.\n\nThe cantina is set out into a number of floors with a boss character at the very top. Each floor contains three people to play against and they all have their own traits, paddles, pucks and special moves. Your biggest barrier is money as it can be slow to accumulate and you need to pay large amounts to unlock new floors and equipment.\n\nTo break things up there are three ways of playing your opponent. You can undertake a simple one on one duel, bet on the match to try and increase your winnings or undertake the survival mode. In survival you are simply trying to score as many points without reply as possible in order to earn money multipliers. There are also missions of increasing difficulty to try and complete. Most these involve winning by a clear amount of points but it’s a good attempt at variety in a game where the premise is hitting a hockey puck up and down a table.\n\nThe modes may be similar but the characters you face are different enough to keep things fresh. Each has their own special moves which need to be learned and countered in order to have any success. Early specials consists of shots that snake up the table or curve but later on they are deviously fiendish to try and stop.\n\nAs you progress you can buy new pucks and paddles and win characters equipment by collecting all their back story pages. This then allows you to bring your own special shots to the table and gives you a fighting chance. Shufflepuck Cantina is fairly tough to begin with but once you get the hang of the speed and the way the paddles move it becomes much easier. The biggest problem is that saving up for anything takes a long time and you’ll probably be playing the same opponents multiple times in order to reach the total to go up a floor or buy a new paddle to give you a chance.\n\nThe game started life as an iOS title and we can see where the in app purchases would have been. There’s none of that here but a lowering of the money required to get things would have been welcome as there are a ton of things to buy and not that many opponents to play against in order to get them. It would have also been nice to ahve the original game somewhere in there but then you can't have everything.\n\nIssues with money aside, Shufflepuck Cantina is a loving homage to the original game. There’s a lot of attention to detail and the game plays well. Much like the original we would suggest it isn’t something you’re going to spend hour long sessions playing but it’s certainly great fun in small doses. It’s not the most complex game but what it does it does well and we’re glad to see someone taking a slightly obscure cult hit and creating something that actually deserves to be played. It should put a smile on old fans and people new to the series and it’s really much better than we could have hoped for.\n\nOverall 7/10\n","February 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are interesting and colorful, as is the setting.  Graphics wise it comes into its own while still appealing to the old aesthetics.\n\nIt is fun and challenging learning how to anticipate and overcome new opponents techniques.  First playing the opponents on the disco floor and being a bit overwhelmed, but managing to get up to speed with them and finally consistantly winning is pretty satisfying.\n\nHowever, being a gripey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I have a few relatively minor criticisms:\n\n-The missions get a bit monotonous, as does some of the character animations.  A few of the animations when you win a point over an opponent actually were making me a bit nauseous, as the camera jolted repetitively.\n\n-There are a few game-destroying bugs at the time of me writing this, like the shock-absorber puck you're forced to use with some missions will get stuck to the side of the table and move extremely slowly such that it will take over a minute for it to reach the opponent.\n\n-The ability of opponents to block the puck seems random at times, as some of your seemingly most skillful shots will be easily stopped, while some sluggish accidental returns will make it through.  The physics also seemed to be a bit off sometimes, as when the puck ricochets at a strange angle, but it's not enough to take away from the fun.","May 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a variety of opponents, each with a special move, and by dumping cash into them (to buy their biographies) you can use their special moves and even play as them against other opponents. It's very easy to unlock all the floors, however the quest to fully max out each character, complete all their quests, learn all the special strikes, level  yourself up and complete your spaceship is a little grindy... but honestly if you're not enjoying playing the game... why play the game? It's not as though it has massive depth or a particularly compelling storyline. There are three different game modes, first person to reach a score, a betting version that requires you to score a certain lead and survival where one point from your opponent knocks you out.

It’s a great looking and VERY faithful homage to the original, right down to the broken glass and the music in one of the areas. That said, I’m not so sure it could keep the interest of today’s gamers for long.\n\nThe game is basically just air hockey. They’ve added a silly stranded-on-an-alien-planet premise, to explain what you’re even doing there, because... you know... that matters!  In fact, the game gives FAR more to the player than I ever would have expected. There’s different game modes, different areas with different opponents presenting different challenges. There’s points and rankings, money, a slots game with prizes, dozens of different mallets and pucks to unlock, etc, etc.\n\nThere's even a back-story to unlock for each of the opponents you face, with their own little place in the sci-fi universe of Shufflepuck Cantina!\n\nI’m serious... There’s a Sci-Fi Universe... for an air hockey game!\n\nUltimately, you’re supposed to unlock all the character’s back-stories to get “parts” for your crashed spaceship. Once you’ve done that, you'll challenge the “end boss” who has the last part, presumably so you can finally leave this charming little Tatooine knockoff!\n\nTo be honest, even as nostalgic as I am, I doubt I’ll ever actually put in enough time to get that far. But you have to admire Agharta Studio for having put so much effort and imagination into such a simple game.

It looks quite good, there's a variety of opponents and it is enjoyable in short bursts.\n\nUnfortunately the game is entirely built around grinding. Want to play with new items and against new opponents? You'll have to play the same few early opponents on a seemingly endless loop.\n\nTo make things worse, they have the exact same animation and sound every time they win or lose a point. Given that to get anywhere you have to win numerous successive points, it means you have to face the same animation and sound over and over and over again.\n\nMindless repetition of gameplay elements is bad enough, but it becomes downright torturous with this lack of variety. It completely undermines any personality in the character design and makes progression downright aggravating.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many unlocks there are in the game; if getting them is so painful, they're going to go to waste.","April 18, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is very sharp looking and looks and sounds great. The colors are bright and fit the mood of the game. The  opponents look great and are animated very well. The dont move around the place but still they look great. The game is like air hockey with special moves and paddles. I do have a few nitpicks with the game. The object is to get parts from the opponents winning matches and once you have won a match you get money, with the money you can unlock parts of there biography. However the bios are on the spendy side so your gonna need to win a lot of matches to unlock all 15 bios for one opponent.\n\nThe trouble with this is kind of two fold. The game takes forever to unlock anything and it gets kind of boring  playing the first 3 opponents you meet for a solid hour or more. There are mini quests inside the game that break some of the monotony of the game. However I have only done one so far. My other nit pick is the size of the table its super small and cramped. I would love it if they opened up the table more on the sides so the table would not feel so cramped. I am recommending this game however its not perfect and may annoy some with the grind it offers.\n\nMy review out of 10 would be a 7. Not bad by any means however the grindyness and the cramped table is kind of a drag.","February 11, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As usual, to get out of it, be patient, wait for the bad AI to run out of stamina as it always does. Ekbar would have been a better/more logical last stage/missions boss since the emissary does have precognition in its background racial story to justify the "raging" phases during which you have to "limit the damage and keep it up" to see next survival round.\nAdd to that you are forced to use the worse mallet (glitchy)/puck(stucky) combination to make it perfect in every #stage 10 round, if that's not the proof someone ran out of ideas or time to make this decently harder, I don't know what it is.\nDefinitly, not worth the buy and annoying every bit quickly, but I'll go throuh it just because persistancy more than skills is all that it takes.","March 6, 2014","false","155.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I beat the final boss 25/0 and I can't even feel proud of it cuz (SPOILER) he is just using all the skills of the previously defeated opponents - even of the weakest opponents... (how boring, uncreative and unchallenging is that?!!).(SPOILER END) I know casual games are casual but hey: it doesn't mean players who play casual games are unskilled idiots. there are many challenging casual games like KINGDOM RUSH or PLANTS vs ZOMBIES , etc. that manage to chanllenge u whilst still being a casual game but this game is ALL GRIND NO CHALLENGE.\n\n4.) user interface design is poor and requires me to click a lot to get around....troublesome...\n\n\n>>> CONCLUSION:\nAll above mentioned problems can easily be fixed and the game still has gigantic potential. especially if u could enable multiplayer and multiplayer leagues it would be super fun. I hope the developers make some major changes to it otherwise it is dead in the water and just an unchallenging, brain-melting grindfest.\n\ncheers","July 12, 2014","false","15.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Its quick to get into and back out, you can exit the game from anywhere in it by pressing esc.

Alternatively, if you love frustration, this is the game for you!\n\nSeriously though, this game has a couple of interesting aspects, but their implementation is terrible. You can "embody" opponents, playing as them with special skills and weaknesses. However, these do not work for the quests, switching between bodies is tedious and their drawbacks can be significantly restricting.\n\nThe worst thing about the game is that it insists on you winning without your opponent scoring a single point. This is such a terrible, terrible design decision which only leads to frustration. This is exacerbated by the fact that starting a new duel requires you to press Escape and click four times. A simple "restart" function would have helped a lot.\n\nOn top of this, it feels so cheap. There is one short looping piece of music on each level. Opponents always repeat the same phrase if they lose. Music and sound can only be turned off, there isn't even a volume slider! And it is quite obvious they make you grind perfect wins and credits to pad the game, which only detracts from the experience.\n\nAvoid unless you are a masochist. 2/10","July 15, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Sounds weird, right? Well, it took the old Shufflepuck Cafe, and it has modernized it.\nWith fancy graphics, more opponents, upgrades, backstory for characters, concept art, ... you name it. It has a bunch of stuff! It's also an iOS port. A very poor one at that.\n\nI'll say right off the bat: I didn't dislike the general feeling of the game and gameplay itself. That was pretty good, for what it is. But... it's Pong. And it's a really bad port of Pong. I'll get on to why.\n\nThis was a free game on iOS, with a bunch of IAPs. The computer version has no IAPs, as one would imagine, since it costs 10€. That doesn't mean, however, that the grind is gone. Oh no, no no! If you want something on this game, you'll have to play the same opponent and mode over and over again.\nI liked the game when I started playing, but it quickly went downhill into a grindfest. That's really unfortunate... and lazy.\n\nGraphics look nice. It's not something spectacular, but, for what is is, it looks pretty good. And it delivers its objective, so that's a plus!\n\nThe music was also pretty cool. It invoked the feeling of the old Shufflepuck, and even Star Wars and Cowboy Bebop in conjunction with the visuals! That was pretty awesome. But the music gets old after a few hours, since you have a looping song per floor.\n\nThe old Shufflepuck Cafe didn't have much of a backstory told to the player. It was up to imagination. Shufflepuck Cantine Deluxe delivers that backstory for you in very (very) detailed Biographies for each opponent, that you can buy with hard earned in-game currency.\nThat sounds cool, but it's just text. One would have to interrupt the game for a while to read it all. So... It's a cool idea, but I don't like the way it was implemented. They could've voice-acted it after each mini-quest or so... Well, it's too much text that breaks the pacing... if it has any.\n\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay itself.\nYou all know Pong. In here, you can have different discs, each with different special powers to give it different tragectories (and so do you opponents), and you can have different Mallets, and upgrade them to get more in-game currency (credits).\nThis provides a little bit of variety, but it the end, they didn't take it very far, and their effects on the game are far lesser than they could have been.\n\nIn the game, you have 3 modes: Duel, in which the one to hit x number of points first, wins. Then you have Bets, in which you pay some money, and get more back if you win. Then you have Survival, in which you'll play until you suffer a hit.\nDuel gives you medals depending on how many point your suffer. Has you unlock those, for each character, you'll be given mini-quests, during which you'll just fighter other opponents with different mallets.\nIt gets very repetitive. VERY repetetitive.\n\nThen you have floors, with 3 different opponents in each one. These get progressively harder, but it's nothing too challenging. The problem is, apart from the different special powers, it's always the same game. You're always doing the exact same thing.\nAnd the way they've structured the game, was for you to play for about 20 hours (at least) before you're able to go to the final floor, after unlocking everything.\n\nUnless you're a really, really big fan of pong or the old Shufflepuck Cafe, there's no point. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, specially on a PC.\n\nWhy would one play this on a PC, really? And for so long, for that matter. I was going to finish it, but after 9 hours I was just sick of it. It brought nothing new to the table, no surprises, no challenge, no nothing!\n\nNow, about the Port. First off, they have 2 separate settings menus. Why the...? Why would you do that? Why not take everything to the same place? Ah well...\nIn regards to audio, there's only Music and SFX. On or Off. No sliders... When to developers learn?\nGraphics options are very, very poor as well, barely has anything.\nGameplay has essentially the mallet velocity and very few else.\n\nIt's just a very very lackluster port.\nAnd even worse, they kept the design as it was for mobile devices. That's ♥♥♥♥ing awful.\nIt's just a time waster, and it's very unfortunate.\n\nGameplay was genuinely good, if not repetitive. But... they've ruined everything by not caring about the overall experience and just following the trend to milk money off their consumers. And, if not money, then time.\nAnd not changing that when they made a PC port is just very lazy.\nThis was just a cash-in and it should in no way be on Steam.\n\nIf you like this type of game, go ahead and get it. But beware, its pacing and structure is as awful as it gets.\n\nFor anyone else... No, I would not recommend this at all. At least not until the game has been reworked for PC.","February 9, 2014","false","8.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

A bit surprisngly for me Oculus works really well with that kind of table games (btw, is it HD actually?). Very enjoyable.","June 22, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A rational question arising is the price/performance ratio. A way to answer this question is through a comparison with the original: Shufflepuck Café.\n\nDoing so, a lot of opposing pairs come into mind, for example what's new, what's missing:\nWhat about the game mechanics? You take your mouse and move it from left to right, forwards, backwards, that's nothing new, even the splitting glass when you hit some background is the same as before. The one thing that is new though are the special strikes, but you could claim that they lack of originality. Why is that? They are predictable. Well, Shufflepuck Cafe was predictable as well, to a certain extend, but it seems to be no abuse of notation to approve that Shufflepuck Cantina is even more predictable. For example, a "noise decision" is not present any longer as it was before with the magician lady in Shufflepuck Café. You could also claim that Biff was tuffer to beat than Lord Emell is at present. Against Biff, one could only score by switching corners quickly and through counter strikes using the energy he threw into the puck. Emell uses all special strikes of all enemies, and that's it, his defence is not hard to break, one could claim.\n\nFrom this point of view, one could question the philosophy of the game, the ultimate goal besides of earning a living. What's the challenge? In Shufflepuck Café, it was a challenge to sweep Biff, but the predictability of Shufflepuck Cantina leads to more conditional aspects. As a game with Biff was to win or loose 15 points, this element has been transfered to Shufflepuck Cantina in form of the Spaceship Parts Challenges. But there are other types of challenges in addition: Duels, bets and survival mode. But as the special strikes do not really differ from each other, so do these challenge modes. They are all somewhat based on the fact that a sweep is the best way of winning a game in terms of time and points.\n\nAnd the last mentioned is a crucial factor. Like many other games nowadays, the achivement bar tries to keep the player up with the game although he already could have gained the impression of having mastered it. Is it an achivement to do the same things over and over again? That's a philosophical question and shall not be answered right here and right now.\nBut it can, of course, be annoying after some time and this would depend on the individual, one could say.\n\nSo, there seems to be nothing new and you could easily call Shufflepuck Cantina a remake of Chufflepuck Café, but not as difficult as the original, but more costly in terms of time and money. This summing-up impression rises especially after considering the complexity of the elaboration of the additional features: They are all separated from each other, for example, you cannot combine special strikes and there is only one feature (as shields, double strikes, reduced mallets or pucks)  affecting the gameplay at a time. Combinations in this area would make the game more unpredictable and it would be more difficult to sweep an opponent and one could surely arrange the achivement bars with such a new difficulty level.\n\nTherefore, the only excuse left for such a lack of elaboration seems to be the development budget. Is it?\n\nSpeaking of the price/perforamnce ratio again, the graphics and musics aren't too bad, multiplayer is missing, it could appear to be too expensive after all (75% off would do). It also appears to be no game for someone looking for an effective challenge with more variations in comparision to the original.","June 19, 2015","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having to leave a dialogue and restart it before every mission is a drag.\n- It's very hard to see why multiplayer doesn't feature.\n\nAll in all, it's a good start though and I hope the team makes a sequel with the above problems ironed out at some point.","January 21","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
