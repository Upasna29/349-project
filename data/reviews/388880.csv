If not, Oxenfree might not be the game for you because, for the majority of the game, that is all you will be doing. If warning lights are currently flashing in your brain and the phrase “walking simulator” is on the tip of your tongue, hold on for just a moment and let me explain why this game is worth your time.\n\nYes, Oxenfree is a narrative driven experience in the same vein as any Telltale game and yes, the game has very few mechanics to speak of. However, rather than using “walking simulator” to describe this game, I believe the label “conversation simulator” would be a much more appropriate choice, as this is the area where Oxenfree truly shines and sets itself apart from the rest of its genre. On the surface, Oxenfree’s dialogue system is comparable to that of Mass Effect or similar titles; every time your character Alex speaks, you are presented with three dialogue choices that appear in different colored bubbles above her head. I say three options, but there is actually a fourth: to not say anything at all (you can actually play through the entire game without speaking). Unlike in other games that allow dialogue choice, however, Oxenfree’s dialogue operates in near-real time; Alex will speak exactly when you tell her to, interrupting or talking over other characters. This makes conversations flow naturally without unnatural pauses and provides that real life conversation pressure of not wanting to interrupt someone who’s talking but also wanting to get to get your 2 cents in before the conversation moves on.\n\nHowever, a good dialogue system alone does not a great conversation simulator make. What really sells Oxenfree’s dialogue is its flawless writing and voice acting. Unlike Life Is Strange, where teenage characters are speaking lines obviously written by adults trying to immitate a vernacular outside of their experience, Oxenfree’s teens sound wholly natural. Lines are delivered full of pauses, incomplete thoughts, “ums” and “ahs”, and the kind of grammatical errors caused by talking faster than your thoughts. Sometimes lines will also just slowly die off or end mid-thought. I’ve rarely seen dialgue written and delivered so realistically, especially for adolescent characters in a video game.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is well worth your time just the points I’ve listed so far. However, it would be unfair not to mention the rest of the game’s strengths! Firstly, its atmosphere. While Oxenfree may be marked as a horror game, I don’t think that label is appropriate here. While there may be one or two scenes that startle, Oxenfree’s soundtrack, visual design, and story combine to form an eerie supernatural thriller that is tense and head-scratching, rather than scary. And what a story it is! While it may start slow, using a clichéd horror trope of a group of teens spending a night in a remote location, the story quickly picks up and sucks you in. Characters are well rounded and detailed and the plot is paced well right up to its solid conclusion.\n\nIf I had any criticisms to level agains the game, most would be related to the way you move around Oxenfree’s island setting. Many areas of the game are proportioned to allow space for conversations to play out. However, there are many cases where you have to backtrack the way you came without the luxury of a conversation to keep your mind off of the characters’ glacial movement speed. I also encountered several conversation-related bugs that prevented me from progressing. Although your choices subtley influence the course of the game  (there are no “Telltale will remember that.” cues), Oxenfree plays out largely the same over multiple playthroughs, giving it a lower replay value. Due to this fact and its short, 3 hour runtime, you may rightly decide to invest your money elsewhere. However, if you’re looking for a tight, well-delivered narrative experience that you can finish in an afternoon, Oxenfree might be just what you’re looking for.","March 5","true","9.7"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","64","67","0","0"

After finishing the game (yes, it may not be an extremely long title but I also missed some collectibles), I would say that this is a strong start for Night School Studio.  It was hard to define this to that person when they asked if it was a puzzle game.  While there are certain situations that test your ability to remember or pay attention, there are actually no real puzzles in it.  Most of the time, you're walking through this dark and gloomy environment and conversing with the other kids.  The game is more narrative than anything else, but I feel that's where it shines.  Having to deal with the supernatural occurences on the island while working your charm to not have the other kids hate you really builds a great story and character progression.  Add in the wonderful music and the fantastic 2D environment with 3D characters that actually feel right, you're given a game that helps prove that 2016 is off to a wonderful start.\n\n\nThat being said, the game is not without it's flaws.  First off, there's no audio sliders in the options.  Not a big deal for me, but I know some would prefer quieter music to voice acting.  While the voice acting is pretty great, there are audio issues as to when your character decides to answer over someone else.  Sometimes you'd like to wait for the person to finish, but the choices you make in conversations don't neccesarily stay there for long, so your character just ends up interrupting sentences before they start or mid sentence.  I also feel I encountered a visual bug in that something chose to not disappear, but I'm still unsure if that was the case.  It just felt off during the scene because it was there and no one seemed to question why it was there.   Also, the traveling may turn some people off of it.  As I said prior, this game focuses on story moreso than action or game mechanics, so if conversations during your walk time isn't enough to peak your interest, you may find yourself not liking it.  So maybe with that one massive piece of information about how it plays, the $20 may be too steep for some, but I recommend this title to anyone else who actually would enjoy story more than crazy gameplay.  Beautiful art, outstanding music, terrifying moments, wonderful character building, well displayed teen drama...what more could you want from a game that is a "sit down in one sitting" type of title?  If this is what we can expect from Night School Studio, I can't wait to see what else they can pull off.","January 15","true","4.0"," 91 of 111 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","91","111","3","0"

The use of radio as a plot device as well as a gameplay mechanic leads for some extremely creepy moments and my fondest expierences of this game so far have been when you know you need to tune the radio and something scary will happen, but you just don't want to and you're left sitting there freaking out. Strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys character driven narrative and extremely creepy horror aspects.","February 14","true","4.2"," 48 of 48 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","48","48","2","2"

All of them. In their own teenage angsty way. Written well, voiced perfectly, and entirely believable. The depth of the characters go as far as you're willing to take it, and I appreciate that. Though, to get the full teenage experience, you have no idea what each character really thinks of Alex (the protagonist), but you can kind of figure it out. It would be nice if there was a 'friendship stats' bar. I was very surprised to see a certain character basically break off being friends with me in the final leg of the game. We hugged it out though.\n\nPlot (C):\nIf you read the plot, I would say the game takes about seven or eight hours to complete. It's your X-Files type of plot, and though not soundly explained, it's interesting enough. Some parts of the plot were optional, though names were coming up that I know were in some papers I picked up....but were not memorable at all. (I'm hoping options where I could answer with 'Bob the sailor' means I picked up a 'Bob the sailor' tidbit earlier in the game) When I replay, I will be looking at the characters rather than the plot, really. What annoyed me the most was in order to complete the mini objectives, I would have had to circle around the map again at a very slow place, with no extra dialogue at all. Just quiet music and retracing footsteps....no thanks for now.\n\nAtmosphere (B):\nVisually stunning. Interesting Music. Movement speed is a literal D-R-A-G.\nI would go on further about my likes and dislikes, but I'm not the best at critiquing these things with a keen eye.\nThe music was a bit repetitive, sometimes matching the mood, but let me feeling a bit empty.\nThe backgrounds and details were made with an amazing palette of matching colors that fit to the mood of the game. I'm only distressed that on this island, there were absolutely no animals except for a mysterious group of birds. A deer would have been nice to add to the forest ambiance, but when they said the island is deserted at, I guess the animals head back to the mainland too.\n\nExtra:\n-I enjoyed the radio system. I feel as if there's some secret station that places dubstep, but I have not found that yet and hope it exists. I'm sure there are easter eggs somewhere.\n-The way the epilogue was done was nice.\n\nOverall, the game is nice and worth the $20.","January 15","true","19.8"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","51","58","6","5"

Of course there were some things that could've been improved, but the characters were amazing, mainly in the sense that for once a game has actual realistic teenagers that aren't walking clichés.\n\nThe only really issues I had were that there was no way to see what the controls were, although this was only really an issue at the very start, but still I feel like it would've come in handy, and secondly, movement was a bit dodgy, both in the sense of the speed being very slow and also its a bit awkward when turning corners, although I eventually got over both of those problems.\n\nThe story was really good and I enjoyed the fact that there are multiple different endings and all that, although I wish you could see there was a way to rewind like in other choice based games instead of having to start over again.\n\nOverall I'd probably give the game a 9/10 due to it being a really good game, definitely would recommend it.

All the characters were believable in their intentions and way of speaking. The voice acting is top-notch, which only helps the immersion.\nI recommend finishing the game in one session for the maximum effect.\n\nNow, to the puzzles.\nYou solve different puzzles to save your friends after they've been possesed by some  ghost spirits 'living' on the island you're on. You do this using your handy pocket radio, which can also be used to tune into hidden frequencies such as a morse-code station, and your persuasive talking ability.  I really like this way of solving puzzles, the radio is a solid element in the game and speaking to other character is joyous. Again, the voice acting plays a large role in this.\nAll the puzzles that I encountered in my playthrough were fun to solve.\n\nYou can't quicksave before making a decision. Everything you can do is decide in the short timeframe given during dialogue. If you miss this chance, your character says nothing, which has an effect. (Huge props to nightschoolers for doing this)\nWhile I did miss a decision I wanted to make because of this way of speaking, it worked perfectly every other time.\n\nThe supernatural elements in this game are very well done and can mess with your head some of the time, like they should. I actually almost broke my mouse when I got scared because I actually jumped in my chair. The only game to ever have done this is an indie game, isn't that funny?\n\nI actually cried during the ending, which surprises me even today considering im a heartless monster in every other occasion.\n\nTL;DR This game is amazing and you should definitely get it. Even if you hate teenagers, you'll like the characters in this game. Well, except one, but that one's intentional.","February 16","true","12.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","30","32","3","1"

What really elevates Oxenfree is how the conversation system isn't the usual stilted dialogue menu: you talk, they talk, you talk, they talk, rinse, repeat.

Whether it will be your cup of tea or not, it’s an experience worth experiencing, and it is a rich experience. The narrative is as much a coming of age story as a supernatural thriller.\n\nI am NOT a fan of Teenage drama, but the characters felt diverse and their actions believable given the circumstance they are put into that I was fully immersed. I know some people have criticised the stoic or jilted dialogue but I think they might have forgotten how teenagers talk, and how awkward they sound, however that stays true to their age as they are still discovering their voice, and much of their speech is emulated from what they emulate from the media, or what is expected of them from their peers, including clichés.\n\nAnother concern by fellow players is the long time that it takes to traverse the map, I didn’t find this much of a problem. There is constant dialogue between the characters, and dialogue options, as you walk. While there are long stretches of silence if you walk off the beaten path, for example to search for collectibles, I felt that I was actually still in character, examining her thoughts and how she is coming to terms with what is happening, how a normal person would like taking long night strolls on the beach to contemplate on their life. The characters grow throughout this experience! I only wish my real life walks had as amazing a soundtrack to go along with.\n\nI finished the game with in my opinion the best ending possible and re watching the trailer of the game on the store page, I realise I did not see many of the events or dialogue portrayed and thus experience the different outcomes. As such, I can expect myself returning to this game in the future, although I admit I might find the long walks tedious then.\n\nSide note, as someone who suffers from motion sickness, I appreciate the side scrolling view of Oxenfree and wish more horror games with rich stories can move out of the first person medium, as Oxenfree proved that isn’t required for immersion. I know this is a personal thing, but I play games for the story, I’m not ashamed to say my difficulty in games is always set to Easy, and I appreciate the fact that Oxenfree allows me to just get along with the juicy plot without having to dodge necromorphs or rationing ammo while constantly worry about jumpscares. I don’t lie awake at night thinking of monsters, but I do from the thought of how small we are in the universe, what happens when we die etc. That is true Horror, me thinks.\n\nFinally, to those who complain that their $20 ($28AUD) should have bought them more game time etc (I finished the game in about 5 hours), I think you really have to think about the quality over the quantity here, this is a game that remains in my mind, the soundtrack of the game could be worth this much alone, or even the background illustration of each ‘level’. There are few things in life, much less games I pay for that my wallet doesn’t hurt after from a serious case of buyer’s remorse, but Oxenfree isn’t one of them. I think it’s priced just right as any higher would’ve scared me away from trying it , but now that I have, I would gladly pay more.\n","February 3","true","4.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","1"

Whilst (usually) not life-or-death decisions, your choice of who to support, who to challenge, and who to work with feel very honest and natural. This helps the game feel grounded and gives the characters a believability, which helps you invest in them as things start to fall apart around you.\n\nIf I could criticise anything about the game, I'd say it doesn't play it's cards close enough to it's chest, from just a few minutes into the game some strangely sci-fi things are happening and we learn a lot about what's wrong on the island fairly early on. To the game's credit, this didn't diminish my desire to continue hunting for even more clues, and the drama kept me hooked right until the games closing credits, but a little more mystery and build up early on would have been nice.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this game, and I'm eagerly looking forward to whatever Night School Studio turn their hand to next.

But something of it felt a bit off which stopped me from loving it unlike with Transistor for example. After playing Life is Strange loads of times too, I guess some games can't bring the same excitement or feels.\n\nOxenfree is a pretty awesome game with a neat artistic style of the backgrounds. I wasn't sure at first what to think of it when I started playing. But eventually it become really enjoyable.\nIt tells a nice story about Alex, who goes to an island with a group of friends. But you will find out that it's not just any normal trip as something strange happens which involves nasty ghosts. The game is rather small in size and you mostly move left or right.\n\nIt has a rich amount of dialogues between characters. The voice acting is really good and the characters speak quite fast sometimes, so there is a chance you might miss something they say. Oxenfree has a lot of choice making during conversations and the difference between this and for example Life is Strange, is that you don't have much time to think.\nYou have to make your choices rather quickly every time, which I didn't like so much. The island has an eerie/spooky feeling, which fits well with the setting. The music, well it's just great ^_^. Not the best I have heard, but it slightly reminds me of some 80's movie or tv-show and few of the songs really stood out. The game reminded me how creepy radios can be, just like with Silent Hill :P.\n\nThe story had some good moments imo, it tries to be different which is never a bad thing and ending of the game was great. I will not spoil anything though.\n\nHmm anyway, I recommend people to play this but with the current price it can feel expensive to some, as the game isn't very long. Unless you collect stuff etc. So it might be better to wait for a slight price drop. It took me about 6 hours to finish Oxenfree, but stats show more although I wasn't exactly playing all the time.

Its writing is also quality stuff and the voice acting really sells it both making for a likable cast that sound pretty natural. The flow of the dialogue is also unique because you have to make your choices on the fly and you can walk around while doing it. The core of the gameplay is your interactions with Alex’s friends and new step-brother while you explore the island using your radio to uncover the island’s past. My only real complaints are that sometimes the game doesn’t give you enough time to respond, like only a scant few seconds, also the ending twist doesn't really fit thematically well if you play a certain way and just feels like a cheap gotcha twist. Otherwise it’s really good and a must play for adventure game fans. I’m looking forward to whatever Night School makes next because this was quite the strong first game.","January 15","true","5.1"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","33","44","0","1"

Voice acting was GREAT! Loved the radio and how it got tied in during the game.\n\nExcellent story; very engaging. Collectibles are definitely a challenge.\n\nVarying endings are pretty cool as well. Can't fault it for choices and subtlety in story points and nice touches here and there.\n\nOnly complaint is that it's terribly slow to play, purely because of the walking places and Alex having a set gait most of the time. She can run, but it's still pretty slow getting around as the player cannot control that. I'd liked to have been able to take more shortcuts to get around etc. I appreicate that having that in added a lot of time to the game, and made it a little more "real" I suppose. However, it's a game, and I feel like I could appreciate it more without the slowness of moving around and along the set pathways. Particularly for collectibles; I could easily have spent an hour or two walking around to destinations to find things; even with a guide to see where the items are located!\n\n\nDespite this, would still definitely recommend for someone who wants something that's exciting in its own way, and doesn't mind a story -coversation driven game. Would definitely pick it up in a sale.","February 7","true","6.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","0"

It's an amazingly crafted adventure game with some of the best voice acting I've ever seen in a game like this. The fact that it's an indie game honestly surprises me. It's got some scary moments (I'm not done with the game, only about 3 hours into my first playthrough, and I intend at least one or two more), but mostly it's just beautifully scripted, and flows so well, that you can honestly get through the huge amount of really very satisfying dialogue while you're doing the exploring and stuff. I am slightly annoyed by the fact that dialogue doesn't carry from one area to the next, so if you want to hear all of a conversation you gotta stand around and wait just a little bit, but I honestly think it's worth it.\n\nTake it from someone who usually plays JRPGs, action RPGs, and dungeon crawlers on an almost religious basis, Oxenfree is an adventure game for basically anyone ever, especially if you like creepy ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso the radio tuning mechanic is cool as hell.","January 19","true","7.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Oxenfree is a minimalist game. An incredible walking simulator story-driven adventure full of emotion. You will want to discover its history, you will want to resolve its mistery. It's beatiful, it's sad, it's evocative. It has an amazing soundtrack, and a great art design. And probably the best conversation system I've seen in this type of game, intuitive, nice and simple.

This game reminds me a lot of Life is Strange, with supernatural elements to keep it fresh and different. A very strong debut title from Night School Studio and perhaps the first best game of 2016.\n\nPositive aspects of this game:\n\n+ Plot - to say anything would give away the main story. However, I found it realistic, engaging and I felt invested in my characters to survive.\n\n+ Characters - this is perhaps the strongest aspect of the game, and like plot, cannot really be spoken about without giving anything away. Each character has their own personality, their own flaws, and their own desires. The beginning of the story gives you an idea of what each character might be like, but as with any good narrative, there is more to each character than you might first believe.\n\nSimilarly built of that is the dialogue system - your dialogue options (similar to TellTale's dialogue system), is greatly influenced by each of your relationships with each of the different characters. I was very impressed with this, and had a lot of fun poking fun/insulting different characters ;)\n\n+ The Environments - I really enjoyed the different environments created, and the art aesthetic for each respectively. For instance, in the abandoned school it felt very creepy and sinister. And each environment feels very different from the last one (although continuous), keeping the feeling of immersion in this world.\n\n+ Voice Acting - I was not familar with voice actors listed on the steam product page, but it didn't matter because all voice acting is very strong. Ren is well voiced as the typical stoner, Clarissa as the evil girl, Nona as the shy, bookworm, Alex (you) as the main protagonist and Jonas as your unknown step-brother.\n\n+ Gameplay - fairly simple, most of the gameplay revolves around discovery of the supernatural elements on the island and your interactions with each character, utilizing the dialogue system as previously mentioned. I was very impressed as the game quizzes your ability to explore and understand the island around you, something that I think is missed in many games.\n\nSimilarly, throughout the game, you will constantly use a radio-tuning mechanic to solve puzzles. I felt this was appropriate to the context and enjoyed it a lot.\n\n+ Music - I had no problems with the background score. Never felt irritating during the 4.7 hours. I'll be honest, most of the time, I didn't notice it as I was too busy focused on the character dialogue.\n\nNegatives\n\n- At first when I loaded the game, I could barely play the game with incredibly poor framerates (for a 2D game!). This apparently is an issue for some graphics cards. The developer is apparently aware of this, and posted a solution, but I felt that this shouldn't have been an issue. I hope a future patch will fix this by the developer.\n\nMy score 9.5/10.","January 17","true","6.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Okay.\n\nSo even from last year when the game was announced, I was already hyped for it. And I'm happy to say that the final product did not disappoint. This game has such a unique and beautiful art style that I've never seen before, coupled with a minimalistic interface and absolutely SUPERB writing and voice acting. I loved the seamless flow of dialogue between the characters, I was very intrigued by the story and the horror elements. The ending to me at first felt a little...abrupt, but I was left quite thrilled at the plot twist which, even though I saw coming, was still pretty darn cool.\n\nMy only gripes were that there were still a few glitches in the game I noticed, where the characters that accompanied me got stuck in some places, which was slightly immersion-breaking. But it's totally understandable since the game literally just dropped. Another little nitpick is I wish there was a fast-travel system for the island, especially in the later stages. Since I'm a completionist, I wanted to explore and find the collectibles, but it was a bit tedious having to manually go everywhere. A fast travel system from point to point would have been handy.\n\nIf you're a fan of story-driven, choice-based games like TellTale games or Life is Strange, then this game is without question meant for you. I really enjoyed it and will probably play through it several more times, just to see the different outcomes. And honestly, the story makes it make SENSE to play through the game more than once. If you've finished it, you'll understand why.\n\nUPDATE (June 2, 2016): There's now a New Game + mode available for this game, and I just finished it. Personally I found it to be a bit underwhelming, since the description promised a lot more than what the game gave, I thought. It had a very interesting new ending, and several new additions that kept me somewhat engaged, but for the most part there really wasn't THAT much added. If you're like me and have previously played at least 5-6 playthroughs of the game already, you'd spend most of it trying to seek out as much new content as possible, and I guess I was disappointed that there wasn't enough of it in my opinion. I was expecting some sort of big expansion or a ton more new dialogue options/scenarios. Still, it was something new.","January 15","true","27.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","1"

GO PLAY THE GAME.\nThis review contains no spoilers. But going in blind will lead to the most thorough enjoyment.\n\n\n\n\nOxenfree is a throwback to 80s teen horror flicks that starts out in a way that will have you raising a doubtful eyebrow.\n\n\nThe dialogue is this game's primary appeal, and it's what will immerse you the most. In fact I don't think there's another game out there like it. Nothing even comes close to how well it flows. It doesn't sound like everyone recorded their lines separately. There's no delayed interruptions, there's no lines that sound like they were delivered at gun point, or recorded by someone pulled off the street; and during conversations, you have to choose what to say quickly or your time will run out. Conversations carry on, with or without you. You can interrupt people, and they'll cut off in a way that seems real. You could spend the whole game without saying a thing (if you want to be perceived as creepier than anything that happens on the island). There exist games out there where certain characters have better voice acting, however as an entire package, it's exemplary. It has wonderful, realistically delivered and flowing lines and despite being made by a small indie team, big names like Bioware, Naughty Dog, CD Projekt and more recently Don't Nod should absolutely take note.\n\nThere is no gameplay besides walking, talking, and the game's primary mechanic, the radio. Alex (you) can use it to tune in to anomalies, a few easter eggs, radio stations (that shouldn't exist) and even manipulate the environment. While it isn't what most people would describe as a horror game, as I said above, it's a throwback to 80s light hearted horror that would star an all teen cast, and there are more than a few places where you will be spooked, or you'll be a teensy bit on edge.\n\nThe story starts out light. There are multiple endings, all of which surprised me. Even the CREDITS had somethings very unexpected. An amazing, simple touch that connects everybody that plays the game.\n\nThis is a game that will absolutely stick with me. And it's something I'll recommend to anyone that's a fan of story driven games, mystery, the paranormal, or anything that revolves heavily around the characters and less on the gameplay. If you liked Life is Strange, Firewatch, the Stanley Parable etc, you will like this game.","February 28","true","10.0"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","17","24","3","0"

There's also a lot of haunting music and glitchy effects which create a great creepy atmosphere.  I don't think I was scared much playing this game but I was definitely unsettled.  Enjoyably unsettled, if that's a thing.\n\nYou do make meaningful choices which eventually affect the ending.

As the game progresses you find out the darker secrets of the island, but you also build relationships with your friends, and depending on how you play and how you treat them will determine different things later on, including the various endings you can receive.\n\nHow is the gameplay? It's very good. There's a mechanic involving a radio and finding hidden radio stations that is good for those who like to know more about the mystery and also like collectables + achievements. It's all very simple and works very well.\n\nI also would like to praise the voice acting in this game. I was instantly reminded of Life is Strange, another favorite, with the dialogue and level of voice acting here. Everyone does a great job, and there's a LOT of talking, but I never was bored or thought the dialouge was corny; In fact, I wanted more of it. Major kudos to the studio and actors for pulling this off - it could have gone the other way, and never did.\n\nThe game also presents the player with various choices much like Telltale games, Until Dawn, or, again, Life is Strange. You get three choices, normally, and this will lead to various responses depending on what you said, and this also allows for a lot of replayability.\n\nThe game does, as the description says, revolve around ghosts and it is quite spooky and eerie in parts, specifically relating to the radio, but there's no gore or anything, just spooks and mystery.\n\nI got all the collectables and had a wonderful time. I don't normally spring for a full priced game, especially one I just heard of and is a new IP, but if you're on the fence, I'd say give it a go. If you liked any of the other games I mentioned, I think you'll like this game. It took me about 8 hours, but it's 8 hours of really good and fun content, and some $60 games have that much content, but isn't as good or deep.\n\nAs I said, I didn't hear of this game til recently, but I'm so glad I did, and I will be replaying it for sure, not just for the achievements, but the experience, the interaction of characters (which I ended up liking!) and just enjoying the game as a whole, and you should too!","January 20","true","9.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

The art style pops, the dialogue has a solid mix of believabilty and humour, and the narrative setting really works.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/z7xfla/recommended/388880/","z7xfla","z7xfla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/z7xfla/","191 products in account","Oxenfree is a dialogue-heavy adventure game about a group of teenagers who go on a trip to a mysterious island, only to have their night of drinking quickly turn into a thrilling story of the supernatural.  Much of the game is spent wandering around figuring out what to do next, while engaging in interactive conversations among the group of friends.  When it is the main character's turn to speak, you are presented with up to 3 dialogue options - and if you don't choose any before the speech bubbles fade away, the character will say nothing.  One of the game's biggest strengths is that many of these dialogue choices actually do have an impact on the game's story - they can affect anything from the characters' friendship levels to significant changes in the ending.  Although the ending comes rather abruptly, it is interesting to see the many different ways that it can vary, thus giving the game a fair amount of replay value.  Also adding to the game's replay value are hidden collectibles that explain more of the backstory.  That being said, it would have been convenient if the developers had added a running option - your character can only walk, which can add some monotony to finding these collectibles.  On the bright side, the considerable amount of dialogue between the characters will tend to break this monotony when following the main path.\n\nThe graphical style in this game consists of 3D character models on top of beautifully-drawn 2D backgrounds, all of which blend together smoothly.  However, I did notice some lag as I was walking through certain areas - and I have a powerful computer that can play far more demanding games than this without a problem.  Nonetheless, it is clear the developers poured tons of effort into polishing their game, and this can especially be seen in the voice acting.  You will feel as though you are listening to a real group of teenagers, and their reactions are very believable in any different situation they are placed in, no matter which dialogue options you choose.  The soundtrack, while not particularly memorable, fits the game's atmosphere very well.  The consensus review score for Oxenfree seems to be around 8/10, and I find this to be a fair rating.  $20 is a bit steep, though, so it's probably best to buy it on sale.","April 7","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That probably shouldnt be remarkable in itself given that there's an established genre of choice-based games, but it is. For that alone it deserves praise.\n\nJust the way in which its choices and branching storyline work is superior to most. Rather than railroading you from point to point where you're called upon to make big, sweeping, clearly telegraphed decisions (which are probably illusory), in Oxenfree far more of the player's input is taken into account. Unlike in Life is Strange or Telltale games where your conversations only really matter at specific points and everything else is filler, in Oxenfree your actions and words throughout build or deteoriate your relationship with other characters, and even have a knock on effect wherein something you've influenced another character to do will change another character's opinion of them - this shows that the game's world doesnt solely revolve around you, and it adds a real sense of life to the cast as a whole.\n\nI'll also say that while comparable supernatural game Life is Strange leans too heavily on its supernatural elements (to the detriment of its focus on what really matters, character development), Oxenfree never loses sight of the fact that its characters are its most important element, and that the extreme situation they're in serves primarily to draw out their personalities. As a result I became invested in them and stayed emotionally invested throughout.\n\nAs for its aesthetics, Life is Strange leaned heavily on it's lovely visuals and lighting to make up for a lack of genuine choice, but Oxenfree has both. Its music and painterly art-style are perfectly atmospheric - and in places genuinely beautiful - and its voice-acting is emotive and high quality. The radio you carry with you - which some reviewers have criticised for the weak puzzle mechanics relating to it - is a better tool for building atmosphere than gameplay. Throughout the game you can tune to various stations, and listen to them gradually become more distorted and bizzare as the night goes on.\n\nI do however have various complaints about the game. Firstly the game is heavily linear, and though its branching map appears at first glance to encourage taking different routes to objectives, and searching for collectibles, the fact that characters fall dead silent when you're not on the prescribed narrative route sucks the life from these activities. An inability to control walking speed also makes finding these collectibles in obscure corners of the map laborious. I can quite understand why they did that - having players dash through the map would break pacing - but at the same time having just a little more control over speed would have been nice.\n\nSecondly there's the fact that the conversation system is not perfect. Too often picking a dialogue choice will simply cut through whatever anyone else was saying, and while the system seems fairly intelligent in getting characters to pick interrupted subjects back up, you can never know whether or not there are things you missed entirely (at least not without reloading your save to the last checkpoint, but that would break immersion). In some instances Alex will wait until a natural point in the conversation to speak your choice herself - but you can never tell when. Given the fast and fluid nature of the game's conversation system, in which your dialogue option bubbles fade away quickly, I often found myself seeing just how long I could wait before having to press one so that I wouldnt miss out on any more of another character's dialogue. Once or twice I missed my chance to say anything at all.\n\nThirdly you have the length. Now I stretched it over multiple sessions because I like to savour these things, but it would have been very possible to complete the whole game in a single sitting. In about four hours. Now you could spin this as a positive, say that it didnt overstay its welcome, say that it was just the right length it needed to be and didnt contain filler - and perhaps given the technical difficulties of making a choice game it really couldnt have been any longer. These things grow exponentially more complicated the longer they go on and the more branches devs have to take into account. But nonetheless, the fact remains that time and familiarity are a considerable part of emotional connection to a character, and with more time the game could have explored its cast with greater depth and subtlety.\n\nMaybe these sound like heavy criticisms, but keeping in mind all the substantial positives I outlined at the beginning of this review, buy it. These complaints are nitpicks in comparison. Of course everything could be better, could be improved, but for what it is I strongly recommend Oxenfree to anyone who enjoys this style of game.\n\n\n\n","April 6","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There was some pretty noticable downsides to this game but ill get to that later. Also this is a spoiler free review.\nSo first, the positives.\nArtwork and aesthetic of this game was beautiful. It was very pleasing on the eye. The overall design of the game was great. So was soundtrack. The overall atmosphere of the game is great.\nThe gameplay and story was also interesting. It felt new, as the radio mechanic is something i havent seen before. And i love how you can choose the path of the story, and have so many dialouge options. Basically it was a good game.\nBUT the reason i wrote this review was because of the negitives.\nIll start off with the dialouge. Ill start off with saying, i hate inturrupting as well as being inturrupted. The dialouge in this game makes it so you either inturrupt the character speaking, or you wait until theyre done speaking (which will result in the dialouge options either almost faded away or just gone.) I found that really hard to get over. Another thing i found is if you are in the middle of an important dialouge sequence and you inspect something in the middle of it, you may become stuck. The dialouge doesnt go back to what they were saying before, so you basically need to replay the whole sequence.\nWhich brings me to another point: The save points.\nI really beleive there should be a save point instead of just waiting to finish the sequence. The points where the game saves are pretty far away which was a pretty big inconvenience.\nI also found the characters to be pretty unrealistic at times, as they would pick fights where fights shouldnt have been. And i think they could have approached that more realisticly, because i had a hard time beleiving that would ever happen in real life.\nBasically, theres a lot of cons. But i really liked the game. It has GREAT replay value as theres so many different routes you can take it. I think the pros outweigh the cons, and if it intrests you, go for it and buy it. its a great experience.\n\nTLDR; Game needs work, but that doesnt outweigh the fact that its a good game, and it doesnt mean you shouldnt buy it","February 12","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a horror game!\n- Story seems straightforward but actually has a lot of complexity and surprises involved. Reminiscent of an '80s horror film.\n- Short and easily played through in one sitting. This makes it easy to replay for alternate endings.\n\nCons:\n- Lots of typos in the letters, in the subtitles, and everywhere you look. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. If you're going to put so much effort into making the artwork beautiful, please bother to proofread the text as well. :(\n- A little expensive for the length of the game.\n- Movements are a little awkward. It's easy to get stuck on edges or cliffs and you're slow, which discourages exploration.\n- There are some lingering bugs. At one point the NPC following me got stuck at the top of a hill and wouldn't jump down. I was waiting at a point where he needed to join me before the page would transition. It soft locked the game and I had to alt+F4 to retry it. He got stuck after the reset too, so I had to take a different route through the world to bypass the issue entirely.","February 14","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Some sequences around this have really stuck in my head.\n+ Some unique mechanics that are really inventive and cool (the mirror thing, to those in the know).\n+It's completely gorgeous. Backgrounds and character design are so pretty and memorable.\n+While the choice aspect isn't outstanding, there are a few really clever options.\n\nNegatives:\n-To get all of the small points out of the way at once: the subtitles are often wrong (in small ways but it's noticeable and jarring), the narrow paths and slow walking speed can get annoying, the radio lock mechanic can be kind of a drag later on in the game, and the dialogue system has a unique look but in practice can be clunkier than something like Telltale's usual system.\n-Trying to avoid spoilers as much as possible, I found some of the later plot points very unsatisfying. There seemed to be some unnecessary cutting off of branching story paths, especially since this isn't the kind of game where the story gets continued in a sequel.\n-Character approval and its results can be confusing (I genuinely thought I was experiencing a glitch at one point), but this might be somewhat unique to my playthrough.\n-Characters' reactions to things can seem kind of muted, particularly later in the game. On the other hand, it can get really irritating in thriller/horror games to hear the characters generically freaking out throughout the whole thing, so it's understandable why the writers would want to avoid too much of this.\n\nThis could either be a positive or a negative depending on your perspective, but playing through once leaves some things unclear and unexplained.\n\nIt's better at atmosphere and dialogue than choice mechanics and branching paths in my opinion, so it might be best to go into it with that it mind. I still strongly recommend it though. There are moments from this story that I'll remember for a long time.","February 23","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/388880/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","Oxenfree is a quaint horror/thriller adventure driven by dialogue selection and tuning into radio frequencies.\n\nThe premise of the game is that you play as Alex, a girl who is on an island at night with some of her high school friends/acquaintences where they plan on just hanging out and getting drunk until some cave exploring goes wrong and unleashes a supernatural force upon them.\n\nOxenfree is definitely an odd one, it has similarities to other games in terms of the overall feel, but it really does stand out as rather unique. For this game to be succesful. the story would have to work as at it's heart, the game is story driven. The core game mechanic is actually your choice of dialogue. When other people are conversing, you get transient dialogue options, which you have a few selections to pick what you wish to say. You can also opt to remain silent, which in of itself can also be a game driving choice. Either way, the choices you make with regards to the dialogue influence the outcome of the game and how it progresses. I especially liked how you only have a limited amount of time to make your choice, as I feel this in of itself can drive your decision making. In most games, NPC's will just sorta wait around for as long as you like until you make your decision, but in Oxenfree there is a sense of urgency in saying what you want to say. So despite almost being visual novel-esque in game/story progression, there is some quick thinking to be done, and if you really want to catch all the dialogue you do need to be on the ball.\n\nI enjoyed the story, it was certainly different to any game I've played before. There's plenty of teen high school drama, which serves its purpose and the voice acting is very good. The cast of characters are well fleshed out, and I felt that there was enough done for me to care about the various characters and appreciate their motivations.  I definitely got some 'Life is Strange' vibes from the way the characters were written, which I'd say is a good thing. This really is integral to how the game plays out as the choices you make in game also affect the outcomes for the other characters.\n\nThe scenery artwork for Oxenfree is gorgeous. I love the watercolour style backdrops, the island is fun to explore. The atmosphere is great, for the various regions of the island. The sounds also help this. Ambience is used well to set the tone of the area you're in. Navigation relies on you walking around the island, and I guess it's laid out like a platformer so it looks 2D, but you can walk in 3 dimensions so I guess it's a visually 2D game with 3D function. Whatever it is, it works.\n\nAs a horror game - it's definintely not one of the scarier games I've played. It certainly uses elements of horror, but I'm not sure how far I'd define it as a full on horror game. It dabbles in sci-fi/the supernatural in it's own way, but I'm not sure I'd really call it a sci fi game either. I guess genre isn't too important here as it's all pretty fluid. I think it succeeds in building a sense of uneasiness in the key parts where it needs to. The use of lighting, music and sounds really helps this.\n\nIn terms of controls, I played this with an xbox one controller and it played perfectly (supports rumble function too, which is a nice touch for sure). It's not a game of precision, a controller is perhaps the most comfortable way to play this, though I'd imagine keyboard works fine too.\n\nOverall, the game is quite short (I finished it in under 5 hours) but I feel this is fine, particularly given the pacing of the game and how you drive it forward. I think for what it is, the length is fine and it does a lot with that time in order to tell a compelling story. I enjoyed the gameplay, was invested in the story and would be interested to see if the devs are putting out any similar titles any time soon. It didn't blow me away but it was a unique, enjoyable experience and I'd give this a solid recommendation.","February 28","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After exploring one of the island's caves, you and your friends stumble upon an anomaly that turns the night into a fight for survival. And that's really all I can say without ruining the plot and its various twists.\n\nThe story is compelling, and explores some very interesting themes. It's also a very human story; something I don't think can be praised enough. So many games that release nowadays always feature generic, cynical archetypes that are ultimately forgettable (think Harkin from Lords of the Fallen, or Aiden Pierce from Watch_Dogs). The characters in Oxenfree feel like real people, even if some of them might be completely insufferable...\n\nAside from a few extremely obnoxious characters, the dialogue is very well written. And you can tell the writers are aware of this because their characters never shut up. These people blather on so much, I thought the game glitched during a segment where the characters were silent for about 5 minutes. It can get really tiresome listening to these kids go on and on about every single thought that pops into their head, especially considering (as far as I could tell) there was no way to skip dialogue. Perhaps all of this would have been more tolerable if there were a skateboarding section... oh well.\n\n------Gameplay------\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Oxenfree is a point-and-click adventure game with multiple endings. However, there are several mechanics that keep the game from feeling too formulaic. Alex's radio can tune into various frequencies on the island, unlocking secrets, hidden anomalies, and even areas. It's also connected to the game's narrative.\n\nYou will also be given free rein of Edward's Island. Unlike most of its contemporaries, Oxenfree offers players a metroidvania-style world to explore as they see fit. This is both a positive and a negative, though, as Alex walks like she has nowhere to be. She also occasionally struggles to navigate the environments, which can be frustrating. This is obviously done intentionally to make sure you hear all of the characters' unimportant dialogue, but it feels excruciating to realize you've gone to the wrong area, only to have to crawl back to where you were supposed to go at a snail's pace. Thankfully, backtracking never feels like much of an issue, as the developers saw fit to keep previously explored areas interesting by adding to them upon returning.\n\nOne odd (likely intentional) choice from the developer was to severely limit the amount of time you have to pick your dialogue option. It didn't occur often enough that I felt it was interfering with how I wanted the narrative to unfold, but it was certainly noticeable. At certain points I was forced to randomly click something before I had time to read all the options available to me. This is usually done to create tension, but it can create frustration if not done correctly. I still can't help but feel all of these minor gripes could have been avoided if only there were more skateboarding sections.\n\n------Presentation------\n\nOxenfree is beautiful. From the very mellow soundtrack, to the wonderful hand-painted environments, this is s game that is pleasant to the senses. The voice work is also top-notch; all the actors and actresses do a phenomenal job.\n\nAside from that, I did notice a few glitches. As I mentioned earlier, Alex will occasionally struggle with the very narrow pathways of Edwards Island. I also experienced one glitch where a character wasn't performing an action needed to advance the game, forcing me to restart.\n\nStill, there were no crashes, and the game ran fine on my fairly standard PC. Could have used more skateboarding, though.\n\n------Arbitrary Score------\n\nOxenfree is a good game, though not one without its flaws. It's certainly worth the asking price of $19.99, and if you ever see the game on sale, be sure to jump on it.\n\n8/10","January 23","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","2","2","5","0"

My final video review is still in the works, but I don't want to delay this recommendation -- play Oxenfree. It is visually gorgeous, along with containing an absolutely fantastic sound scape of music and stellar sound design. It's writing is damn impressively well done and even puts some of Telltale's work to shame. The variety of choices, both big and small, is fantastic (even if there is a limit as far as different endings, due to the game's four hour length). Even the radio gameplay mechanic is surprisingly engaging.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the game's refusal to let you have manual control over your walking speed makes backtracking for collectibles a genuine chore. But those are really only there for three achievements and for some extra backstory, so it's not a huge loss if you ignore them or collect them all.\n\nWhile I will agree that $20 seems a bit much for a game that can be beaten in four hours, considering I am already planning to play through at least two more times, the cost evens out, and you can also elect to get the game on sale (I waited until it hit $15).\n\nOverall, it is a solid piece of work, and I look forward to what Night School has planned for their next title.

It's a walking simulator for the most part but unless you're drifting off the main path, you'll always have a conversation going that you can interact with by choosing dialogues want as you walk.\n\nThe first hour really hooked me and I honestly wasn't expecting it to have such an eerie and creepy (sometimes jumpscary) feel to it but damn, at times it really sent shivers down my spines. Though after that first hour it was more of just going through the game, interacting with objects, moving on the the next objective, etc. It felt super repetitive even though its never the same dialogue (to an extent). I have no idea how extensive the choices I make will impact the outcomes in the future until I play it for the second time. It definitely has 2 or 3 replayability, but only if you're willing to go through some of the same things again, I am but only after a couple of months. Overall, if you love games for its story and you love choose your own adventure games, this is an awesome catch!\n\nJust one more thing, I went through the whole game and really thought I was being cool with everyone and trying to be on their nice side but I literally got the worst outcome possible.

I liked the use of the radio (an ordinary object) throughout the game to interact with the island and the ghosts.","April 17","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This brand of horror game doesn't depend on jump scares and monsters, however, instead throwing you into the story of a short trip gone wrong, where a group of high-school age friends end up opening a time/dimensional rift by accident while exploring some anomalies on an island.\n\nThe storyline draws heavily from 80s horror movies, yet it feels fresh enough that you get engrossed by it while it manages to avoid some of the more common tropes of the genre, like trying to deliver scares just by killing characters off left and right. I'll admit that the game is short, yet it gave me one of the best graphical adventure experiences I've had in a while, delivering both laughs and intrigue throughout its whole duration.\n\nOh, it also has a few bugs that can get annoying, just so you know, and the save system isn't quite perfect since if you quit you'll be restarted at the beginning of your current "stage", which can mean having to hear dialogue several times since there's no way to skip it. It's annoying, but since the game is short I'm sure most people will finish it in just one or two days and it won't become a huge issue.","April 10","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/recommended/388880/","markofthedead","Markness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/","135 products in account","Oxen-free is a story-driven indie poltergeist-inspired teen-drama romp (wow that is a long way of describing it) game. This game is pretty good so far (now beaten), but please read further for a more detailed review!\n\nFirstly..\n\nControls: The controls for this 2D game with 3D models runs pretty smoothly. No complaints here, standard movement with the keys, just no mention of how to interact with things right at the begining. Easy criteria to get high points for me, but it is suprisingly easy to screw this one up! So for me: 2.0/2.5 for Controls.\n\nGraphics/Smoothness: Graphics are pretty good. Performance runs pretty smoothly and I have no problems at all running the game. No graphical lag at all while playing. Good art-style with the characters and interesting premise using this sort of art to create a teen story out of it. It looks pretty good for an indie game. But with this price tag that it has, you would expect so. For me this gets a 2.0/2.5 (to balance the score)\n\nGameplay/Bugs: The game itself is fun. It is very story-driven and makes you really think about your decisions. You must answer some questions quicker than others, and there is no sort of "kick in the butt" mechanic which tells you to answer quickly or slowly. So, you feel as if you need to answer quests as quickly as possible and what ends up happening is that you cut people off (and kind of ruins the immersion of this story-rich game when you are constantly cutting people off), other than that, no complaints and I do not see any complaints on the forums as of yet for bugs. So for me this criteria gets a 2.0/2.5.\n\nThe question now is whether or not it is worth 20 bucks which brings us on to the next point..\n\nValue: The game itself is 20 bucks. So with my 1$/Hr value calculations I would need to get 20 hours of gameplay from this game. I believe that I will maybe get half of that, but it really is still in the air. (Unless they add free DLC or something... hah....) okay, enough jokes. But the value itself I do not believe is there for this game. Don't get me wrong, it is an awesome game, but the value is just not there unless you are really interested in this sort of game. I've played other games that I've paid 20 bucks for and gotten 100+ hours out of them. As for this one, this is not the case unfortunately. So, this gets a 1.0/2.5 for value.\n\nSo here is my score:\n\n7/10\n\nMarkness recommends the game based off of the music, the art style, and the story-rich game itself. He does not recommend the game based off of its value. You will be hard-pressed to probably get 20 hours of playthrough time in this game unless you play it over several times. It is a beautiful game, and has some amazing moments, and therefore is a pretty solid game. No major complaints about the game except its price-tag. I would recommend ONLY getting this game if you are super interested in it. Otherwise you may want to hold-out for a discount. Good game though overall, so thanks for this!\n\nAlso, if you want to take a look at the game itself, I have created an overview to it so you can take a look:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uhB0ABhQS8","January 15","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The setting is great, also for young and old ;) It didn't feel like a teen story with clichés! It is a lil' bit short, but it doesn't feel that way.

So suffice to say that it's a 'walk-n-talk' adventure game with a pretty touching set of characters and rather different vibe than a lot of similar games. When these group of teenagers start out this expedition they are most certainly not friends and things are rather awkard or unpleasant between them in a way that felt very true to life. As you see more of where this game is going you'll find a surprising degree of optional side questy content and some pretty convincing variable dialouge and feedback from characters. Additionally when it wants to be this game is very effectively unnerving and other times when it wants to be very heartwarming or genuine or even emotionally unpleasant in the way fighting with a friend feels in real life. I didn't really know what this was about when I started but I can now highly recommend it to the curious.","May 14","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Meaning that there is a ton of stuff I didnt discover yet. This however does not change my opinion on the game.\n\nOverall I can already say that I love playing it. However I love playing it in the evening. I tried playing it today in daylight and it just didnt give me the same feeling with noises and people in the back. So if you want to play it, play it in a dark room by yourself. It gives you the best experience in my opinion.\n\nThe game is about a playable story about... Well. Find that out for yourself. Like Undertale this is a game best played without spoilers. Things happen if you let them happen. The whole game depends on your decisions making it into a "telltale" game but way different. While Telltale gives you the setting and pushes forward Oxenfree wants the player to explore. Of course there are moments of "plot happens" but that is only to get the game into the direction it has to go no matter if you have done something or not.\n\nI myself know that what I have done at the start of the game couldve been something completly different. I decided to do something and what happened because of that happened. What wouldve happened if I wouldnt have decided to do it? Who knows. I dont.\n\nBut now three points that I have noticed that are worth mentioning.\n\nMany people tend to say that the "Teenage Bull" going on in the game is rather stupid and annoying. I however like it alot. It shows that the characters are more than just characters. They ARE Teenagers, growing up, liking or disliking things. They ACT in a certain way that fits their character. I myself because of that dislike one of the characters mainly because of how he/she acts. And that is the point of it. It gives the game much more depth.\n\nThe second thing however is more of a neutral thing. While I already love the game and its graphics there is this one thing that is also very time consuming. Running around on the given maps. Yes he game is about exploration and about you looking here and there to maybe find something but it seems rather slow at times. Nothing bad of course. Just that it may not be for some people.\n\nThe last point is a rather neutral one as well.\nThe graphics of the game look very pretty and also a bit scary at times. Or should I say creepy? I think creepy fits it more. Anyways, back to the point. The graphics look very pretty. Yet they have 2D and 3D. 2D as in the background and 3D for the characters. And while the 3D isnt the best I have ever seen it also isnt the worst. If it wouldve been in 2D as well I doubt it wouldve made a big difference.\n\nOverall Oxenfree is already a good game and the experience I had with it so far made it worth playing for me.

I grew up watching Degrassi, One Tree Hill, 90210 etc. If these themes don't resonate with you as they do I, then I can't speak to whether or not you'll enjoy this game to the same extent I did.\n\nOxenfree is wonderful. It's mysterious. It's evocative, moody, delightful, terrifying and even heartwarming. It will push you on an emotional rollercoaster through a beautifully hand-painted island fully of incredible and awful sights. The characters are believable teens: annoying, unpredicatable, bratty—but lovable for those reasons.\n\nI'm not going to go into the plot—short of a few very light puzzles, the game is really nothing but exploration-advanced plot—but it is captivating. You'll get as much out of the story as you're willing to put in: if you're not willing to invest yourself in the characters, then it may not resonate with you.\n\nI'd be remiss not to mention the Soundtrack, which mirrors all my thoughts about the game exactly. It's wonderfully melodic, at times saccharine, but then always beautifully, disturbingly dissonant at the right moments. And it's free with the game!\n\nI'd reccomend playing the game in one sitting, preferably in a dark room for maximum effect. A single playthrough shouldn't take more than 6 hours, even if you try to find collectables/optional plot. This shouldn't be too much of a problem though—if you're like me, you'll have a hard time putting it down.","January 25","true","9.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The art style is very unique, and the voice acting and dialogue were on point! The sounds and music were extremely immersive, and really enhanced the gameplay. There were some things that I feel were unnecessary, and overused in teen story games right now- see the taking of polaroid photos a la Life is Strange, and a few other more spoilery plot devices.\n\nI feel like the thriller/horror/supernatural elements were well balanced, providing just enough atmospherics without actually making me hide under my blanket! I loved the incorportation of the radio! There is definitely replayability, like any game where your choices ACTUALLY influence the outcome of the story, but I feel like a lot of the game's value was in not knowing what was going to happen, so I don't think it would be as interesting the second time through. Of course, in my playthrough I made everyone hate me so maybe I'm just a sore loser.\n\nTL;DR Great art style, sound, and voice acting. Would recommend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzcookies/recommended/388880/","mzcookies","Mz Cookies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzcookies/","342 products in account","Oxenfree is a striking and charming game that beautifully immerses the player into not only the story, but the characters through an outstanding conversational system that surpasses any I've encountered before.\n\nThe gameplay is minimal, as to be expected in a story rich game but it delivered more than  I ever could have anticipated with its colossal ambience and its faultless voice acting. The voice acting is so superb, it is what makes Oxenfree so atmospheric and genuine. It is difficult to really articulate exactly what makes it so 'special', it's emotional, it's sincere, it's everything you would wish for in a game heavily dependent upon dialogue and interactions.\n\nThe approach to conversations is simple but so engaging that I would be extra cautious to not skip anything, which I must say is fairly rare in games based on heavy dialogue. The characters themselves are quirky and have droves of personality. Character development throughout the game is blended seamlessly and comes naturally and strenghtens the players connection to them.\n\nThe walking in Oxenfree isn't tiresome, it is mostly scattered with engaging dialogue and gives the player a chance to soak in the beautiful surroundings as the detail is quite amazing. There is no need for a fast travel system, this isn't Skyrim, it is a STORY RICH game and thus expectations should be altered accordingly.\n\nI will acknowledge, however, that this definitely is not every gamers cup of tea, but it was never meant to be. From my playthrough, it is difficult for me to try and pinpoint a fault. The only slight downside I would say is the price for the length of gameplay, but seeing what Oxenfree has to offer, I would say the price is justifiable.\n\nOxenfree is a game of beauty, with a perfected conversational system, pragmatic characters that evoke emotion within the player, topped with an obscure story. Each of these elements collectively gives the player incentive to complete it with a sense of urgency, to determine the games outcome. That's what a story rich game really should encompass and what lovers of the genre NEED to play.\n\n","June 2","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perhaps THE most. And as adventure games are my personal favorite, I hope that's saying a lot.\n\nThe central mechanic of the game is  interavtive dialogue (though it sports it's fair share of walking, too), a fact which is well-exploited by Night School Studio. The conversations, which take place everywhere from a haunted island to myterious flashbacks, are creative, amusing, and relatively realistic. Depending on the situation, you'll find yourself talking with anywhere from one to four other individuals, all well-developed and unique characters. Just as in real life, you won't be given the unrealistic conveniance of endlessly pondering what you'll say next, or how you'll respond to an unexpected and perhaps even crucial question posed by one of the other characters, a rather silly reality in many other adventure games. Wait too long to choose a response, and the conversation will move on, leaving you wondering if you were right to remain silent. And even when you do say something, you may never be sure if it was to your benefit, or if it was your undoing.\n\nThe story of Oxenfree walks hand-in-hand with this brilliant mechanic, but is, if possible, even more impossibly convoluted. Even as someone who has played it with a fervor, I couldn't possibly spoil the story for you, even if I wanted too, because there are so many different paths to take. One single choice of words can send you spinning in a new direction, discovering one of many possible events and endings. Not all of those endings are good, and perhaps none of them are perfect. As you play as Alex, set amidst the oddities of her teenage friends, slowly descending into the mystery and the madness of a camping trip gone terribly wrong, you'll always be left wondering what just happened, what didn't, and what could have.\n\nIf a game that tells a story as deep and mysterious as that found in any thriller film or novel sounds up your ally, and if a title that will make you feel everything from sorrow to happiness and terror to laughter seems right for you, then Oxenfree should indeed grace your wishlist, and hopefully your library. And even though the game is, at most, four or five hours long, it is no longer than it needs to be, and is filled with the various and convoluted possiblities of a second, third, or perhaps even fourth replay.\n\nOxenfree is a story, deep and dark as any cave, waiting to be explored.","June 6","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't say much about it without spoiling it, and trust me, it should not be spoiled if you're interested in playing it for yourself.\n\nThe important things to note are that the dialogue is wonderfully written, the art and character design work perfectly, and the sound does exactly what it should do in an atmospheric horror game.\n\nThe dialogue is what I'd like to focus on further. It's very naturally written and spoken, it's very understandable why the developers are proud of their system. The writing is an example of what you should do with teenage characters, they actually feel real, not like what you'd expect from a middle aged guy thinking teenagers=selfies and that's it.\n\nThe only real gripe I can think of is that character movement is a touch slow and there's a few places where other character models get hung up on something and make the following scene either awkward or take a little longer to start while they path to it.\n\nOrdinarily, I'd go for a more in depth review, but the more I say, the more I risk spoiling something. So really, if the trailer catches your attention at all, just buy it and take the time to play it. It's not terribly long, but it will hold your attention for a long while.","June 5","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting is superb as is the soundtrack.\n\nIn the game your dialogue choices appear for such a short time that they disappear before you can even choose one. Also, making dialogue choices interupts what the other characters are saying but you have to do it or lose the chance to choose what you want to say. Initially, I thought this was a problem with quality control but learned this is intentional, intended on mimicking real life conversations. The other characters react by what you choose to say or not to say at all, and sometimes someone gets cut off by another while talking. Realism.\n\nMy only complaint: My game crashed 4 times. 3 of them were when the game is about to save progress so I had to replay the section.\n\nThis game IS definitely worth the $20.","January 17","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Turns out, it was very much worth the wait!\n\nOxenfree is the story of a group of friends going to an island, planning to drink up by a bonfire on the beach. Your friend, Ren, tells you about these weird "signals" coming from a cave near the beach and, being a curious young bunch, you all decide to go there. What follows is a great story, with some interesting choices you get to make along the way.\n\nMuch of the back story to your particular adventure is told via letters, which you'll start finding half way through the game. For me, those letters introduced so much depth to the island, its history and the events that unfold before you. I strongly recommend collecting and reading them.\n\nWith its gorgeous environments, stellar voice acting and gripping story Oxenfree is well worth your time. If I had to compare, I'd do so with Life is Strange. If you liked that at all, you will love Oxenfree.","January 16","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game had some pretty good pacing. I found the radio stuff to be a tad teadious at times, especially near the end of the game. But it wasn't enough to ruin my time with the game as there wasn't a sense of danger as you try to find the right frequency, at least during my playthrough.\n\nThe certain aspect of the game I dare not directly mention for the sake of avoiding spoilers also added a sense of ominous-ness to game, as you didn't understand what was going on with that stuff, and it gave you an optional direction to approach the game's story from in my honest opinion.\n\nThe game was a tad short, but I think in this case a short, good game is much better than a long-winded bad game. And I spent the whole time thinking the ending wasn't going to live up to all the build up to it, but in the end I was really not disappointed by it.

The atmosphere in this game is just brilliant. The way how the game is build is very interesting and has a good style.\n\nThe dialoges between the characters are entertaining & funny. The voice acting is also very good. You can affect the other characters with the choices you make.\n\nSoundtracks and the sound effects fits perfect in the game.\n\nStory is very interesting and with time it gets more. My first playthrough took me 5 hours, maybe not so much how i expected but absolutely enough for a great story.\n\nThe only thing I did not like was when you made choices, you don't have so much time. And if you choose too fast, she(Alex) just breaks in the dialoge from another character.\n\nUnfortunately this game is for now only in english. I can recommend this game if you understand good english. Otherwise you have to play it more than 1 time to understand the story.\n\nIf you look for mystery games you need to check out Oxenfree.

One of the very few narrative-heavy games that does conversations during movement well. The dialogue is neatly written, voice acting is spot-on and the music makes a great impression. Also, the visuals are really, really good.\n\nThe decisions made during playthrough mattered more than I had initially assumed, and the epilogue wrapped things up nicely. However, I felt like the actual ending was sort of a let-down, and the story in the second half of the game wasn't as strong as the opening hours (which had three or four _really_ great scenes). Still, I implore you to try and figure out the mysteries of the island - despite the game being fairly linear there are a bunch of secrets to uncover that fill out the narrative.","January 15","true","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","2"

Who are actually made up of Telltale and Disney alumni! Now that is a quite a combo. Not to mention they are teamed up with Skybound as well!\n\nOxenfree features a group of kids who unwittingly open a rift during an overnight island party gone horribly wrong. You play as Alex, who has brought her new stepbrother along with you to the party. You determine the story through your dialog choices with Alex. The story and your relationships change based on every choice.\n\n- Great art (Disney alum)\n- Soundtrack is well done\n- Interesting characters\n- Intriguing story/ mystery\n- Fantastic world building\n- Awesome voice cast\n- Gameplay is fun\n\nGameplay is mostly exploration, dialogue choices and tuning your radio to pick up frequencies. Basic, but it has its own quirk so it's still fun. Lot's to interact with as well so it keeps you on your toes. The game handles conversation in a very unique way. Most of the time you'll be moving while talking and have limited time to respond.\n\nWhere this game shines, so far, is in its story, dialog and characters. Each character immediately has their own niche and personality. Some you will love; some you will hate. Oxenfree has a whimsical feel, but soon takes a mysterious turn. It does a great job of building up the tension early on between both the characters and the world. It's certainly hooked me, and I think it will hook you too.\n\nUltimately, if you enjoy a narrative driven adventure full of mystery and scares, I think you will enjoy this game. IGN reported it clocks in at 3-6 hours, however I'm being told it's more like 7-9 hours. Either way fair amount of time for $20, to me.\n\nIf you're looking for gameplay before you buy, why not check out my playthrough!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cyjuO--KUs\n\nI wanted this review to reflect my first thoughts. I will update half way through and when I've competed the game.\n\nHighly Recommended.","January 15","true","8.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","2"

The aethstetics are awesome, the game looks fantastic, and the music is pretty nice as well.\n\nBut, as it is a narration - driven game, let's talk about it's main component.\n\nHonestly, I don't buy it. Here's why:\n\n1) It has a pretty generic cast of you (main character) - generic nerdy/trying to be fun guy - generic normal guy - generic nerdy girl - generic annoying girl.\n\nWhich could work, but\n\n2) Unlike, let's say, Life is Strage or any Telltale games or the Longest Journey or anything else, there is absolutely no character development. I would expect to see the characters to be first terrified first by all the unusual things, but then find the courage to go through. Instead, they are literally the same guys that started the journey. Don't get me wrong, the teenage banter is done fine, but it is what it is - just banter, the characters dont open up or progress or improve in any way or form.\n\n3) The kids reactions are really lacking. For example, when something weird happens, the character will usually just say "Oh, hey, I think it's this weird thing happening". Really?! There is out-of-this-world stuff going on, and not a single character freaks out or anything close to what a normal person would do. Instead, they just talk about it for a moment, and then continue with their usual personal topics.\n\n\n4) Fake freedom of exploration.\n\nThe game is 100% linear, and it pretends not to be. For example, there will be one particular moment when you need to get from Harden Tower to Relay Point. Well, by looking at the map, I figured I could go either left or right, so I went right. Guess what?! Right before getting there, at the bridge, there was literally A WALL standing that didn't let me go through! And yes, the wall had nothing to do with the game at all and simply dissapeared when I went the other way around, after waisting around 10 minutes on this fake exploration choice.\n\nAnd the final -and, I think, the biggest problem with this game.\n\nThis is not a game.\n\nSeriously, the only game mechanic is tuning the radio from time to time to find the right frequency for something to happen (three times in a row). There is not a single puzzle in the whole game.\nWhich, for me, turned this into a walking simulator - not as horrible as Dear Eshter, but still.\nIf you don't have any interestic mechanics - fine, just skip them entirely, do what Telltale did and make it a long movie with occasional interactivity, it would work great! But instead, you just hold your finger on one of the WASD for ten minutes, and then press space to interact with the only interactable things that is so obvious that a three year old would figure it out.\n\nOverall, I feel that while i enjoyed it occasionally, I was more often annoyed at just walking and walking and walking or tuning the radio for the 134781th time.","March 14","false","3.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","1"

Then, after three hours, I ran out of patience and just... stopped. I haven't finished the game, perhaps it gets better in the later stages. But for me it just isn't worth the hassle!\n\nDon't get me wrong, Oxenfree is not a completely bad game, there was certainly effort put into it and some of it paid off. The voice acting is spot-on and the visual style is very interesting, for example. But now let's move on to why I gave this game that big ugly thumbs down.\n\nThe game consists mainly of walking around, talking to people and fetch questing. The greatest challenge is finding the right frequency to tune in on your radio so you can advance, which is tedious at best. You can never die or lose in any way (as far as I know), and there are also no intellectual challenges to speak of. So this game basically tests your patience and nothing else.\n\nBut who cares about challenge, we are here for the narrative and hard decisions, right? Well, as I said earlier, the voice acting is top notch. But the story itself kind of meanders around, never truly dragging me in. I played this game yesterday and I can only vaguely recollect what I had been doing for those three hours. I can only remember two of the protagonists' names (out of five). I simply wasn't involved, so everything went in and out like a boring lecture.\n\nAs for the "hard decisions", more often than not I picked arbitrarily or by accident, because I had no idea that it was decision time. For example, at one point you are supposed to choose who will accompany you on your next fetch quest, but it shows nothing but the characters' names. So I picked one that was the least obnoxious at the time and whoops, they are my companion now. But even if I knew perfectly clear that I was making a decision, I still wouldn't know who to pick because WHO THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE? What am I supposed to base my choice around, I barely remember their names!\n\nSo, to summarize: Art style and voice acting is great, the narrative not so much, anything else is hardly worth mentioning. I didn't like it.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the game just didn't resonate with me, that this is all just a problem with my personal taste. And seeing how many good reviews this game got, I am inclined to believe that theory. You want to try the game out? By all means, do so, you will probably like it more than I did. But I can not in good conscience recommend it to you.","March 13","false","2.9"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

In the beginning of the story I was extremely excited, edge of my seat - yet as it unraveled I was disappointed to discover there were no new elements. I finished it far more quickly than I thought I would, and overall the feeling of dissatisfaction made me wish I didn't buy it in the first place (again, at least not for $20)","February 25","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It has good art. But it's not good. The supernatural aspects are forced, and far from scary. The dialogue is completely awful. Walking around aimlessly takes up 75% of the game. Oxenfree takes all the cringe-worthy aspects of the impressive Life is Strange and haphazardly combines them with an after-school special.

I do like narrative driven games (Soma, To the Moon) but despite a promising start, which was quite atmospheric and creepy, I thought it tailed off pretty badly. When it ended it felt like a bit of a surprise as there was no satisfying climax. The dialog was perhaps a bit too two dimensional and teenage and all the back stories were like horror cliches.\n\nI originally liked it's original concept with the walking and talking but, as my speech bubble decisions increasingly felt insignificant to the direction of the story (which, like all bad horror films became pretty dull the second I knew what was going on), it became fairly tedious.\n\nIf it ever becomes £5 I'd recommend it as quick, fairly interesting and original game concept that you can complete in an evening but it's not worth £15.","March 27","false","6.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

I was recommended this game if I had enjoyed something like Life Is Strange, and while the premise is interesting in the beginning, it becomes incredibly dull and slow to a point where the it just feels like you are watching some flash-made mini movie on newgrounds. Do not bother wasting your time on this, incredibly overrated, and not nearly in comparison to something like LIS, since it lacks decent or believable voice acting or enticing gameplay. I come across as harsh, but unlike LIS and other interactive storytelling games, they dont expect me to hold down the "D" key to keep moving right to get to the next screen of endless boring dialogue.","April 28","false","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its worth your money and your time.\n\nThe artstyle of this game is great, the plot is interesting, and the characters are likeable.\n\nThis game just pulls you in, and it doesn't let go. The way the Ghost talks is so badass, and so creepy at the same time. The way it follows you around, and that you can only see it in flashes, just to remind you that it's always watching you, toying with you. It makes you want to know what it is, and what it wants. And the game, generally, isn't that scary. Me, being a complete avoider of the horror genre, didn't think this game was scary enough to make me not want to go pee in the middle of the night. One reason for this is that the Ghost actually talks to you, and explains things pretty early in the game. It's not like you're in the dark throughout the entrie game and at the end you get the information. It doesn't even slowly feed you info to keep you interested. You learn exactly who the Ghost is about an hour into the game. I mean, how many games tell you exactly whats chasing you within the first hour?\n\nAnyway, this game is great, and well worth the 20$.

I really like it. But, aside from my personal tastes, the art style is gorgeous, with hand-painted, watercolor backgrounds, and relatable characters. There's actually a sense of realism to the decisions you make in the game, where you will have to pick a choice, or none at all. It's like real conversation, where you can cut in and say your piece, or leave the conversation going, without your 10 cents thrown in. Because you never know whether what you say is important or not, you might find yourself being very careful about what you say, or throwing caution to the winds and screwing everything up for yourself. Either way, the fun is the journey, especially with that nifty radio.\n\nThe characters have depth to them through their dialogue, and edgy teenage ways. Like someone else said here, their voice acting is absolutely on-point. Some of the music adds quite a fitting sense of tension, as well(gotta have some l33t vaporwave). It adds to the thriller-esque theme, and fits in well with the common horror trope of teenagers goofing off in the middle of nowhere and summoning the Devil or some other riffraff like that. It's a nice twist on the genre, and it's more of a slow-burn creepy, without any jumpscares. Any squeamish people(like me) will be glad to hear that, but the creepy atmosphere is still set here.\n\nCons\n\nEven with these nice perks of the game, it is an Indie game, and indie games are made with a target audience in mind. I feel as if this was made for fans of Until Dawn and/or Life is Strange. Or, in fact, decision-based games in general. It does involve a lot of walking around, so if you're not much of a fan of walking simulators, then this may not be your cup of tea. Each playthrough is around 6-7 hours, so it may turn many people off because of its steep price, but it's well worth it for the replayability, especially if you buy it while it's on sale.","March 18","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because you never know whether what you say is important or not, you might find yourself being very careful about what you say, or throwing caution to the winds and screwing everything up for yourself. Either way, the fun is the journey, especially with that nifty radio.\n\nThe characters have depth to them through their dialogue, and edgy teenage ways. Like someone else said here, their voice acting is absolutely on-point. Some of the music adds quite a fitting sense of tension, as well(gotta have some l33t vaporwave). It adds to the thriller-esque theme, and fits in well with the common horror trope of teenagers goofing off in the middle of nowhere and summoning the Devil or some other riffraff like that. It's a nice twist on the genre, and it's more of a slow-burn creepy, without any jumpscares. Any squeamish people(like me) will be glad to hear that, but the creepy atmosphere is still set here.\n\nCons\n\nEven with these nice perks of the game, it is an Indie game, and indie games are made with a target audience in mind. I feel as if this was made for fans of Until Dawn and/or Life is Strange. Or, in fact, decision-based games in general. It does involve a lot of walking around, so if you're not much of a fan of walking simulators, then this may not be your cup of tea. Each playthrough is around 6-7 hours, so it may turn many people off because of its steep price, but it's well worth it for the replayability, especially if you buy it while it's on sale.","March 18","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has nice art style (thank God it's not another one of those «8bit pixelart»), and a good soundtrack. In-game effects are interesting. The idea behind the game is interesting too, especially if you like movies like «Frequency», it has something in common.\n\nBut the dialogues... are too childish, careless, and lack of immersion. Hey, you've just seen lots of paranormal activities, one of your friends posessed, flying around like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Copperfield on his magic show, and... it's time to talk about dating, your teenage problems, divorce of your parents, etc etc etc. I know it's needed to reveal characters background, but the way it is done is soooo boring. Most of the dialogues in game seemed too unimportant and boring. Now that I've finished the game, I don't want to start another one — because I just can't stand all this teenage chit-chat (or maybe I am too old for this, I don't know).\n\nSo, I can praise the technical part of the game, but unfortunately it was «killed» by bad writing.

The FPS is always dropping at random areas, the characters walk VERY SLOOOWLLLY, but the worse part is the NPCs AI. You usually have an NPC character following you while you play the game, and their pathing is very bad and buggy. I constantly find myself waiting miles ahead for the NPC who keeps climbing onto and getting off of the foot of a cliff, or just clinging to it and never moving. For some areas, the screen doesn't scroll all the way with you, keeping you from entering an important house or retrieving an item because you're pretty much moving beyond the edge of the screen.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game or play it until Night School Studio fixes all of the bugs that make it practically unplayable, or else won't have a very pleasant experience with this game.","February 10","false","3.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Seriously, I thought it was great where you could go back in time and possibly save people from death. I also loved the mystery of these other beings, which made me put my Nancy Drew hat on wanting to solve the mystery. Voice acting was AH-MAZING! Really, really great job on that as well.\n\nThe problem I had with this was it was extremely SHORT. I know my play time says 9 hours but that is because i went back trying to get all the endings. I really wish it was longer with more challenges or mini games. It would have enriched the story a bit more and it would just amp up the fun (in my opinion). Another thing that makes me want to not recommend this was the controls! While trying to tune the radio for the right frequency drove me mad. MAD, I tell you. And sometimes when I went to go click a choice, the choice that I picked--well wasnt picked. What I mean was I was clicking like mad on a word bubble but it simply didnt seem to realize what i was picking. Thus it made my character say or do nothing. If these things were fixed or added on to, then I would give a thumbs up. Its just that I think there is so much more potential to this game but with its short play time...i just cant recommend it (at the current price or even the normaly price of $20.)\n\n","June 2","false","9.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The kind where you know the protagonist has gone through some emotional trauma because she dyed her hair blue. The kind where, despite seeing your friends possessed and committing suicide a scant few minutes ago, there's always time to stop and take a group selfie and banter about mundane teenage problems. If this is the new age of video game entertainment, where we fully embrace the self-imposed inferiority complex when stacked against other mediums that are better suited to telling nuanced long form narratives, why does the writing feel like it was cobbled together from the Dawson's Creek trash bin? Is the lateral move from a fourteen year old male demographic to a fourteen year old female demographic (who aren't capable of playing traditional games) really a sign of progress? Why do these teenagers talk like they're thirty, but don't understand simple concepts like what constitutes a stepbrother? Why do they start the game as stereotypical Diablo Cody characters, survive what would be a life-changing night for anyone... and end the game as stereotypical Diablo Cody rejects? Sigh...\n\nTo be fully honest: I'm not the intended audience for Oxenfree. I heard a few rumblings about a new horror game where it was best to go in as fresh as possible to get the most out of it, so I took the bait and bought it on blind faith. That was a bad move. Immediately I began to have PTSD episodes of Gone Home, where it became clear this game was made for entry level, angsty preteens and creepy, middle aged academic critics who questionably identify with them. To be clear: I'm not against “casual” games, or narrative focused games, or even coming of age stories, nor do I want to take anything away from anyone who enjoys them... but if that's your thing... demand more than what Oxenfree has to offer.\n\nI quite liked the hand painted backgrounds of Oxenfree. They stand in sharp contrast to the PS2-looking, low polygon character models that frequently clip through each other. There can be a problem with scale and navigation caused by the art, as some paths aren't clear and you can often outrun the camera. The game probably wouldn't be pushing any limits on a phone, but overall it's pleasant to look at. You will be referring to your map quite often, however, and that suffers from the same problems with scale and determining pathways. Scattered around the island are some collectibles in the form of small piles of rocks, and these can be unnecessarily difficult to spot: they're tiny and often almost indistinguishable from the background, or they're off-camera...\n\nThe clashing art style is exemplary of the game itself. Oxenfree feels like a handful of disparate ideas thrown against a wall, and they don't mesh particularly well together. Some of the horror elements are kind of cool, but they're completely destroyed by the pacing necessary to tell a poor teenage melodrama. The relationships of the characters could have been interesting to explore, but the supernatural elements (and their lack of concern about them) along with generally poor development and payoff make the script seem secondary. The exploration of the island could have been satisfying, but it's bogged down with the clunky dialogue... Nothing ever really gels, and none of Oxenfree's parts are very strong on their own merits. I also ran into a couple notable bugs. Once the AI just up and broke on me, leaving my character stuck at a door while her much needed friend just stared at her, causing me to reload a save from ten minutes prior and relive a scene I didn't care about the first time all over again. Another time a female companion's dialogue was replaced with an off-screen male character's voice for a lengthy line. That was actually pretty funny and unfortunately the most entertainment I got out of Oxenfree.","January 16","false","4.1"," 103 of 219 people (47%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","47","103","219","21","15"

The relationships between protagonist Alex and her four companions--popular yet abusive Clarissa, excitable stoner Ren, bookish Nona, and newcomer Jonas--are well-defined, with varied dialogue options that bring to mind the excellent work done in "Life Is Strange" and "Until Dawn." The biggest difference between those titles and "Oxenfree," however, is that I'm not entirely convinced that "Oxenfree" is much of a game. Beyond (optionally) choosing dialogue options and tuning a radio dial into the various "hidden" frequencies that haunt the island, there's a tenuous amount of actual interaction. The similarly themed "Everyone's Gone to the Rapture," or the superior "Gone Home," both of which take a photo-realistic first-person approach, are far more immersive.\n\nI want to recommend "Oxenfree," but the things I most admire about it are things that are best found in other media--as a movie, or a novel. (I recommend "Slade House," by David Mitchell, while you wait for the film of this "game" to be produced.) That might not seem particularly fair, and there are plenty of so-called "walking simulators" and "visual novels" to be found on Steam, toeing the line between fiction and video game. I just wish the game had gone a little further with some of it's weirder elements and ghostly effects, or had had some slightly deeper lore to delve into--something, even as small as a fast-travel option (to previously explored locations), to encourage replay of the supposedly branching paths. As is, "Oxenfree" is as light as the children's game its title comes from; this isn't the game I was looking for.","January 15","false","6.3"," 25 of 82 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","25","82","2","3"

There was no harsh cut offs in the conversations, if you inturrupted someone while they were talking they would finish a word or two and then stop, as one does if inturrupted in a conversation. You choose what your character says via pop up text bubbles, then the NPCs react to your words.

I really liked this game. It kept me engaged and locked in the whole time. The plot was suspenseful and engaging. The characters were really fun and quite interesting. I really liked Alex in particular. She was easily likeable, with an easygoing yet subtle, fun yet considerate, and real personality, despite being almost completely player defined. The conversations between the characters and their relationships felt surprisingly organic and fluent. It was a joy to listen to banter and build relationships with people. It was even more of a joy participating in banter (it was so fun and made me feel in compete control of Alex. Pretty cool). They did an excellent job making interesting, fun, natural, and immersive character interactions. This is my favorite part of the game. Furthermore, I just love the amount of dialogue and plot choices that the game enables me to make. It's like I am defining almost everything Alex said, acted, or even felt about situations. This is one of the first games that made me feel like I had that level of freedom and extensive control over my own character's interactions. I just wish you didn't have to interrupt people talking all the time because you're afraid to run out of time to pick a dialogue option. I would've liked it if they gave us more time to respond, but included a [...] option for the times when you want to remain silent. The voice acting, I have to say, is so organic and natural, and immersively delivered. It never felt off or jarring. It just flowed perfectly. Wonderful job done by the voice actors, especially Alex's.\n\nI love how the plot kept me on your toes, immersing me in a comfortable and familiar environment, yet contrasting that with doses of supernatural events. The atmosphere is full of captivating suspense and enticement; it really draws you in. The plot just gets more and more intriguing, more and more intense as it progresses.\n\nI liked the graphical art style too. Not too over-the-top stylish (like a lot of indie games with their black and white, shadows, and artistic partial effects). They definitely took a more subtle, yet really nice approach to the art style that I appreciate. It's colourful. Not rainbowy or particularly vibrant, yet not monochrome either. It's really easy on the eyes.\n\nI'm not a fan of platformers. So I'm also not too keen on 2D sidescrollers. But this game, with its smooth mechanics and controls, along with its nice art style and 2.5D world, made the experience of traversing the world quite enjoyable. The conversations also made it a lot more interesting. The controls were very smooth, simplistic, and easy to adapt. I found it a lot more comfortable with a controller, that's for sure. My only complaint here is really just the lack of guide to the controls. I didn't know how to jump or interact with something, or use the radio in the beginning. A few times when I needed to. I just ended up mashing keys until I figured it out. Yes, there's a few popups that come up, but it's quite sparse and easily missed. I would've liked if we had a list of controls and had access to keybindings. Also, followers got occasionaly stuck in the environment as part of some pathing bugs, which prevented the plot from progressing. I had to reload several times.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point. The menus. The options menu is lacking. Where is the audio adjustment for changing dialogue, sound effect, and music volume? How do I enable Vsync? How can I customize my level of graphical detail? And of course, as I've mentioned before, where is the controls menu and keybindings option? It would've definitely helped to be able to access some more settings. I would've also liked a multiple save files option so I can explore different narrative paths and choices, or undo some of my actions. There's really no easy way to do that without having to start over.\n\n\nBut these are nitpicks, really. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game. My biggest gripe (which isn't really a complaint as much as a preference) is with the ending. Although I won't say that it's bad, because it's quite cleverly conceived and well crafted, but the ending is one thing that I really disliked. The ending just felt disjointed from everything that was worked towards in the game. I won't elaborate, but it just didn't feel like a true "conclusion" or gave adequate closure to the main plotline that was being played out. It took away from the value of everything I did in the game, and made that feel insignificant.\n\nBut I loved this game. I loved the story, I loved the characters, I loved the banter and dialogues, and I loved the sense of freedom and extensiveness in Alex's character. If I could describe this game in one word, it would be: subtle. Subtle, but wonderful.","January 31","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/recommended/388880/","Isarii","Isarii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/","98 products in account","I recently played through Oxenfree, yet another game set in my Cascadian home that plays to the sinister magic of the region; whatever keeps the Californians from moving here, I suppose.\n\nLike most of the single-player games I enjoy, Oxenfree is heavily invested in its narrative. The title is fairly gameplay light; I’d almost go so far as to call it a walking simulator, if that didn’t seem to be such a weird characterization for what’s effectively a 3-D sidescroller. Still, the gameplay will mostly be comprised of exploring the game’s island as you progress through the plot, using your handheld radio to tune into anomalies found throughout the map.\n\nOxenfree draws its clearest inspirations from teen horror flicks of the 80s and 90s, centering on a group of teens who venture to an empty island to enjoy a night of fun. As you’d expect, it doesn’t take long before their plans are upended and the weirdness sets in.\n\nThe game would best be categorized as a psychological horror title, relying on the strength of its characters to build tension instead of cheap jump scares. Featuring a team of veteran voice actors, the dialogue delivery is some of the best I’ve experienced in a game, notable in particular for the timing of characters’ lines. The flow of interaction finds realism through the ways characters constantly interrupt and talk over each other like actual people, something I’d never known I was missing in video games until now. Beyond the quality, dialogue delivers on the quantity front as well; there’s hardly a moment where someone isn’t going on about something, be it the characters’ relationships with each other or the events unfolding around them. The game’s conversation system includes a choice and consequence element where your choices will decide how characters view you and the way the story progresses and eventually ends.\n\nThere are several mysteries to be unraveled as you progress through Oxenfree, and they won’t all be laid out clearly just by following the main plot. As you journey through the vacant island, you’ll find clues to its history hidden along the way, challenging the player to piece together the full story in their head.\n\nDespite being a horror title, I wouldn’t really characterize Oxenfree as scary. It’s certainly an engaging and thrilling experience, but there was never any point in this game where I felt like I was in danger of having a heart attack; this is likely a result of the aforementioned avoidance of jump scares. If you’re the type who usually avoids horror games, I wouldn’t rule the game out purely on that basis.\n\nFor the bottom line, Oxenfree features a solid story with excellent dialogue, engaging conversation choices, and enough mystery to keep you interested. My single-sitting playthrough of the game took around 4 hours, which does introduce a question of value for a $20 title. While I would unreservedly recommend playing the game, your personal value judgments may make this one to pick up when it goes on Steam sale.","March 13","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting and quite original, you'll find yourself wanting to know more about the island, and the strange happenings that is occuring to your own character (Alex) and four other friends that your on this mystery island adventure with.\n\nThe dialogue is actually very natural, entertaining, and comedic. They really nailed this important part of the game. As a result I connected with all of the characters, maybe not Nona so much... But otherwise everyone has very distintive personalities, and people you may judge early on you can have a completely different opinion of later on in the game.\n\nI've only played through once so far, and I feel like doing it again. So that's a good sign right? Repeat value, the alternative ending outcomes works well in it's favor.\n\nIt's not really scary, at all. But I don't think this was even an intent with the dev's, this is very much a casual indie game, and I loved this approach.  Also the game really isn't a challenge in conventional ways. It simply forces you to make decisions which can possibly impact your friends lives in negative or positive ways, so if your into that sort of thing you'll probably love this game.\n\nThe art style is like a 10/10 lovely asthetic, it brings the world to life, seriously amazing job by their artists.\n\nThe soundtrack feels very carpenter inspired, with also what feels like a bit of a nod to disasterpeace. The composition are very minmalistic in nature, they never become to busy or present to completely pull you out of the immersive experience. The composer nailed the time period and atmosphere, but also showed a lot of restraint, yet the music never gets tiresome or to repatative. I loved how he processed all of the synth sounds with added tape delay giving that lovely wabble from the fluttering.\n\nThe sound effects are also spot on.\n\nIf you like mystery games, then I'm pretty sure you are going to want to experience this.\n\nRating: 8/10\n","March 13","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some parts are linear but there are choices. It's character-driven game, so you need to (or not) care for relationships between them. But the part where it shines most is the radio mechanics. A gorgeous radio tuner scale popups when press a button and you can tune to different frequencies. It simulates an analogue radio, so you never get a perfect singal. There are some interferences, sometimes static, sometimes something important. Some messages needs to be written down (get some pen and paper). It's awesome.\n- AI - what AI? Where there is only one type of AI there - other NPCs follow main character. Nothing special, except that they can get stupid and blocked on cliffs/jumps. But Devs said they are working on fixing that.\n- sound - brilliant. There are some jump scares, there are some environmental sounds. And there is a radio and everything related to it. Brilliant.\n- music - very solid soundtrack. So solid that it's worth buying it separatly.

I've played through twice already to see some of the differences in how you interact with people. The dialogue system is amazing, honestly. You have a finite amount of time to select a response (or choose not to respond at all) and the conversations feel real-time. My only gripe is that it can feel slow at a couple points.

Yes, some of the teenage drama/dialogue can be a bit much, but the characters all felt unique and fully fleshed out. And in a way, their personalities added to or highlighted the tension of the atmosphere. The juxtoposition of a bunch of silly teens stuck on this terrible island just works. There are a few moments that are legitimately scary, and the music and overall story are both great. I played it twice to test the quality of the replay, and I'd say it isn't as great the second time around, even though I got a different ending.

This is only enhanced by the amazing quality of voice acting. Most games have at least one bad/ok voice actor, but all of the acting in Oxenfree is top notch.

In a sense, its like undertale, where you need to experience it, rather than watch it to make the most of it.  I spent around 5 hours playing it grabbing all the collectables, so if your intereted in bang for you buck, there are better alternatives as replayablility is limited.  Certain decisions will be tracked and compared at the end, and you may end up impeding or influencing other players.  Art style is fantastic, a nice 'fairy tale' vibe really helps build the world your on, but it can be a little dark in areas with key interactable objects hard to notice.  Voice acting is superb, really nothing much more can be said.  Story is very nice, and character development is executed extremely well, with everyone changing naturally based on your actions.  Soundtrack is good, helps set the mood for the story while not being dominating.\n\nOverall, if you want a good story focused game, this is a great choice.

The title is fairly gameplay light; I’d almost go so far as to call it a walking simulator, if that didn’t seem to be such a weird characterization for what’s effectively a 3-D sidescroller. Still, the gameplay will mostly be comprised of exploring the game’s island as you progress through the plot, using your handheld radio to tune into anomalies found throughout the map.\n\nOxenfree draws its clearest inspirations from teen horror flicks of the 80s and 90s, centering on a group of teens who venture to an empty island to enjoy a night of fun. As you’d expect, it doesn’t take long before their plans are upended and the weirdness sets in.\n\nThe game would best be categorized as a psychological horror title, relying on the strength of its characters to build tension instead of cheap jump scares. Featuring a team of veteran voice actors, the dialogue delivery is some of the best I’ve experienced in a game, notable in particular for the timing of characters’ lines. The flow of interaction finds realism through the ways characters constantly interrupt and talk over each other like actual people, something I’d never known I was missing in video games until now. Beyond the quality, dialogue delivers on the quantity front as well; there’s hardly a moment where someone isn’t going on about something, be it the characters’ relationships with each other or the events unfolding around them. The game’s conversation system includes a choice and consequence element where your choices will decide how characters view you and the way the story progresses and eventually ends.\n\nThere are several mysteries to be unraveled as you progress through Oxenfree, and they won’t all be laid out clearly just by following the main plot. As you journey through the vacant island, you’ll find clues to its history hidden along the way, challenging the player to piece together the full story in their head.\n\nDespite being a horror title, I wouldn’t really characterize Oxenfree as scary. It’s certainly an engaging and thrilling experience, but there was never any point in this game where I felt like I was in danger of having a heart attack; this is likely a result of the aforementioned avoidance of jump scares. If you’re the type who usually avoids horror games, I wouldn’t rule the game out purely on that basis.\n\nFor the bottom line, Oxenfree features a solid story with excellent dialogue, engaging conversation choices, and enough mystery to keep you interested. My single-sitting playthrough of the game took around 4 hours, which does introduce a question of value for a $20 title. While I would unreservedly recommend playing the game, your personal value judgments may make this one to pick up when it goes on Steam sale.","March 13","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really catchy, this somehow short game will take your breath thanks to astonighing graphics and its storyline.\nI recommand you this game. Except if you're really a fan of this kind of game, wait for steam sales; but don't miss it.\n\nLong review\nOxenfree is a promenade between teenage's struggles and a ghost horror story. As the game doesn't really have any gameplay challenge (it's more a talkative game), the atmosphere is really immersive. The different answers you choose will bend the relations between the 5 characters, even if the main arc won't change (not I've noted). I've really like how you can be submerge by the game atmosphere and storyline. I've really felt transport in a mix between my nostalgia for my own teenage years, my interest in psychologiy horror stories and some philosophical though (remind me somehow the comics "Bell's Theorem" by Schulltheiss because of the "time" problematic and the sunken submarine)\n\nPlaying with the radio (the main feature of the game) is really original and well integrated in the game. We can also catch some old radio and get some old music - maybe the background music could have been only through the radio.\nThe background graphics are astonoshing, really catch.\n\nThe nature especially is exceptionnaly painted. Bad points: the characters themself are a bit rough (mostly not a problem since we mostly see them from far away), the doors are exceptionnaly ugly (made on paint???) and the cursor, which we frenquently use, is the normal Windors one (why not design your own??).\n\nPostive\nimmersive\ngraphics / nature are very beautiful\nstoryline and script are catchy\ngood integration of interactions between the characters\nthe interactions with other players  with the mirrors  is really a plus and could have been even more pushed\nthe musicNegative\nsome graphics are ugly or missing (doors, cursor). An ugly door on an astonishing wall?\nsomehow short game (count around 6 hours)\nno introduction about who is who and the previous relations between characters.: even if we learn that into the game (good point), it can biaised some answers/interactions we do only because we lack some informations (bad point)\n"two" background musics: the background music of the game and through the radio. One is too much.\nDetails and propositions for the Dev' team:\nthere are some path finding issues, especially when taking a ladder or climbing a wall: the 2nd (IA) character wait that we have finished the move to start its own, even the ladder/wall if big enough for both. (Note: this happen when the IA character move first and we follow it).\nwhen walking, we can go through other characters (collision problem)\nthere could have been a script that turn the character towards the ones they are talking to. It's minor but noticing (strange to talk to someone's back)","March 20","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an air of mystery and I was continually left wondering and curious until the very end.\n\nWith most other platformer-adventure games I've played, I tend to want to explore, discover, collect, or use everything before moving on through a level. But this game sometimes doesn't allow you to do that - as you shift and loop through time and watch different scenarios play out. How it happens is bizarre, why it happens is bizarre. The storyline will keep you on your toes for sure.\n\nWhat I loved about it was the characters, the visuals, and the overall creepiness.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that what you said, determined how things played out in the game. Although I wish it had been a little more apparent during gameplay as I felt like I couldn't make a bad choice. Then again, maybe I need to play it another time for me to compare.\n\nA couple of disappointing things was moving through the map could sometimes be slow - especially when backtracking. There's no run option - although sometimes your walk was a swift jog. But most times, you're slowly walking the path through different parts of the island until you reach your end point.\n\nTasks were relatively easy and they were pretty spelled out as to what you needed to do. There's wasn't as much problem-solving or puzzles as I thought there might be. You couldn't really do anything wrong or sit there for long before figuring out what it was you needed to do. In that regard, I felt it was a little simple.\n\nI grabbed this on a sale and am not disappointed but if I had paid full price, I may have been.","March 20","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a sense, its like undertale, where you need to experience it, rather than watch it to make the most of it.  I spent around 5 hours playing it grabbing all the collectables, so if your intereted in bang for you buck, there are better alternatives as replayablility is limited.  Certain decisions will be tracked and compared at the end, and you may end up impeding or influencing other players.  Art style is fantastic, a nice 'fairy tale' vibe really helps build the world your on, but it can be a little dark in areas with key interactable objects hard to notice.  Voice acting is superb, really nothing much more can be said.  Story is very nice, and character development is executed extremely well, with everyone changing naturally based on your actions.  Soundtrack is good, helps set the mood for the story while not being dominating.\n\nOverall, if you want a good story focused game, this is a great choice.

If you liked either of those to games, or like a short game that will tell a greate little story, then play this.\n\nThis game is very story based, and there is little gameplay, hoever I would not call this a walking simulator. I stand by my comparison of Kentucky Route Zero as it plays very similarly. The gameplay mainly consists of looking at a map to walk from A to B, and solving some really simple "puzzles" to progress. These puzzles are more along the lines of "The door is locked, pick up the key on the floor in plain sight and use it" type of puzzle rather than any sort of headscratcher. The mechanics work well with the game, and don't break flow from the story. I encountered a few technical glitches such as NPCs who were supposed to be following me getting stuck in place, but nothing game breaking.\n\nThe story is really good. Nothing ground breaking, but a good story. It centers around 5 teenagers who take a weekend trip to a small island town, and wake up something supernatural that they must fix/escape. The voiceacting and writing was really well done. They really managed to capture the vibe of a teenage trip, and when things head south the game is really good at creating an atmosphere of creepyness and unease.\n\nIn all, good game. I would recommend to play it all in one sitting, so clear off a block of 3.5 - 4 hours turn out the lights, put on some headphones and enjoy the ride.","March 18","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an air of mystery and I was continually left wondering and curious until the very end.\n\nWith most other platformer-adventure games I've played, I tend to want to explore, discover, collect, or use everything before moving on through a level. But this game sometimes doesn't allow you to do that - as you shift and loop through time and watch different scenarios play out. How it happens is bizarre, why it happens is bizarre. The storyline will keep you on your toes for sure.\n\nWhat I loved about it was the characters, the visuals, and the overall creepiness.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that what you said, determined how things played out in the game. Although I wish it had been a little more apparent during gameplay as I felt like I couldn't make a bad choice. Then again, maybe I need to play it another time for me to compare.\n\nA couple of disappointing things was moving through the map could sometimes be slow - especially when backtracking. There's no run option - although sometimes your walk was a swift jog. But most times, you're slowly walking the path through different parts of the island until you reach your end point.\n\nTasks were relatively easy and they were pretty spelled out as to what you needed to do. There's wasn't as much problem-solving or puzzles as I thought there might be. You couldn't really do anything wrong or sit there for long before figuring out what it was you needed to do. In that regard, I felt it was a little simple.\n\nI grabbed this on a sale and am not disappointed but if I had paid full price, I may have been.","March 20","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, some of the teenage drama/dialogue can be a bit much, but the characters all felt unique and fully fleshed out. And in a way, their personalities added to or highlighted the tension of the atmosphere. The juxtoposition of a bunch of silly teens stuck on this terrible island just works. There are a few moments that are legitimately scary, and the music and overall story are both great. I played it twice to test the quality of the replay, and I'd say it isn't as great the second time around, even though I got a different ending.

It's a very story-driven choice based game with amazing voice acting and dialog options that actually feel significant. The price point may be high for those expecting more than 4-5 hours of content, but I definitely recommend it at normal price. If on sale, it's a must buy.\n\nOxenfree is a very enjoyable experience. It was made by some former Telltale devs and this becomes very clear as time goes on. Characters form opinions of you based on your dialog choices and you can use this element to build up or tear down relationships. The impact of some choices comes off as very clear, but others are so subtle you wouldn't recognise that it had an affect if a little bubble didn't pop up over the characters head. While the game is fairly linear in its story, you can explore different areas at any time and progress at your own pace. While exploring you have the option to learn about the world and gather various collectibles. All of which are completely optional and only seek to expand on the story of the game. They are also not very hard to find. Some require a watchful eye and others the deciphering of some simple word puzzles.\n\nOn a different note, the atmosphere of this game is fantastic. I found myself playing the game at night and in the dark in order to get the full effect of the game. The supernatural elements are very well done and keep the game from being your typical "walking simulator", In the end with the dialog choices, collectibles, and atmosphere the game comes off as a type of combination of a Telltale game, walking simulator, and point-and-click adventure. And it ends up being better for it. By combining all these elements you get a truly unique experience that's really hard not to like.\n\nPros:\n-Great atmoshpere\n-Amazing visual style\n-Superb voice acting\n-Interesting plot\n-Actual replay value (due to various choices that can be made)\n\nCons:\n-Some might find the price point kind of steep for 4-5 hours\n-Dialog choices vary in an odd way (some interrupt characters, while others wait for them to finish speaking and there's no way to tell which will happen)","March 9","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's gorgeous. Every part of the island is unique and haunting while fitting the comicbook style visuals. Or should I say the 90s Saturday morning cartoon style-of which you recorded on a single vhs too many times and the magnetic strip started wearing out around the edges... It all meshes and adds to the atmosphere. It's eerie and scary without jumpscares and loud sounds.\n\nWhich rolls us into the audio; being the true genius of Oxenfree. I don't know much about the time period the radio tunes us in to, but the clips that were chosen, from old wailing poka to bugs bunny, are all set to make you feel off, to add to the atmosphere you're wandering through. The dialogue, and the warped hollow sounds of the spirits, and the whispers caught over the airwaves, are all perfect.\n\nI can't exactly talk about dialogue without getting into gameplay. Because participating in conversations is one of the major points of gameplay. Like a Bioware or Tell Tale game you have multiple things you can say in conversations. You learn different things about the characters in each playthrough, because you don't have the time to stick around and keep chatting. You effect your relationships with your friends with rarely the chance to truly make amends. And I wont mention how your choices actually effect the ending. Because they do. And there's some mind melting endings you can dredge up. The other major point of gameplay is the radio. Using a Steam controller, I found the radio puzzles simple to solve, but in a third playthrough I found that solving them too fast cut off dialogue I hadn't heard. Moving around the map doesn't take too much time, the only part of the map I hate traversing is climbing up and down the radio tower... And there's only been one glitch I've encountered so far, and it's not gamebreaking.\n\nThe plot is deep. And while I say a couple endings are mind melting, the adventure you go on is what really makes Oxenfree spectacular. At every step there's character interaction, something to learn about the island, or the spirits toying with you. There has been so much detail and care put into the world that half way through your frist run you think you're piecing together what really happened, only to realize that while the spirits do have a story, they aren't the problem.\n\nOxenfree has a lot to offer, if you don't want to give the masterminds behind this beautiful game the twenty bucks they earned, you can wait for a sale. I wont judge. But aside from a few minor glitches that'll probly get fixed, and a lackluster collectathon I can't reccomend this game enough.","January 25","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a really good game if you want to ease into horror games; it's almost like a movie with a choose your own adventure twist. It's also a really neat game for people who can't play video games really well or don't want to fight in their games. Fighting seems to be a big thing in most horror games, and although this isn't the first game to do that, it's still a realitively fresh thing.\n\nThe story is actually pretty creative, although does carry a few tired tropes like  that Alex's brother is dead and she (and Clarisse) have to deal with it along with the spooky happenings  but it's not too distracting or even that bad. Most of the tropes are written so well I can't really say it's a bad thing, only that it's not original. Some things in the story seem a little dated, but again, it's not too distracting. It's a mostly timeless game yet it can take place in a pretty small span of years, which is hard to do. They take full advantage of this  by using smart phones to take pictures of the spooky spots and showing them in a polariod picture with the ghost in the background of the photo . It's not only an interesting disign, but also has a small role in world building.\n\nThe art is amazing. The backgrounds and sets: absolutely sets the mood. The little photos that are taken from time to time have a nice aesthetic feel to it. The character animations are wonderful: shifting, moving their hands, and walking realistically and showing emotion through body language rather than facial expressions.\n\nOne major problem I had with this game is the amount of talking, which is all written and voice acted perfectly, but can be pretty long and drawn out. If you're like me and are pretty distractable and/or get restless just sitting and reading/listening or moving from point A to point B without much action, you'll need to be in the right mood to play it. If lots of dialogue is you're thing, go for it. Otherwise, find another game that's more simulating.\n\nA small tip for the above issue: if things get too boring or slow, pause and walk around a bit, eat, splash water on your face, whatever. Just do things to break up the amount of time you're just sitting and reading/listening.","January 29","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story follows Alex in such a way to reveal important information about her and her situation without spelling it out for the player, and the player gets to know Jonas in the same way that Alex does. The game isn't *terrifying*, but I admit I was startled quite a few times while playing -- enough to keep me on my toes, but not too much to make me anxious about playing.\n\nThings I didn't like about the game? Well, there's not much to dislike, to be honest. I guess the speed at which the characters walk and climb objects is annoying, but a lot of the time, the dialogue fills in that space, and makes it less boring. The mechanics of the radio aren't super fun, either. It's an essential portion of the game, yet I had issues with the radio closing out when I was turning the dial, and making me repeat sequences of tunings over again. This, in itself, would be a harmless glitch if it didn't take forever to change the channel on the radio. It made discovering the "anomalies" disinteresting to me since it just took so long to walk to the rocks and then tune the radio to the right station. But maybe I'm just too impatient.\n\nA lot of choice-based games seem to streamline their endings (Life is Strange, one of my favorite games, is guilty of this); I didn't feel this was the case with Oxenfree. I felt like the things I said did have an impact on the game, and ultimately its end. And like I mentioned before, the voice acting was phenomenal. Personally, I would've been a bit more choked up about the situation than these characters were, but hey, to each their own. It's refreshing to play a storyline that doesn't have romance thrown in just to attract players -- Alex stands alone, and her relationship with other characters seems on a strictly platonic level. This means no gimmicky love crap, which I am sick of seeing! But honestly, this game was so well-executed that if they had thrown in a romantic interest for Alex, I don't think I would've been so bothered by it.\n\nSo what do I want to see more of? GAMES LIKE THIS. Real characters with interesting personalities, a gripping storyline, immersive sound effects, and simplistic yet gorgeous graphics make this game really come into its own. Night School Studio really delivered on this one, and I am already hoping to see them pursue other games of this style.\n\nAll in all, should you buy the game? For $20, I say go for it. You've got to be willing to listen to the story, though. Otherwise, what's the point?","January 30","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Two days if you take your time.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the character dynamics and mysteries of the island. There are some real moments that make just want to strangle a character or two, but to me that just underscores the quality of the writing. The dialogue is quite clean and natural sounding; however I decided to turn on subtitles as it helps with some of the conversions throughout the game.\n\nThere are a few technical issues I noticed though, like a somewhat sticky world when trying to go up stairs. Once, my character got stuck climbing, but then snapped to the top. Once I was with one character, but got the voice of another. Another problem is the choice bubbles are sometime off-screen if you're on an incline.\n\nThese issues are not deal breakers, but can certainly break immersion. Those issues aside, I enjoyed the game and definitely recommend it if you're in the market for a cerebral exploration game.","January 17","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueswoon/recommended/388880/","blueswoon","Swoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueswoon/","126 products in account","Loading this game up, and pressing start begins a journey that you can't comprehend with a single playthrough.\n\nAs an artist I want to begin with the visual beauty of this game. It's gorgeous. Every part of the island is unique and haunting while fitting the comicbook style visuals. Or should I say the 90s Saturday morning cartoon style-of which you recorded on a single vhs too many times and the magnetic strip started wearing out around the edges... It all meshes and adds to the atmosphere. It's eerie and scary without jumpscares and loud sounds.\n\nWhich rolls us into the audio; being the true genius of Oxenfree. I don't know much about the time period the radio tunes us in to, but the clips that were chosen, from old wailing poka to bugs bunny, are all set to make you feel off, to add to the atmosphere you're wandering through. The dialogue, and the warped hollow sounds of the spirits, and the whispers caught over the airwaves, are all perfect.\n\nI can't exactly talk about dialogue without getting into gameplay. Because participating in conversations is one of the major points of gameplay. Like a Bioware or Tell Tale game you have multiple things you can say in conversations. You learn different things about the characters in each playthrough, because you don't have the time to stick around and keep chatting. You effect your relationships with your friends with rarely the chance to truly make amends. And I wont mention how your choices actually effect the ending. Because they do. And there's some mind melting endings you can dredge up. The other major point of gameplay is the radio. Using a Steam controller, I found the radio puzzles simple to solve, but in a third playthrough I found that solving them too fast cut off dialogue I hadn't heard. Moving around the map doesn't take too much time, the only part of the map I hate traversing is climbing up and down the radio tower... And there's only been one glitch I've encountered so far, and it's not gamebreaking.\n\nThe plot is deep. And while I say a couple endings are mind melting, the adventure you go on is what really makes Oxenfree spectacular. At every step there's character interaction, something to learn about the island, or the spirits toying with you. There has been so much detail and care put into the world that half way through your frist run you think you're piecing together what really happened, only to realize that while the spirits do have a story, they aren't the problem.\n\nOxenfree has a lot to offer, if you don't want to give the masterminds behind this beautiful game the twenty bucks they earned, you can wait for a sale. I wont judge. But aside from a few minor glitches that'll probly get fixed, and a lackluster collectathon I can't reccomend this game enough.","January 25","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a side-scrolling, almost point-and-click psuedo-puzzle-thriller. I'm not really sure what to label it as, honestly - all I know is that I went into it unsure of what to expect, and wound up being completely drawn in by the visual effects, soundtrack, and beautiful art style. I wasn't quite prepared for the first time the screen went entirely fuzzy, filled with static, and then flipped around a few times. It was amazing.\n\nThe story is something that unfolds at a good pace, and character development feels very natural and compelling. There's a lot to be seen and experienced in the game, so it's worth a few playthroughs. I got through my first one around 4 hours or so; I plan on trying at least a few more, just to see what some of the other options do.\n\nI think the only complaint I have about the game lies in the controls; sometimes, they're a little wonky, and it can be hard to maneuver to a specific ledge or ladder or something without taking a few (unnecessary) tries to get it right. I found that playing the game with a controller rather than a mouse helped a lot, in that regard. I was thrown off a little by the speed of the text-box choices at first - you have to choose quickly, in most cases. However, that quickly faded, and choices were easy to make in instances of little time.\n\nAll in all, it's a game worth buying, and a game definitely worth playing for yourself rather than just watching!","January 20","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roahn/recommended/388880/","roahn","Roahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roahn/","236 products in account","Follow my Curator Group  here\n\nTitle: Oxenfree\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Xbox One\nRating: 13+\nDeveloper: Night School Studio\nPublisher: Night School Studio\nPrice: $20\nRelease Date: 15/1/16\n\nOxenfree is a narrative game made by Ex-Telltale Developers. It tells the story of these 5 senior high school teenagers who embark on an annual adventure to an island. Although this time things end up a little different.\n\nThe first thing to notice about this game is its graphics and art style. Its 2.5d and while at first glance I didn’t really take note of it, this glamorous style soon grew on me and some sections of the game just looked spectacular. Especially in the darker bits of the story.\n\nYou play as Alex, a girl who her personality is being controlled by you, even the past as you will learn through the flashbacks in the game. You can be a jerk to everyone or be everyone’s best friend. Its entirely up to you and this is what I found particularly amazing with the game, while the actual choices on what happens to the main plot isn’t that in depth and different as I could’ve hoped; the actual chemistry between the characters are completely different upon how you speak to them which will in turn change how they speak to you.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is mainly walking through the environments while talking to one or some of the querky, stereotypical, but somewhat unique characters. From Ren, your annoying best friend to Clarissa, your ‘‘friend’ who seems to have a grudge on you. Although how you handle it and the consequences is completely up to you. Its also the voice acting that completely seals the deal with these characters. I’ve heard these voices from some old Telltale games but they sounded different, but in a good way. The voices really made me think that these characters were real people and not just artificial intelligence running on a code.\n\nAnother part of the gameplay is its dialogue, which is how you talk to the characters. They appear on the screen and you click them as you move along through the environment as the characters talk, although I found that if you interact with something or press a dialogue prompt the person talking will stop. While it isn’t much of a big deal it annoyed me a little as I wanted to finish hearing someone talk but I wanted to say something too. Although most of the time this happened the dialogue was just ‘filler’ and didn’t tie in much with the main story.\n\nAnother grope I have with this game is how slow the beginning starts off as. I was getting bored but luckily not so bored to the extent that I was forcing myself through. Although I lost my boredom when I met all the characters and saw all the ‘beef’ between them in the first scene when they are all together. And then when the main plot is finally shown, I was hooked until the very end; even though I felt like my choices of how I were towards the characters were completely different in the end stats as I was being told the conclusion and future of these characters based on how I were towards them. But it didn’t matter much to me as this game is definitely more about the journey than it’s destination.\n\nOther than a somewhat disappointing score as I felt like the music could’ve been done better with some greater soundtracks due to the mystical and grand environments you find. This game is pretty wonderful. It has a great artstyle, story with amazing character development and voice acting, and a great world filled with lore which you will need to play again if you want to uncover everything about Edward’s Island. Even if the main plot choices are a bit lacking, and the dialogue could be interfaced better.\n\nWe give this game 4/5.","January 23","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a really good game if you want to ease into horror games; it's almost like a movie with a choose your own adventure twist. It's also a really neat game for people who can't play video games really well or don't want to fight in their games. Fighting seems to be a big thing in most horror games, and although this isn't the first game to do that, it's still a realitively fresh thing.\n\nThe story is actually pretty creative, although does carry a few tired tropes like  that Alex's brother is dead and she (and Clarisse) have to deal with it along with the spooky happenings  but it's not too distracting or even that bad. Most of the tropes are written so well I can't really say it's a bad thing, only that it's not original. Some things in the story seem a little dated, but again, it's not too distracting. It's a mostly timeless game yet it can take place in a pretty small span of years, which is hard to do. They take full advantage of this  by using smart phones to take pictures of the spooky spots and showing them in a polariod picture with the ghost in the background of the photo . It's not only an interesting disign, but also has a small role in world building.\n\nThe art is amazing. The backgrounds and sets: absolutely sets the mood. The little photos that are taken from time to time have a nice aesthetic feel to it. The character animations are wonderful: shifting, moving their hands, and walking realistically and showing emotion through body language rather than facial expressions.\n\nOne major problem I had with this game is the amount of talking, which is all written and voice acted perfectly, but can be pretty long and drawn out. If you're like me and are pretty distractable and/or get restless just sitting and reading/listening or moving from point A to point B without much action, you'll need to be in the right mood to play it. If lots of dialogue is you're thing, go for it. Otherwise, find another game that's more simulating.\n\nA small tip for the above issue: if things get too boring or slow, pause and walk around a bit, eat, splash water on your face, whatever. Just do things to break up the amount of time you're just sitting and reading/listening.","January 29","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story follows Alex in such a way to reveal important information about her and her situation without spelling it out for the player, and the player gets to know Jonas in the same way that Alex does. The game isn't *terrifying*, but I admit I was startled quite a few times while playing -- enough to keep me on my toes, but not too much to make me anxious about playing.\n\nThings I didn't like about the game? Well, there's not much to dislike, to be honest. I guess the speed at which the characters walk and climb objects is annoying, but a lot of the time, the dialogue fills in that space, and makes it less boring. The mechanics of the radio aren't super fun, either. It's an essential portion of the game, yet I had issues with the radio closing out when I was turning the dial, and making me repeat sequences of tunings over again. This, in itself, would be a harmless glitch if it didn't take forever to change the channel on the radio. It made discovering the "anomalies" disinteresting to me since it just took so long to walk to the rocks and then tune the radio to the right station. But maybe I'm just too impatient.\n\nA lot of choice-based games seem to streamline their endings (Life is Strange, one of my favorite games, is guilty of this); I didn't feel this was the case with Oxenfree. I felt like the things I said did have an impact on the game, and ultimately its end. And like I mentioned before, the voice acting was phenomenal. Personally, I would've been a bit more choked up about the situation than these characters were, but hey, to each their own. It's refreshing to play a storyline that doesn't have romance thrown in just to attract players -- Alex stands alone, and her relationship with other characters seems on a strictly platonic level. This means no gimmicky love crap, which I am sick of seeing! But honestly, this game was so well-executed that if they had thrown in a romantic interest for Alex, I don't think I would've been so bothered by it.\n\nSo what do I want to see more of? GAMES LIKE THIS. Real characters with interesting personalities, a gripping storyline, immersive sound effects, and simplistic yet gorgeous graphics make this game really come into its own. Night School Studio really delivered on this one, and I am already hoping to see them pursue other games of this style.\n\nAll in all, should you buy the game? For $20, I say go for it. You've got to be willing to listen to the story, though. Otherwise, what's the point?","January 30","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Two days if you take your time.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the character dynamics and mysteries of the island. There are some real moments that make just want to strangle a character or two, but to me that just underscores the quality of the writing. The dialogue is quite clean and natural sounding; however I decided to turn on subtitles as it helps with some of the conversions throughout the game.\n\nThere are a few technical issues I noticed though, like a somewhat sticky world when trying to go up stairs. Once, my character got stuck climbing, but then snapped to the top. Once I was with one character, but got the voice of another. Another problem is the choice bubbles are sometime off-screen if you're on an incline.\n\nThese issues are not deal breakers, but can certainly break immersion.

Like, a salt-rock. Seriously. Oxenfree is... Ambitious. This is one of the few positive things I can honestly say for it.\n\nIt has an interesting art style that, unfortunately, is hard to focus on given the extreme distance of the camera. Some finer details would have been nice, or zooming in on characters talking during appropriately important moments. The scenery is occasionally vibrant, but given that most of it is misty and vague, it leaves something to be desired. Oh, and the character animations were awkward as all get out.\n\nThe music was interesting, and I loved fiddling with the radio and finding bizarre tunes or clips straight out of history, but after a while it was repetitious and not a single piece really gripped me or kept me excited. The overall tone of the game was far too muted for far too long, and the rare moments of excitement, which were decently highlighted with cool effects both visual and auditory, did not make up for the periods of downtime (in a relatively short game I might add!).\n\nIt was fairly tedious to navigate the map, with no option to quickly travel from one important location to another once you'd discovered it and done a key thing there. I suppose that would have made the experience even thinner, but the rigors of zig-zagging in 2.5D up and down some really uninspired pathing kind of took its toll when the conversations dwindled away.\n\nThe writing itself felt... empty at times. It wasn't that it was poor, per se, or that there weren't interesting elements. Just that, despite the information overload of letters and clues, or conversations and experiences, I never felt particularly attached to the island or the characters. It was a bit like going to a museum with strangers. Strangers who were kind of irritating, more often than not. Some of the moments were fairly genuine, and I liked being a smart aleck, and warming up to whoever I could, but it still felt... underdeveloped.\n\nThen, there's the voice acting. Alex, the main character, was fairly well done! But I think the other characters were a little lacking overall. The recordings were all pretty loud, and felt isolated from their setting. While the idea of being able to walk and talk is nice, and interrupting characters feels a touch more natural than how some games handle the intricacies of conversation, it just fell as flat as pretty much everything else in the game.\n\nOh, and the animations again added a kind dissonance, where characters would be talking to you from a pretty far distance if you didn't follow them around or wanted to look at something else while keeping track of the conversation thread. I can understand speaking across a room, but maybe recognize and pause for a moment when they decide to walk out the door on me? Or don't have them stray too far. Once, I even had a character insist I do a certain action while standing in the complete wrong spot and even bugging it out for me. I couldn't move, once I chose to interact with the thing, and she didn't arrive and join me to finish it. I had to restart from entering that particular screen (another saving grace might have been the ability to manually save).\n\nAll in all, I really wanted more from this. It's got hooks. It's got promise. But it doesn't really deliver. I still think it's worth a purchase, and I don't really regret the experience, but it does frustrate me. Keep your expectations in check, and it will probably satisfy you.","January 18","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has the emotional core of Life is Strange and a similar story structure of Until Dawn. The result is a delightfully non-threatening cosmic horror adventure game. Few jumpscares await you. It is visually stunning and I adore the watercolour art style. It helps to build the world of Edwards Island: desolate albeit rich in beauty and mystery, which shines even in its supposedly mundane moments. The dialogues grab you early on and continues to shine in many key parts of this branching story, especially in moments when you least expect it. And of course, the sound design, soundtrack and voice acting is very important to this game, and they delivered perfectly. An absolute treat for both the ears and the eyes, and anyone with an unhealthy obsession with triangles. However, the story is not mind-blowing, but the writing is nonetheless decent in delivering its premise, though it could be paced better.

Oxenfree it is absolutely what I love in a game, great atmosphere, it is an EXPERIENCE, you are taken on a journey. THIS is art.\n\nThe game is a bit like Life is Strange in tone if it had more beleivable characters and much, MUCH better voice acting. Speaking of voice acting, the conversation system this game has is one of the best I've seen, you chime in during another characters dialogue in response to something they're saying. You can just ignore the conversation though and walk around doing whatever, even if they're talking right to you, you can let it hang. It makes the dialogue feel much more organic.\n\nAgain, the game slows down a bit at the ending, not to the degree Life is Strange did, the ending is still fairly strong, but the best parts are definitely when the whole crew is together early game having those organic conversations you chime in on and direct. Truth or Slap, the game at the beginning, was my favorite part.\n\nFor a debut title they did a very good job, this charming title was delivered very well and I can't wait to see more games from this publisher in the future.","January 18","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the teen drama, even if it felt a little forced, and I enjoyed each characters personality. The art and overall scenes were amazing and the voices, pure brilliance. The only negative thing I could say about this game is that it felt very limited in where you could go and what you can do, for example choosing someone to go with you, or even having conversations with them. You couldn't initiate them or choose when to talk, you were prompted. Having save slots/files would be welcomed warmly here too, I really dont feel like going through the whole game again just to unlock a few achievments. For what it's worth I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of a read and likes to choose their own path and their relationships with others. I hope to see more of these games later on, and maybe a dlc wouldn't be too bad either.","February 2","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creepy (but not too bad), atmospheric and charming. The dialogue makes you really invested in the characters, and the game mechanics are really neat. The score is fantastic, really sets the tone. This is one of those games that rewards being thorough, so look at everything. And your choice of dialogue actually affects the outcomes, so choose wisely (but be quick).\n\nThis one may even be worth another play-through. It's not very long, maybe 3-6 hours. Best played all in on go, so set aside a good amount of time. If you leave the game early, you'll probably end up repeating a few things.\n\nWould recommened this to anyone who like story driven games. Not for the action-loving types. If I had to name something that I think could have been improved on, I would have liked the ending (before the epilogue) to have been a bit more clear/explainy/revelatory.

While the 3D characters in a mostly 2D space can look very charming, there are some areas where it gets hard to move around as you're not sure if the game wants you to go up or sideways. Sometimes the characters have uncomfortably long gaps between their lines, breaking up the immersion a bit. And some of the dialogue prompts fade so quickly that they're gone before you've read all the choices. But these are minor annoyances. The game itself has a solid story that really sucks you in and makes up for any of the above.\n\nI've got some issues with the ending(s), but nevertheless, it's got plenty of replay value. It seems like you could get a whole lot of new and different dialogue by making different choices.

Great story with brilliant voice acting.\n\nMy gripes are two:\n\n1. The text bubbles are white font with light green backgrounds - making them very hard to read. In situations where you sometimes have to react quickly, this is a huge annoyance which shouldn't even be a problem. Black font would have fixed this; no idea why they chose to make the text white.\n\n2. This one may just be me, but I would have appreciated a zoom feature. Being able to get a close up of the characters and backgrounds would be a nice feature. The wide shots are great for establishing the scenery, but I just want to zoom in every once in awhile to get a closer look.\n\nOther than those two things, this is a superb game.

An actual solid, well thought out, immersive, greatly detailed video game. The idea of the core gameplay itself is refreshing and flatout brilliant in its execution. Memorable characters with excellent voice actors that get lost in the world of their roles (always a plus), great level design, solid and easy to understand gameplay mechanics, an atmosphere that draws me in, an amazing soundtrack, and a storyline that keeps me guessing and wanting to continue on my journey - all of these aspects has probably put this game into my top 10 games of all time. Maybe even my top 5!\n\nSeriously, for such a simple game, yet with such a complex and brilliant presentation, it EASILY competes with many games that have been developed by big name developers and publishers out there. It's masterful is what it is! Well, maybe not masterful. There's this latency issue where the game slows down and lags for some odd reason. Whether this is an optimization error or what, I have no idea. Thankfully, it doesn't happen too often and it might be just an issue on my end. But that's not my main gripe.\n\nMy main gripe is the multi-choice character dialogue. When I choose a statement the character says something that isn't what I was expecting. As I result I keep reloading the scenes just to choose the one I intended. It has the BioWare thing going on. But that's minor compared to the true brilliance of this game; brilliance that I am about to reveal to you.\n\nUnlike BioWare and their games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age (or any game with multiple choice dialogue), in Oxenfree, when you're in a conversation, your response can just be... nothing... NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! YES! THANK YOU, OXENFREE! For once when characters are bickering with each other I can just stay quiet and reserve my responses! I don't have to choose an option! I don't have to force my character's input on others! And that's why I love this game so much! My overall involvment, or lack there of, feels so much more real and engaging for me when I can just listen a conversation out and add my input in when it is necessary!

Everything, from the aesthetics, to the acting, to the story, is positively perfect.\n\nI know there will be detractors; there always is. But Oxenfree set out to do one thing, and one thing only: It set out to create a modest yet masterful thriller adventure, with killer unique aesthetics, good characters and a legitimately effective atmosphere.\n\nIt did all that and so much more.\n\nMy one and only complaint is that I didn't have more of it. I rarely feel this; I'm okay with games on the shorter end of the spectrum -- one or two hour games are fine by me, and Oxenfree lasted me for about 7 hours -- but this atmosphere and context was so well done that I feel the writer could have come up with a couple more roundabouts particularly toward the middle of the story. I realize more lines of dialogue to record means more money that must be used to pay the actors and I absolutely don't hold it against Night School Studio.\n\nUltimately, it was the right choice to keep it short and simple, as opposed to overambitious and suffering from feature creep.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Oxenfree thoroughly and I can't wait to jump back in and see what else can happen in the game's dynamic ending.

Between the great voice acting, creative story, and relatable characters, Oxenfree is a real gem, worthy of a few playthroughs.\n\nThe art style is quite nice, reminiscent of older animated movies and television shows from the late 90's and early 2000's. Backgrounds have a painted, rich feeling that really makes the map lovely to explore. The characters art is simple, but unique, drawing an image for the character, but not setting them into an archetype. This game is really wonderful to look at. The antagonist spirits appear as shadows, punctuated with partial red outline that gives them a certain alien feeling of wrongness. Overall the art sets the feeling of the game wonderfully and helps to draw in the player right off the bat.\n\nThe story and dialog are really inspired and very well done. At no point do the characters really become stereotypes, although a few characters aren't completely fleshed out, by the end. Exposition is carried out tastefully and naturally. Natural is actually a very good word for describing the majority of the dialog in the game, it feels normal, the conversations feel like conversations that real teenagers would have. Lately, some games with characters around this age have tried to shoehorn in pop culture references that often feel contrived and awkward. Oxenfree doesn't try this, opting to instead have the characters interact like normal people. Bolstered by some fantastic voice acting, the script is wonderful. The story is involving and smart, tying the characters together and moving forward at a good pace. Combined with optional collectibles scattered around the map, the story really builds the history of the island and surrounding towns into something memorable.\n\nIn terms of gameplay and puzzles, Oxenfree plays it simple and safe. Controls are basic, although traversing the map can get a little slow. The scenery is usually attractive enough to make the jogs between areas at worst acceptable, and at best a joy. The game is verging on being a walking simulator, with all of the puzzles being very simply moving the mouse left or right. Different dialog options and endings make the game's replayability high, along with finding all of the collectibles that aren't required, but help to complete the world.\n\nThe score for the game is fantastic, matching the mood perfectly, the soundtrack for this game goes up there with Transistor and Bastion as some of my favorite videogame music.\n\nWithout gathering collectibles, the game will take around 2-4 hours to complete for one playthrough, with another hour or so for gathering the collectibles. The game, in my opinion, deserves at least 2 full playthroughs, as there are many different possible endings and choices that can be made.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nPros:\n-gorgeous art\n-great voice acting\n-wonderful story and dialog\n-good atmosphere\n-beautiful music\n\nCons:\n-very simple puzzles\n-slow movement makes for a little slogging\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Superbrothers:Swords and Sworcery and Kentucky Route Zero.","February 7","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Memorable characters with excellent voice actors that get lost in the world of their roles (always a plus), great level design, solid and easy to understand gameplay mechanics, an atmosphere that draws me in, an amazing soundtrack, and a storyline that keeps me guessing and wanting to continue on my journey - all of these aspects has probably put this game into my top 10 games of all time. Maybe even my top 5!\n\nSeriously, for such a simple game, yet with such a complex and brilliant presentation, it EASILY competes with many games that have been developed by big name developers and publishers out there. It's masterful is what it is! Well, maybe not masterful. There's this latency issue where the game slows down and lags for some odd reason. Whether this is an optimization error or what, I have no idea. Thankfully, it doesn't happen too often and it might be just an issue on my end. But that's not my main gripe.\n\nMy main gripe is the multi-choice character dialogue. When I choose a statement the character says something that isn't what I was expecting. As I result I keep reloading the scenes just to choose the one I intended. It has the BioWare thing going on. But that's minor compared to the true brilliance of this game; brilliance that I am about to reveal to you.\n\nUnlike BioWare and their games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age (or any game with multiple choice dialogue), in Oxenfree, when you're in a conversation, your response can just be... nothing... NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! YES! THANK YOU, OXENFREE! For once when characters are bickering with each other I can just stay quiet and reserve my responses! I don't have to choose an option! I don't have to force my character's input on others! And that's why I love this game so much! My overall involvment, or lack there of, feels so much more real and engaging for me when I can just listen a conversation out and add my input in when it is necessary! Absolutely GENIUS!!!\n\nA big ol' 10/10, would buy another copy and give to a friend!","February 7","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/388880/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","Oxenfree tells an unconventional story about loss and friendship, as seen through the eyes of a teenager and her group of unsuspecting friends. It starts out innocently enough, on a boat headed to an isolated island for an overnight party. However, once things start to get weird, they get satisfyingly really weird, and the supernatural events quickly become engrossing. Rewinds, time loops, possessions, visions; all are handled in a fascinating way.\n\nThe overall smooth execution make this a must-play title for players who enjoy narrative-rich experiences without the fuss of complex interactions. Though it is sometimes unclear what consequences your choices will have, the game constantly progresses in a pleasant, steady rhythm.\n\nWhile it looks positively great, its sound production in particular is brilliantly beyond anything else in its category. The voice actors all do a splendid job and render each character unconditionally believable, down to every stutter or natural hesitation. All of this is heightened by a haunting score and chilling sound effects.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that its text options disappear all too quickly. Considering they're the bulk of your interactions in the world, it's pretty upsetting. If you select a choice too soon, you'll often interrupt someone, but not always. If you don't act fast enough, you will forever lose your opportunity to engage in that moment. This inconsistency initially sparked strong disappointment, but it becomes manageable once you get used to it. Also worth nothing that there is no wrong answer, and choosing not to say anything is also a valid option.\n\nThere is not much in terms of puzzles to solve. Tuning into the right radio frequency is always just a guess, and although it feels very innovative at first it loses a bit of its charm along the way. I wish there was something more logical to it, instead of just scanning the band left and right until something happens.\n\nOxenfree offers some collectibles, of which anomalies appear entirely pointless, whereas lost letters provide interesting context and enrich the narrative. I'm never a fan of those and wish these elements had been delivered in a more integral manner. A useful map keeps track of your current objective, or rather destination, and unless the player intends to collect stuff there's never any need to stray from the main linear path.\n\nIts disquieting ending fits the theme almost too perfectly. It left me feeling slightly depressed, as most thorough introspective stories tend to do temporarily. It is positively short, in that it doesn't overstay its welcome. I am satisfied with a single playthrough but the game does offer multiple ending variations, which I was curious enough to look up on the web. If this was a book I'd read it. If this was a movie or TV series I'd watch it.","March 26","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueswoon/recommended/388880/","blueswoon","Swoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueswoon/","126 products in account","Loading this game up, and pressing start begins a journey that you can't comprehend with a single playthrough.\n\nAs an artist I want to begin with the visual beauty of this game. It's gorgeous. Every part of the island is unique and haunting while fitting the comicbook style visuals. Or should I say the 90s Saturday morning cartoon style-of which you recorded on a single vhs too many times and the magnetic strip started wearing out around the edges... It all meshes and adds to the atmosphere. It's eerie and scary without jumpscares and loud sounds.\n\nWhich rolls us into the audio; being the true genius of Oxenfree. I don't know much about the time period the radio tunes us in to, but the clips that were chosen, from old wailing poka to bugs bunny, are all set to make you feel off, to add to the atmosphere you're wandering through. The dialogue, and the warped hollow sounds of the spirits, and the whispers caught over the airwaves, are all perfect.\n\nI can't exactly talk about dialogue without getting into gameplay. Because participating in conversations is one of the major points of gameplay. Like a Bioware or Tell Tale game you have multiple things you can say in conversations. You learn different things about the characters in each playthrough, because you don't have the time to stick around and keep chatting. You effect your relationships with your friends with rarely the chance to truly make amends. And I wont mention how your choices actually effect the ending. Because they do. And there's some mind melting endings you can dredge up. The other major point of gameplay is the radio. Using a Steam controller, I found the radio puzzles simple to solve, but in a third playthrough I found that solving them too fast cut off dialogue I hadn't heard. Moving around the map doesn't take too much time, the only part of the map I hate traversing is climbing up and down the radio tower... And there's only been one glitch I've encountered so far, and it's not gamebreaking.\n\nThe plot is deep. And while I say a couple endings are mind melting, the adventure you go on is what really makes Oxenfree spectacular. At every step there's character interaction, something to learn about the island, or the spirits toying with you. There has been so much detail and care put into the world that half way through your frist run you think you're piecing together what really happened, only to realize that while the spirits do have a story, they aren't the problem.\n\nOxenfree has a lot to offer, if you don't want to give the masterminds behind this beautiful game the twenty bucks they earned, you can wait for a sale. I wont judge. But aside from a few minor glitches that'll probly get fixed, and a lackluster collectathon I can't reccomend this game enough.","January 25","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With fascinating dialogue, beautiful art and a very immersive world, this is a game you have got to play. The eerie nature of this game makes it unique, the characters are all likeable bar one or two predictiable developments, however these do not down grade this game. A game similiar to telltale games, although with this you really do feel like you are a character and that your decisions affect the end game. This becomes apparent on a second, third or fourth playthrough.\n\nBelieve me, as soon as I completed my first run through, I wanted to immediately start again. There is so much to this game you cannot not play more than once.\n\nFor sure, Oxenfree is a game of the year contender already. It is a real diamond.

Creepy (but not too bad), atmospheric and charming. The dialogue makes you really invested in the characters, and the game mechanics are really neat. The score is fantastic, really sets the tone. This is one of those games that rewards being thorough, so look at everything. And your choice of dialogue actually affects the outcomes, so choose wisely (but be quick).\n\nThis one may even be worth another play-through. It's not very long, maybe 3-6 hours. Best played all in on go, so set aside a good amount of time. If you leave the game early, you'll probably end up repeating a few things.\n\nWould recommened this to anyone who like story driven games. Not for the action-loving types. If I had to name something that I think could have been improved on, I would have liked the ending (before the epilogue) to have been a bit more clear/explainy/revelatory. But it's very possible I just missed something the first time through, and the epilogue was great, so I'm not really going to complain.","January 21","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It meshes the aesthetic of Life is Strange with the overarching unease and mood of Over the Garden Wall, with a tinge of Until Dawn to create a simple, but thoroughly enjoyable and visually beautiful game. The spooky moments tie in really excellently into the mechanics of the game, and don't rely on jump scares or gore to be frightening, making it enjoyable for fans of the horror genre while also not being too intense for the more gentle-hearted. What I really enjoy, however, is the way the dialogue is handled--a lot of people complain that it goes too fast to click sometimes, but to me that makes it seem more natural--you don't have time to deeply contemplate your dialogue choices, so you just have to say something quick and hope it's good, just like talking to real people.\nIf you're a fan of narrative games and are looking for a new game that won't take too much of your time, I cannot reccommend this enough.

It's a really good game if you want to ease into horror games; it's almost like a movie with a choose your own adventure twist. It's also a really neat game for people who can't play video games really well or don't want to fight in their games. Fighting seems to be a big thing in most horror games, and although this isn't the first game to do that, it's still a realitively fresh thing.\n\nThe story is actually pretty creative, although does carry a few tired tropes like  that Alex's brother is dead and she (and Clarisse) have to deal with it along with the spooky happenings  but it's not too distracting or even that bad. Most of the tropes are written so well I can't really say it's a bad thing, only that it's not original. Some things in the story seem a little dated, but again, it's not too distracting. It's a mostly timeless game yet it can take place in a pretty small span of years, which is hard to do. They take full advantage of this  by using smart phones to take pictures of the spooky spots and showing them in a polariod picture with the ghost in the background of the photo . It's not only an interesting disign, but also has a small role in world building.\n\nThe art is amazing. The backgrounds and sets: absolutely sets the mood. The little photos that are taken from time to time have a nice aesthetic feel to it. The character animations are wonderful: shifting, moving their hands, and walking realistically and showing emotion through body language rather than facial expressions.\n\nOne major problem I had with this game is the amount of talking, which is all written and voice acted perfectly, but can be pretty long and drawn out. If you're like me and are pretty distractable and/or get restless just sitting and reading/listening or moving from point A to point B without much action, you'll need to be in the right mood to play it. If lots of dialogue is you're thing, go for it. Otherwise, find another game that's more simulating.\n\nA small tip for the above issue: if things get too boring or slow, pause and walk around a bit, eat, splash water on your face, whatever. Just do things to break up the amount of time you're just sitting and reading/listening.","January 29","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story follows Alex in such a way to reveal important information about her and her situation without spelling it out for the player, and the player gets to know Jonas in the same way that Alex does. The game isn't *terrifying*, but I admit I was startled quite a few times while playing -- enough to keep me on my toes, but not too much to make me anxious about playing.\n\nThings I didn't like about the game? Well, there's not much to dislike, to be honest. I guess the speed at which the characters walk and climb objects is annoying, but a lot of the time, the dialogue fills in that space, and makes it less boring. The mechanics of the radio aren't super fun, either. It's an essential portion of the game, yet I had issues with the radio closing out when I was turning the dial, and making me repeat sequences of tunings over again. This, in itself, would be a harmless glitch if it didn't take forever to change the channel on the radio. It made discovering the "anomalies" disinteresting to me since it just took so long to walk to the rocks and then tune the radio to the right station. But maybe I'm just too impatient.\n\nA lot of choice-based games seem to streamline their endings (Life is Strange, one of my favorite games, is guilty of this); I didn't feel this was the case with Oxenfree. I felt like the things I said did have an impact on the game, and ultimately its end. And like I mentioned before, the voice acting was phenomenal. Personally, I would've been a bit more choked up about the situation than these characters were, but hey, to each their own. It's refreshing to play a storyline that doesn't have romance thrown in just to attract players -- Alex stands alone, and her relationship with other characters seems on a strictly platonic level. This means no gimmicky love crap, which I am sick of seeing! But honestly, this game was so well-executed that if they had thrown in a romantic interest for Alex, I don't think I would've been so bothered by it.\n\nSo what do I want to see more of? GAMES LIKE THIS. Real characters with interesting personalities, a gripping storyline, immersive sound effects, and simplistic yet gorgeous graphics make this game really come into its own. Night School Studio really delivered on this one, and I am already hoping to see them pursue other games of this style.\n\nAll in all, should you buy the game? For $20, I say go for it. You've got to be willing to listen to the story, though. Otherwise, what's the point?","January 30","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes place on a fairly small island, which you will explore as Alex with a few intriguing side characters. The dialogue between these characters is basically all this game has to offer outside of it's main story, as it's pretty much all you do in between the story progressions. Thankfully the dialogue is great, all the characters are interesting in their own way, although they feel a bit one dimensional at times.\nThe voice acting is great for the most part, I really enjoyed it during the random dialogue, but it fell short on some of the more serious situations, clearly lacking the emotion you'd expect.\n\nThe dialogue system works really well. It lets you choose between a few options and when to say it, in a limited time. It has been implemented well, so it feels a lot more like real conversations compared to most other games.\n\nThe main problem with the game is it's price. It only takes 4-6 hours to complete, and has limited replayability. Sure, there's a few times where you can bring a different companion, or say different things, but that's too far in between for my liking, not to mention the long walks with dialogue you've already heard once before.\nThat said, I do not regret buying this at almost full price, but if you're not super into the story telling games, then I'd recommend waiting for a sale.","February 13","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI pathing is shoddy at times, for some reason only one character can interact with certain paths at a time. It's a minor problem, but it hurts the immersion.\n\n2. There are a lot of little things in the game you can notice, but the dialogue and plot push you to look past them. Again, a minor issue, but it feels like the devs want you to interact with everything and find the little hidden things and then the plot contradicts that.\n\n3. The cool thing about the dialogue is that the options can interrupt NPC dialogue, it's a great idea, but as with most inventive ideas in the gaming industry, it's not executed perfectly. Occasionally, you will be forced to choose a dialogue option due to a time limit, even though you want to keep listening to the NPC's, or you'll press a dialogue option before an NPC starts speaking and you'll miss out that way. Good idea, decent execution. Again, only a minor detractor.\n\nEssentially, this is a really good story driven game. It's somewhat short, but has replayability through its branching story.

Loved the graphic style and voice acting, and the story was really satisfying (although that's definitely going to be a subjective thing).\n\nThe dialogue system requires a bit of patience if you want to hear as much of the conversations as possible, and waiting too long sometimes means you miss the chance to make a dialogue choice since a lot of them are designed with the idea that no response is a valid option. Also, some choices will interrupt the conversation, others won't, and I didn't see anything that would indicate one way or another.\nThere's also a few points where the characters get really naggy if you don't instantly do a thing, even when you're already attempting to do the thing and it actually takes a few seconds to make it work. Or the game is a little slow to tell you what key you need to press.\n\nLack of key rebinding was a bit annoying. I use a Dvorak keyboard, and while it's not exactly hard to switch the layout to QWERTY it's really stupid that I had to.\n\nSome people are going to find this replayable, others not so much, particularly if you explore and collect a lot in the first playthrough. I'd say any replays probably need to be done at about the same pace as the first to really build the story again.\n\nOverall, I loved it, and I'll replay it again but not straight away.

Between the great voice acting, creative story, and relatable characters, Oxenfree is a real gem, worthy of a few playthroughs.\n\nThe art style is quite nice, reminiscent of older animated movies and television shows from the late 90's and early 2000's. Backgrounds have a painted, rich feeling that really makes the map lovely to explore. The characters art is simple, but unique, drawing an image for the character, but not setting them into an archetype. This game is really wonderful to look at. The antagonist spirits appear as shadows, punctuated with partial red outline that gives them a certain alien feeling of wrongness. Overall the art sets the feeling of the game wonderfully and helps to draw in the player right off the bat.\n\nThe story and dialog are really inspired and very well done. At no point do the characters really become stereotypes, although a few characters aren't completely fleshed out, by the end. Exposition is carried out tastefully and naturally. Natural is actually a very good word for describing the majority of the dialog in the game, it feels normal, the conversations feel like conversations that real teenagers would have. Lately, some games with characters around this age have tried to shoehorn in pop culture references that often feel contrived and awkward. Oxenfree doesn't try this, opting to instead have the characters interact like normal people. Bolstered by some fantastic voice acting, the script is wonderful. The story is involving and smart, tying the characters together and moving forward at a good pace. Combined with optional collectibles scattered around the map, the story really builds the history of the island and surrounding towns into something memorable.\n\nIn terms of gameplay and puzzles, Oxenfree plays it simple and safe. Controls are basic, although traversing the map can get a little slow. The scenery is usually attractive enough to make the jogs between areas at worst acceptable, and at best a joy. The game is verging on being a walking simulator, with all of the puzzles being very simply moving the mouse left or right. Different dialog options and endings make the game's replayability high, along with finding all of the collectibles that aren't required, but help to complete the world.\n\nThe score for the game is fantastic, matching the mood perfectly, the soundtrack for this game goes up there with Transistor and Bastion as some of my favorite videogame music.\n\nWithout gathering collectibles, the game will take around 2-4 hours to complete for one playthrough, with another hour or so for gathering the collectibles. The game, in my opinion, deserves at least 2 full playthroughs, as there are many different possible endings and choices that can be made.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nPros:\n-gorgeous art\n-great voice acting\n-wonderful story and dialog\n-good atmosphere\n-beautiful music\n\nCons:\n-very simple puzzles\n-slow movement makes for a little slogging\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Superbrothers:Swords and Sworcery and Kentucky Route Zero.","February 7","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also appreciate the fixed camera view which helps to capture the scenery very well. My only issue is the irregular movement speed.

Walking around using WASD, using shift to control the radio, ctrl for map. While the game could have been a  point-and-click adventure, I felt that using WASD controls connected you a bit more to the characters. Quirky and spectacular moments hold other control schemes, but to give them away is to destroy the curiosity they deliver.\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot is well laid out and flows well, never making dull moments take too long. I wasn't sure whether to classify this as a 'scary' game, as while I feel that there are definitely elements of horror within the game the relative atmosphere this gives off is much lighter. Characters continuously joke around, and in the end it feels more like an adventure that develops through teenage angst and determination to make their own decisions then anything extremely sinister. My one critique of the writing would be that several intense moments are followed by a half-hearted "OH NO", when a real person would be freaking out a lot more. Other then these specific moments, however, the voice-overs are spot on and represent their character's very well.\n\nMusic\n\nMusic makes or breaks a game like this, and I am happy to say that SCNTFC did a great job putting the soundtrack together. Whether you're on a beach or a dark foreboding cave the sound design encapsulates the moments and pulls the player in. I would say more to praise the sound, however this game heavily relies upon it and I would not like to spoil anything.\n\nOverall\n\nThe game is a well rounded jaunt on an island full of secrets, and while the voice-overs miss a beat here and there the polish and absolute love that was poured all over this game is well worth the price.","January 20","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved the graphic style and voice acting, and the story was really satisfying (although that's definitely going to be a subjective thing).\n\nThe dialogue system requires a bit of patience if you want to hear as much of the conversations as possible, and waiting too long sometimes means you miss the chance to make a dialogue choice since a lot of them are designed with the idea that no response is a valid option. Also, some choices will interrupt the conversation, others won't, and I didn't see anything that would indicate one way or another.\nThere's also a few points where the characters get really naggy if you don't instantly do a thing, even when you're already attempting to do the thing and it actually takes a few seconds to make it work. Or the game is a little slow to tell you what key you need to press.\n\nLack of key rebinding was a bit annoying. I use a Dvorak keyboard, and while it's not exactly hard to switch the layout to QWERTY it's really stupid that I had to.\n\nSome people are going to find this replayable, others not so much, particularly if you explore and collect a lot in the first playthrough. I'd say any replays probably need to be done at about the same pace as the first to really build the story again.\n\nOverall, I loved it, and I'll replay it again but not straight away.

There's not anything quite like it. To compare it to teen horror flicks is a little bit of an injustice, and it is far from a simple adventure game. Your choices do matter in this game, and the dialogue with your compatriots in the mystery can affect their perception of you as a whole. The game indicates it in a simple but effective way, and you can see how the things your friends say can also come across with the others as well. I found myself reloading the game just to see how particular scenarios would play out, and I don't find myself in that place often. It really felt like a deep experience I could have mistaken for a AAA title, and in the most amazing way, it reminded me of the often imitated but seldom done well experience of a choose your own adventure book, particularly the memories I have of the Goosebumps choice novels I read growing up.\n\nThis game is well worth the money and I will be revisiting it to see what else my choices can change within the game's haunting world.","February 22","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes place on a fairly small island, which you will explore as Alex with a few intriguing side characters. The dialogue between these characters is basically all this game has to offer outside of it's main story, as it's pretty much all you do in between the story progressions. Thankfully the dialogue is great, all the characters are interesting in their own way, although they feel a bit one dimensional at times.\nThe voice acting is great for the most part, I really enjoyed it during the random dialogue, but it fell short on some of the more serious situations, clearly lacking the emotion you'd expect.\n\nThe dialogue system works really well. It lets you choose between a few options and when to say it, in a limited time. It has been implemented well, so it feels a lot more like real conversations compared to most other games.\n\nThe main problem with the game is it's price. It only takes 4-6 hours to complete, and has limited replayability. Sure, there's a few times where you can bring a different companion, or say different things, but that's too far in between for my liking, not to mention the long walks with dialogue you've already heard once before.\nThat said, I do not regret buying this at almost full price, but if you're not super into the story telling games, then I'd recommend waiting for a sale.","February 13","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I can safely say that i got what I was expecting, this game is well worth it's full price!\n\nYou play as Alex, a young girl who is spending the night with some friends on a small island, that once housed a military base. Armed with a radio, you accidently open a mysterious gift, that unleashes ghosts from the past. Now, it's up to you, to survive the night, find your friends, and escape the growing nightmare!\n\nWhile I can't say it's the most graphically impressive Indie game i've played, it manages to have some great artwork, that matches the style and gameplay. The characters are all very good, and portrayed with great voice acting. the story itself manages to remain genuinely interesting throught, despite some cliche's sprinkled throught. While I won't spoil the ending, I can say, that I had a genuine sense of satisfaction with the ending, and seeing that my choices had real impact.\n\nThe only blatant negative's that I can find, are that it can be slow at times, with how fast the character's move around the map, but that was solved with some very well written dialogue, and some heartfelt characters moments. The worst thing for me, was that the game can bug out sometimes, leading one to restart an area over again.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that "Oxenfree" is a truly great game, filled with great characters and dialogue, a truly unsettiling atmosphere in certain parts, and a satisfying ending. I would easily reccommend this game to all my friends, or at least to those who love a good adventure/mystery story!\n\nMy final rank for this game would be very solid: 9/10","May 22","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great story with brilliant voice acting.\n\nMy gripes are two:\n\n1. The text bubbles are white font with light green backgrounds - making them very hard to read. In situations where you sometimes have to react quickly, this is a huge annoyance which shouldn't even be a problem. Black font would have fixed this; no idea why they chose to make the text white.\n\n2. This one may just be me, but I would have appreciated a zoom feature. Being able to get a close up of the characters and backgrounds would be a nice feature. The wide shots are great for establishing the scenery, but I just want to zoom in every once in awhile to get a closer look.\n\nOther than those two things, this is a superb game. A bit short with only a 4-hour playtime, but that's probably for the best - keeps the narrative tight and without needless fetch-quests and item hunts.\n\nDefinitely recommend this to anyone who likes story and dialogue heavy games.","February 8","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An actual solid, well thought out, immersive, greatly detailed video game. The idea of the core gameplay itself is refreshing and flatout brilliant in its execution. Memorable characters with excellent voice actors that get lost in the world of their roles (always a plus), great level design, solid and easy to understand gameplay mechanics, an atmosphere that draws me in, an amazing soundtrack, and a storyline that keeps me guessing and wanting to continue on my journey - all of these aspects has probably put this game into my top 10 games of all time. Maybe even my top 5!\n\nSeriously, for such a simple game, yet with such a complex and brilliant presentation, it EASILY competes with many games that have been developed by big name developers and publishers out there. It's masterful is what it is! Well, maybe not masterful. There's this latency issue where the game slows down and lags for some odd reason. Whether this is an optimization error or what, I have no idea. Thankfully, it doesn't happen too often and it might be just an issue on my end. But that's not my main gripe.\n\nMy main gripe is the multi-choice character dialogue. When I choose a statement the character says something that isn't what I was expecting. As I result I keep reloading the scenes just to choose the one I intended. It has the BioWare thing going on. But that's minor compared to the true brilliance of this game; brilliance that I am about to reveal to you.\n\nUnlike BioWare and their games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age (or any game with multiple choice dialogue), in Oxenfree, when you're in a conversation, your response can just be... nothing... NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! YES! THANK YOU, OXENFREE! For once when characters are bickering with each other I can just stay quiet and reserve my responses! I don't have to choose an option! I don't have to force my character's input on others! And that's why I love this game so much! My overall involvment, or lack there of, feels so much more real and engaging for me when I can just listen a conversation out and add my input in when it is necessary!

As soon as I started watching a play through for this on YouTube I had to search it out. I knew it would be my kind of game and I was right. I don't know why a lot of people were saying that the kids in the game were annoying, I found them to be quite normal and if you didn't choose to play the game as a nasty person, then the conversations and interactions were enjoyable.\n\nI really didn't want this game to end. It looks beautiful, I found myself wishing that I had created something like this myself. It had a magical feel which had an honestly creepy element as well. The story was intriguing, and I could have played for hours. Even though you had to travel through the same parts of the map a few times, there was always enough going on to make it different each time so these repeats didn't feel tedious or played out.\n\nI'm now waiting a while so I can forget some of the gameplay in order for me to go back in and try playing differently. Maybe not be so nice of a character this time and see how that goes. I can't wait to see what the developers come up with after this.

If you liked either of those to games, or like a short game that will tell a greate little story, then play this.\n\nThis game is very story based, and there is little gameplay, hoever I would not call this a walking simulator. I stand by my comparison of Kentucky Route Zero as it plays very similarly. The gameplay mainly consists of looking at a map to walk from A to B, and solving some really simple "puzzles" to progress. These puzzles are more along the lines of "The door is locked, pick up the key on the floor in plain sight and use it" type of puzzle rather than any sort of headscratcher. The mechanics work well with the game, and don't break flow from the story. I encountered a few technical glitches such as NPCs who were supposed to be following me getting stuck in place, but nothing game breaking.\n\nThe story is really good. Nothing ground breaking, but a good story. It centers around 5 teenagers who take a weekend trip to a small island town, and wake up something supernatural that they must fix/escape. The voiceacting and writing was really well done. They really managed to capture the vibe of a teenage trip, and when things head south the game is really good at creating an atmosphere of creepyness and unease.\n\nIn all, good game. I would recommend to play it all in one sitting, so clear off a block of 3.5 - 4 hours turn out the lights, put on some headphones and enjoy the ride.","March 18","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is extremely well written, so much so that I played the whole game from start to finish, very rare for me and only for games with good stories. The character development for each character is superb\n\nThe game is more like an interactive movie where you choose your dialogue and see the outcome, There is little interaction as in puzzles and most of the time it's just you moving about the island. The dialogue system is really good and innovative however the only complaint I'd have is that if you select a choice whilst another character is talking, then it immediately becomes overidden with the dialogue you chose\n\nVisually the game is stunning and built on the Unity engine, this game amazed me to bits. The music as well was perfect and fitted so well with the atmosphere of the game and the sci-fi genre. The voice acting was also superb and each character had their own personality and made the characters even more believable\n\nOxenfree is a fantastic interactive movie game that everyone should give a go! It's innovative and original!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc...

You’ve been warned.)\n\nThe very best way I can think to describe Oxenfree, is that it feels kind of like a Telltale game got mixed up with or influenced by an 80’s teen horror flick like Poltergeist or what have you. Except, unlike a Telltale game, Night School Studio isn’t stoking the flames under six other games at the same time, so it doesn’t feel near as half-baked. You play the snarky blue-haired girl, Alex. She and her friends, Ren, Jonas, Nona, and Clarissa, are all high school students living in a scenic coastal town. Together they head to a small tourist trap of an island just offshore to less than legally spend the night there for a party, as is a time-honored tradition for upperclassmen. The intent is to drink, dance, and be merry, but before anyone can get good and properly drunk, they are plagued by mysterious forces beyond their understanding or control, awoken by a small portable radio Alex is carrying around.\n\nProbably one of the best things Oxenfree understands is its sense of pacing. It’s all good and well that I came here to be spooked by otherworldly forces, but you’ve got to set the mood first. You spend the first twenty minutes or so fiddling with the game’s dialogue options and getting to know its meager cast of five characters. Some might find it a little on the boring side, but it’s the perfect lull to make the creepy events later on feel all the more jarring. It’s also a pretty good introduction to the characters, each of whom at first glance might seem to fill a specific tropey role for this exact brand of narrative. But very quickly they spend this early game time filling in; there’s a good few backstories and anecdotes getting told that paint them with decent personality beyond simple labels. And with one of the characters being new to the group, it doesn’t feel out of place at all. This also very efficiently sets up where everybody stands with everybody else. One of my personal favorite things about the characters though, is that they feel like believable angsty teens. There’s none of that “how do you do, fellow kids” nonsense like with Life is Strange where the writers tried and failed so miserably to mimic hip kid lingo, which can really take you out of the experience. It all at the very least starts to form that all important attachment to the characters so that you’ll actually be invested and give half a care when the potentially life-threatening hauntings start happening. Suffice it to say, tone is established pretty darn well, and without feeling like the game is wasting any of your time doing so.\n\nSpeaking of believability, though, the setting also feels very fully realized. There’s a rich history to the island that you can access at certain spots via your radio, and it breathes a lot of life into the setting, helping greatly with immersion. You can sit down and listen to it at your leisure, and I really suggest you do. Without wishing to give away too much, one of the puzzles in the game involves trivia about the island. Aside from that and one other puzzle, though, the rest of the gameplay mostly consists of the same puzzle over and over again, if you can even call it a puzzle. You just mozey Alex on up next to whatever object the plot has grabbed hold of, and have her tune the radio until the plot sorts itself out. Gameplay, I’ll be honest, is where Oxenfree is at its most lacking. At the same time though, it’s a certain type of game that people simply aren’t drawn to for the actual play of the game. But if you’re not into games of that nature, Oxenfree probably isn’t going to change your mind.\n\nPerhaps Oxenfree’s second most lacking point is that of narrative agency for the player. Not that it’s terribly lacking; there are a good few hidden factors in the moment-to-moment dialogue options that’ll affect certain things later on. But it’s lacking where it feels it should matter most. Shortly after the inciting incident, Alex and Jonas are faced with a true to form Telltale esque major decision, in which friend to go save first. I figured, during my initial playthrough, that my decision would ultimately affect which of them had a worse time during the plot. But after playing again, I found the events happen in the same exact way, just in a different order. I can’t help but feel let down, because if choosing favorites doesn’t mean others taking the brunt of the hauntings, then what is even the point? That’s not to say the game is totally bereft of alternate story scenarios, which it definitely has. But none of it seems to come up until the tail end. Maybe all of this matters later, but why can’t it matter now? Why set it up as though it does matter right now, if it doesn’t? It feels a little dishonest by design.\n\nAnother saving grace, though, is something else Oxenfree understands pretty well, at least, definitely better than something like Firewatch. It’s that, if you’re going to write a character who, let’s be honest, only exists to add a sympathetic note to one of the other characters, while that’s all good and well, you’ll paint a fuller picture if you broaden your brushstrokes to actually include said vestigial character. What I mean is, Henry from Firewatch had Julia, but she was defined almost entirely by her profession and her relationship to Henry. Oxenfree’s counter to this is Alex’s dead brother Michael. During the home stretch, Oxenfree  has several flashback sequences where the player controls Alex during fond memories involving her brother. Everytime he comes up though, he’s buzzing with ideas about the direction he wants to take his life in. A lot of this affects Alex, obviously, but a lot of other things he mentions don’t have anything to do with her. It broadens him into feeling more like his own character, as opposed to purely being a reason for you to feel sorry for Alex. Unlike with Julia, it’s because not everything about him was mentioned or shown simply because of how sad it was going to make Alex.\n\nOn the whole, it has its little quirks and issues here and there. It’s definitely not a perfect game. If you can’t get past the character models looking like tiny dolls, or you’re just not into this type of game, you’re probably not going to enjoy it. And I’ll admit, the overall scariness was hit and miss, and the mundanity of the explanation behind the hauntings was a little disappointing. But all together, I’d say Oxenfree is a pretty solid little game. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives by a longshot. The tone, setting, and characters are all really well thought out and executed. Ultimately, those alone are enough to call it a satisfying overall experience.","April 19","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also beautiful to look at and the mix of huge 2d scenery with the small 3d characters works well with the exploration-based gameplay. You basically just wander around an island and tune a radio to different frequencies but the story and characters are captivating and there is a really neat surprise at the very end. My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to backtrack somewhere because the characters walk so slowly, but these walking parts are usually filled with conversations between the characters.\n\nThe game only took me a few hours to complete but it felt like the perfect length.

The game focuses on choices and the choices you enter are complex. I did my best to be nice and help others but it wasn't black and white. It's not a good choice/neutral choice/bad choice, rather a "Well, what do you want most/least?" choice, because you'll probably have conflicting wants. Keeps you thinking and on your toes.\n\nI love the characters and one didn't end up liking me but well, it's not for lack of wanting. I like her. They're all cuties.\n\nThe conversation-based story and play is very cool. It's a massive innovation on storytelling and choice in games.

You have to make a lot of split-second decisions that impact your friend's in the game that feel agonizing because you get sucked into the creepy ambience of the story.\n\nThe only thing I had a hard time with in this game was getting a little lost because you can't access the map in the middle of scenarios. For the directionally challenged like myself, this was a pain. I had to go back and forth a few times to get my bearing on the island. But having to backtrack helped me find more of the secrets...so, I guess it worked it in the end. :P","May 22","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I can safely say that i got what I was expecting, this game is well worth it's full price!\n\nYou play as Alex, a young girl who is spending the night with some friends on a small island, that once housed a military base. Armed with a radio, you accidently open a mysterious gift, that unleashes ghosts from the past. Now, it's up to you, to survive the night, find your friends, and escape the growing nightmare!\n\nWhile I can't say it's the most graphically impressive Indie game i've played, it manages to have some great artwork, that matches the style and gameplay. The characters are all very good, and portrayed with great voice acting. the story itself manages to remain genuinely interesting throught, despite some cliche's sprinkled throught. While I won't spoil the ending, I can say, that I had a genuine sense of satisfaction with the ending, and seeing that my choices had real impact.\n\nThe only blatant negative's that I can find, are that it can be slow at times, with how fast the character's move around the map, but that was solved with some very well written dialogue, and some heartfelt characters moments. The worst thing for me, was that the game can bug out sometimes, leading one to restart an area over again.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that "Oxenfree" is a truly great game, filled with great characters and dialogue, a truly unsettiling atmosphere in certain parts, and a satisfying ending. I would easily reccommend this game to all my friends, or at least to those who love a good adventure/mystery story!\n\nMy final rank for this game would be very solid: 9/10","May 22","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
