In the game you are the second overlord (after the first has left) and you must help your army of minions destroy the pitiful disgusting forces of good BLEH!\n\nGameplay\nIn overlord you start off with  learning how to control a small group of minions. There are 4 different kind of minions you will find though the game. to summon a minions you need orbs of their specific colour which can be gained by killing enemies.\n\nAs you continue you will gain the ability to purchase items to improve your amazing dark tower and to improve yourself.\n\nThroughout the game your goal is to become evils favourite son by commiting tasks such as killing villages, killing off elves etc. (good times i know) You will also have choices within the story which will help you reach your evil goal.\n\nMinions\nThe minions here deserve their own perfect panel. Within the game as previously mentioned there are 4 different types of minions, each with ups and downs.\n\nBrown	- Can wear picked up items and is your basic unit\n\n+easy to get orbs\n+capable of wearing armour and picking up weapons\n\n\nGreen	- Stealthy backstabbers who deal high damage\n\n+ can turn invisible when guarding a location\n+ back stabbing :D\n\nRed	- Ranged fireball chucking units\n\n+ only ranged unit\n+ chucks fire\n\n- low health\n\nBlue	- Blue is the only type of minions that can revive other minions (if he gets to them in time) and is the only minion capable of traveling through water\n\n+ can swin\n+ can revive\n\n- weak in combat\n\nRaising Hell\nAs you can guess raising hell is in fact not the base game but rather a dlc that allows you to launch it (hence why i have 0 hours on overlord). In raising hell after you defeat an areas "hero" a gate will spawn which will send you to what seems like hell. You will see your former enemies being tortured and punished while you must go and get stones to control these amazing hell resorts. And after you shall face the true keeper of this hell-like realm whom i shall not name (because i have forgotten him) and you shall receive the true ending of overlord.\n\nRating\nPros\n+ fun gameplay\n+ fun little minions\n+ minions pick up garbage for you\n+ succubus\n+ each area has a different feel and the storyline is fun\n+ amazing ending\n\nCons\n- may become a bit repetitive ( i got nothing else bad to say)\n\n\nFinal Throughts\nFor me Overlord Raising Hell has been an amazing game which I was able to truly embrace. I enjoyed every moment of gameplay along with the storyline. This game is one of my top picks and is truly a game you must try.\n\nFinal Rating 10/10","June 20, 2015","true","29.5"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","72","76","7","0"

For a review of the original Overlord, please reference my steam review at http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980576540/recommended/11450\n\nRaising Hell's storyline takes place after the events in the original Overlord. Abyss Gates are spotted in each of the lands that you have previously explored and present a twisted, more hellish version of each area. The seven sins of hell come to mind when playing through these areas. Your goal is to go to each Abyss and take control of it. You will also find moulds in these zones to create new and interesting equipment.\n\nThe unique armor and weapons added in Raising Hell present new abilities that otherwise would not be available to you; however, the new equipment is woefully underpowered. If you already have a full set of upgraded Arcanium gear, you're better off ignoring these new items.\n\nAlthough the expansion adds much appreciated content to an already outstanding game, it does little to nothing to fix the flaws of the original. Trying to control your minions to solve some of the new puzzles can be frustrating. In particular, there is one puzzle that you must sweep your minions left and right to mow a lawn. Don't complete it fast enough and you have to start over. Nothing tells you that you failed due to time so you could end up like me looking it up online to figure out what I am supposed to do. This happened about two or three times for me. Guidance isn't exactly clear on some of the puzzles.\n\nIf you enjoyed the original, this game will be well worth your money. If you are unsure of buying both Raising Hell and the original Overlord in one go, do not fret. Your saved game on Steam of the original will transfer over into the Steam expansion so you can enjoy the content at your leisure.","December 17, 2013","true","7.4"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

Never tried the K/M\n4) Lengthy adventure\n5) Well designed levels keep things fresh and interesting\n6) Cute and charming story\n7) Bonus DLC is more creative than the actual game\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1) The game at times can feel repetitive.\n2) The game can be frustrating at times especially if you loose a lot of minions at once forcing you to harvest more.\n3) Seems a bit too long given the nature of the game, I just wanted it to end around 13 hours in.\n4) Minions sometimes don't really follow your commands causing needless death.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is worth checking out and if you enjoyed pikmin from Nintendo you should somewhat enjoy this game. Both have similiar gameplay elements yet vastly different design.","June 12, 2014","true","19.8"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Overlord: Raising Hell is the official expansion to the 2007 game 'Overlord'. This expansion was released on the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 all on 2008. The game promises new content for the single player experience by adding additional plot, more levels and new enemy types, new items, and new creative mini-games.\n\nThe game takes place several months after the events of Overlord 1 and serves as the prologue to the events that would lead up to Overlord 2. Having finally restored his dominion over the land and exacting revenge on the adventurers, the Overlord now faces a new threat to his rule when portals to another dimension starts opening around his territories. Upon investigating the nearest portal, the Overlord discovers that his 'loyal subjects' are attempting to flee into the portals with no intention of coming back. The Overlord now ventures into one of these dark portals in an attempt to conquer whatever is in the other side and 'persuade' his followers to come back. Little did he know however, that the portals were just the beginning of a much sinister plot by a being far much more powerful than him.\n\nPROS:+ The core gameplay of the original title is still intact\n+ Good new story that adds several hours to the game time\n+ New enemy types are fun to fight\n+ Each portal has a story of their own\n+ Fun new mini-games and simple but satisfying puzzles\n+ New minion equipment\n\nCONS:- New items for the overlord sucks (mainly because they have prebuilt stats)\n- None of the the original CONS from the main game was ever addressed\n- Some of the mini-games gives no clue on how to solve them (gardening puzzle)\n- Far more expensive than the Original game, but still requires you to own said original game\n- No additional events to increase Corruption / Evil\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION although it could have used a bit more polishing specially since most of the CONS from the main game was never fixed. The game retains the core gameplay mechanics that made the original game unique and fun to play, it adds several hours of game time with an interesting new story, new monsters, new puzzles, and it lays down a good premise for the Overlord 2 sequel.\n\nAll in all, I still liked this expansion and give it my RECOMMENDATION. I do however, urge you to BUY THE OVERLORD COMPLETE PACK which contains Overlord 1, Overlord: Raising Hell (expansion), and Overlord 2 either on Sale or Full price, the game is worth the money for Action Adventure fans and people who's interested in the story.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

You need to use your minions more to complete objectives.\n\n-The good parts:\nFeels just like the base game Overlord, so you can jump right in.\nGraphics seems to be a bit improved and effects seem to be used a bit more.\nEnvironments look and feel a little better this time.\nHidden secrets are back.\nLevels are not to small and big.\nDecent game lenght.\nChallenging, but not to difficult.\nLevel design is better than the base game Overlord.\nThe Minion Master is still annoying as how he gives orders to you ;p.\n-Bad parts:\nPrice is to high if you just want to buy the DLC. This DLC is shorter to the base game, but costs more money for some reason.\nI bought it when it was on sale and that was for the whole Overlord package, just before the time of this writing.\nMinions sweeping still does not respond well for most of the time. My camera jumps random when I began to sweep and     locks itself untill you reset the sweep.\nFeels a little more linear than the base game. Rating  : 7,5\n\n-First impressions (not relevant for this actual review, just for my first minutes into the DLC):\nNot good as all they added are portals to new levels, no weapons/armor, no new minions, to linear.","September 21, 2014","true","24.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

Ya who wants that? ME. Make more of these games please.\n\nBeing a demon lord sith master dark force (copyright) yadadada  is pretty awesome!\n\nControl and Minons\nOverlord focuses on you staying in control of well .. the overlord while you can also control minions. I really like these types of games that are define you as a single character who you are always in control of while manipulating units makes you feel more like a general in the front lines and not a king who is a potato in a castle you never see.\n\nThat being said the gameplay is basic and most of it relies on you controlling your minions and solving the puzzles throughout the game. Its more of a puzzle game with combat moments of just sending your minions to rush in and slaughter everything in your way.\n\nUpgrades\nThough when you upgrade your character enough you can pretty much slaughter everyone yourself without the need for minions (sounds about right for a evil overlord).\n\nDid I mention my overlord castle had gold practically pouring out of the gates? Thats until i smithed a ton of statues of me in gold… awww the good days.\n\nSpoiler that didn’t happen :’(  Though you do get to have a treasure room like Fable 3.\n\nMoral System\nThough I find it hilarious it even has a moral system that is measured in corruption you think the whole OVERLORD with the flames in the background and evil monsters in the front of the game box would be a clear indication that you are a dedicated to being straight up evil.

It's got one primary mechanic that dominates the game, natural progession with you the player growing stronger and stronger, quests, lots of failure near the end, and a decent final boss.\n\nThere are some games that, although really good, fall closer to the realm of "art" than "entertainment".

The most fun I got out of this game was when a friend gave me a link for this - http://forum.cheatengine.org/viewtopic.php?p=5430025\nyou can spawn about 120 minions safely, the more you make the more of a chance of them just vanishing. give them infinite health and mana, give yourself infinite health and mana. Best of all you can speed hack both yourself and the minions to move at insane game breaking speeds, I have yet to try this in multilayer. But it gives the game a 2nd 3rd or 4th playthrough and a reason to buy it if you already own it on a gaming system.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=375179618","January 21, 2015","true","11.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","10","17","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kenomica/recommended/12710/","Kenomica","Kenomica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kenomica/","413 products in account","Overlord has you take the role of the almighty Overlord, an evil presence who is set to rule over the land.\n\nYou begin the game, a newly awakened dark force – tasked with rebuilding your dark tower. You raise an army of minions, terrorize the local population and craft your own armour and weapons. You can even customize your dark tower, which is a nice touch. The narrative and environment are very reminiscent of Middle-Earth, in the sense of a twisted parody where you play as Sauron. The setting is very light-hearted and comical, despite playing the villain in a Tolkien-esque world. The graphics aren’t exactly stellar and there are issues with pop-in, but it does a nice job of portraying the theme of the overall experience. It’s similar to World of Warcraft’s style of softly lit and stylized environments and characters.\n\nAlthough you are a dark and powerful Overlord, you start off fairly weak, which is where your minions come in. Like Pikmin, you need to gather a force of followers who can aid you in your quest. You need a certain amount of minions to perform specific tasks for you - such as moving obstacles, pulling levers and of course, combat. They can also access smaller areas otherwise inaccessible, revealing secrets and other goodies. There are also various colours which specialize further. Brown minions, for example, are your standard fighting force, whilst red minions are your ranged attackers; greens are your stealth attackers and blues are your healers.\n\nOverlord plays like a very old game; now, I do not mean this in a negative sense – not dated or “retro” – I’m referring more to the game design and ideology. Although there is a main thread to follow, you’re not held by the hand from point A to point B, you are encouraged to explore and find things for yourself. The world is rather large and full of secrets and puzzles, which need actual work and thoughtfulness to find. It makes a very refreshing experience compared to more modern games full of set pieces and elaborately staged corridors.\n\nThe controls are very well done, both with keyboard & mouse and a controller; although camera control is limited with a controller. You control your Overlord as you would expect, attacking and using magic but you can also control your minions directly as a horde, allowing finer control, such as sweeping them through inaccessible areas. You are also able to set guard points, sending your minions to station there until you recall them; this allows you to set your fire throwing reds at the back, set up an ambush with the greens etc. It’s nice how much control you have.\n\nThe game lasted me roughly 25 hours, which felt very well paced. Some games feel too long, others too short. This game fits neither of these categories.\n\nI highly recommend this game, as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it.","February 13, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Adventure games are one of the best type of games, and this, being evil and having minions (with different abilities for each element), combines many great styles into one, beautiful, high quality, game. Not to mention the Raising Hell expansion pack, plus Overlord II. The artists and mappers who made the worlds did an outstanding job, making the best enviroments I have even seen, and really know how to put detail into the job, and staying on the theme of the zone. The game also shows very funny dark, impish humor. Much like Portal. I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody. Get the full pack on Steam.

Frustrating Gameplay & Conflicted Themes Doesn't Make One Evil.Genre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG.\nDeveloped & Published by: Triumph Studios and Codemasters\nPlatform: Windows only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Expansion.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nOriginally posted by Overlord: Raising Hell Steam Description:How evil can you get? Discover how corruptible you are in Overlord, the twisted fantasy action adventure where you can be evil (or really evil). In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nTo me, this paragraph is describing another game entirely. It's one case of marketing that I could argue negatively affected my impression, and eventual review, of a game. I did create a review several years back but I've returned after several years to make it informational and useful to you, the reader. So, let's begin.\n\nOverall Story Thoughts\nOverlord is a quirky cartoonish game sure, but a dark twisted fantasy adventure where you get to be really evil? I disagree. It’s true that people who do evil deeds don’t feel evil or in the wrong when they’re doing them. But...well...let's talk about the story. In the game, you're setup as some sort of evil Overlord, tasked with bringing darkness and ruin to the world along with the help of your minions. So, you go out into the world and destroy people who are more evil than you and bring peace….and prosperity….to the land. Ok, that's one way it ends. The other way the story ends is that you create a land ruled by fear and your power's corruption and devastation of the lands. But all it does is affect the ending cutscene, not the game itself. Well, it doesn't affect it that much. I really don't like games that set me up to think that my in-game actions will affect the world when all it really does is affect the end cutscene.\n\nThis game doesn't really let you be an evil overlord during the course of play. Part of which is to be blamed on the more comedic, cutesy tones present throughout the story. You can’t just randomly kill people if you wish, only in special circumstances. While you can set fire to wheat fields, slaughter sheep and destroy all the kegs of beer you can see, they just regrow back as soon as you leave. I get that it needs to be that way for gameplay reasons but it’s hard to feel evil when you know what you’re doing isn’t really harming anyone. If anything, I just feel more like a destroyer of boxes than a ruler of all that is dark and evil. I can’t even make children cry at the sight of me! I mean, c'mon. What is this...\n\nAll that said, it does make for a decent time as more of a comedic/light fantasy story than a dark tale of power & corruption. Characters are two dimensional and stereotypical but the interactions can be somewhat amusing at times. Especially between the Overlord and the town citizens. All typical fantasy creatures can be found here. Drunken Dwarves, Ethereal Elves, Portly Halflings, Dumb Trolls and more are in this world, serving the part they play in most any other fantasy genre. You get to see a decent variety of locations too. But there wasn't much that surprised me.\n\nGameplay Thoughts\nYou control up to 100 minions and an unnamed overlord at the same time. The overlord gets a melee attack chain and the use of spells but he should generally stay out of the fight. Otherwise, you'll wind up running out of health and mana extremely fast. So, you'll be playing most of the game through your four types of minions:\nBrown melee minions that will generally make up the cannon fodder of your army.\nRed fireball throwing minions that are immune to fire.\nGreen poison immune minions that will backstab enemies.\nBlue minion reviving ones that are immune to water and have weaker attacks. It’s a decent variety of minions but the game lacks in tactical decision making. Just send swarms of minions at your enemies and recall if you notice a big telegraphed attack coming. That’s really about the sum of the combat. Most of the time you’ll be losing minions because the controls didn't respond or you didn't see a hazard in time. That or they become stuck on doing whatever activity you "assigned" them or in the terrain. The sweeping function doesn't help matters either as it has the same issues. It’s more tiresome than enjoyable to deal with these controls when multiple types of hazards/enemies are present in a level. One last thing: I was fighting the camera more than I felt necessary for a 3rd person game which doesn't help the already frustrating gameplay. You have very limited control over it.\n\nPC Settings & Multiplayer\nI never did get a chance to experience multiplayer because the servers were shutdown after Overlord II was released. You can play online through Hamachi but the community has no doubt suffered. There is a split-screen mode though, that’s rather unusual for a PC-centric title. Graphics settings are solid. Resolution options, AA slider, V-Sync, Texture/Debris/View distance sliders are here as well. FOV is missing but you probably won’t need it. Audio sliders are present as well and it supports up to 8.1 speaker systems which is nice. Mouse and Keyboard function well enough but I think controller is the preferred control scheme. Even with a controller, the game feels like it’s fighting me the entire time. The game is getting on to be 8 years old now and it is rather disappointing that the framerate doesn't stay consistent. I noticed even on my current machine that it would fluctuate between 50-60 fps during the first level. I don't think it's enough to be a deal breaker but I wonder how bad it would be to play some of the later levels again.\n\nOverlord: Raising Hell Expansion Thoughts\nIt’s not worth it. Half of it is challenge levels with a minor amount of story attached and the other half of it is maps for the now non-functioning multiplayer. Unless you really enjoy the mechanics of controlling your minions and want to challenge yourself to a new level of frustration, this expansion is a pass. Oh and keep in mind that the original game won’t launch if the expansion is installed. Not a big deal but something I should mention here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI don’t recommend Overlord or Overlord: Raising Hell. While there are glimpses of really fun gameplay, it eventually gets worse over time. Frustration set in long before the game ended and there’s a constant sense of repetition and I want this to end already that plagues the latter half. It just becomes a long grind. Between that and the quirky controls/minion behavior, it leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, there is a ton of backtracking. The story itself is...ok. Its not awful but its not very memorable either. It seems at odds with itself on whether you're a good guy or bad guy. Outside of smacking minions around, destroying some buildings and killing a few people, you don’t really feel like a true Overlord to me. You just feel like an anti-hero who's a jerk when all I'm doing is defeating corrupted heroes, saving the townspeople from starvation and being a generally good guy. It's a decent enough 3rd person "RTS" game but I think it could have been much better given more attention to its gameplay.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]A Paladin's Review: Overlord 2.

The game runs fine on moderns systems, doesn't look too great but it doesn't try to and that's okay.  Due to playing offline I can't tell how many hours are in the game, but probably no more than 15 or so.\n\nThe problem is that while it is passable, the game is fairly generic.  Enemies don't really have a middle-ground threat level, they either fall easily to a swarm of minions or kill your minions in 1 hit.  There's no noticable attrition, just TPKs.  There are some puzzle elements but its hard to do much with the minions to make it all that fun.  The story tries to be slapstick, but kinda just falls flat on the humor.  Controls are mostly fine as long as you remember them.  The 'Raising Hell' expansion adds extra side-zones, which are generally well crafted.  I did 3 of 5 of them.\n\nNot bad but nothing really great, all in all.","December 19, 2012","false","9.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I guess nothing resonnated with me. not the goofy characters, not the aged graphics, not the dull gameplay which mostly consists of pathfinding, not the crummy controls or "strategy" (since there isn't any). All of it was really boring and i kind of wish i saved my 5 bucks for something better... like a 5 dollar footlong.\n\nArbitrary score: Boring pickmin clone attempt/pickmin, which is actually good\n\nEdit: Alright, let's get more in-detail then.\n\nTLDR: Just go watch Zero Punctuation's review on Youtube, he more or less explains my feelings on this borefest of a game.\n\nIn this game you control minions which do your ♥♥♥ kicking for you as you take on tasks which generally involve making your way through enemies or pathing your minions through a certain route to either kill enemies or collect objects.\nThe strategy is practically nonexistent. There was one section in the halfling homes where you can let out boxes of rats to do some fighting for you, but beyond that it's all just swarming your minions to an enemy or group of enemies while you charge in smashing the space bar (attacking with the overlord) or casting some spells. My patience with the game ended fairly early on. basically what i experienced was the halfling homes and the raided castle as well as some of the hellish place and a good chunck of the forest. I stopped just before i got the green hive because i realized how freaking bored i was at that point. Nothing stood out as fun or interesting and i was already 3 hours in. If a game fails to make much of an impression at that point then it stands to reason that the game doesn't deserve any more of my patience.\nI call it an attempted pickman clone because it IS. Basically you have colored minions that help you fight enemies and collect objects around the world. that's pickman in a nutshell, only pickman is at least fun in the sense that it controls better and you're fairly quick to get your multicolored friends and start adventuring. In this game i felt like i was getting my minions at a crawl and i didn't feel like i was really adventuring. each level had so much linearity to it that there were only occasionally branches in level design which led to chests for your minions to break open and that's about it. The only real difference is that you have an overlord and the overlord felt boring to play.\nThe overlord can cast spells, attack, and move minions around. He isn't even all too exceptionally strong unless you upgrade his stuff and even then you're doing the same things but with better gear. There was never a point in my 3 hour playtime that i felt like a badass overlord going around being an evil badass. On the contrary i felt like a d-bag running around and checking off a chore list.\n\nSo there you go. I won't talk about aesthetic since it's to each their own and that's about it. It's a boring game that didn't do anything impressive with 3.7 hours.","February 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","5"

Play the sequel if you want to try this franchise out. You're not missing anything story or gameplay wise. This is like the beta for that game. And everything you didn't like about the core game is worse in the DLC.\n\nThis needed more work and more commitment. Its like the game was afraid to really let you be an evil Overlord. It feels like a rushed production. They threw together the broad sketch of what an Overlord is but didn't really flesh things out. You'll end up running around doing lots of errands either for the people or your adviser.\n\nYou can't even sit on your throne.\n\nThat said, the minions are a fairly well realized bit of gameplay. Point and click and they'll run out attacking your enemies, destroying stuff, pillaging towns. The four types of minions give you some variety for tactical play but honestly you don't need it.\n\nBig minuses.\n1) No minimap or other navigation. You have no way of figuring out how to get anywhere except through raw memorization. You'll even occasionally get directions like "go east" when there's absolutely no way of knowing which way east is (you can't see the sun and nothing indicates a cardinal direction)\n2) Can't sit on throne.\n3) The "evil/eviler" karma meter system sounds good on paper but in practice it works a lot like a standard karma meter. Thanks to their non committal premise, the villagers are actually happy when you conquer them because the people in charge before were worse. If you want your villagers to fear you, you actually have to go back through their town on a separate "YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE ME!" rampage.\n4) Cheesy tepid humor. It kind of reminds me of the style of humor you get in Fable 3 but weaker.\n5) Game undermines the experience of being an Overlord. When you're at the castle you're constantly being nagged by your adviser and mistress to go back into the field to do some overlording. Aside from using the portal to jump to different maps there's almost no point in visiting your stronghold.\n\nEDIT: So this review got voted down 4 times. I wonder why? Who is defending this incredibly mediocre game? What have I said about the game that is untrue? I really mean it when I say "Try the sequel instead". The sequel really is much better than this. It fixes a lot of my gripes about this game and generally fleshes everything out, making it more robust.\n\nIn the sequel, instead of this game's karma system where you choose between acting like a good guy who is a little naughty and acting like a bad guy, you get to choose between being a tyrant and a marauder. The second game mostly gets things right. Try that one. Don't waste your time with this one. The plot is very thin in these games and playing the first one will do almost nothing to help you appreciate the second. The one or two plot points from the first game that are relevant in the second one are sufficiently explained in the sequel.","September 22, 2014","false","13.4"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

The Raising Hell expansion is pretty much a full on stand-alone game which supplies even more hours of stupid, mindless fun. My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of direction. There is no mini-map or waypoints. Even a directional arrow would have been a welcome addition. Instead, most of the time, I just ended up wandering aimlessly until I found a new objective. The controller support is great for everything except camera positioning--which makes playing with one much more frustrating than it should be.\n\nThe gameplay feels original and unique over more traditional action/adventure types. The concept never gets stale, but getting lost really took a toll on my patience meter making the game much longer than it needed to be.

Two words would be "gleefully mischievous." Imps and goblins usually annoy me - like the sidekick in The Darkness II - but these little fellows manage to be endearing.\nAnyway, this game has its tongue firmly pressed to its cheek, in a good way.\n\nIt parodies LOTR - except you are playing as pseudo-Sauron, sweeping your minions across halfling villages and elven forests with an evil grin on your face.\n\nYou (the Overlord) are slow and lumbering, but your minions - whom you can guide with an invisible hand or more precisely assign tasks to - are fast and fluid.\n\nIt's sort of open world - open enough to let you revisit previous (respawning) locations to replenish your gold and Souls.\n\nNegatives: Lots of backtracking. No way to sprint or speed up your Overlord character. And no mini-map of any kind. These three problems are a big no-no in an open world game.\n\nStill, I'm early in the game and I am really enjoying it.","July 13, 2012","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It add a good 5-7 hours worth of gameplay and gives you 3 new weapons and a new armour set. It consists mostly of puzzle like gameplay and uses a new feature which allows you to sweep your minions while holding items. Basically, you go through the 4 different lands you've conquered and torture the dead heroes even more. It is a lot more frustrating compared to the regular game, a lot more thinking involved..which isn't bad..but you might want to pull your hair out after awhile. This DLC contains no more health, mana or minion tokens. Just the 5 'Unique' items. It adds a few more enemies to the arena and that's basically all this is. The ending leads to the events of II. As much as I love Overlord, overall, for $9, not worth it. If it was $5, for sure! If you have no Overlord games and are giving it a shot, I'd recommend going ahead and paying the $20 for the whole set.","May 30, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Two words would be "gleefully mischievous." Imps and goblins usually annoy me - like the sidekick in The Darkness II - but these little fellows manage to be endearing.\nAnyway, this game has its tongue firmly pressed to its cheek, in a good way.\n\nIt parodies LOTR - except you are playing as pseudo-Sauron, sweeping your minions across halfling villages and elven forests with an evil grin on your face.\n\nYou (the Overlord) are slow and lumbering, but your minions - whom you can guide with an invisible hand or more precisely assign tasks to - are fast and fluid.\n\nIt's sort of open world - open enough to let you revisit previous (respawning) locations to replenish your gold and Souls.\n\nNegatives: Lots of backtracking. No way to sprint or speed up your Overlord character. And no mini-map of any kind.

A game where your choices actually affect the world around you and how the ingame characters react to you.\nBeautiful graphics and well worth playing.\n\nIf that didn't persuade you then.....

For example nintendos Pikmin, which most of you wont even know.\nSo let me explain:\nYou basicly dont fight all that much, instead you control a horde of ever growing amount of goblins that fight in your place. You walk around pointing in directions, or taking direct control of minions to fight enemies. Later in the game you have different minions that you have to micro manage a bit (some are fire immune, some dont die in water).\nThe game has a good pace, some nice humor and its Fable-like graphicstyle is supporting this as well.\n\nI can recommend it together with Raising Hell, its cheap now anyway. And while graphicly inferior to Overlord II I had more fun playing the first game.\n\nVery good game, get it.\n'nuff said.","January 14, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the supposed attraction of Overlord, an interesting hybrid of tactical strategy, action RPG and adventure game, all wrapped in a purely satirical shell.  However, how evil you actually get to be is rather low, being either murderous evil or the evil version of “nice by accident”.  In either case being evil isn't really the attraction of the game, as much as it is about the parodic fun the game pokes at all things fantasy.\n\nWhich is good, because the battle system is unwieldy, the stages are sometimes a bit too long, and in the middle of the game the expectation of lifeforce to imbue into your weapons and armor vs the amount you actually have results in a near grinding halt of the gameplay as you grind away in your dungeon on beetles and their ilk.  Clearly the game has some problems, not the least being the somewhat obtuse Hell stages of the Raising Hell DLC.\n\nBut it's all ok!  Though those problems can be felt, they are helped along by a silly, interesting, goofy tale that really ends up being about revenge, sin, and what it really means to be evil . . . as well as by some fairly pretty graphics, even seven years past the game's release.\n\nFor anyone that enjoys a silly tale of fantasy parody and ordering goblin/gremlin-like minions to kill things, this is a game best picked up.

Honestly, I don't feel Overlord is complete without Raising Hell, since it adds new unique magic items, one of which is almost a must have: the Sword of Life-Stealing.\n\nI wouldn't say Overlord: RH is a great game. It barely merits "good". But, some of the wit made me chuckle, the combat felt somwhat satisfying, and the crafting tied it together. The minion controls were in a word, awkward. They don't control well, and it basicaly devolves into mobbing enemies or sticking your minions on guard duty.\n\nThe tactic I found that works the best is once you have the Sword of Life-Stealing and Arcanium armor with +75% or better health regeneration you're basically unkillable. While this does detract from the difficulty, it also makes the game less exhasperating to play.\n\nBut do you truly get to be an "evil overlord"? No. if they'd made the main character a knight, gave you binery moral choices that allowed you be to a "chivalrous knight" or a "black knight", and made all your minions squires instead, the game wouldn't be very different. Is the idea sort of amusing as the backdrop for the gameplay? Sure.\n\nRecommended if you want to take a break from all the other third person action games.","May 3, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Raising Hell expansion is pretty much a full on stand-alone game which supplies even more hours of stupid, mindless fun. My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of direction. There is no mini-map or waypoints. Even a directional arrow would have been a welcome addition. Instead, most of the time, I just ended up wandering aimlessly until I found a new objective. The controller support is great for everything except camera positioning--which makes playing with one much more frustrating than it should be.\n\nThe gameplay feels original and unique over more traditional action/adventure types. The concept never gets stale, but getting lost really took a toll on my patience meter making the game much longer than it needed to be. I never thought I'd put so many hours into it, but it's just so damn fun. It's hard not to recommend.","February 16, 2013","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example nintendos Pikmin, which most of you wont even know.\nSo let me explain:\nYou basicly dont fight all that much, instead you control a horde of ever growing amount of goblins that fight in your place. You walk around pointing in directions, or taking direct control of minions to fight enemies. Later in the game you have different minions that you have to micro manage a bit (some are fire immune, some dont die in water).\nThe game has a good pace, some nice humor and its Fable-like graphicstyle is supporting this as well.\n\nI can recommend it together with Raising Hell, its cheap now anyway. And while graphicly inferior to Overlord II I had more fun playing the first game.\n\nVery good game, get it.\n'nuff said.","January 14, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are decent and environments look pretty, though character models and animations seem dated. I liked that combat in Overlord isn't solely through the minions, but that your character has upgradeable weapons and spells that allow you to get up close to the action. The music is good while the humor is hit and miss for the most part.\n\nThe expansion adds in a hell version of the main quest environments called abysses. After 1 or 2 abyss levels, I felt like this formula grew a little repetitive and tiresome, but some elements of them were humorous and enjoyable. The game gradually gets more challenging near the end, but sometimes I felt that excessive grinding/health bars in bosses made conflicts drawn out artificially, testing patience rather than ingenuity.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with Overlord and its expansion which I found enjoyable. The game is very long for this genre and this compounds the problem of repetitive gameplay, but if you give yourself Overlord in small doses, you'll find a worthwhile experience.\n\nBottom Line: 7.5/10","September 27, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it on PS3 when it first came out and it's good enough to play 3 or 4 more times. Rly funny with a lot of hidden obvious humor. Isn't optimized very well for pc but it's easy to get used to and can look up on forums how to do certain things. 10/10","February 14","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gives new interesting gear that is already enchanted unlike all other types of gear. I would honestly say yes to getting this if you enjoy an extra challenge.","January 8","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overlord is fun adventure game with a micro RTS element and some interest story narratives.

The Overlord himself can either be a benevolent ruler, or a dark and corrupted  master of evil. The gameplay is smooth and easy to handle, the controls are super easy to learn and get down. I can't give this game enough praise, the bad thing i have to say, is that the graphics are...eh. But for me that doesn't take away from the experience! I like the oldish graphics, it gives the game more charm. The whacky and zany voices are so fun to listen to. I found myself talking like Gnarl and some of the peasants, i did enjoy the experience. The sound track is simple and catchy and alos, EPIC the tunes can go from cheery and chipper, to dark and gloomy. This game was a serious blast.THEN i bought Raising Hell and my mind was filled with wonder as i took on the task to delve into the depths of what is basically Hell. It was glorious. And you too can experience the glory! Buy Overlord and be sure to Buy Raising Hell! DO IT NOW!!!!!\n\n10/10\nBUY IT!\n","April 27","true","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
