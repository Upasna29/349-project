"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Premoistened/recommended/255030/","Premoistened","Ol' QWERTY Bastard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Premoistened/","1148 products in account","I purchased this without realizing it was an iOS/Android game.  For a portable game Echo prime isn't half bad.  I can see how the gameplay would lend itself well to that platform.  However, the features that make it ideal for a cell phone don't translate well to a home enviroment.  The game is clearly intended to be played in 10 to 15 minute spurts and that shows in the level design and make-up.  Levels are blazingly short and incredibly repetative, most likely to compensate for the presumed limited space of a phone or tablet.  Also, the designers left in many of the touch related instructions.  During the initial traning mission the player is encouraged to "tap a place on the ground to move there" or to "Swipe to dodge!"\n\nEcho Prime's gameplay tries to find a home somewhere between a clickfest like Diablo and classic arcade Beat-em-ups like Streets of Rage but it misses the key notes that make those two genres enjoyable.  You gain money from grinding missions which you use to buy weapons and armor which you then grind kills on to get "Echoes" which are essentially spells that can level.  It's a fairly steep and obvious treadmill.  Though, the only incentive I can see for continuing to upgrade your gear is the chance to unlock new Echoes.  You aren't encouraged to upgrade your gear because the enemies are hard, in fact quite the opposite.  I was able to play to level 8, about an hour in to the game, without purchasing new items.  The AI is too predictible or, in some cases down right dumb, to pose any type of a threat to a competent player.\n\nLastly, the story: more spefically the almost complete absense of one.  You're a guy on a ship flying around space and beating up aliens, pirates and robots whose character models don't really differ that much.\n\nAll in all, I can understand how this would be an enjoyable game on a mobile platform but at the end of the day there is enough substance or depth here for the game to have lasting appeal.","January 29, 2014","false","1.5"," 96 of 115 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","96","115","0","0"

Levels are small, short, and often composed of smaller sub sections separated by loading screens. Of course the main feature is the presence of Echoes, which are various boosters or abilities, both active and passive. They're really varied and you can borrow for each mission one of three echoes offered from other players (nifty!). There are a variety of missions but they mostly revolve around defeating enemies in a linear manner, defending an item, or surviving waves.","January 28, 2014","true","3.7"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","66","83","0","0"

Controller does not funtion correctly. Also, I get stuck everytime after beating a level, so I have to exit game and open it back up to play the next level. I really enjoy the classic feel that it offers for the first couple of levels I played, but I just can't give it a good review right now--It's unplayable as is. If they fix it, I will probably, then, give it a thumbs up.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt seems they have fixed some of the issues. It works!\n\nOk, good linear side-scrolling classic type of game. Love upgrading echoes and gear, abilities are cool and fun to master, and there is a whole lot of monsters and robots to see and demolish. However, game does have a few drawbacks. Some controller functionality issues are still present but not bad. No, not all pc games need to have controller support, but its nice to have options. For this review, I used and took into account the functionality of both types of controls--keyboard and controller. Even when using a keyboard, I can go to wierd empty pages when selecting some of the menu links--but you can just back out of it by clicking back or pressing b on controller. With that said, functionality for both controls are fine now, and you should have no problem getting through game using either.\n\nGame can seem a little difficult at start. Its not really hard to get from level to level to start, its just knowing what echoes are and following the story line that may be a problem at the start for some.\n\nAnyway, I give the game 6.5 now and 6.75 if small glitches and controller stuff is fixed.","January 28, 2014","true","14.5"," 64 of 102 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","64","102","0","2"

Worse yet, the controls in the PC version really don't work that well - sometimes clicking anywhere near an enemy will shoot at it, even if it's already dead. Also, your dodge roll behaves erratically and buggily, often not really moving you the way you want it to move, or at all.\n\nLikewise, it shows its iOS roots by having a lot of very simple, repetitive levels. It took me about 10 hours to complete the campaign (at least through hitting level 33 out of 50 and getting the final campaign achievement, End of the Line), but most of this was essentially just grinding the same kind of missions I'd already completed a dozen times over. Further, it's not a loot-fest at all - basically you just get to pick one of three or so items for each slot from the store each time you hit a new tier of 5 levels.\n\nThe Echoes do look amusing and provide for on-the-fly character customization for each level, and some of the boss fights are amusing when the controls aren't actively getting in your way of completing them, but all in all I can't really recommend this game at any price. It's just not fun.\n\nSorry, Robot Entertainment.

It isn't a deep game, every level boils down to either 'shoot things' or 'don't get shot', but that has a certain mindless appeal.  The levels are short, and it's easy to digest quick matches when you only have 5 or 10 minutes to sit, which is nice.\n\nThe game has a few bugs, none of them game-ending.  The most annoying one I found was clicking on the bottom right of the screen (where your active powers are) sometimes minimizes the game for no discernable reason.  The game itself doesn't pause when this happens, so sometimes by the time I had brought the game back up I would be dead.\n\nThere is a story that you follow, which is minimal but adequate.  Gear progression is reasonable, although I found myself shoe-horned into a certain type of gun because of a certain mission type that only rewards that type of gun.\n\nOverall the game is a simple distraction, and if you need something mindless to fill the time it's probably worth it. That being said, you aren't missing anything special if you don't pick it up.","February 23, 2014","true","18.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

However, it's another IOS title, that has been given a port to PC.  Am looking forward to them doing another full PC game, most likely that'll be Orcs Must Die 3, but after having played Hero Academy, I was alright with trying out another IOS title from them.\n\nSurprisingly it is better then expected.  I went into this purchase with very low expectations, because I hadn't heard anything about it, you couldn't google much about it, and their certainly was little to no youtube reviews about it, so I really went into this game puchase blind, which after the CONSORTIUM fiasco (Don't Buy CONSORTIUM) really made me hesitant about buying another game so soon with such little information out there about it.\n\nThis game is a Hack & Slash, Side Scrolling, at times having a brawler feel, with RPG Leveling and Equipment "stats" elements.  It has a lot of depth, for being IOS, and it's a great port to PC, so much so, that if you didn't know it was IOS, you might not suspect it being an IOS game initially.  Although after about an hour of play through, it gets to a hint where it asks you to touch the screen, that's kind of a dead giveaway :D:\n\nThe game is definately best played in short bursts.  It was meant to be a time killer on the go, and you may want to just play it when taking short breaks from other games, or while killing time waiting for other friends to log in.\n\nIt also has a friend network, where you can borrow a unit from your friend for a mission.  Your friend will recieve the mission rewards at the end.  Which I feel is a neat feature, but it also gives you a little bit of that "Facebook" vibe.\n\nRight now it is 20 percent off, and you get a free copy of Orcs Must Die 2 with that purchase, so if you already own that title, then it's a great game to gift a friend.  However if you don't own Orcs Must Die 2, but have thought about buying it, then now is the time, because buying this game is like getting Orcs Must Die 2 half off, and getting Echo Prime for free!  No time to buy it like the present!\n\n4/5 Stars on PC  5/5 Stars if you buy it to play on your Tablet","February 5, 2014","true","15.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Think OMD and OMD2.\n\nPlot is almost comically rushed. "Hi I'm a spaceman - oh god my ship is being attacked - hey look an alternate universe." Ridiculous.\n\nGameplay is TERRIBLE. Movement is almost entirely mouse based (wasd are used for dodge rolls), with the mouse serving as both a movement and attack command, meaning running from an enemy who has approached you is nearly impossible. To add icing, the game switches automatically to melee when enemies are close, meaning if you're a distance fighter and spent a ton on a fancy gun, you can only use it when enemies aren't running towards you, which is almost never.\n\nCombat in OMD was excellent. The weapon selection was diverse and interesting in both games and allowed the user to choose their own playstyle and fight from wherever they wanted. Better still, they could run wherever they wanted as well, be it to the frontlines or away from a losing battle. In Echo Prime, you get a gun and a sword, and only the gun has any sort of variety. Furthermore, clicking anywhere on the screen when an enemy is at point blank will make the spaceman lunge TOWARDS the enemy. First thing I did was upgrade my dodge distance so I could roll far enough away from enemies to be able to use the move option again, since mouse movement is the fastest way to escape, but dodging is the only thing the user has full control of.\n\nAlso, the tutorials are completely underinformative. You can dodge and shoot in the same command by clicking and dragging away from an enemy, which is what I do the vast majority of the time, but the tutorial never mentions this. I found this out accidentally shortly before dying, where I also learned the QA team didn't press the dodge roll buttons during the death animation, or they would have found out you can make the spaceman wiggle around most absurdly as he keels over.\n\nThe extra features are nice-ish. Boosts and abilities come from aliens called Echoes. You can use other players' echoes during missions to borrow their powers for one mission and in return, give them experience to be used toward upgrades. You can pay in-game money to pick an Echo from your list of friends, but there's no real reason to. Odds are the ability wont make much of a difference. Most of them are uselesss, weak attacks with long cooldowns or piddling increases to things like attack, defense, or critical chance. The only ones I used modified dodge distance and healing, since dodging is so important and taking damage is so easy what with the stupid, suicidal player character.\n\nOverall, the game is just nowhere near as fun, addicting, or polished as OMD or OMD2. I love Robot, but I hate Echo Prime.","August 25, 2014","false","3.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Surprisingly, the game does quite well on PC, although it could be just a bit better.\n\nFor a mobile port, Echo Prime does a certainly good job. The only issue I have with this port is that the game still plays like a mobile game, you touch, or in this case, click, to fire your weapon or move. The game would have been immensely better had WASD movement been implemented, while still maintaining the click-to-shoot mechanic. As it stands, you’re unable to fire when walking/running, which is fairly annoying considering WASD movement could have been implemented without any impact towards balance.\n\nThe game is split into multitudes of “worlds” and levels. Each level does not take long to complete, but there’s quite a bit of them. I’d estimate maybe four hours to beat the game? That’s plenty of content for a game like this.\n\nOh, and there’s an arena mode, which I spent a lot of my time in. The arena is my favorite place to be while playing Echo Prime. Infinite enemies coming at you in waves, all in good fun. That, combined with the game’s customization options, really make the game shine. There’s plenty of upgrades and weapons available for unlock and purchase as you go through the game, leveling up.\n\nI can’t say I recommend the game at its full price of $10, but if you’re able to pick it up during a sale, then go for it.","February 12, 2014","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Items also level up with each kill,so the more you use an item the better it gets. There are no character classes,other races etc typical with rpgs,so in that sense it falls behind.\n\nFor me,the game's appeal is the action-rpg style mixed with fast paced shooter mechanics.I like the fast combat,smaller maps and collecting loot.I also like how I can play 10-20 minutes,have fun, and feel satisfied.\n\nThis is not a game that requires an investment of time/money to be enjoyable,nor is it a AAA game or an epic story driven saga.

The echo's are a bit interesting, but the game itself is not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/255030/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","So Robot Entertainment came out with a PC port for their iOS game Echo Prime. In this game you will be playing the part of an Enforcer who somehow survives an attack that should have done everyone in. You are saved by an Echo. Now this time around Echoes are other worldly beings that come from all over the galaxy/universe, and are here to help augment their powers with yours to allow you to survive and take on all that seems to be threatening not only you but the echoes as well.\n\nGraphically I have to say that I'm impressed with this port. I'm not sure if they had to do a major overhaul to get this game up and running on the PC, but I have to say that this game looks like it belongs on the PC. The best part of the graphics of the game, in my opinion is the fact that the weapons and armor that you will be equipping are actually shown on your character. There are too many games that try to do a generic set of armor for specific levels of items, and it is refreshing to see that level of detail go in to the game. The other thing is that I liked the different looks of the areas I had to battle through, there was a subterranean feel to some levels, different space ships, lab facilities, and even an ice planet feel. The other thing was the amount of enemies and the subtle, yet deadly changes that come with them.\n\nAll the music in the game felt like it belonged in a space themed game, but there was enough variety to not make the music monotonous in the background. Now of course since this is a port of an iOS game, I'm not surprised that there were no voices added to the game, would it have been a nice extra bonus, sure, but it really wasn't needed as the focus was where it needed to be in this game, the combat.\n\nSo the controls of the game had to be pretty simple. You are going to use the mouse to click to where you want to move. You are going to use the mouse to select an enemy to attack, if you hold the mouse button down you are going to keep attacking that enemy until it is dead. If you hold down the left shift you can stay in place and just attack. You are going to have the chance to have up to 6 different hotkey actions if you would like, though most of those aren't going to be an option until you are a good chunk into the game. Now of course one of the REALLY REALLY nice things about this game is that you have the ability to re-map the entire setup, so if you feel that you would play better with different buttons to dodge (that's WASD by the way), or perhaps you would like to have your hot keys closer you can do that too. Oh and of course you are going to need to master the blocking mechanic in the game, that's set as the right mouse button. If you can do it at the right time you can take no damage or you can reflect a shot.\n\nI am going to come out and say it right off the bat, I have played WAY too much of this game, I should have written the review of this game quite a while ago, but I was having so much fun trying to collect over 60 different echoes, each with different abilities, some with passive abilities, some with active abilities, and of course a couple that had one of each. There are a hefty number of side (optional) missions that you can go on, I have played through almost every single one of them, and you will find that there's even a ton of items to really spec out your character.\n\nSpeaking of items and echoes, there's an interesting dynamic at play with this game, if you want to really power up all your echoes as fast as possible, and perhaps find them faster, you are going to want weaker armor and weapons. The reason is that after so many kills you are able to attune that item and it will either increase the experience of an echo, or introduce you to a new one. Now every echo only has one level and once you have surpassed it they will just generate you money. At the end of missions is when you can do the regular leveling up if you wish to take that path. There's also an enhancement option that allows the echoes to level up faster and produce more currency. The best part is that NONE of it is microtransaction driven.\n\nSo here's the deal, you need to get this game. If you like hack and slash games, you are going to need to add this to your collection stat. Are the fighting mechanics the tightest? No they are not, but you have to remember that this is an iOS port where you are handcuffed to just tapping on the screen. Can you over come that obstacle and find a game that will eat up hours of your time? Absolutely I've logged just over 20 hours and yearn for more. To end this review I have to say that Robot Entertainment continues to release quality products, yes I know its a port, but they didn't just slap it on to a different platform they made it feel like it belonged there, and for that I have to give this game a 9.4 out of 10.","March 25, 2014","true","22.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I stopped just to write this review and encourage gamers to picks this up. No, it's not a megalithic AAA title to beat all titles, it won't cure hoof in mouth disease, or make Justin Bieber move to Belarus. Yes it's a port from a tablet or some such gizmo but so what?\n\nThe game has an interesting social factor in that it is sort of a stripped down Spore concept. What I mean is that as you progress through the game you will acquire new echoes. These echoes give you more powers and these echoes belong to other players. When you use them, the other player(s) receive echo points for leveling, etc.\n\nEach mission is a bite sized bit o' gaming goodness and the combat simulators you encounter are a real blast.\n\nNote for gamers who don't like using controllers: this gem plays beautifully with mouse and keyboard. The only real artifact to tablet play would be in using powers that must be activated. In the heat of battle, you'll have to click on the power to use it, so, survey your situation quickly.Movement and attacking is accomplished by clicking the left mouse button; you block by clicking the right mouse. Dodging is accomplished by using the WASD keys and it is FAST. Dodging is actually a very nice mechanic in that you quickly can dodge into enemies and slice 'em to bits, so use it offensively as well!\n\nMy only concern would be longevity. This game, while having a lot of randomization, doesn't seem to have a mechanism to start a new campaign. This reminds me a bit of Darkspore in that you couldn't start over. But, perhaps there is endgame content or the ability to start again at a higher difficulty. But, if not, for 7.99 USD, this is still a fun romp.\n\nSo, see you in the multiverse!!!","January 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

As a mobile game I'm certain I would have liked it quite a bit.  However, as a PC game it is just ok...and almost not quite that.  I'm not trolling here, despite what some people might think.  If you take a mobile game and release it on the PC then that's what you get.  A mobile game on the PC.  The simplified games that I often play on my phone or iPad are not very interesting when you put them on the computer in almost all cases.\n\nNow I knew nothing about this game.  I just saw it on the Steam front page.  The video made it seem very action packed.  What I got of course was mobile pacing which was likely limited for mobile devices.  I get that, but my computer isn't a phone.\n\nYou can not use a controller (yet) but the mouse and keyboard work fine.  This pretty much boils down to using the mouse for everything except the active abilities.  Click to move, click to shoot.  This is fine but again this is a mobile mechanic transfered to a computer version.  A little effort into cross platform distro would be nice.\n\nOn the good side, the Echo system is pretty cool.  The artwork for the Echo cards are good and the abilities are interesting enough.  Had this been fleshed out before release on Steam I would probably have though it was awesome, but as it is I have to say it's ok.\n\nIt's not like it's an $60 game or anything anyway.  Give it a try if you are looking for something simple.  There is definitely potential here.","January 28, 2014","true","0.6"," 45 of 109 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","45","109","0","16"

The moves are designed for tapping, and rather unnatural to play on keyboard and mouse. The graphics are merely OK, and the rooms gets repetitive very quickly. The game quickly falls into an "equipment grind" as you basically play the game to get "credits", and the credits lets you buy better gear, which will allow you to play tougher levels, for more loot credits, ad infinitum.\n\nThe idea is not bad. You start as an enforcer, armed with a gun and a sword/blade, you suddenly have to deal with invasion of your universe through this wormhole. Fortunately, you get help of "Echoes" from other multiverses who were also being invaded, and you lend each other special bonuses like extra defense, special attack like "freeze". As you fight you pick up "credits" that you can use to upgrade your kit (gun, sword, armor, helmet, special single-use artifacts that works over a couple missions but needs to be repurchase).\n\nThe kits work much like Diablo-type games... Each item has attributes, and the are bazillion of them with different attributes, and level requirements. As you level up, you'll get access to higher grade weapons with corresponding level requirements, and more power, like more long distance damage, fire damage, more critical hits, etc. Similarly, with armor, you'll get general defense, defense against fire, against ice, against criticals, etc.\n\nThe missions generally comes in three types: corridor crawl, timed defense, and arena.\n\nCorridor crawl has you moving right along a corridor, killing all enemies. There are occasional "barrels" or such that can explode, or leave a hazard on the floor, and you need to make it through the end without dying.\n\nTimed defense requires you to defend a device or reactor against all comers. This can be a bit dangerous as you can't take it slow, and enemies comes from two sides, sometimes together.\n\nArena is a simulation where you basically fight until "death" against all sorts of enemies for as many waves as you can.\n\nThe problem with this game is it gets repetitive and boring very quickly. It is okay as a mobile game where you play a few levels at a time, but as a PC game, it feels sorely lacking, too simple, etc. etc.\n\nGraphics are decent, and sound is tolerable. This is a small and cheap game to be played until you tire of it.","November 3, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun to play for short periods of time, could really do with co-op or multiplayer though. Maybe a few more level or enemy designs but it makes up for this with all the armor and weapon options you get. Can get a little boring at times and has very very clunky controls. I don't suggest you buy it at full retail price.","February 9, 2014","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mobile port and I think it belongs on mobile rather than on PC. It's a great time waster, its fun to progress through the worlds conquering bosses and enemies, but there just isn't enough to do to justify having it on PC.","June 4","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
