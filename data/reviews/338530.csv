However, it's a complete ghost town- as of writing this there's one server up with nobody on it (and then that server ejects me after five seconds of waiting, which I don't entirely understand.)\n\nIf you're willing to buy copies for all your friends (or your friends actually have money), absolutely buy this game. Otherwise... yeah.\n\nOn a slightly related note, I think this is a game that's been crippled by Early Access- the launch hype was too spread out and it wasn't able to solidify a good player base. If the dev(s) had instead kept Beta exclusive to youtubers with the intention of building hype, I think there would've been a sufficient playerbase at launch to keep this going.

Quite a few that may never come to be. Trouble In The Manor is a great game and does what it's meant to do.\n\nEven for an early access release this game has already reached close to it's full potential in terms of gameplay. Perhaps more maps and a few more weapons down the road could be added but the gameplay is already there. I have yet to experience any bugs at the time of writing this review.\n\nThere is a whole lot of games taking a stab at copying 'Trouble In Terrorist Town' (as I already said), but this one does it best by far. And the developer is dedicated to the game and very friendly. I highly recommend this game.\n\n* Update (11/11/15) *\nIt has been a number of months (3 months and some time) since the last time this game was updated.

It's an extremely good, and addicting game. I've met some really cool people who really make the game fun to play. The only issues I have with the game currently, is lack of players (just came out), and a few bugs (nothing too major.)\n\nThe game takes a lot of influence from Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist town, where you have 3 classes; Detective, Innocent, and the Traitors. This game has 4; Bloodhound (essentially like the Detective), Innocent, Murder (like the Traitors), and Vampires. The object is the same; track down, and deduce who the murders are. However, as a murder you can become a vampire, and infect others so that they too can become Vampires, creating your whole army of Vampires.\n\nAs an innocent, you really need to stick with the bloodhounds (detectives) to try and track down the murders.  The bloodhounds can use a DNA scanner to try and match who the killer is with the victim's corpse, or can even use a seance to talk with the dead to gain information about who the culprit is. The murder is by far the most fun to play as. Lie and decieve is your game, and with many tools/weapons in your arsenal, it's an absolute blast to lie and stab your way to victory.\n\nYou'll need to collect coins spread out throughout the manor, and in some objects, to be able to purchase weapons, teleporters, and other tools at your disposal. Keep in mind, each class has a different loadout out, e.x. a murder can purchase a flamethrower, but a innocent can't.\n\nFor the price of $5.49 in it's current state, I highly recommend this game. I've put in almost 7 hours, and I'm still having an absolute blast playing this game, and learning more about the game.\n\nWith a great, and active community, I can only see this game getting better.\n","July 3, 2015","true","21.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is really fun, but don't think it's going to be easy. Murderers have to plan out their kills, making sure to blend in with the innocent, but at the same time choose their next victim! There are so many little tricks, like teaming up with a vampire teamate and making innocent players run into a spike trap is satisfying! So many ways to kill, so little time! Remote bombs, Vampires, Spike traps are really fun to try out; did I mention that you can also poison rooms and turn off the lights?\n\nNever the same gameplay, I'm always finding new ways to avoid getting caught, or avoiding vampires!

This game is not completely dead.\n\n\nAnd you are correct on the settings, we are trying to update the game but unfortunately the game engine software we used is having an issue getting the Steam SDK to launch properly so we have to wait for them to update that. Until then we can't update the game.==\n\nSo Heres the full scope of it, The game doesnt have a huge playerbase because he cannot market it, and apparently he is working alone on this project. He also seems to plan on continuing to work on it despite taking it out of early access (I hope that holds up, i doubt he would have responded personally if he didnt plan to)\n\nSo Based on gameplay, yes, its a good game, but buy it for some friends or get them to buy it, because in the few times i checked the servers were dead.\n\nSmall indie devs like this can make the best game in the universe but wont get anywhere without some marketing, and without funding to pay for some kind of AD, he really only has word of mouth or youtubers. So my challenge to the one or two people who will see this, is try not to let this game die. Its not a bad game, its like a mix of garrys mod's murder game with the art of the escapists, its a great concept and an inexpensive game with a good art style, its worth trying or playing with friends. Its easy to complain about the game having no one on it, but players are the only ones who can change that!","January 12","true","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/recommended/338530/","mysocks","Valex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/","1136 products in account","Edit: Please read the comments for the respectful developer reply on the matter before taking the negative context of this review to heart.\nExcerpt: "If you read the discussions in the steam forums, there's a topic about new designs for the game in the future which should fix most problems (mainly connection problems and latency problems)."\nComments also contain further elaboration on issues I've noted.\n(Not sure what happened to my earlier review, so here's a reiteration:)\n\nThis game suffers from:\n1. Lousy User Interface.\n2. No tutorial\n3. Lacking core things that should have been implemented before leaving Early Access [like an options menu] not in the game yet,\n4. Plenty of bugs, poor syncing, and crashing\n5. No server population, and given its stability issues, you may run into trouble just trying to run with friends\n6: Few roles implemented, only a single randomized free-for-all-style mode implemented\n\nOn the flip side, the gameplay was fun- though it seemed a bit imbalanced and is clearly designed with more, rather than less players in mind.\n\nIt's not a bad game, just one that left EA too early and lacks in population.\n\nIf it's ever stabilized and fleshed out, and if you manage to grab some friends for it, it could be a good time.\n\nAs far as gameplay:\nStatic map layout, but room contents change each load-up\nYour role is selected at start. Each role has different room interactables and shop purchases.\nAll characters move at the same speed, so pinning people or cornering them into traps is key, but that's impossible with too few players [nevermind all the teleporting and failed contact recognition and so forth the game suffers from].\n\nHonestly, as fun as a game as it is, it's lacking depth for long term play, and when you factor in the incomplete nature of it, it's incredibly hard to recommend.\n\nPlus side, it dropped in price to $1, and steam refunds exist, so by all means, give it a shot and decide for yourself. :)","February 14","false","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","6"
