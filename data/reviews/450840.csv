I liked the idea but this isn't finished yet. There are too many problems with the gameplay. Not worth the price of admission... fix it up and resubmit. Personally, I am requesting a refund - maybe I'll look at it again when you fix the problems.\n\nSo I have been chastised for not listing the things wrong with the game... There are too many things wrong to list. How much time do you have? Let's just start with a few.\n\n1. There is no intro/back story. Who am I? Why am I wearing Abe Lincoln's hat and brandishing a flamethrower? What kind of parent is my Dad that I have to go to Hell and save him? Where is my Mom, and why doesn't she stop this insanity?!\n2. You can't walk and fire at the same time.\n3. Aiming at an angle is nigh impossible.\n4. The camera gets blocked and you are fighting blind.\n5. The enemies get stuck on various things (I used this to my advantage and killed Shaab easily.)\n6. How do I heal poor Timmy?!\n7. If the portal is going to open in 10 minutes, shouldn't the timer count down?\n8. THERE IS NO RESTART! You have no choice but to QUIT the game if you die.\n9. Why is there a SPEECH volume control... WHEN THERE IS NO SPEECH?\n10. I'm just exhausted now... can't continue listing things...\n\nGOOD THINGS ABOUT THE GAME\n1. Music by Kevin MacLeod\n2. I promptly got my refund.","March 10","false","0.3"," 167 of 178 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","167","178","10","8"

This kind of thing gets old in really short order.\n\nI saw the Jimpressions episode on it months ago, and thought he'd been rather scathing towards it.\n\nI, Lord Crocosquirrel, hereby admit to being wrong. If anything, he was being overly nice to it.\n\nDownright polite, if what I've seen of it is any indication. Not that I made it any farther than he did.\n\nHere's the why:\n\nFirst, it's a "horror" game on Steam that was made by an indie dev. I've seen a few good ones, but the overwhelming majority are a pile of flaming squirrel dung.\n\nOptions Menu: Slider for voice control when there's no voice acting. That's a minor thing, admittedly, but it foreshadows the rest of the experience.\n\nShoddy controls:  It has controller support, but the only thing that works is the left analog stick. Not a single button works. The keyboard controls work, but are so laggy as to be nearly useless. Might as well just stand there. It's not like littel Timmy is going to turn in place anyway.\n\nGraphics Quality: The less said about this the better. The environments have been hacked together from Unity assets, and the model of the boy in his spiffy hat looks like it was done by a pack of drunken gerbils. Hell's armies are Nazi stormtroopers, and we don't talk about the mummy you have to kill right off the bat.\n\nGameplay: In the description of the stream I did on this game and a trio of other, less s**t games, I said the game was Digital Homicide levels of Bad. I stand by that statement. You can't turn in place, so kiting an enemy is pretty much out, the flamethrower won't follow you, but keeps emitting the way you were facing. Firing at an angle is difficult at best.\n\nTo put a big red bow on the entire mess that's supposed to be combat, not only have we no way to heal, not only does the enemy not even have to be facing your direction to kill you dead, but you have to line up with your target pixel-perfectly and hold it there, or you're not going to do ANY damage. No real audiovisual feedback, so you don't know if you're going to kill it soon or it's going to beat you to death with a stick from three hundred kilometers away.\n\nThe little pink bow comes when you die, and you inevitably will. You have to quite to desktop before you can restart, and the cutscenes aren't skippable. You can't even click through the text.\n\nThe *music* is just fine-- taken from Incompetech, of course, but I'm guilty of that myself. No foul there, and in fact that was probably the ONLY intelligent thing the developer did.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm not giving this a recommendation. Avoid as if your very soul depended on you NOT playing this game. There are better games out there that cost much, much less. Go play those. Seriously.","June 2","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
