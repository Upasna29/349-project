It is not your usual moege nor an otomege in fact I was quite a surprise for me since I did judge it from its cover at the start and I did not expect much at all. Magical Eyes - Red is for Anguish is developed by  POMERA Studios and publish by Fruitbat Factory It has 1 ending but has choices, choices that use a reasoning system that unlocks bonus content upon successful answer. It will not affect the ending in any way except for S rank scenarios unlock and materials unlock.\n\nThe StoryIn the middle of the night on a certain day of April 201X, the left arm of the owner of a general store is chopped off in the backyard of his own store. Even though he claims that the perpetrator is a 'doll' that was kept in the store, his words carry little weight due to the lack of other witnesses. The doll and the detached arm are gone from the scene of crime. Where could they be? No one knows and it is up to the reader to read through it to unfold the mystery slowly with clues provided.\n\nThe story is like a roller coaster it starts off slow but for this a little slower than usual then at the climax this roller coaster just went 90 degrees down the slope which absorbs the reader into the story in which this case me it was really exciting and i felt the thrill. I loved the pacing of the story its really well paced though some people may find the start a little too slow. But it will be worth. It uses a map-based scene selection and you can get to see things through characters point of view.\n\nCharacters are extremely memorable, each of them are unique and have some special traits about them. Lets take for example, Nanashi his first impression he gave off was he is no different than any other business man that has 2 - 3 faces to slap. The kind side of his will appear when you have money to spend and the other side when you have no money. His character introduction was so funny I literally laughed when he called Yuu a fashion model and then did a 180 degree face turn when he finds out that he has no money on him to spend. But on the contrary he is quite a caring person just that he hides it well. Overall all of the characters are really memorable and will definitely leave an impact on the reader as it did leave a strong impression on me.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsBackground, CGs  art – Backgrounds are made with 3D CG backgrounds and unfortunately I am nor exactly a fan of it. I do not like it that much and would prefer 2D backgrounds over 3D backgrounds. Why? Because 3D backgrounds looks a little too bland and in this case it does not compliment well with the art style that is being used here for the character sprites. But as for the CGs and sprites both of them are is consistent with each other and looks detailed. Overall it is good, just that the 3D backgrounds may be off putting for some people.\n\nAudio Elements –The audio is really good for this particular VN the sound effects are very realistic that it manages to send down shivers down my spine as it manages to set the mood and make things flow from then on at certain parts of the VN. For example, at an action scene it made used of sound effects which made when the doll that was dragging a weapon, while the weapon is scraping against the floor gets louder and louder as she gets closer to the victim in the VN. It did a very good job of immersing the reader into the action and atmosphere.\n\nTo Sum UpTo sum up do I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer, yes I did enjoyed it and it did a good job of captivating the reader [me] and kept me nice in place to finish it with a sense of satisfaction. It is well worth your time and money for sure and for people who likes mystery with slight hints of horror this is the VN for you.\n\nSome people may find that this character Chiharu have not much impact in this game well the reason is quite simple. Magical Eyes - Red is for Anguish is just the first part and there is more that is called "indigo blue heaven" that has not yet been released yet you will be able to see that after completing the game. For people who have completed this VN do re-watch the OP as there are many hints and you can get to see almost every character that is mentioned in Magical Eyes - Red is for Anguish.\nLastly I would like to thank Fruitbat Factory  for providing me a review copy.\n\nClick here[azusantiara.com] for full review with images etc\n\nA guide I have created can be found here.[azusantiara.com]\n\nNote using this guide may have spoilers use it at your own risk.","March 31","true","25.9"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","47","52","6","8"

While the plot starts off really slow, even for the Visual Novel standpoint, it really does setup a story of mystery regarding a mysterious doll that has mysterious circumstances following it. The characters aren't the strongest, in fact, some of them are rather boring, but the main intrigue is what does the plot justice here. The love story that's intertwined, while touching, can bring the plot off its tracks. In particular, it feels disjointed, like two main plot threads are fighting each other for the spotlight, like the game doesn't know who should be the main focus here, and only rarely do they truly intersect. Look, it's a visual novel, there's barely any gameplay here besides the decision making and “quiz” sections, and if you're looking for something like Danganronpa here, you're going to be disappointed. And for general Visual Novel fans, the writing isn't strong enough to propel them for a purchase. But if you specifically like supernatural mysteries, there's a good world here that's built, and one that kept me interested in the 6 hours of story telling.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe mystery and supernatural elements of the plot are intriguing, and make you want to dive deep into this world's lore and the concepts it plays with.\nGood length for the story in question. Slow to start, but does have one strong arc that ends reasonably in terms of that sub-plot.\nGreat characterization and redemption story for one of the side human characters, that made him shine compared to everyone else. He may be a minor character at first, but he becomes the most interesting character at the end, despite the whole super natural beings part.\nDespite my problems with it at times, you do feel chemistry between the love interests and it does make you wonder what's in store for them during the plot.\nExtras do a good job of posing “what ifs” and little answers for the future of the franchise. Very good in the teaser element.\nSome reasonable artwork.\nMusic is appropriate with minor exceptions for the tone and feeling of the story.\nNegatives:\nThe plot starts up really really slow. It tries to set the world in question, and it takes a significant amount of time to set the concepts and backdrop. If you need engaging plot right away, this may be a problem, as you'll be really confused for the first two or so hours.\nMain love interest needs more identity out of the gate. Gets to the point of “ok, the only defining feature is that she loves the protagonist”. Eventually that changes, but it takes way too long to get there.\nTransition problems between romance and mystery elements. Feels like two separate plots, and they don't necessarily play well together.\nThe game doesn't look like it's a series at first, but keep that in mind. If you're looking for complete closure on things, you won't get it, as there's another story on the way.\nSome of the characters are....well boring.","March 30","true","5.9"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","43","51","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/recommended/366780/","Zetto_","Zetto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/","253 products in account","Magical Eyes is a great supernatural action/mystery VN with some pretty high quality production values and light interactive elements in the form of multiple choice question segments the game calls "reasoning mode".\n\nIn this world, there are things called Variants, which are basically a kind of spirit that manifests in various forms when there is an excess of some emotion from a human that lasts even after their death.\n\nThese variants and their strong emotions can be very dangerous to humans (their powers very much supernatural) and end up causing a lot of harm. That's where "Disobeyers" come in. These are people who are like Variants, but still living. They've formed an organization to deal with these variants as they show up, and work with the local police, opting to not really stay hidden so much as bank on the idea that their abilities are so fantastical that no one would really believe them anyway if someone claimed to have seen them. And it works!\n\nOur Protagonist, Yuu Amakura, is not only one of those Disobeyers, but a top one, and throughout the game we see him and several folks from the organization take on a case concerning a mysterious moving doll, with some minor perspective shifts between his love interest and various other characters who might not seem important at first glance, but might be in sequels that seem certain to come out, as the events in this game feel like a leading on to something more going on.\n\nThe game tone wise feels like an anime you'd think was currently airing, and funnily enough, the game does have an opening cinematic that sometimes plays when you finish a chapter of the game, very much as though you were watching an anime. There are two "episodes" in this one, the prologue, chapter 0, and Chapter 1, which is basically the main story of the game.\n\nThe music, visuals and overall presentation are top notch. The music is varied that there's a good amount of tunes that are only played for one small part of the game, all fitting the mood pretty well. The character designs have a very nice style and the backgrounds and CGs are well drawn. The backgrounds are also 3D rendered, and I find it looks pretty neat. There's even an awesome Shin Megami Tensei style map hud that you use to go from place to place and progress on with the story. The voice actors sound really good to me, and the game functions pretty well. I only encountered one bug and it was fixed just about as soon as I mentioned it. Fruitbat Factory doesn't mess around with having things work.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game, is the reasoning mode. With a name like that I thought there might have been a system similar to phoenix wright where you'd have clues and try to deduct something plot important from the clues you've gathered. In reality what you have is a multiple choice segment that pops up at the end of every chapter to see if you remembered what's going on in the story. Getting it all right leads to extra scenarios being unlocked, getting it all wrong, apparently doesn't have any negative effects that I can see anyway. I haven't tried to get it all wrong, but I did mess around a bit and couldn't see any real difference. This also makes me feel as though the mystery part currently isn't so pronounced as the action/supernatural parts, but perhaps things will change in the sequels?\n\nI do know that I enjoyed the game enough to definitely want to see more from Studio Pomera. The world is intriguing and the characters are all enjoyable. It again seems to point to something larger coming up, but what can it be? Who knows. Overall a great VN at a great price for anyone interested in VNs that have supernatural, action and mystery elements to them.","April 1","true","10.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Generally good quality, lots of nice sprites and systems (if somewhat underused). Good pacing and flow, mix of humor and drama, and better fight scenes than I'd normally expect in a smaller game like this. The backgrounds are a little undetailed 3d but I dont think that's a problem.\n\nThe game is a complete story in itself, but it's also a first episode setting up for future stories in the same world, so some side issues will not be resolved. Player interaction is limited. There's no branching other than whether or not to play the optional scenes, and the occasional are-you-paying-attention quiz that unlocks a few more optional scenes if you get the questions right.\n\nThis is not a fanservice title, there aren't even any girls visible other than the protagonist's sole love interest and his (adorable) little sister.\n\nGet it if you like low-powered urban fantasy. (Supernatural stuff exists, but is relatively infrequent and not known to the greater public.)","April 18","true","4.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Think Fault:milestone one in the way the story grows and comes together at the end, but without fault's obvious cliffhanger.\n\nThe production values are quite good. I'm not sure what to praise more - the character art, the backgrounds, the music or how dynamic some of the scenes are. It's definitely not a run-of-the-mill visual novel.\n\nLast but not least, I have to give props to the VAs as they do an excellent job of conveying the characters. It certainly helped pull me even more into the story.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that if you like your thrillers/mysteries/character drama/magical world stories, I think you'll enjoy this one as is.

So if u like mystery genre then u will like this VN. Just a small bit is that this VN does start slow. Once u get past the slow part of the game the VN will start to pick up.\n\nThis VN u will play as Yuu, Chiharu, and another side that is ???, The ??? is for because u will be playing through other's POV. Although u will play more of Yuu's side in this VN.\n\nI really liked the characters a lot. I can't decide who is my favorite. Probably Rin and Pops:) Also the characters have voice acting in this:) Only Yuu doesn't have a voice though.\n\nI really liked the music in this VN. the music was very nice.\n\nThe BG I had to get used to because at first I didn't like them. Then as I got used to the BG I started to like them.\n\nAlso something important to notice is that there is a sequel to this game called Indigo Blue Heaven. So u will not get all answers in just Red Is For Anguish. This might be the reason why Yuu is mute in this VN. I assume Indigo Blue Heaven u will play more as Chiharu. If that is also the case then maybe Yuu will have a voice in Indigo Blue Heaven and not Chiharu this time.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this VN a lot and recommend anyone else to try this VN. Just again note that there is a sequel called Indigo Blue Heaven which I cannot wait to play:)","April 11","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let see...\n\nWell firstly, the novel had pleasant graphics and animation. They were a bit repetitive though, a standard in the genre I guess. During fight scenes the repetition almost got disturbing however. Also, a more seamless fitting of the characters into the milieu would be appreciated. Or do people really just stand there in other visual novels as well? This much? Why not have them sit, sip their tea, point to things, show emotion with their body etc.? Voice acting was also on the positive side. It seemed quite natural (at least to a non-Japanese) and was well in sync with the English text. No complaints\nabout the music either.\n\nNow about the text... some of it was pretty highbrow-level, which is mostly okay but at times can feel a bit silly if not used with caution. It can make the text unscrupulously vexatious. A small sample of words and phrases from one little part of the novel:\n\natone, rebuke, gorge, emphatic, impassive, "in response to specific remarks", "That's indubitably the reason for the baton relay-like exchanges"...\n\nBiggest let down for me was that there wasn't enough action, romance, suspense, twists or general pizzazz. There was some of this and some that, yes, but no single element seemed very dominant. Not that I could see. This was a mystery novel sure... but seemed apologetic about it by dishing out other elements as well, ending up one knick-knack shop of a story. On some level reading MERIFA was like going to a museum, you yourself needed to make it interesting, give it some effort. The entertainment did not really jump at you enough. But that's just my taste as a member of the ADD-generation. In fact, if they continue writing this or stories like this, the makers could very soon be the Stephen Kings of visual novels... in good and bad. That reminds me of the youtube video "Stephen The Lesbian", now there's entertainment that jumps at you! Anyway, thanks for the ride ~\n","April 14","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
