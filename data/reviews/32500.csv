My standards for review scores are 10 starting points, and -1 point for everything done wrong. Before I continue, I need to state that I am not biased towards any particular gaming company or extended universe/lore. I review the game as it should be reviewed -- as a time waster. Things done right in this game are below:\n\nGreat Graphics\n\nLightsaber Combat and Force Powers Done Right\n\nMany Customization Options (Including several costumes [Just for aesthetics] and many lightsaber crystals which give you different upgrades)\n\nThe game has done a good job with capturing the atmosphere of the environments, especially Kamino\n\nThings done wrong are below:\n\nThe Story is atrocious, no debate. And with the story being a major point of any game, an extra point is taken off. -2 points.\n\nThe player character is a mix of blandness and unoriginality, however, at times, you can feel like an indestructible god, choosing who lives and who dies which provides a fun experience. Not enough to keep a point, however, so -1 point.\n\nFinally, Quick Time Events (QTE's) are abundant, and repetitive. -1 more point.\n\nThe final score for this game is: 6/10. While being a good Star Wars game, it still has enough flaws to put it at an average rating. In my opinion, if you haven't gotten this game yet, get it. Even though it doesn't have the highest rating, it can still be a lot of fun if you don't play a game for the story, but to waste time and have fun.","December 1, 2014","true","115.5"," 158 of 193 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","158","193","14","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/recommended/32500/","onceinathousandyears","TreiseV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/","364 products in account","It is fun to unleashed the force: stormtroopers are in air, AT-Ats get fed up with their own rockets and Vader is a nervous Sith Lord. The con of this game is that it doesn’t last long.\nThis game is high quality. The cinematics are better than the movies, the art style is gorgeous, everyone looks better(except for Juno) your force power are higher and in turn, the havoc you’ll create. The story is simple and there are some very discreet subplots(the biggest one is unlocked in the challenges). Some people have reported bugs, but they have submitted fixes as well. I for one didn’t have a problem with this game. Except for one thing. It was too short. It was like sex with someone really hot, one a day when you’re so full of energy and into it, but for a reason, it’s so short it will strike you like the Death Star.\nA good question would be: “Is the game worth buying if it’s short?”. I’ll tell you what this game has and it will be your choice if you’ll take it or leave it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436790249\nFans of its prequel will notice that old moves are still there, many unlocked from the start. You have the typical force powers: force push, force lightning, force repulse, saber throw and a new one: mind trick. They all feel powerful when used, they’re designed to be enjoyed rather than used tactically. Whether you push, stun, impale them or make them commit suicide, it’s still the same, you are unstoppable. However, they are more detailed than you can see at first glance. Mind trick makes troopers attack the others or jump to their deaths in a humorous way, lighting will overheat the jet of a trooper, resulting in his flying around without control to an explosive end. Also new to the series, there is the body dismemberment, making the sword combat more satisfying. Having two lightsabers instead of one make the protagonist to fight in a more agile and aggressive way.  Force fury is an ability that amplifies your power for a limited time. In that stance, enemies are pulverized by your power. The game itself is not hard. Unleashed mode will present something that could have been old school challenge, but gaining full health whenever checkpoints are reloaded simplifies things too much. Skydiving is fun and has its place, there are three sequences anyway. The QTE’s are the type that can be failed, but most are optional, boss battles being the only ones that require them.  Boss battles themselves are well designed, as there are multiple stages with key moments that make the real differences. The gameplay itself is one of the best.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436786831\nThe story is incomplete. Even if it doesn’t show, reading the novel(which proves the story’s potential) proves how much more there was to say. Even if you go through Kamino, Cato Nemoida, Dagobah, aboard a big rebel ship called the “Salvation” that will later engage in a space battle and facing Vader on your return to Kamino, it’s not enough. What is there is spectacular, but the canon end makes way for a sequel that will never be made.\nIn the story, you are the clone of Starkiller who inspired the creation of the rebellion. You are made stronger than the original to suit Vader’s more demanding commands.  As you retained the memories of the original, you’ll find yourself fighting the empire and looking forward for reuniting with your old love. This time around, Starkiller is the hunted one, but he has enough power to face whatever Vader is throwing at him. However he is delayed and at the end, Vader proves he can make him do his bidding.\nVader is portrayed as the menace he is in the books: manipulative and hard to take down.  He has the intellect from the original trilogy and the fighting skills from the prequel trilogy.\nThere are two endings, the light side one where the rebellion earns a major victory because of you and the dark side one, where you die, Vader stands victorious, with the perfect dark side clone at his side.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434687427\nIf you want to spend more time in the game, there are several challenges that make you use your force powers in certain ways, there are all kinds of outfits and skins to unlock(and they are worth it), holocrons to collect for getting new saber crystals(that change the sabers color and add an effect in combat), cinematics revolving around the dark clone subplot and that’s about it. If you look for more of the lore, there is a databank and concept art available.\nIt’s a well designed game, high quality, but low quantity. Star Wars fans and gamers in general(casual and hardcore) should buy this if they have the money to spare.","May 3, 2015","true","11.4"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","84","94","9","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/recommended/32500/","Tribeman","Tribeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/","452 products in account","So last week I wrote my review on Force Unleashed 1. I was impressed with the story and how well it fit in the Star Wars universe and the only major complaint I had was that the controls sometimes felt clunky, that the game could have been a LITTLE bit more than it was.\n\nI finally got around to playing this, and it feels like my opinions flipped. You play as Starkiller again, and the introduction gives a good start to WHY you are there. If you didn't play the first game before this I recommend you do, otherwise you will be totally lost. Anyway, I'll go through each section.\n\nStory: 5/10\nThe only reason the story is this high is because the first game did a magnificent job setting things up. You know your story from the first, although the Starkiller in this game doesn't remember much about his past (minor spoiler, don't worry you find this out in the openning cutscene, Vader tells you that you are a clone). You basically spend the game trying to get back to your beloved Juno's arms, that's about it. No major plot development like in the first one, nothing that helps you define yourself as a Sith or Jedi. In fact, Starkiller feels a little bit less of a badass and a bit more angsty than I would have liked.\n\nGraphics & Sound: 8/10\nThe sound is easy, they did a good job with music, it fit in well, and the whole Star Wars lightsaber/force sound effects are amazing, exactly what you expect. The graphics are polished and the cutscenes are really well done from what I could tell. There are 2 very major reasons why I don't give this game a 10/10 (keeping in mind that the game was released over 3 years ago). First of all, most of the cutscenes actually involve your character model, thus including your dual lightsabers and the crystal color you chose, which is good. The problem? The fully CGI cutscenes that are videos, they just had him with dual red lightsabers. It felt really lazy and removed me from the experience a little bit. Other games make sure their full cutscenes include the specialized weapon and armor you are wearing, don't switch me back to the original, it is really annoying. I took 1 point off for that. The second thing, while the game looks great and everything, the characters look different than from the first. General Kota and Juno specifically, and Starkiller as well but not to the same extent. They just LOOK like different people with similar features. That bothered me slightly, yes they are WAY MORE polished than before, but it detracted from their original look.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGameplay is magnificent in this. They changed the combat system and leveling system, the menus are more fluid, fighting is more fluid, FORCE POWERS ARE MORE FLUID. This was my problem in the first game, not so in here. You basically have most of your kit from the first game, and as you gain experience you unlock more force powers along with being able to upgrade them up to a maximum level of 3. This is beautiful, and being able to rapid fire Force Push (even though I never used it) is amazing. Also, put a point into Jedi Mindtrick, it is the most fun part of this game. The game felt more fluid, and I died maybe a few times to mis-timed jumps, but never because the camera screwed me or things not being responsive.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nThe story was kind of lame, and it was the only thing to take away from it. The game is short, it took me 6 hours (theres like 8 levels) and I didn't feel like it took forever. The action was amazing and the fights were fun. Everything else aside, I enjoyed this A LOT more than the first game.\n","December 16, 2013","true","6.4"," 82 of 94 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","82","94","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/32500/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Starkiller is back and this time it is personal. Waking up from what seems to be a long sleep, the obscenely powerful force adepts finds himself on Kamino in servitude to his old master. Bereft of his friends, memories and purpose, Starkiller is left with questions and he goes on a rampage to find people who can help him. Now, with 100% more lightsaber and 400% more cutscenes and quick-time events the force is unleashed once again...to much less fanfare and considerably more issues.\n\nA video game sequel traditionally follows a particular pattern: More of that and then some. Not The Force Unleashed II. No. This game is much less than its predecessor. It is shorter, less interesting in terms of plot and story. Barely changes up its gameplay formula and feels generally cheaply made. Dissapointing is the core word used to describe the overal impression of The Force Unleashed II's content and gameplay. The original had issues, but instead of addressing them, the sequel just kept a lot of them in there and added some more.\n\nIn this installment, we find a clone of the original Starkiller in Vader's service. Vader has managed to clone a jedi; something thought to be impossible. However, most clones succumb to madness from residual memories from their original self. Hellbent to not fall to insanity, Starkiller escapes to find the only two people in the galaxy left alive who can tell him who he is: General Kota, and his former love: Juno Eclipse. Starkiller hops between a few planets and even visits Yoda before finding his way back to Kamino to end up right where a started...dead.\nThe very premise of the story, Starkiller's amnesia, is a massive turn-off. Where before the story involved intrigue, betrayal and rebellion; it now merely rests on goose chases and damsels in distress. A notable improvement though is Starkiller's broadened emotional spectrum. Instead of mysterious and angry, he can now express sadness, sarcasm and joy, as well as a range of angers such as irate, furious, enraged and vengeful. A nice change up, but it is too little and too late. By the time you witness the juicy plot twist, the game ends.\n\nTo be honest, when I started the game I was biased against it. I had played it before on the PS3 and was sorely dissapointed in it. However, when I was making my way through the first few stages I noticed that the environments were signficantly more detailed, the physics worked better and the different levels of force powers were more defined. So the noticable improvements to gameplay and presentations are noticable from the start, and they capture you. John Williams' inspired score accentuates the action at the right moments and the voice acting is more convincing because the actors are a little bit more acqainted with their roles. However, the sound editing is spotty. Certain effects, such as Vader's breathing is superimposed over the score, making it an awkward ambient sound. Additionally, some hit effects were just cheaply taken from the stock sound pack and sound horribly out of place. While I was seriously considering forgiving the game for many of its flaws I couldn't overlook the glaring instability of the game. The game crashed on me more times than I care to count. Either during gameplay, or during loading. Regardless of the moment of the crash, the game would send me back to the beginning of the stage and let me do the whole thing all over again. Annoying, and sometimes infuriating, as some segments are not particularly enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay follows the same standard as the original; combat sections and the occasional force puzzle with some platforming. It is a tested formula; God of War has thrived on it. However, The Force Unleashed II lacks the variation and excitement. The sequel introduces many new enemy types that require a more distinct approch as opposed to simply slashing and shocking it, but once you find that shocking and grabbing is just as effective you quickly make short work of enemies that were supposed to make life hard for you. Boss fights do not fare much better. Mindlessly hacking away at them is the preferred method of dealing with them. When you're not hacking though, the game will simply let the cutscenes handle the action and force you to either press buttons on prompt or simply witness awesome stuff that you are not doing yourself.\nThis becomes glaringly obvious toward the end where set-pieces, corridors, bosses and cutscenes appear back to back. The final boss, Vader (screw your spoilers, you saw this coming) is a joke on many levels. Not only is he a complete pushover, he is also not even remotely like Vader. This is purely speaking as an invested Star Wars fan, but the final boss fight just rains on the entire parade.\n\nWhen the credits roll after a measly four hours you can really feel the bad taste in the back of the mouth. The game is rushed. It is polished in appearance, but the content was cut; cut with a cleaver and left on the side because there was not enough time to fully finish it. Particularly the Dagobah stage shows signs of time constraint. It feels like there should have been a stage, while the only thing there is a cutscene. Other distinct ommissions include a battle with Boba Fett, who is set up to be fought. And the most startling missing element is probably the DLC. While the consoles got another what-if story; this version doesn't even get a single costume.\n\nThe overal final product is just such a dissapointment it would incite buyers remorse within no time. Couple that with the crashes and the lack of DLC and you have a game that cannot justify its pricepoint outside of a sale. I can't reccomend it and I would even go as far as to completely dissuade Star Wars fans to play it, because it does such a poor job with Vader that it makes his appearance in Revenge of the Sith acceptable. In retrospect, I'm happy that I cancelled my pre-order all those years ago. A strong sign of the force. A sign that the force is weak with The Force Unleashed II.","October 30, 2015","false","4.2"," 379 of 537 people (71%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","71","379","537","56","10"

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is a sequel to the first game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.\n\nStar Wars: The Force Unleashed II has quite similar but enhanced gameplay from the previous game, yet I think its kinda simplified a bit too. Still good, you get to use the lightsaber and swing it on stormtroopers or AT-ST. But the whole story, the chapter is too short and I think it's somewhat repetitive. Using the same key combo to finish AT-ST and their kind, the boss fight, it's kinda boring. The challenge is not a good addition too for me. It's good to swing lightsaber on many stormtroopers, using force lightning and all, but the repetitive level kinda ruin it all.\n\nThe graphics of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is good, great in fact, if only the gameplay are that good too. The frame rate are good, no lags so smooth and the textures are beautiful. But the game is not stable as sometimes the game like to crash to desktop, especially on newer operating system.

You play Starkiller, the apprentice of Darth Vader as he struggles with his own personal identity, and his place in aiding the Rebellion.\n\nThere are multiple endings, but the game is short and at times frustrating, so the replay value is low.

There's definitely fun to be had in this game; the force powers you receive and using your lightsaber are enjoyable and make you feel powerful. However, the gameplay is very repititious and the main campaign is shockingly short. I beat it on medium difficulty in around 5 hours, and the other modes do not add much replayability.

I'm only running an HD4850 at the moment and I was able to max out the settings with antialiasing and a resolution of 1440x900 while maintaining a solid framerate. I found myself taking several moments in-between combat sections just to stop and enjoy the visuals.\n\nIf you're looking for some quick action and some eye candy, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up.

But no, they had to rush this one. Make money as fast as possible. *Shakes head in disbelief*\n\nDecent Star Wars games are hard to come by, so why not take a little more time to polish this one then ? I seriously can't answer that.\n\nI was impressed by the graphics. It has that certain Star Wars vibe, which is a definite plus. But there's not much variety in the environments (about 3 truly different areas/worlds), and as a result everything looks bland and boring, and doesn't make you want to explore. As far as that's possible, because it's mostly a linear game, with only one way to go forward.\n\nThere's plenty of detail in the characters and the effects look great in motion. One thing that distracted me from the experience though, was the face of Starkiller himself. At times he seemed to show little or no emotion, while the scene led me to believe otherwise. It looked very awkward and weird, and happened at least 2 or 3 times during the entire game.\n\nThe story, which is uninteresting but has a nice little twist in it, is still very decent for a Star Wars game. I'm not a die hard fan of the movies, but I do appreciate them and the fact that you can choose between a Dark and Light ending gives the game some kind of replay value. Which still isn't a lot, considering the game can be finished in 4 or 5 hours. But the story still feels rushed and you have the feeling that you missed out on certain things. Maybe because of time or money constraints, I don't know.\n\nThe combat is good, with enough enemy variety that require you to use your different abilities and tactics. I've seen games where you have tons of abilities and in the end only used 2 of them, but not in this one. So, again, a plus.\n\nThere's not much to upgrade this time. I'm not sure if I remember it correctly, but I thought the first game had much more things to upgrade and unlock. Still, it could be my memory.\n\nStar Wars The Force Unleashed II was made to make money (like pretty much any other game), but in the end it just feels rushed and incomplete. I wish they had taken more time to flesh things out, like the skills and the interface, but more importantly, the story. And despite all these flaws it's still not a bad game.

It has more graphics settings options than the first game, which basically only had one option: high detail or not.\n2. You use two lightsabers instead of one. I was a marauder in SWTOR so this really appealed to me.\n3. Improved lightsaber violence. I've played a few games as a Jedi/Sith but this is the first where you actually dismember and decapitate your enemies when you hit them with your lightsaber. Nice detail there.\n\nCons:\n1. Short. I beat the game in only about 6 hours and I played the first game for almost three times as long. I have not yet nor do I really plan to try the challenges.\n2. It was choppy. I certainly meet the recommended requirements but I still had issues with screen tearing and just low levels of detail. I don't think it looked as good as the screen shots.\n3. The story wasn't all that interesting. He's a clone, wants to be with Juno and fights Vader. The end. I'm glad I never read the novelization for this. Based on the final cut scene there might have been a TFU3, but that'll never happen.\n4. The attacks weren't as detailed as the first game. I didn't get to buy various attacks like the first game.\n5. Dagobah was a huge ripoff. What was the point of it?\n6. WAY too much action. Seriously the game was non-stop storm trooper slaughter; you never got a break from it. Always moving forward and killing. It was like a bad action movie. No puzzles or side quests or explorable worlds.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't recommend you buy it and play it. If you got it as part of the Star Wars bundle like I did, feel free to give it a shot but don't expect a quality game.\n\nYou get to see Boba Fett, but never fight him :(","August 16, 2015","false","6.0"," 115 of 175 people (66%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","66","115","175","14","0"

As long as you don't expect it to last too much longer than a movie, you wont be disappointed. What it (still) does really well is make you feel very powerful. You're a true master of the force having awesome powers, and it feels great.\nSeeing as you can complete it so quickly, I'd get it in a sale or something. It was pretty much a rip off at the launch price, but now for 5 bucks or so, it's good for a few evenings of good fun.","December 15, 2014","true","5.7"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","31","38","2","0"

I had only played 20 minutes of the game on pc since I never got it to run at over 30 frames per second. That is now something of the past. There is a crack that unlocks the game to be played at 60 fps or over with the steam game. Just look for it on Google!\n\nSince the Humble bundle sale there has been a large amount of bad reviews of this games some people not being able to run it at over 30 or not run it at all. Problems with the cutscenes etc.\n\nI installed the 60 fps unlock and played this game nonstop without any problem at all. Not one cutscene was less than 1080 quality and the game ran perfectly from beginning to end. The crack for the unlock might appear as a virus but that is also fake. The file is fine!\n\nI 100% recommend playing this with a gamepad!!\n\nNow to the game.\n\nI only had played the first forced unleashed (at 30 and with a keyboard and mouse) and loved it. This game TFU2 has everything improved. The controls are way tighter and respond top and the game just runs overall better.\n\nI played the game and it took me about 11 hours to finish it. I played it on normal dificulty and must have died maybe once or twice in a level. Maybe sometimes even more. I have read the game clocks 4 hours. That is impossible!\nMaybe playing it with cheats and on padawan. I went for all the upgrades and played at a normal pace.\n\nThe graphics of this game are really amazing. everything looks super polished and the effects of this game are really over the top awesome. You can use the force in ways you have never seen.\n\nThe music is really amazing because we have john williams score from episode 4.5and 6 and it was edited perfectly to fit to the story. The story is not the best but we cant really say any Star Wars story is a oscarworthy material. Its Star Wars and we love it!\n\nThe gamplay can get somewhat repetative but in the 11 hours I never got sick of the crazy things I could pull off with my character. I recomend doing the challenges to learn some crazy ♥♥♥ movements and do them in the story. This game plays like your typical God of War, Devil May Cry over the top hack n slash.\n\nThe game is great fun and should be highly enjoyed if you grew up with Star Wars.\n\n\nI give this game a 9/10 since its originally locked at 30. But overall this game is truly amazing and wont dissapoint.","March 20, 2015","true","13.7"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","32","40","0","4"

Really isn't.\nBest I tell you why, right? Let's start with the good.\n\nTwo lightsabers. Yeah, pretty awesome, looks neat too. Graphics are a serious step up from the HQ edition of the first game. Lots of rain too. I like rain.\n\nThe new levelling system is very simplified, which doesn't seem entirely good, until you realize the following problem with the game: It's considerably shorter.\nThat's right. There's about four to five area's you go to, technically.\n\nYou escape from the Clone Facility in Kamino, save your friend Kota from that dusty Arena, say hi to Yoda while you go to that swamp to get a vision, then defend a rebel ship that's part of the fleet attacking Kamino. Everyone abandons ship and you send the ship on a crash course straight into the cloning facility, where you go beat Vader's metal butt.\nTHAT is IT. You get a Dark or Light side ending, which are both very unsatisfying. (look them up on Youtube)\n\nThere's about four costumes you unlock through this. One isn't even automatically equipped, since it's only used in a cutscene.\nThe others are unlocked by having a save from the first game, picking an ending, and playing the challenges.\n\nThe acting... it's mediocre. Listening to Starkiller was much less enjoyable this time. He comes over as juvenile, maybe even arrogant, and seems to have a sort of grunt to him that just doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention his pain grunts in combat are simply annoying.\n\nThe challenges are as fun as they sound. If you like practising using block to redirect missiles back at attackers and survive for as long as possible, then you'll like that challenge.\nRegardless, they're not a worthwhile replacement for the lack of story this game has. There's no extra levels. Just an unlocked difficulty in the end.\n\nThis is one of those games where I wish it never existed. It's only a detriment to it's predecessor. A memory that should've stayed untouched.\n\nToo bad, really. If the developers had held the same standards as the first game had, this would have turned out alright. But there's just so much removed and so much simplified, it falls short in such a sad way. I'm really saddened by this game.","April 27, 2013","false","5.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

Fordo","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198140712359/","23 products in account","After completing this game for the 22nd time on all difficulties, NOTE* (I usally try to mix around what difficulty I play on everytime I start the campaign again) I think it's time to give this game a review. I will give a proper review, most of my other games that I review are short reviews. I will go over, Gameplay, Story, Voice Acting and Characters and Boss Fights.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay I found very fun, if you really dig physic games I really recommend you pick this game up. The way Force powers and enimies interact with the enviroment are really good, so if you are into enviromental destruction you will like this game. The Lightsaber, Force and Lightning combat I found really fun and funny at times, such as fully slicing your enimies to pecies, Forcing them to thier deaths or even throwing them sky high, but the best Is throwing them at each other. The Lightning powers are fun to use aswell, such as shocking the Jumptroopers until thier Jetpack goes out of control and colides with thier own. There are many combos you can do that make Lightsaber combat fun such as, Saber Slam, Lightsaber Throw, Grab Attack ect.\n\nStory\nI found alot of people really hated the story, I found some parts really good such as the "Lightside Ending". The way Darth Vader says, "As long as she lives, I will always control you", really made me wonder what the next game would be like story wise. The "Darkside Ending" was decent the music for the cutscene really got to me and some sadness sunk into me aswell. There is a part in there that they just used as a fill in, the Dagobah mission which was pointless making you wonder for 30 seconds until meeting Yoda in a cutscene then your off the planet for good, they could have just made the level with something more to do and it would have made the game abit better. I know there are Holocrons there but again 'No Point', if they had made it longer It would make more sense to put them in. The original Force Unleashed had a better story overall.\n\nVoice Acting and Characters\nThe voice acting in this game is Top Notch the cutscene after you defeat the Gorog aboard the Rouge Shadow you and General Kota get into a argument, the voice acting was so good in that part that It sounded like a real argument should be between two people, overall the voice acting is great in this game. You will meet characters from the original Force Unleashed which is nice, characters such as, Proxy, General Kota, Juno, Princess Leia and of course Darth Vader. The character modles are well down aswell, making them feel alive to you, and of course voice acting for all characters are great.\n\nBoss Fights\nThere are four boss fights in this game. The first one between you and the Imperial Gunship is short and repetitive, I didn't like this boss fight. The second one between you and the Gorog I thought was excellent, there are three parts to this boss fight. The third one between you and the Terror Droid is good, there are two parts to it. The final boss fight between you and Darth Vader is pretty good there are two parts to this boss battle.\n\nConclusion\nTo be honest being a huge Star Wars fan I really enjoyed this game. I know alot of people out there really hated it but that is thier opinion. So if you like Star Wars or anything mentioned above, I do recommend this game.","May 17","true","108.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Granted, the glitchiness that everyone saw in the original game no longer is around; the thing can be run on a microwave. Though I still can't get over the fact that this still feels like a poorly done port.\nYou'll see what I mean when you hear the soundtrack and the fact that it doesn't sound like something from Star Wars at all. It sounds like some kind of orchestrated piece meant for an action movie in space, but not a STAR WARS action movie in space. It's just not all there, something is very much missing and I can't bring myself to forgive the design team for this flaw.\nAnd what the hell was going on when they decided to write the story for this game? This is Star Wars we're talking about, not Star Trek or Battle Star Galatica. Star Wars has a very strong signature when it comes to story telling and anyone who grew up with it knows exactly what I mean. This just doesn't fit the structure at all, and with the strange soundtrack this game seems almost like a parody rather than canon material.\n\nThe powers are mostly the same: force push, force pull, force lightning, and mind trick (which I'm not certain was in the first installment). They all feel bland and unpolished, but do add something else to the game which keeps it from getting too reptitive.\nThough, repetition is still everywhere and if you've played the first then that's exactly what you can expect from this one. But not everything is bad about that, considering the combat does still flow pretty well and the original cast of voice actors are all back again. Mission wise, it's the same thing over and over again, do not expect it to change. There's little diversity given to what is offered besides fighting enemies or finding an objective. Free roam would actually be a nice change, too bad it wasn't included.\nIf you're deadset on buying this game, wait until it falls into the single digits during a sale. DO NOT spend over $10, not even if you're a hardcore Star Wars fan. And if you've played the first, know that this one will be the same thing over again but with different (and less) costumes.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nPlayability 8/10\nGameplay 6/10\nSoundtrack 4/10\nStory Telling 3/10\n\nOverall Score 6/10","May 10, 2014","true","8.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It was not just adding the duel sabers, but the combos and crits where done rather well. for what it is, this game is truly great, but because it was so short, i was left feeling like "ok where is the rest of it?". i do recomend the game, and more so if you liked the first one.

Why? There are two main reasons:\n\n1. The PC port is ♥♥♥♥-poor. Half the time the game won't even load up for me, and the other half it works perfectly fine. This is literally within seconds of closing it down once for freezing on the opening logo and then opening it up again using steam. Absolutely no changes were made to any part of the PC or any software on my PC, including steam. When you get in the game, there are constant issues. Clipping and hilariously bad rendering where sometimes the top half of the screen looks like it has been cut away from the bottom and slid to the side. This is on a GTX 560 ti, which is quite a powerful little card in itself.\n\n2. The game is stupendously short. You can reach the end in two and a half hours on normal if you've played spectacle brawlers with platforming elements before. No, I'm not kidding: two and a half hours. Even for £5 on sale it's an absolute ripoff.\n\nThere are a variety of other issues with the game, including:\n\n- Story being non-existent. It really does feel like a cash-in. No thought was put into it at all. Using the already lame clone excuse in order to pull the player in for another full-priced ride that has poorer combat and lasts only 20% of time it took to beat the original game is incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the publisher and dev.\n\n- Repetitive enemies. Each enemy type has a particular way to beat them; a single weakness the game tells you the moment you meet them. The rest of the level is then you exploiting that weakness and meeting the same enemies again... And again... And again.\n\n- You meet Yoda. At one time I thought this would have been cool... Now it just feels forced. "Look how Star Wars we are! We're part of the universe!" Not to mention, the 'level' you meet Yoda in (yes, it's counted as one of nine levels) involves jumping up a cliff then running into a cave. There's no combat whatsoever. It's basically a five minute cutscene.\n\n- Plot holes and inconsistencies; general lack of an attempt to flesh out the narrative. They could have done a hell of a lot with clone Starkiller, but they didn't. They just used it as an excuse to bring him back for a sequel.\n\nHowever, if you really don't care about any of the above problems and don't mind the price and/or are a big fan of the first game, it might be worth picking up solely based on the cool-factor of a boss fight against an alien 1000x your size while plummeting towards a planet surface. That's about the only cool thing I found in this, though.\n\nIf you want a Force Unleashed game, play the first.","May 3, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Lacks everything I enjoyed about the original Force Unleashed. Force Powers feel less powerful, the story, writing and characters took a major hit. Force Unleashed was, if anything, engaging thanks to the dialogue and fun characters - the sequel has none of that, only Kota Rahm constantly shouting at you.\n\nThe setting and areas you fight in are really bland and lack the grandeur of the first game and the art direction isn't up to snuff either. Enemies reminded me more about toy-designs, you know the type that toy-companies produce to expand on movie licenses - AT-STs have some weird rocket launchers, there are chunky "Wardroids" with shields, spider-like "terrordroids" and other ♥♥♥♥ that felt completely out of place. Not my cup of tea.\n\nThen there is the way too over the top action, 13 year old me would probably flip ♥♥♥♥ about the CRAZY action going down - but 31 year old me just looks at the INTENSE, MICHAEL BAY-LIKE ACTION and thinks: Really? This is dumb and tries way too hard. Examples? That massive fight against an enormous humanoid monster that eats Rancors for breakfast or crashing a friggin' fleet flagship into a planet colony. This ♥♥♥♥ has completely lost it's Star Wars touch and entered the realm of demi-gods doing the superhuman thang. Again, not my cup of tea.\n\nAnd on top of all that, THIS PORT IS EVEN WORSE than Force Unleashed. Needs forced V-Sync otherwise the screen flickering will fry your brain, forced v-sync kills the cutscenes though - making them stutter like crazy. It's rather unstable as well and has a whole bunch of ridiculous show-stoppers like a cutscene close to the end that loops infinitely.\n\nThis is a REALLY bad follow-up to Force Unleashed and adds nothing to the experience of the first game. Feels really pointless. Avoid at all costs.","November 26, 2015","false","4.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

Enough said. Lucasarts had some issues with the first game and although I loved it I hoped to see improvements in the next. What did I get when playing, a game that just trolls you around in every direction. Here are the stats:\n\nPros:\n\nGame has beautiful graphics.\n\nButton smashing is easier now, without any hassle.\n\nNew force powers have been added and force usage per use has been decreased.\n\nIconic heroes from the original movie franchise are present, such as Yoda and Boba Fett.\n\nOutstanding audio effects along with the original Star Wars orchestra.\n\nCons:\n\nEnemies are pathetic and a lot less boss fights are present. The AT-ST,which is a boss from the first game, takes barely any skill to tear apart.\n\nGame is a horrible port from console to PC. The game has a slowmo lag no matter how good your PC is. This is fixable but not for someone without any experience, consider doing some research.\n\nInstead of adding elements to the game that excited players throughout the game, the developers turned the game from an awesome and action packed action-adventure game into a action-adventure/puzzle solving game that waisted a lot of people's time and money. Make a single mistake during a few of the more challenging puzzles and you'll end up restarting the checkpoint from a farther distance.\n\nGlitches do happen oftenly.\n\nOverall:\n\nI own this game on both console (X360) and PC. What do I have to say, don't get it, because its a total waste of your time and money. This game ruined the Force Unleashed series, by turning this game into a trolling puzzle game. There are wayyyyyy less boss fights than the first game and enemies are super easy to take down with practically one swipe to a stromtrooper and a couple blows to a AT-ST. Yup you heard it, the thing that was a boss in Force Unleashed 1 is now and barely is something of a challenge. In the end, I'm glad that Disney bought Star Wars, because the saga seriously needs some fixing up to do.","December 12, 2014","false","3.7"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","26","49","5","0"

The story feels rushed , as if they just came up with any old rubbish off the top of their heads. I enjoyed the first game a lot, but this game just doesnt hold up as well. That being said i am a massive star wars fan and just the combat alone is amazing and satisfying for me.\n\nThe main problem i have with this game apart from the rushed and unfinished story....is that the force is absolutley ♥♥♥♥ing usless. Most of the enemies in this game are immune to your force to the point where you start to wonder why the developers even included it in the game...\n\nThe lightsaber combat is still awesome and there are some amazing combo's , but in all honesty all i did during this game was use the new grapple feature as it one shots most enemies , eliminating the need for actual combo's.\n\nI still recommend this game to star wars fans as there is something strangley satisfying about cutting through waves of enemies with an excellentley animated lightsaber. If your not a star wars fan you may find it hard to appreciate certain aspects of this game , so to those people i do not reccomend it.\n\nOverall the game is no where near as fun as the first one but there is still fun to be found for star wars fans.\n\n7/10","January 2","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xareh/recommended/32500/","xareh","A$AP Xareh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xareh/","176 products in account","The Force Unleashed II, sequel to a flawed, but remarkable Star Wars game. Is it good? In a word - yes, it's great fun, but it has one or two glaring issues. Read on, maestro!\n\nThe original Force Unleashed was an impressive reimagining of the OT universe, truly advancing the design to make the Empire look more evil and, importantly, more high tech than the prequels. The story was fantastic, not quite KOTOR good but certainly enjoyable. However, it had problems - until you unlocked every ability, you felt weak (though this did create a great sense of progression), the Force targeting was annoying, and some of the missions and bossfights were either pathetically easy or insanely hard. Both Force Unleashed games do many things entirely uniquely. No previous Star Wars game has ever given a character of such intense power. Starkiller in both games is considered one of the most powerful Force wielders in the entire universe of SW - and you can feel that.\n\nNow, the actual game... well, a lot is better. For one, it's much better looking and has aged better. Graphically, it's actually kinda beautiful, some of the costumes scream to be made in real life with a matched pair of sabers. The design is fantastic, and visually dual lightsabers is just great. Also, cutscenes are no longer horrible looking, where the PC gameplay actually looked better than the cutscenes, the animation is tighter and they look far better - much more cinematic. However there are notable, weird resolution problems like button tips and the menus being low res at 1080p.\nThe targeting has been really tightened up, I hardly ever struggled with moving what I needed to, there are more enemies (and they're less spongey, more mechanic based), lightsaber combat is insanely fun and acrobatic, Starkiller feels more mobile, it feels like they've had time to go back and make it all better, which they have. It's definitely easier, and the boss battles are certainly nowhere near as hard. The original had an interesting balance where either you would utterly obliterate your foes or have to go on the defensive. This is pure attack.\nIn this, Starkiller's at his clear peak - he has two lightsabers (Jar'Kai, hell yeah!) his powers are available far earlier and the game introduces Force Fury - what has to be described as the most insanely powerful use of the Force ever seen, effectively the same as simultaneously using all the Sith Holocrons in the original at once, and then some. If you want to know what it feels like to implode a hallway with relentless blasts of Force energy, look no further.\nOverall, it does play a lot better than the original! And it is remarkably hard to make a game world with such destructability and yet maintain the cohesive experience.\n\nSo, giving that The Force Unleashed was really great, doesn't this make TFU II even better?\nIt would, if not for a glaring problem - the game is far too short. And far too location sparse. I finished it in 4 hours and, giving the style of game, there's not too much replay value. It has the awkward feeling of only being a third of the full game - where The Force Unleashed would have gone into a new section of the story, TFU II just... stops. It's not like KOTOR II where it literally dumps you back at the title screen and leaves you confused, but it's close.\n\nThe story is effectively to let fans who really care about happy endings - the outline of the story follows, it's not really inventive  you are a clone of Starkiller after he died on the Death Star, driven half mad by visions of Juno Eclipse, the love interest in the original, you attack Vader and escape the Kaminoan cloning facility and go to seek her, becoming reacquanited with General Kota and the Rebel Alliance Starkiller built in the original. That's the premise..\nOnce you've finished that, the game ends - it's clear TFU II was to be a part of a trilogy, but there will likely never be a TFU III due to Disney's takeover. Which is a shame, as the original was incredibly compelling and a very interesting set of ideas. Not to mention Sam Witwer as Starkiller (and bizarrely Palpatine) is very charismatic. This is maintained, although he sounds totally deranged in this (which makes sense) and Palpatine doesn't feature at all.\nThe game sequel baits HARD at the end too! .\n\nThere are about four unique locations, against seven or more in the original. They are beautifully done and nicely used, much better level design than the original. However, four is far too few, and you will notice it. One of the locations only exists for a few holocrons and a cutscene, however art makes it clear more was intended - it's probable TFU II had an enormity of cut content. You cut through 'em fast too, giving how powerful Starkiller is, though that happened in the original too at a certain point. Levels do feel shorter too.\n\nThis reaches the critical problem - length. The story and gameplay, hand in hand, make this an insanely short experience - fun while it lasts, though - which means it can't be recommended at full price. 4 hours for a good player like me is nothing. I lamented Dishonored as being 'criminally short' at 6 hours (however it has tons of replay and is a masterpiece), 7 hours on the original, the missing 3 hours are noted.\n\nCan it be recommended at less, like £5? Absolutely. Great game. It's a shame Starkiller's arc will never be completed, and a further shame that this game is so much shorter and story sparser than the original, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of throwing Stormtroopers off bridges.\n\nI'm gonna miss this series...\n\nOh, and a tip - if you can't get it it to run, run it in compatability mode - Windows XP SP3 - fixed a freeze on startup for me. Weird.\n\nTwo things in the plot: 1. The 'clone' of Starkiller you play may actually be Starkiller all along. It is alluded to as this, we will never know... 2. In the lightside ending Boba Fett chases you at the end to Dantooine - it is explained he breaks Vader out after you capture him.","January 30","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Given most track records with sequels, and what happened at the end of the first game, I didn't know what to think of this, and yet given how amazing the first game was, I thought they might just pull it off.\n\nHowever, as much as the gameplay was decent, the story lacked any sort of conviction, or plausability. This was a money sequel, just as I had feared, and added nothing to the first game. I didn't come away feeling any different, the ending of the first game was more than appropriate to answer most questions, about what happens between Star Wars: Episode 3 and Episode 4.\n\nEven though the gameplay was okay, the length of the main storyline is a joke. The first game spanned an epic variety of environments and enemies. Whilst this game I felt like I spent almost all the game just fighting regular Storm Troopers, who are the squishiest of squishies. In the first game, you visit multiple planets, and also revisit them several times, in a star spanning quest. In this, you visit a total of 4 different areas. Almost none of which you spend any meaningful amount of time in, such as 1 planet, where you spend 5 seconds walking around, and then about 2 minutes of cutscene. That's it. The only planet you do spend any reasonable amount of time on, you feel like you're seeing the same thing over and over again, due to how mind numbingly boring and samey the architecture is.\n\nSo, if you like the gameplay of the first game, but don't particularly want any sort of meaningful addition to the story, or area design of the first game, then this is the game for you! Otherwise, don't play it.\n\nEdit: Also, about the only redeeming factor of this game, is that it had a first game.","May 12, 2014","false","5.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

(Pretty obvious, right?)\nI won't go into details about the story in order to avoid potential spoilers in case you're interested in buying this game. But, I'll just say that, although linear, it's pretty solid and not as bad as some people say. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I really enjoyed it. After finishing TFU, I was wondering if the story could continue and TFU2 surprised me a lot, giving me some hours of fun.\nLet's start with the review, shall we?\nFirst of all, do not pay attention to the people that often speak bad things about this game. But, just in case, I'll take in consideration some points that most people complained about\nYes, is a pretty short game. Yes, it has abundant and repetitive QTE's (Quick Time Events). Yes, it's not a flawless port. Yes, it may be somewhat easy if you managed to finish the first game in Sith Master difficulty.\n\nBut, let's look at the bright side. I have actually enjoyed the game.\nThe gameplay of the game is very similar to the previous one, but instead of one lightsaber, now you have two. It's still a great Hack N' Slash, indeed. New enemies, new threats, new combos and the possibility to test your abilites with the Challenge mode (Once you win a challenge, you unlock videos that give more information about the story).\nDespite that the port was not something out of this world, the graphics are beautiful and the evironments are beautifully crafted, recreating a gorgeous Star Wars atmosphere.\nAs I've said before, I'm a big fan of the Star Wars universe and the replayability comes from two sides. Firstly, if you're interested in test your ability in Unleashed mode and secondly, if you enjoyed the story and would like to experience a different ending.\nIf you ask me what I dislike the most about this game, I'll tell you two things. First, that the Endor DLC is only available for consoles. And, last but not least, the lack of achievements. I like to test myself with the achievements and, also, they enlong the playability of the game.\n\nDo you want my honest opinion? It's a good game, there's no doubt about that. But, perhaps you would like to wait until it's on sale.\nOn the other hand, if you're a big Star Wars fun, wait no more and buy it right now. The fun is guaranteed.","February 22, 2015","true","12.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Now don't get me wrong, it has many flaws, but despite the mixed response to the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe graphics in this game are great for it's age and an upgrade from the previous game. The cutscenes in this game also blew me away as well with how good they were. I also really enjoyed the gameplay. I thought that the lightsaber combat was amazing, but at times you will feel like a god anayalating everything in your path, I also liked the force and how there were different force powers and combos. I wasn't very fond of the lighting though, as it was sometimes randomly stop.\n\nTo me, the storyline of the game wasn't great either. You start as Starkillers clone on Kamino, but after failing to overcome his feelings, you are to be executed by Vader. You then in a desperate attempt for your life, flee off Kamino. You then head to Cato Neimoidia, to save Rahm Kota from the arena. After this you go ahead to save Juno Eclipse, the original Starkiller's love intrest who you, the clone of Starkiller, still has feelings for.\n\nThe game becomes very repetetive over time. As each level brings in new enemies and abilities, these become constantly repeated throughout the whole level, which becomes time consuming and boring. I also wish the game was longer. I bought the game along with 8 other Star Wars games, so I tried this out first. I ended up beating in in two days (or 15.9 hours) which was a shame because when the game ended, I was craving more.\n\nTo sum it up, I really enjoyed this game, despite it's many flaws, it had great gameplay and combat, and was generally fun to play. So I am going to be giving this an 8/10","February 9, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/32500/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR - If you liked Star Wars the Force Unleashed 1, you should enjoy part 2. The game is much shorter but takes up much less of your hard drive space, and you may actually want to replay it, unlike its predecessor. - 7.5/10\n\n*Spoilers for first game*\nThe Force Unleased 2 continues the adventures of Darth Vader’s former apprentice Starkiller who actually died at the end of the first game if you chose the “light side” ending. If you chose the dark side ending, well, you were in a whole new timeline that directly contradicts the Star Wars movies.  In part 2, you awaken in captivity and are told by Vader that you’re actually a clone of the original Starkiller, kind of like Milla Jovovich’s character in the Resident Evil movies. Basically Vader’s making a bunch of super powered clones so when one dies in training, he’ll just wake up another one. Fortunately for you, this clone is actually as powerful as the original Starkiller and can kick some ♥♥♥ with his dual lightsabres (twice as many as in the first game).\n\nJust like The Force Unleased 1, the game is played in the third person perspective with your main attacks being quick swings with your laser swords and your ranged attacks being force powers. There have been some refinements to the gameplay system so the sword attacks seem to flow better compared to the first game, both in combat and the way you upgrade your skills. You no longer have to navigate a long list of sword attacks that you need to buy one by one. Now you upgrade your sword skill just like any other force power and it automatically improves your sword combos. Speaking of upgrades, the game now uses a visible “experience” system where you can actually see how many points you have to buy skills with (similar to Darksiders). You don’t “level up” in the game, you just buy upgrades with the experience you earn. There are holocrons (treasures) hidden around the levels just like the first game that contain things like bonus experience and different upgrade crystals for your lightsabres.\n\nMost of the enemies you face are Imperial stormtroopers though there are a few new big dudes and annoying spider bots. Just like the first game, the large enemies have a ton of health if you try to slice them to death, but after you’ve done significant damage, you have the opportunity to kill them via quick-time events. You definitely should take advantage of this because unlike the first game, most of the big guys don’t get “stunned” by your force lightning. Overall though, I think you’ll find the game easier than part 1 because of a new auto-heal system where you can regen most of the life you just lost if you don’t take damage for a few seconds.\n\nPros:\n+Hack and slash adventure in the Star Wars universe. The story is actually pretty short (lengthened by long battles) but it is decent. Most of the characters from the first game return in case you’re emotionally invested in any of them.\n+ The game is simplified compared to Force Unleashed 1, which is a good thing because part 1 was unnecessarily complex in some parts (such as the upgrade system). It also seems to be better optimized for the PC and doesn’t have so many damn loading screens. I played both games with mouse + keyboard by the way.\n\nCons:\n-It’s nice to have challenging boss battles, but some of these fights are a pain because of how long they are, especially at the end. The boss has a ton of health and you can only chip away about a millimeter from their life bar at a time. And that’s if he’s not blocking all your shots. It’s not like he’s throwing out cool attacks either, just the same stuff repeated a few dozen times.\n-The game is very short compared to the first Force Unleashed, about half as long actually. And since this isn’t a Game of the Year (Force Unleashed 1 was “Ultimate Sith Edition” with included DLCs) there aren’t as many extras this time around.\n\nOverall the game is fun and you can beat it in a day if you want to sit down for 6 hours. There isn’t too much variety in skill paths, although I didn’t have enough points to buy everything by the end of the game. If I want to focus on “force persuasion” I’ll have to play the game again, which I probably will in the future.\n","May 12, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because I'm thinking beyond my own view, most of my friends would rather play a star wars RPG, then this game. As far as console to PC ports go this one has many flaws that makes it annoying to play, I can overlook these and enjoy the time I spent in the game, but not everyone can; so that is why I'm not recommending it.\n\n-Quick Review-\nThe Force Unleashed II is a third person hack and slash that implements various combo's that are all unlocked from the first game, and quick time events. If the second game is compared to the first, the Force Unleashed II; has better special effects, most constant action, a shorter story, but is still fundamentally similar in play style.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Welcome back to life Starkiller, that is... If you ARE Starkiller, we don't really know - and you (the player) don't either. The first level starts out with some dazzling special effects and action scenes, upon finishing that level I thought "well... good luck trying to make that any more exciting, developers. You hit the limit."\nI was more or less correct, the story just kind of sits there, Commander Rahm Kota just yells at you over the comm; while you ignore him and slice through stormtroopers... doing what he was telling you to do unintentionally. The layouts are usually very linear, at one time I confused myself, because I over thought the "puzzle".\nSerious answer: You are allegedly a clone of Starkiller, Vader as appointed you to take up Starkillers role in the destruction of the rebels. However, the clone is having flashbacks which are supposedly memories from the original Starkiller, distracting him and at times letting his enemies get the upper hand. Clone-Starkiller escapes Lord Vader and tries to assist the rebels and find "Juno" who is a shuttle pilot, whom Starkiller is obsessed with.\n\nGame Play: The Force Unleashed II was designed for a console; but I played the whole thing with a keyboard and mouse. I doubt that this game NEEDS to be played with a controller, but you can tell from playing that the game was not designed for a keyboard and mouse.\nAs was already mentioned earlier, The Force Unleashed II implements quick time events, which prevent me from being able to enjoy the exciting execution scenes, and always keep me on my toes (either you like quick time events or you don't... I personally don't, they're distracting).\nMostly all of the combo's from the first Force Unleashed game, are already unlocked, so I was using force combo's right at the start of the game; which naturally I enjoyed. I've always liked using different attack patterns, often times to beat a group of enemies or a certain boss you would just need to find the one "perfect" combination to make them all a joke.\nThere were four NPC's that broke up the fun hack-and-slash nature of the game, AT-ST's ("Walkers"), AT-MP's ("Missile-Walkers"), Carbonite War Droid's, and the notorious Incinerator War Droid's. Once you face one or a combination of the listed NPC's, brace yourself because you need to time your force catch, throw and/or block.\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam-achievements for the Force Unleashed I or II. This may change someday but at this time (02/10/15) there are no steam achievements. The reason I think it may change is because there are xBox achievements for accomplishing various challenges in the game.\nWhile there are no Steam Achievements, the extra's and unlockables are still available, including some mini games (challenges) that you unlock after playing through the game. The challenges generally capitalize on teaching you how to master a skill you learned from the main story... block, jumping puzzles, combo attacks, etc.\n\nPrice:  The Force Unleashed II is priced at $19.99, I like to spend an hour's worth of time in a game for every dollar I spend; but I only spent 8.4 hours in the game before I had earned pretty much everything, except beating the game on the hardest difficulty, and getting platinum on each challenge.\nSo my feeling on the price is, that it's high. I got my copy of The Force Unleashed I and II from a humble bundle. (for what it's worth, they're the titles that attracted me to the bundle most. Aside from "Star Wars Humble Bundle", just take my money already)\n\nConclusion: Okay, I'll quickly compress the good and the bad of the Force Unleashed.\nPros: * The game is a very fun hack-and-slash * The combo's in the game as very natural feeling *Excellent special effects *Nice cut scenes * Hey, it's star wars, I like that, I'm a fan, I can't help it * Force Lightning ( <<< Excellent reason!) *Many costumes to unlock (about 20 of them) * Challenges *Database entrees are amusing\nCons:*The story will be played through in about 7-8 hours, on easy mode it would be even more fast! *the Boss battles are dull repetitive sequences of telegraphed signs to dodge, followed by button mashing *Button Mashing, mash all the buttons *mediocre story (the extra's reveal they were going to have more! I assume they ran out of budget money... I blame level 1 being so amazing and taking up all the budget)\n\nYou can definitely decide for yourself if you want to play this game. An easy way to know is to figure out your opinion on the first game: if you liked Force Unleashed I you will like the second. If you're not put out by any of the down sides of the game, you should totally get it! If you have any doubt at all about the game, you should probably should skip this one, buddy.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for The Force Unleashed I","April 10, 2015","false","8.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

This is the pinnacle of minimalistic game development, where so atrociously little effort has gone into creating anything with an ounce of creativity -- just copy-pasted sequences mixed in with painful quicktime events followed by more copy-paste.\n\nJust to give you an idea of what I mean by mind-numbing repititon, this is how the "final, epic battle" with Darth Vader actually played out.\n\nYou begin by battling him on a platform, your only recourse is spamming lightsaber attacks as he auto-deflects force powers.\n\nOnce you eventually hurt him enough, a quicktime event will occur. Upon successful completion, Vader will jump to another platform, summoning some mini-clones of you, 10 or so in total, for you to fight. When you're done, you jump to his new platform.\n\nAnd then you repeat, lightsaber-attacking him until he takes enough damage to trigger the quicktime event, which is identical to the previous. When you finish, Vader jumps to another platform, and again, 10 mini-clones appear for you to fight. When you're done, you jump to Vader's platform.\n\nAnd again you "battle" him until taking enough of his health to trigger *the exact same quicktime event*. Upon completion, as before, he jumps to a different platform, and 10 mini-clones appear for you to fight.\n\nThis went on and on and on 4 times before I finally gave up, as I felt my soul being drained, physically, from my body. Whatever mindless, empty husk of a person created this game has my infinite pity; I can only imagine what kind of horrible life they must lead, being so absolutely bereft of depth and creativity.\n\nI will not play this game again, and I heartily recommend anyone with a shred of self-respect steer very, very clear.","December 27, 2014","false","8.2"," 80 of 159 people (50%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","50","80","159","21","7"

Its scenes, boss fights, fight systems are good. Camera could be tricky in some fights but nothing a player cant handle it. After the first game it gives you the feeling that you actually wield true lightsaber not a lightstick that you can cut off bodyparts of your enemies which is the meant of lightsaber. Color crystal modifications and their buffs are good.\nScenariowise game is a bit dull and too short. Yes game's one of big flaws is that it is too short. Game gives you two endings as you can presume they are light side and dark side.\n\nTL;DR you can enjoy this game and have a good time with the star wars spirit. But it's only lasts short.

It's also not quite as buggy as the first game, and despite having a horrendous release in 2010, it has been tightened up enough to seem quite polished in some ways. However, whilst the first game's weaknesses are this game's strengths, the strengths of the first are the weaknesses of this one.\n\nMost importantly, the story is at best lazy and at worst insulting. Instead of attempting the further the overall Star Wars narrative as the first game did, TFU2's story is a blatantly lazy attempt at reusing the established protagonist, in effect retconning the ending of the first game under a ridiculous premise, and nonsensically undoing all the traits of the character that made him such a joy to watch in the first place. So, much like the prequel trilogy, TFU2 retroactively downgrades the story arc of a great character and subsequently devalues the first game by convincing us that the character isn't as great as we thought. And before anyone decides to throw the 'clone' nonsense out there - regardless of the cheap trick the writers have used, it's the same character.\n\nAnd I suppose some could say 'what does it matter' now that the games' stories are no longer considered canon, but to that I say that despite all the flaws of TFU, its story was compelling enough to make it greater than the sum of its parts, whereas I found myself repeatedly failing to find the motivation to complete TFU2.\n\nThis, coupled with the fact that the QTE's require so little effort or skill it's a wonder that they were implimented at all, and the repetition of certain gameplay elements, makes TFU2 definitively a worse overall experience, and a real disappointment if you, like me, were expecting innovation and expansion upon a title that had great potential.\n\nTFU2 is fun, in ways. But it's not a deep game, and it's rarely a stimulating experience. It's one of those sequels in which it's immediately obvious that the company was cashing in on the financial success of a previous successful titles. It doesn't need to exist, and it brings few improvements of great worth to the table. If you just can't get enough of TFU, and are looking for more sword-swinging, force-slinging action, then TFU2 has that in spades. But beyond the graphical improvements and various intuitive tweaks to the gameplay, there's not a lot here to recommend spending your hard-earned cash on.","February 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 40 of 81 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","40","81","4","0"

The combat, skills and even level design is pretty much just more of the same. It would have been nice if (like most hack and slash sequels) they had added one or two new skills to unleash on unsuspecting storm troopers but sadly, even the kill moves (on larger enemies) are pretty much the same as the first game.\n\nThe story is passable, but is not written half as well as the first game. (potential spoilers!) The real big dissapointment is that the ending really does not lead into the first movie (episode 4 A New Hope) at all as it does not explain what happens to Starkiller, General Kota, Juno, Proxy or even Darth Vader. There is a very small (even miniscule) implication that Boba Fett reclaims vader, but it is so vague it is unreal.\n\nSecondly, the game itself is tiny. I have completed the game in a matter of hours, even having to replay 3 of the levels twice due to constant crashing and movie skipping (more on that in a moment). If you take into account the level replays and deduct them from my play time, I would say that this game lasted no more than 3-4 hours tops. In comparison to the first game that took approx 9 hours. What is even more annoying is that several of the levels are based in the same areas of previous levels and so the scenery only really has 3 or 4 notable changes. Ultimately it made the content that is there to play feel very lacking too. The gameplay in general is largely generic too and there were several times wher I forgot I could even upgrade my force powers because in honesty, the "upgrades" didn't really feel like they upgraded anything at all. Aside from the colour of my lightening changing from blue to purple, the force moves seemed to be as potent at the end of the game (post upgrade) as they did at the start. In other words, they barely changed.\n\nFinally, the games stability is terrible. Now I played this on Windows 10 Professional, and to begin with I had no issues at all. About 1-2 hours into the game though, I would suddenly get a black screen where nothing happens. I could bring up the in game menu and even go back to the start menu, but the game itself would grind to a halt. If I tried to reload the level, the level would play with no sound. The only way I could fix this was to exit the game completely and restart it, replaying the level from the very beginning (cut scenes and all). This easily added 2 hours (possibly more) onto my overall play time and was extremely frustrating.\n\nAnother frutrating thing for me was the camera on the jumping levels. Essentially these levels turn the game into a 3d donkey kongue esque platformer where you have to climb to the top, and more often than not I would find my character missing a ledge by a nat's whisker, either pushed off by an invisible air wall or simply jumping in a different direction to where the camera was facing. Again, multiple deaths here added to the games pathetically short play time and didn't add challenge, just frustration.\n\nI would say if you absolutely need to see what this game has to offer, then buy it on a console., This PC port is buggy as hell and really is not worth the money they want for it. The story is nonsensical and does absolutely nothing for bridging the first game to the original Star Wars Trilogy and so it is easy to just pass this game by and forget it ever existed.\n\nI would say, save your money and replay the first Force Unleashed. It is much better than this one.","May 2","false","6.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The first game had me with it's storyline and pretty fun gameplay. You play a secret disciple to Darth Vader who has a change of heart, but you quickly learn to realize that this storyline and gameplay didn't continue at all into this game. The gameplay does have a little fun to it, once in a while, but it's very lackluster even at the very start. It's very repetitive and just doesn't get you immersed into this character or make you feel very powerful. It feels very choppy and unenjoyable. There's even an instance where you have to bring down a huge Star Destroyer which makes you feel so damn amazing finally, but quickly puts you back to reality once you start trying because the controls and mechanics in which to do so are so obscure that the only way you can find out how to actually complete that part is to youtube the sequence. The mainstory is ridiculously short, I played about 5 hours and finished the entire campaign on Medium, and was easily forgettable.\n\nPros:\n- It's a Star Wars game?\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay is lackluster\n- Storyline is lackluster\n- Campaign is less than 5 hours long\n- There's an instance in the game where you must google in order to continue\n\n*********\nTL;DR\n*********\nPersonally, I only recommend picking up this game if/when it's on sale (I was fortunate enough to pick it up for $3 during the Summer sale).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBritishAce/recommended/32500/","AngryBritishAce","Angry British Ace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBritishAce/","227 products in account","I bought this game on sale. It was a little bit over £5. After completing it, I felt like this game should never have existed.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\n[THIS REVIEWS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST STAR WARS: THE FORCE UNLEASHED]\n\nAs a very big fan of the Original Force Unleashed game, what made the original game so great for me wasn't it's over the top gameplay, but how it played a role in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. It linked Episode III and Episode IV perfectly, detailing how the last few jedis were killed off, how the rebel leaders initially came together, and ended with a satisfying conclusion that perfectly set up "A New Hope," whilst also being conclusive so you feel satisfied with how it ended. However, the Force Unleashed 2 not only rips open that ending and drags out Starkiller's journey, which should have ended at the seemingly conclusive end of the Force Unleashed 1, but tacks on a story that doesn't add ANYTHING new to the Star Wars mythos.\n\nIn the original, you spend half of the game hunting Jedi, which explains how the survivors of order 66 eventually died, and the other half uniting the galaxy against the empire, which explains how the rebel alliance was formed. In the second game, Starkiller spends it finding his lover. That is the whole story. He doesn't set up major plot events in the films; he doesn't even do anything meaningful in his own mythos. He spends the game looking for his girlfriend, and that's it. He even goes out of his way to stay out of any meaningful plot points; when asked to join the rebels and fight the empire, he basically gives them the finger. The only thing that could have added anything to the Star Wars EU is the ending, which obviously sets up a sequel, but that never arrives. As it is, the ending just breaks the entire lore of the Star Wars Universe.\n\nNext, let's look at the game's memorable moments. The original FU had a huge array of great video game and Star Wars moments, something that players and fans would remember for years to come. Hunting rogue jedi, bringing down a Star Destroyer, infiltrating the Death Star, beating the living ♥♥♥♥ out of Darth Vader and even fighting the Emperor in a 1 on 1 battle; you did it all. However, the FU2 has a grand total of 1 memorable moment, which is the first boss fight within the first hour and a half of the game. Not even the Final Boss fight against Vader (that’s not really a spoiler, we all knew he would be the boss), the most important part of a game, felt memorable. As it is, for 4 hours, you slice, stab and force your way through the same, (yet granted, interesting) enemies over and over again.\n\nGameplay is up next. Gameplay is a hard one to talk about. Because, I'm gonna be honest, the gameplay was hella fun. The complaints I'm making against gameplay isn't because gameplay is bad, it's because I personally felt that the first game did it better. The thing is, even though the force powers in the first game were pretty insane, the new ones are even more unrealistic, with the player wielding 2 lightsabers and whizzing about the map firing out lightning and bursts of energy at will. And while it was both fun to and brilliant to behold, it just felt way too flashy and didn’t have any substance to it. There are a few more complaints about gameplay, but nothing worth bickering about; simplistic upgrade system, all combos from first game immediately unlocked, lightsaber duelling revolved around blocking the moment your enemy strikes and then attacking over and over again. In conclusion, it’s fun but too flashy for my liking and not as in depth as the first game.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? Buy it if you really do not give a ♥♥♥♥ about the story. The gameplay is fun, enemies are samey but there's a lot of different varieties, there's not many levels and it takes about 4 hours to complete, but the gameplay alone is rather fast passed and fun. But if you cared about the original game's story, just forget this exists.\n\nThey've recently announced that none of the Star Wars games are canon; however that doesn't mean that you can't have certain SW stories as head canon. So in my eyes, the first game is head canon, and the second game is just a neat little idea of what may have happened if Starkiller continued his journey after the first game, but it's not what truly happens after Starkiller's first game.\n","May 7, 2014","false","5.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

It was a great experience but here's the pro's and con's.\n\nPROS\n- Sorta Kinda Maybe Possibly good graphics\n- Wide variety of customization options\n- Cool Combo's\n- Stormtroopers' aim still sucks\n- Darth Vader Fight is Cool\n- Force abilities are awesome\n- Plenty of easter eggs, secrets, and references\n- Decapitation is a thing.\nCONS\n- Darth Vader fight is about half hour to an hour.\n- PROXY is used in a dumb way\n- Juno needed more screen time.\n- General Kota's dialogue is a little bland\n- Han Solo and Chewie dies.\n- Doesn't really have a satisfying dark side ending\n-  Starkiller doesn't show up\n- The Sith Acolytes are a little too easy to kill.\n\nCONCLUSION: This is a good game if your willing to waste a couple of hours-days to playing it. It gets fun when you unlock so many force abilities that you just feel like a domination machine. Overall, I'd recommend this game for star wars fan's and SWTFU fans willing to drop 20 bucks. If your not the big of a star wars fan, I wouldn't buy it. But either way, if your looking for a good fun game with OP force abilities, this is for you.\n\n\n","April 22","true","28.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Everything that you could have improved of the first game was done to this one. Does not have any graphic issues. However, it does like to crash- BUT it saves it when it does. This is NOT an issue. If you think games should not crash stop buying games that cost 1$ or less and buy games that matter like this to fund the QA time. Old games from the 90s golden era crashed and had tons of bugs. It was fun for us back then to see if we could find the holes in the games. Stuff like COD has bugs.\n\nPlain and simple this is a great game and anyone who says otherwise is flat out too new of a gamer or should just go play the wii fit or flappy bird. People who complain about the story talk about Star War canon. This is an alternate universe- which they flat out state about the game. Also, the only TRUE star wars canon is the 6 movies made. Everything else is bs, and anyone who says otherwise is flat out ignorant.\n\nPlay the game, because there is no other one out there that has mechanics like this.

No more clunky animations, or continuously being hit with no way of stopping it. The story was good, but you'll obviously enjoy it more being a Star Wars fan. Only complaint I have is the length of the game. The campaign took me 5 hours to complete, around 4 hours shorter than the previous game. I was dissapointed with the length, and found myself stunned when the actual game finished because I couldn't believe how short the game actually was.

Another plus is that it's much easier to cach up with interface - with lightsaber mods, powers upgrades, evean changing outfits is better in my opinion - you don't get almost all of them, you'll have to serch for it. I give you a hint - hit hologram of Jabba the Hutt  with some object.

Absolutely love the force powers and graphics. I had played this on the WII before, but nothing beats PC.\n\nWith that said, it's  a downer that it's so short, and that there's not a ton of content. Once you finish the game, you probably won't be compelled to go back and re-play much unless you want to destroy something. It's also capped at 30fps. As a 60fps player whose never experienced 120+, I must say the cap didn't bother me at all. As it's a steady 30 and not randomly dipping or some shiz, it was unnoticable.

You're a jedi guy using force powers to throw stuff around, how can you possibly mess that up?\n\nWith garbage boss battles, it turns out.\n\nThe first big boss you face has three phases, in which you're forced to do some tedious nonsense mostly culminating in QTEs, THREE TIMES OVER. Yes, each phase has you do the same tedious ♥♥♥♥ three times in a row, and nothing even changes between each time: You do the exact same stupid stuff which ends with the exact same stupid QTE. Wow.\n\nThe base mechanics are still intact, and fun, but are squandered on horrible boss battles which almost never take any advantage of them, instead throwing tedious repetitive nonsense and QTEs at you, and horrible level design.\n\nGo play the first game instead.","June 6, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The infamous sequel that doesn't live up to it's name.

Just want to mow down some stormtroopers with ease? This is your game. Don't expect it to last long, unless you like collecting every little thing in a video game that doesn't affect gameplay significantly. Really, I can't recommend this to anyone besides people looking for a quick dose of near-pointless Star Wars action, and those people are rarer than prequel trilogy fans.

It gives you nowhere near as much customisation or options when it comes to compat (which is very repetetive anyway) combos consist of mashing atack button and randomly adding force somwhere along the way (or lightning if you prefer). enemies are piled up on top of eachother soo badly that i found myself using the repulse over and over and over again untill a certain sequence finished. options with upgrades are also very limited (if you can call these options) you get 3 levels of each power (sabre, force, lightning etc) and choose between each one when you can upgrade them. They got rid of option of seperate colour crystals and ability crystal (life leach, fire, electric etc) for your sword, that means you get no red life leach or green lightning blades like you always wanted. sound track is nothing special cant complain but i found myself at no point in game just standing and listinening to a great tune.\nIMPORTANT PART: if you want a game that you can play for a day then by all means leave this game in the dark room and lock it with a three foor iron door for this game has an overall paly time of an average COD game, this game finished at a point where you would with all honesty expect anotehr two hours of game play. sucks that does. at the same time the ONLY choice you get in game is at THE VERY END whic hgives you with all honesty absolutelly no satisfaction at all when you are shown credits 30 seconds after you made your choice.   Graphcal glitches were also present whihc often ruined the mood of hte game.\nSUMMING UP: If you are a hardcore fan of SWTFU 1 the nby all means buy this if you just enjoyed it but you are not a hardass star wars fan do NOT buy this unless it drops to       £3.50     at its highest. it is not worth more than this.","May 4, 2014","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On top of this there's a general lack of polish. Glitchy animations, ugly UI design, poor sound balance, an incredibly poorly executed and ill advised boss fight in the middle of the game, the list goes on.\n\nThe game feels like it was hastily cobbled together in 10 months, not 2 years. I knew all of this going in and hoped to be surprised by setting my expectations very low, but nope, it's just bad.  I'll finish it (I'm less than hour from the end anyway - Steam playtime is not accurate because I was offline for a bit), but out the traditional single player storyline games I've completed in the last 5 years, this is easily the worst.","May 5, 2014","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is one of the worst coded pieces of junk I have ever played. Its a horrible console port. Just getting it to run at all is a huge task. After 30 minutes of researching work arounds on the net, and finally tweaking my system enough to allow the game to even start without crashing, im then met with just absurd amounts of screen tearing (even with vsync), video stutter, flickering 3d objects and textures, and random hitching and slow down. Not to mention, the game is capped at 30 FPS, and the only unlocker hack is being distributed by people who package it with trojans.\n\nWhat a junk game. Do yourself a favor and find this game on the PS3 if you really want to play it. Lucas Arts deserved to go away if this is the quality of product they were putting out. Lucas should go and slap each and every one of the developers involved in this port.","May 6, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealtensecondsflat/recommended/32500/","therealtensecondsflat","Revan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealtensecondsflat/","204 products in account","This was a severely disappointing game.\n\nIt started off so good, which made it all the worse.  You start and instantly realize that the gameplay has gotten an improvement and that you feel just as powerful as your end-game Starkiller from TFU1.  Unfortunately, this is the only good part of the game- and you soon realize that it's terrible that you start so powerful.  You never get any stronger, or you never feel like you do.  This game lasted 4 hours at the VERY most and included a whopping 3 separate locations.  No, I refuse to count Dagobah as a location because you walk around for 45 seconds (I swear to God, I'm not even being sarcastic this time) and then watch a boring cutscene.  Then you leave.\n\nThe trailers promised a more personal, darker, grittier story line, but in reality it's a few hours of Starkiller running around murdering storm troopers and whining while Kota nags at him over the communicator.\n\nOh, and the pathetic 3.5-4 hours this game wastes includes an approximately 45 minute long boss fight.  It's not even difficult.  Literally the hardest part of this game was not slitting my own wrists while jacking off Darth Vader and watching his health bar move down slower than a dead snail in frozen molasses for the better part of an hour\n\nYeah, I know I'm being harsh. And of course it's always gonna be great fun to throw storm troopers out of the skybox over and over. But this game feels more rushed than deciding to finish wanking when you're already late for class.  And it's even more of a disappointment when compared to its predecessor.\n\nOh, also on the second boss battle, the boss didn't load.  No, I don't mean the level loaded funky- the boss itself didn't show up in the level.  So congrats on another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port, Aspyr.  Good to know you're always looking out for a third your consumers.","January 1","false","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is far more fluid, the controls are simple and easy to remember, the force powers feel useful, there are enough enemies to keep the game interesting, and not too many to overcomplicate things. The menu, while still an obvious console port, works far better, with fast access to your force powers, and a simple menu to change the color of your lightsabers. One noticable change to the game's formula is that now you have two lightsabers instead of one. Also, you'll notice slowdowns whenever you land successive hits on enemies similar to how the God of War series works which I really like as it allows you to more easily plan your next move. Quick time events are unfortutely still very much present. All of the big enemy types that you fight throughout the game have an optional quick time finisher move that got boring to watch so fast, I tried to avoid pressing the quicktime activation button and just finished off the enemy by slashing it instead. One nice addition is the ability to use the force to see where you needed to go next. The first game had a problem with instructing the player on what they were supposed to do next. I also liked the ability to use mind tricks on weak enemies so they would do things like kill themselves or attack their allies.\n\nNow here are the problems with this game. I have never in my life played a shorter game. 4 hours. That's right... 4. There are literally only 3 levels in the game: Kamino, some Cloud City like place, and a spaceship interior. The pacing feels way off, as if I was missing the first 3 levels. After the initial tutorial level, you go to this Cloud City place and fight through room upon room of increasingly difficult waves of enemies until you reach a huge colliseum where you're faced with a gigantic boss. This boss goes on FOREVER. So long, I was afraid I was already facing the end of the game. But no, this is just some overly drawn out filler that takes up a majority of the game. I'm not sure why the developers thought it important to draw this out as it isn't necessarily a fun boss that let's you use your skills to their full potential.\n\nAnother major problem is the story. It's not nearly as good as the first one. You barely interact with any of the good characters established in the first game, and your charater's motives are purely to save the damsel in distress this time which just does not feel as powerful as the motive of the first game's character. The storyline overall just feels rather uninspired and doesn't seem to add anything to the overall arch of the Star Wars universe. The cool thing about the first one was that it helped to link the prequel movies and the original trilogy together. Force Unleashed II does no such thing and feels like that awkward straight to DVD movie that nobody ever watches unless they buy it by accident.\n\nThe graphics look incredible, especially for a game that's already a couple years old. Very nice lighting, nice soft edges, and some smooth framerates. The cutscenes are also looking fantastic, almost movie quality.\n\nThe sound is a big improvement, though the music is still a bit hit/miss. The voice acting of most characters is decent, but not nearly as good as the first game. The main character's voice acting is horrendous this time around, with really awkward pubescent screams when he gets angry that just give you that awkward embarassed feeling. I just want Darth Vader to be like "..whoa.. calm down you big baby."\n\nAll-in-all, this game is a better GAME than Force Unleashed I. But Force Unleashed I has a better STORY than Force Unleashed II.","May 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The endings don't make sense and the story was overall un-interesting.\n\nThe enemies were boring and all the cutscene finish moves were exactly the same. One of the things that made the original game decent is the lighsaber duels with jedi and sith, as well as the variety of ways to kill an enemy. This game lacked all of that.\n\nThere was virtually no content to the game; roughly 6 hours of play-time to finish and every level looked the same. On some planets, I could turn a corner and be in a room that looks exactly like the last room.\n\nWhat was crippling is that there wasn't really anything new after the first game. This felt like the graphics were freshened up a bit and a story was added as an afterthought to get people to buy this as a new game.\n\nThis game did exactly one thing that I really liked, and that was a boss battle that happened pretty early in the game. I found that fight to be a fight worthy of the Star Wars franchise, and it is probably the only part of the game that sticks out in my mind. However, the story material for that boss battle is extremely borrowed and I have seen those same concepts in other video games and movies, which is only part of what limits that single fight from salvaging this game.\n\nOverall, I don't play a lot of video games, and I especially don't play a lot of bad video games, so take that into account when I say that this is one of the worst games I've ever played.","February 3","false","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealtensecondsflat/recommended/32500/","therealtensecondsflat","Revan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealtensecondsflat/","204 products in account","This was a severely disappointing game.\n\nIt started off so good, which made it all the worse.  You start and instantly realize that the gameplay has gotten an improvement and that you feel just as powerful as your end-game Starkiller from TFU1.  Unfortunately, this is the only good part of the game- and you soon realize that it's terrible that you start so powerful.  You never get any stronger, or you never feel like you do.  This game lasted 4 hours at the VERY most and included a whopping 3 separate locations.  No, I refuse to count Dagobah as a location because you walk around for 45 seconds (I swear to God, I'm not even being sarcastic this time) and then watch a boring cutscene.  Then you leave.\n\nThe trailers promised a more personal, darker, grittier story line, but in reality it's a few hours of Starkiller running around murdering storm troopers and whining while Kota nags at him over the communicator.\n\nOh, and the pathetic 3.5-4 hours this game wastes includes an approximately 45 minute long boss fight.  It's not even difficult.  Literally the hardest part of this game was not slitting my own wrists while jacking off Darth Vader and watching his health bar move down slower than a dead snail in frozen molasses for the better part of an hour\n\nYeah, I know I'm being harsh. And of course it's always gonna be great fun to throw storm troopers out of the skybox over and over. But this game feels more rushed than deciding to finish wanking when you're already late for class.  And it's even more of a disappointment when compared to its predecessor.\n\nOh, also on the second boss battle, the boss didn't load.  No, I don't mean the level loaded funky- the boss itself didn't show up in the level.  So congrats on another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port, Aspyr.  Good to know you're always looking out for a third your consumers.","January 1","false","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well...it's more of a "meh" situation. It retains the core concept of being overpowered with the force and now you can wield two lightsabers! Sounds fun and it is fun. On the graphics side of things it has improved quite alot - facial animations and character movement have been made to feel more natural. On the gameplay side it is all there - quick and fast button combinations result in making a badass jedi/sith action that makes your jaw drop. But that is pretty much it. The story is ridiculously convoluted - the whole prequel cloning idea brought in the original trilogy mythos. The story feels unfinished and sometimes forced (no pun intended). Grind your way towards becoming overpowered and while advancing the "plot" of the story, face a God Of War style boss battle. Press the right button prompts and you are done.\n\nThe techinical and mechanical aspects of the game have been improved, but there is no narrative to drive the player to finishing the game.

I played in on 360 and thought it was fine. I got this on a sale a long time ago and never got around to playing it. Until yesterday.\n\nAnd then I beat it.\n\nI am not good at video games. But even I thought this game was ridiculously easy. And short. Which is not helped by the game's lack of difficulty. Seriously, I was done in about 4 hours on medium difficutly. And I took my time to try and find some of those dumb holocrons and mess around with the force powers. I have been told the dark ending has some additional stuff to do. But I didn't pick that ending. Given how the game closes with the light side option, there is still more stuff to do anyway. But that's not in this game.\n\nWhen you play the game, it basically becomes: saber attack with lightning or use lightning. The combat was not interesting. The enemy types were very predictable and were not well placed. The boss fights were not any better. I really only remember two: the giant monster and the last one. I'm not sure if I missed bosses or just misunderstood what parts of the game counted as boss fights. But those fights were just boring.\n\nThe story is also pathetically weak. Even by old EU Star Wars standards. To be fair, it's really hard to make a story be relatable when your main character is so stupidly overpowered. I get that the super powers are the point. They enable the "fun" of the game. But it's really not fun. There is nothing to do worth doing. Even if we assume the game was fun to play, that's no excuse to go this lazy with the plot. And to end on that cliffhanger? Why? Just finish the story. Who thought this was enough content? I guess I shouldn't be too upset, I didn't like what they did up to that point.\n\ntl;dr - The game is short, easy, forgettable, and just bad. If you are looking to waste money and are a Star Wars fan/somewhat liked the first game, just buy something else. Seriously. Don't buy this game.","May 9","false","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

[SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\nFirst of all, it's STAR WARS, so that has that going for it.  Even with the whole "Legends"/"Canon" thing, the story is enjoyable and engaging.  The final sequence before facing Vader in the end is incredibly well done:\n\n- cramped camera (normally a bad thing, but here it really highlights the stress and pressure that Starkiller feels, an outstanding cinematic technique)\n- the lighting (stark, clinical white in places, but it still manages to look dark and insidious; the blood-red lights at each of the abberant clone-tanks really accent the sinister operations there)\n- the Force energy (Starkiller's surroundings crumple and disintegrate, which provides a VERY visual metaphor at how he's struggling to keep from losing his mind.)\n\n\nWhile you need to have played the first one to really understand all the nuances of this game, the cinematics and dialogue fill in the blanks enough for brand new players to grasp the events and goings-on.\n\nThe ability to customize not one but TWO lightsabers not only provides gameplay bonuses but can also serve as roleplaying tools if you so desire.  You start with red crystals but can find others as you play...\n\nRED: no bonus\nBLUE: lightsaber strikes replenish Force meter\nGREEN: more health pickups from defeated enemies\nYELLOW: lightsaber strikes deal additonal lightning damage\nCHARTREUSE: lightsaber attacks deal additonal corrosive damage\nORANGE: lightsaber strikes deal additional fire damage\nPURPLE: take less damage from attacks\nPINK: Force Fury meter recharges faster from attacking\nLIGHT BLUE: Force powers use less energy\nLIGHT GREEN: health regenerates faster\nLIGHT ORANGE: more experience points for collateral/environmental damage\nBLACK: lightsaber attacks have a chance to disintegrate enemies\nWHITE: more experience points for defeating enemies\n(I may have missed one or two, there's a lot of them)\n\nForce powers make a comeback, and are more streamlined.  Plus a new one, MIND-TRICK, where you can make enemies flee the battle (often by jumping of a ledge to their demise) or even fight for you.\n\nThe voice acting is well done.  You hear the unbridled power when Starkiller taps into Force Fury and the despair when Vader outmaneuvers him.  Rahm Kota speaks with authority on the starship Salvation and speaks out of weariness when he knows that Starkiller is the only one who can turn the tide.\n\n~~~~~\n\nThe reason for the multiple scores is relatively simple.  Most people know that the game was rushed due to the Lucasfilm/Disney merger; and with this game being the second in a trilogy, the fact that the trilogy has been shelved indefinitely... that can put a downer on somebody.\n\nIf you are a STAR WARS fan who enjoyed the films, the TV shows, and what else, then you'll enjoy this game.\nPut it on your wishlist, watch for a sale if you're worried, there's a decent amount of replayability and the difficulty can be whatever you make of it.\n\nIf you want something that you can just button-mash through, then play on easy.  You'll still be able to enjoy the story.\nIf you want to feel like every battle is like when Luke faces Vader in the second Death Star, then play on the hardest difficulty setting.\n\nUnfortunately, and as much as it pains me to say it... if you're not a fan of action games or combo systems you may not have as much fun with this.  If you're not a STAR WARS fan, then why are you even reading this?\n\nIt's not a BAD game by any means, but as I said before, it's clear that there was more to be had but real-life events forced their hand.\n\n~~~~~\n\nSYNOPSIS:  At once engaging, enthralling, and haunting; the continuation of Starkiller's journey is made even more poignant by the fact that it is *not* canon.  You see the formation of a Rebellion that now never was against the machinations of an Empire that now never were.\n\nIt's a bit like the work of an artist.  Once they're gone what they've made is now priceless.\n\nEven though Starkiller is no longer "real", his struggle is, and that's the soul of this game.","June 3","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a true-fan, no matter what I love every star wars game (especially Jedi Knight series), but this one didn't do it for me.\n-There is no variation in enemies... ever!\n\nOverall 5/10.

First I really like Star Wars though beside the videogames and a few books about Obi wan prior to the Phantom Menace I never really got into the whole Expanded universe. I picked up Force Unleashed somewhere in a Humble Bundle and played it through it in one sitting. Though it failed to deliver in whats the\nmost important thing for me, the lightsaber battles (Jedi Knight; Jedi Academy still has the best actual lightsaber battles in my opinion) it managed to have some great moments just living on this premise that your character is "overpowered" in terms of his Forcepowers. (Still considering pulling out the Stardestroyer out of orbit one of my favourite Star Wars videogame moments)\n\nAnd then Force Unleashed 2 comes along. A horrible short 4-5 hours QTE ridden snorefest with no real story, no excitement and no real reason to exist other than to potentially cash in on the main character, the license or whatever.\n5 hours on hard I must add. I guess you could easily breeze through this in 3 or less hours on easy, leaving you with no real further value beside some challenges. I wasn't even able to finish it because apperantly a GTX 750 is below the minimum requirement since today (could play without any problems yesterday). The cutscenes were also stuttering for whatever reason and the game is hardcapped to 30 frames per second.\n\nDon't waste your money on this turd.

The amount of bugs in this game is also insane, even in game cinematics have very obvious bugs. Stormtroopers heads shaking around, Darth Vader walking through the ground, etc. When you see a pre-rendered cinematic having ridiculous bugs, just turn off your pc. There is no vertical sync option and the screen is always tearing so much so that its strange when there isn't a tear. Story is pointless and tacked on, nothing that happens is important, honestly can't even think of anything to say about it, but you will get a few laughs out how awkward it can be. The gameplay isn't even as good or tight as the first (which wasn't good or tight at all), the lightsaber pausing everytime you hit an enemy for a second drove me insane.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you are a Star Wars fanatic like myself you will get a bit of enjoyment out of this. The music of John Williams is never disappointing, and a lightsaber always is fun.\n\nThis game is nowhere near $20 value as there is story based DLC for other games that are of more quality and longer than The Force Unleashed II. I honestly feel bad for anyone that paid $60 for it. It's pretty clear that the developer signed a contract saying they needed to make a sequel and had no idea what to do. There are plenty of fantastic Star Wars games that you should spend your time with such as the Jedi Knight or Knights Of The Old Republic series. Even if you have already played those games you will enjoy playing them again for four hours more than you will enjoy beating The Force Unleashed II's campaign.\n\nStill not convinced? Okay lets try this **waves hand** you will not buy this game.\n\nEdit: Just found out that this does not include the DLC for the game, making it even less worth your time & money. :)","February 12, 2015","false","4.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

I was impressed with the beginning of this game. What seemed like a solid story, fluid gameplay and beutiful graphics, I thought I was looking forward to a good game. But in the end I was disappointed.\n\nI have completed this game in 3 hours, which for its price is ridiculous (I bought this as part of the star wars collection). It was so short. It may as well have been DLC for the first game. Even then you would expect a strong story, which it also failed to deliver. We were left with a repeat of the end of Episode 3 movie. Turns to dark side to save the women he loves but she still dies. Or the other ending where evrything is O.K. but considering what happens in the dark side endig does'nt make an appearence in the light side ending makes no sense.\n\nThis game has litrally about 4 levels (5 if you include the fill in the dots mission on Dagobah). The levle themselves never offered much. "Do this force power to pass through this part. Now just to make sure you know it do it again." Then you will never do this again throughout the game.\n\nSo with all this, you would expect the game to at least give us a strong ending. But sadly no. We are left with a sub par boss fight with Darth Vader with very repetitive sections that just ruin the emotion of the fight.\n\nSo overll, I would not recommend buying this game at full price. Maybe if it were on sale and you are an adamnet star wars fan you may enjoy it. Some of the gameplay mechanics are amzing and very fun to play with. But at the end I was left with a sour tate in my mouth that has led me to not reccomend this game.","June 12, 2014","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

The graphics and gameplay are nice, but certainly not worth the regular price.\nAlltogether, I would rate it 5/10.\n\nFull review:\n\nAfter finishing the orginal The Force Unleashed I was really curious about the second part. Unfortunately, after playing this game I feel cheated.\n\nCompared to the first part, the plot is almost nonexistent. All the characters are as flat as a pancake, in the first part you could easily see some fabular connections between them, could somehow dive into their stories. Here? There's nothing like this. Don't even come close to this game unless you finished the first part. Otherwise, you will be just going through levels with constant "What is this all about?" in your head.\n\nI really liked beginning of the game, but it just kept getting worse after the first boss fight, probably because it was incredibly repetitive. There are some new types of enemies, but there are only so many combinations before the player gets bored with slaying them.\n\nOn the other side, gameplay itself is pretty good. Although the fight system is simplified, it is still enjoyable. I feel that a lot of potential coming from adding a second lightsaber is missed, for example I'd really like to see parrying with one saber while throwing the other.\n\nGraphics are pretty good and the game doesn't require high end PC to play on highest settings. In fact, most of the time it ran quite smooth in Full HD with maxed settings on my laptop (Lenovo Y580).\n\nTo sum up, it is an average game which I probably wouldn't even bother playing unless it was part of Star Wars unvierse. I would only recommend buying this game when it is heavily discounted or as a part of some bundle. Otherwise, it simply is not worth it.\n\nPlot: 3/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio: 6/10===\nGENERAL: 5/10","February 6, 2015","false","9.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Incredibly repetitive to the point where I just lowered the difficulty to easy in the fight at Cato Nemoidia because of how dull and long it was.  Darth Vader was probably one of the worst boss fights I've ever played in a game, it just goes on forever and is incredibly repetitive.\n- Only three areas Kamino, Cata Nemoidia (which is the longest and best level despite the terrible boss fight), and a rebel ship.  I don't count Dagobah because you don't do anything there.  Basically there are only 4-5 levels total compared to the like 10 of the first game.\n- Too short, it's only about half the length of the first game, I beat it in about 5 hours.\n- Incredibly repetitive, towards the end I just played even the levels on easy due to how dull they were.\n- Mostly uninteresting story, especially compared to the first game.\n- Lack of anything really new over the first game, besides Jedi Mindtrick and wielding two lightsabers, there isn't much new.\n- More quciktime events than 1.\n- Inferior to the first game in every way (except graphics obviously).","March 13, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It was utter crap to be honest for a game the only joy I had were the cut scenes and Vadar is REALLY REALLY easy to beat. Also any Star Wars fan will die if they play this because it doesn't work at all. It just doesn't make sense how easy they lock up and capture Vadar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCreed/recommended/32500/","MCreed","Creed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCreed/","99 products in account","This game is worth at best 1£/hour. Seeing as it clocks in at 4 hours in a fairly avarage run, I'd say avoid it like the plague.\n\nUsability:\nThis is also because it has numerous issues running properly on my win 7. To actually get it to start you need to change the compability settings of you .exe, an .exe which you must first download online if you actually want to play your figther game at 60fps instead of 30. Add to that the long, unskippable start up movies (which you can fix with another download).  Of course you also have some random crashes ( i counted 4) during playtime, and a few glitches while plaing. All in all it's not a very good port. Though i will say it actually does present graphical options, unlike it's predesessor.\n\nCombat:\nThe gameplay is very much the same as one. You have you're similar attacks, lightsaber throwing, litghtning firing and normal saber combat basically. Where it changes is in the speed of combat. Your dash ability from 1 has a shorter cooldown, you wield 2 lightsabers instead of one, which basically means you hit faster, but you're comboing abilities are if anything increased. Unlike the 1st installment, you have little ability to change hit quickly, so you mostly end up doing a quick few slahes on normal enemies, and spam the normal 4 hit combo on more tough ones.\n\nThere are two new installments. Those are mindtricks, the ability to turn a weak enemy to your side, and rage. Mindtricks replace the sheild from 1, but offers little useability to make up for this. Since you dispose of enemies so quickly, and the effect last such a short time, it barely sees any use. Rage on the other hand works as you would expect. you kill enemies, build up ragem, and get a damage boast for a short amount of time on use. All in all it is an allright mechanic, if a bit underused.\n\nTha min issue with the combat lies in it's overreliance of quick time events. Any enemy stronger than your common lightsaber uer or stormtrooper is finished using the same qte, with minor variations in buttons. This means since you have the same animations and enemies throughout the game, you end up repeating it for atleast 50 times over the course of playing. Add to that the stronger focus in bossfights. where earilier the main combat was indeed swordplay and force use, with qte's being used as finishers, here almost the entirety of the bossfights are qtes.\n\nUpgrades:\nAs in 1, you have your lightsaber upgrades. These are colloected as holocrons, which are fairly easy to find as you progress through the game. They are cosmetic and gameplay effects rolled into one, where you can pick one crystal for ech saber, having effectssuch as drain health,\n\nYou also have your powerupgrades as in 1. In 2 these are instead "streamlined" or perhaphaps simplu dumbed down, into one page. Previously you could upgrade your powers, your combos and your player strenghts (hp, energy etc9 with different points earned by lvling up and completing challanges. Here you get all your points based on enemy death (as in bulletstrom). Your upgrade all your swordplay (damage, combos) in one, and the rest upgrades your indivudual forcepowers. The problem with this way is you loose the sense of progression of 1. Since you have all the useful combos from a fully upgraded jedi from 1, you dont actually receive any interesting new combos with upgrades. This leads to all upgrades essentialy being damage buffs, something which isnt very exciting for a quick, combo based combat.\n\nAesthetics:\nImmidiatley you can see they put a lot of effort into making this a beautiful game. The scale of the eniroments, and graphical fidelity are much better than 1, and are enjoyable throughout the game. The only gripe i have is that they removed the enemy healthbars, making fairly difficult to know the damage required to actually bring down enemies.\n\nStory:\nThis game picks up a year or so after 1, and it follows a supposed clone of good old Starkiller. He keeps his old memories, and becomes obsessed with finding the (very) brief love interest of 1. That's it. That's the story. You find Kota from 1, assualt the cloning facility you were created, and fight Vader. Game over. This in a game where half the time (atleast) is spent in qte's and cutscenes. Needless to say it doesn't offer enough.\n\nConclusion:\nIt feels like this game was horribly rushed. The potential lies to have the game stretch atleast another 4 hours, both story wise and gameplay. If nothing else they could have reused enviroments and enemies from 1, albeit graphically updated. As it is, the game ends up feeling like watching an anime, as the game grabs every possibility to wrestle control away from the player at every turn. The little combat there is isn't varied and enjoyable enough to carry the game either, mainly taking place inside corridors and buldings, inlike the vast fauna of felucia in 1 or burning buldings from the wookies homeland. In other words, dont play this game. It isn't worht the wait for the download.","March 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalpour/recommended/32500/","Kalpour","Kalpour Algheri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalpour/","461 products in account","If you’re looking for a great game, please stop here. This game isn’t great, it’s not even good. Mediocre would describe it best. Star Wars the Force Unleashed 2 is rather bland. Here is a breakdown of the game:\n•	Graphics: The game looks nice. Nice crisp visuals help make the game look good.  The rain on Kamino looks amazing, and the destructible environments make the visuals pretty. 7/10\n•	Framrate: Playing on PC is not recommended as the game isn’t optimized well. You’ll run into problems similar to the predecessor. Low framerate. The game tries, but ultimately fails to stay at 30FPS, with frequent drops to as low as 11FPS. As I was playing on the PC, not being able to make the game run at 60FPS, as I do most other games, with the constant drops make this a painful sore on my eyes. 2/10\n•	Gameplay: This is much like driving your first car. It feels amazing at first. You feel like you have all the power in the universe, but then you take a second to realize how boring driving really is. The game tries to throw a few curves your way, but by now you know how your car runs, and these curves really do nothing but slow you down a little. You fight the same enemies over and over again, with the only variation being the combination of the enemies. You can take everything down with your lightsaber. Very little thought is needed to mow down the enemies. You can spice it up using some combinations, but the X-X-X-X combination is really all you need. A few enemies are hard to hit, and you just have to throw a little lightning at them, but that’s all you need to do. The bosses are not much better. All you have to do is learn a simple pattern, and lather, rinse, repeat. They don’t change how they’re acting, and the get predictable really fast. 4/10\n•	Level design: The levels don’t really resonate well. They are long, and filled with the same waves of enemies over and over again. The platforming bits mix it up a little bit, and in my opinion, the best levels are the ones where you are falling. You have to dodge out of the way of incoming objects, or you can blast them aside with a force push. But that’s it. Platforming becomes a chore in this game, and sometimes it’s just rather frustrating. 3/10\n•	Story: The story jumps around, and all you ever seem to do is teleport to wherever the plot says you have to go with nothing really tying it all together. The jump between level one and two is rather Jarring. You escape from the cloning facility on Kamino when Vader is about to kill you, and then all of sudden you are trying to track down your old master from the last game. No explanation. The romantic side of the story is lacking, and feels half ♥♥♥♥♥. 2/10\n•	Length: The game is short. Painfully so. You can beat this game in a matter of hours with no difficulty. You will get to the final level and feel like the game is half over at best. You can beat this game in about 4 hours, if you include the cutscenes. If you ignore the cutscenes, it ranges between 2 and 3 hours at most. The most replayability you get is from playing with a different costume, such as a Storm trooper or Boba Fett. 3/10\nAll in all, this game feels like it shouldn’t exist. It adds nothing new to the lore, which as of this writing is non canon, but regardless. The game is short, doesn’t feel great, the story is lacking, but it looks nice. Don’t play this game, it will leave you with an empty feeling inside. Nothing is really of note. If you really want to play this game, then I suggest you get it heavily marked down, or like I did and get it in a bundle where you only paid a few dollars for. My final scoring of the game is a 3.5/10.\n","April 19, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not loyal to the lore any way, and infact tries to make the star wars lore adhere to its poorly written story. That aside, the game play is pretty boring. I find it reminiscent to a play station 1 platformer, with sort of flashier graphics. If you're a brain dead drooling zombie that gets a woody from seeing flashing lights, then yea I suppose this game is for you. That or you can spent $5 bucks paying someone to jingle a shiny set of keys infront of you. For what ever reason, you're a god in the game, not a jedi, not a sith...you're unstoppable. There is no challenge, it's just you versus things that want to die. The only challenge I had, and the only time I began to die was fighting the last boss. It turned into this sort of platform jumping fight, but it was incredibly buggy, and often ran into invisible walls that forced you to die in order to create this illusion of a "epic" battle. Of course that's not to mention how generic the main character is, he's the vanilla Shepard/Assassins Creed/Cole MacGrath. tall shaved head and white character. Who knew the neo nazi look was something we could all relate to. Also it's absurdly short, took me something like 5ish hours to beat.","May 3, 2014","false","4.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It had fun and easy to use force mechanics, the best I'd seen, with a passable story and decent brawler gameplay to boot. Outside of a few frustrating segments and glitches, it was an amazing experience, which held my attention for a good 20+ hours.\n\nWith that in mind, I was excited for the sequel. Unfortunately, The Force Unleashed II pales in comparison to its predecessor. Its 4-6 hour length is probably its greatest weakness, and this game certainly has weaknesses. Perhaps by itself it's not that bad of a game, although I can't help but compare it to the first game, an adventure which saw you flying around the galaxy, from jungles to lava planets to imperial ships, fighting various rancors, robots, Jedi and Sith. It was amazing! This game, however, barely innovates at all on what the previous title had to offer; the combat system remains largely unchanged, the story this time around is decidedly boring, and the enemy and location variety seem to be worse than before. Strangely enough, even the menu graphics stand out as outdated and clunky.\n\nBottom line, play the first Force Unleashed instead. The only thing this game does better is graphics.","September 24, 2014","false","8.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1kmonkeys/recommended/32500/","1kmonkeys","Needs Food Badly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1kmonkeys/","434 products in account","The first Force Unleashed was by no means a perfect game. On just about every count, Force Unleashed II is worse.\n\nWhile this game continues to let you play a god-like Jedi who tosses aside armies with a swat of his hand, that's about all it really gets right.\n\nControls: Stiffer and less natural than before, with limited mobility on your character. You can fly through the air, but can't walk faster than a hurried trot. It's been a while since I've played the first one, but in this one my movement felt hamstrung.\n\nEnemies: Just as in the first game, enemies eventually cope with your god-like powers by being magically immune to some of them (though this is usually less annoying than it is the first time around). I wonder where Vader's armies of secret Force-immune warriors and missile-toting robots went by the beginning of A New Hope.\n\nBoss fights tend to have incredibly simple patterns, and yet drag on endlessly.\n\nLevel Design: There are a few interesting set-pieces in this extremely linear game, but too often the design slows you down with endless and very dull jumping and locking mechanism "puzzles" that really do nothing but delay your progress with pointless tedium.\n\nOverall art direction is OK, with a fair amount of work put into some levels and not so much into others.\n\nStory: Anyone who played the first game knows that the Force Unleashed story is totally ridiculous but serviceable, given that they're just trying to write some kind of plot around the fun gameplay gimmick of being an ultra-powerful Jedi. Despite what a cheesy tie-in it was, it felt epic in its own way.\n\nThis time around, though, the writers completely phoned it in. Nothing is explained if you haven't played the first game, and makes little sense even if you did. The plot is extremely lazy--your character doesn't even really talk for the first two levels or so, and there's a lot of pointless cameos. Yoda shows up, says two lines to the protagonist, and then disappears before either character asks the other's name.\n\nIn terms of storytelling depth, it feels like a half-baked DLC add-on for the first game at best. That may be a generous assessment. The game is noticeably short, even compared to the fairly short first game.\n\nMusic: About the same as before, with an OST consisting of exactly one musical sting for your character. All other music is recycled John Williams score, even if it wouldn't be terribly appropriate for the given moment in the game.\n\nCharacter Customization: There's still a paper-thin leveling system (your choices here don't really matter). Your lightsaber provides you different bonus stats based on the color, but the advantages from color to color are not terribly significant. There doesn't appear to be much in the way of other cosmetic options.\n\nTechnical Aspects: I could forgive this game's shortcomings if it weren't for the problem that it's a classic example of a bad console port. Most of the graphics settings are completely locked--including the framerate and refresh rate--and it appears that it's impossible to change them. The options menu is clearly blown up from a lower resolution--it looks terrible on 1080. Many users report severe problems on their systems, though I didn't have any.\n\nAt $6, I felt like I broke even on this purchase, and I've had a better experience than many, likely due to a computer that can handle this game's overly demanding specs easily. If I paid $50 for this, I would be enraged.\n\nRig:\nIntel i5 @3.4 ghz\n8 GB RAM\nGeForce GTX 760","May 6, 2014","false","4.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Customizing Starkiller is based on completing specific tasks and finding hidden items throughout the world. As character development goes, Starkiller has an interesting and nonconventional character arch which I believe helped the overall story. I personally enjoyed the concept of having different suits throughout the game. Since each lightsaber is treated as an individual item, players can mix match saber crystals. After completing the linear, choice-sprinkled story players are granted new game+ features, which include new outfits and new game difficulties. The most apparent reason to complete the game would be to find all the hidden items, play with a new look and use all your high level abilities. I high recommend this game for anyone looking for a exciting and sometimes challenging action-adventure game. CerealCommander","July 12, 2012","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Memories keep flooding back to you from Starkillers past leading Vader to consider you a flawed clone. You escape so that Vader doesn't kill you and begin your journey to find out who you are.\n\nPositive\nThe combat feels better than the orignal if you ask me. Sure its a bit of a buttom mashup, but honestly who cares when it's fun. The levels aren't as big and less resources were used, but with a more streamlined design comes better playability. The graphics have been increased since the original as well, but that may also be because the levels are smaller. The boss fights in this game are fewer and less challenging, but they feel like boss fights. The boss fights are much more God of War. The PC port is actually playable.\n\nNegative\nThe game is short. The smaller levels and lack of resources make some zones feel copy and pasted. The story is even more bland then the original and the ending makes you glad you didn't take much stake in it. The game did completely freeze causing me to have to restart twice.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a better PC port and the way the levels are designed to be played is much smoother then the original. It seems way to obvious that it wasn't developed as long though because the levels are repetitious and for a game that is only about 5 hours that is saying something.\n\nValue\nConsidering it is a bad port of an ok game I value it at $4.","February 8, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 I'm kind of indifferent about it. Hear are my pros and cons.\n\nPros\nThe Force Abilities\nGood story line\nAlot of cosmetic custimization\nChallenges give good replay value\nSupports Console Controls (This worked perfectly)\n\nCons\nBeat the whole game in 6-7 hours on my first ever playthrough\nLevel Design isn't the greatest. Alot of the areas look almost identical to other areas on a mission\nLess combos then SWTFU1\nThe lightsaber combo just doesn't feel as smooth as it did in the first game\nQuick time events are horrible\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who has not played the first SWTFU game. SWTFU1 is far superior to this game. I would highley recommend any Star Wars fan to try out the first game. This game I would only recommend buying if you can get it for under 5$ on a sale. My overall final impressions on the game is it felt like a beta so I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. The game is enjoyable but not as fun as the first one.","March 21, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I experienced the slow motion bug that a lot of people get, but I was able to fix by adding some limitations to the game shortcut.\n\nAnyway, the game is a very basic hack and slash game that goes by very fast. My final time was 5 1/2 hours to beat the game. I basically ran right through it without a single problem. Never died(well, I fell off one ledge) and blew threw 95% of the enemies without even thinking. The game is kind of mind-numbing.\n\nIt wasn't clear how to fight the bosses, either.

The first game was quite innovative, I remember awaiting it eagarly years ago..... You got to fight rancors, go into a sarlaac, fight on the first deathstar,  fight other jedi, do all of it on a variety of planets, and bring a whole Star Destroyer crashing down using just the force.\n\nHere you get two lightsabers................. and I wouldn't even call that an improvement.... but thats the closest thing you get to an improvement... Here you get to fight on a grand total of 2 planets....... and the only really remarkable thing you do is fight a giant creature created just for this game..... and you end up doing it in way that seems to directly plagiarize Lord of the Rings..... unlike the first game, you aren't left at all with the impression that you get to unleash the force, instead you're just an average force user...... The enemy force users... get to use better force powers than you do. At the end I was left thinking, "thats it? thats the whole game?!!!!!"\n\nOverall the only thing I am happy about with this game.... is that I didn't pay anything close to full price due to the humble bundle (bundle cost $12)... This was pretty much the worst game in the bundle...... Remarkable considering the oldest game on the bundle had almost a whole 15 years on this game.

Apart from a few moments, and all of them are non-combat related, it is a bland,boring and short game.\n\nThe story is...well not much of a story. It somehow feels empty, no structure, no twists, no anything. The only potential twist they could have done is more of a hint that leaves it up to you to think about it, but it's not one of those mindblowing things you wrap your head around for days. In this case, it is up to a minute. And then you're back to cursing Lucas for deciding to make this game.\n\nThe combat is the same as in the previous game, but somehow you are even more overpowered, and with the regenerating health and the ridiculously overpowered force lightning, you will just breeze through the game. Oh wait, you won't. Because it is filled with too many QTEs. Almost everything is a QTE. Every other door requires you to mash a button in order to open it. And the prompts are scattered to the sides of the screen so you have to look everywhere just to see them, and it doesn't help that they are small and easily blend with the surrondings.\n\nThe level and boss design are just lazy and atrocius. In the first game, levels did happen on same planets, but those were outdoor areas and they did bother to make them look interesting visually. Here there is a lot of backtracking through monotonous corridors and hallways, just wishing for the game to end. Bosses come down to silly QTEs followed by sillier button mashing with no patterns or anything. The final level+boss are especially frustrating, with the former consisting of a single needlessly long and generic platforming section...copied twice more. And that one section consists of a single platform copied ten times or so. And the boss is just a bunch of waves of enemies followed by button mashing...followed by a long QTE which ends with you having to mash the Q button for some 10s or so. And the game is ridiculously short even with the backtracking and level copy-pasting, and can be easily beaten in about 2-3 hours tops.\n\nIf I would have to choose anything good about the game...it would be the Dagobah level, mentioned at the beginning of this review.No fighting at all, just great ambient,atmosphere and cutscenes. Two more nice moments, both without fighting...and that would be it. Voice actors did the best they could, and did a pretty good job if I might say, but they can't do anything for the bland writing for an even blander story.\n\nThis is a game that definitely shouldn't have been made, and you shouldn't waste your time and money on it. If you are still interested in the story, might as well go to YT and watch all the cinematics (and maybe levels)...it might even be more enjoyable than playing the game itself.","February 14, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/untoldlegend19/recommended/32500/","untoldlegend19","shaheel makara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/untoldlegend19/","337 products in account","Game: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II\nFormat: PC\nReleased: 0ctober 2010\nWith the recent advent of Humble Bundles or at least to me they are newish I decided to buy to star wars bundle. In said bundle I received overall a total of 12 star wars games, I won't bore you with the list but that is a lot of star wars.  The game I want to draw attention to here is Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II.\n\nNow  personally I loved the first game other than the levels on Felucia it was a genuinely stellar game. It made you feel powerful, like a real force user out for revenge. The second one? Not so much. It's good and I enjoyed my time with it but my biggest issue is time. I completed the game quit out looked and steam and there it was. FOUR hours of game play from start to finish. Granted I was running through it on medium difficulty but even so should a sequel to a game that had a solid 8-10 story with a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of DLC released after the fact last FOUR ♥♥♥♥ing hours? No is the answer to that question. I'll save that rant for later though let's talk about the good first shall we?\n\nGraphics\n\nIt was a beautiful game when it first released back in October 2010 and it really does still stand up 4 years later. Weather effects, clothing moving in high winds, the motion capture is genuinely stellar it really shines through. Environments are fantastic and true to the movies, there are really very few games that get as visually close to delivering a star wars experience like Force Unleashed II. The flip side to this is artifacting everywhere all the time. graphical glitches were many and if this were a longer game maybe it would count as less but after FOUR hours there are just far too many graphic glitches. Another thing that ties into that is absolutely no V-syncing options at all and it's constantly stuck at 30FPS no matter the hardware configuration.\n\nGame Play/Mechanics\n\nThis is another place where I feel the game before was a better example of how to do things.  It had a better level system,  It had the better skill upgrades In the prequel you gain experience, level up, earn talent spheres, and the spend them on abilities. combos, and skills. in the sequel every time you break something or someone you gain force points which you then spend on the 6 skills open to you. This is literally it. you gain minor other bonuses from different Light Saber crystals but it's so insignificant its barely even worth mentioning. The fighting is much the same but with a severe lack of combos (of which there are only about 20 as opposed to the amount from game number one) really limits the flashy combat and pulls you away from feeling like you are a stupidly powerful Jedi/Sith. No real puzzle elements or alternate paths and that really doesn't help it's case of FOUR hours.\n\nSound\n\nThis will be a real short one. It sounds like Star Wars. biggest point to note here is like the prequel Mr James Earl Jones returns as the voice of Darth Vader. Voice acting is actually very well don across the board but then again you only ever hear about 5 characters actually speak. whodathunkit?\n\nReplayability\n\nNOPE. FOUR hours. FOUR hours. On a harder difficulty I might've gone a whopping 5 hours. some challenges await after completing the game and what DLC was released when pulled from sale for whatever reason. Once this game is finished there is NO reason to EVER come back to it.\n\nStory\n\nYou play as the clone of Starkiller for game numero uno on a quest for revenge and to save the one he loves. awww isn't that cute? isn't it also the most generic thing ever? I won't rant too much here I did enjoy it even for its generic seen it before storyline the voice acting really helped me trundle through the story. Much like the first game(noticing a theme yet?) you will be required to fight Darth Vader. this is the highlight of any of the bosses but I felt even that may have dragged on a bit too long.\n\nOkay rant time. Lucas Arts all you had to do was make the first game again make it look prettier and everyone would have been so happy with the end product but no, like every other developer you decide that you should change one of the fundamentally greatest things from the first game. The progression for Starkiller. you took what made that game great and just ♥♥♥♥ all over it with number 2(see what I did there?) I really wish that you had just copy pasted for number 2 and considering that  because of Disney we won't get number 3 there are so many things you left unanswered. is he Starkiller prime? is he just a clone like all the rest? If he is a clone why can he use the force? There is a real simple solution to all of this. DONT MAKE IT FOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! another 4-6 hours and you could have told the rest of star killers story and fans would have been happy but now all I have is an empty pit of unanswered questions and disappointment for series that could have been so much more.\n\nPositives\n\n•	Graphically beautiful\n•	Stellar voice work\n•	James Earl Jones\n\nNegatives\n\n•	Story was bland and been there done that\n•	graphical glitches\n•	FOUR hours\n•	No replayability what so ever\n•	FOUR hours\n\nI wish I could rate this higher but its only worth a 5 out of 10 IF this is your first outing with SW:TFUII then it will be fine and fun but please go back and play the first one it's so much better.\n","February 15, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customizing Starkiller is based on completing specific tasks and finding hidden items throughout the world. As character development goes, Starkiller has an interesting and nonconventional character arch which I believe helped the overall story. I personally enjoyed the concept of having different suits throughout the game. Since each lightsaber is treated as an individual item, players can mix match saber crystals. After completing the linear, choice-sprinkled story players are granted new game+ features, which include new outfits and new game difficulties. The most apparent reason to complete the game would be to find all the hidden items, play with a new look and use all your high level abilities. I high recommend this game for anyone looking for a exciting and sometimes challenging action-adventure game. CerealCommander","July 12, 2012","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Ask yourself if this game is really worth that much. Because I don't think so.\n\nAs for gameplay it is quite solid. Except chase scenes, QTEs and minibooses.

Meh.\n(Spoilers Ahead)\n\nThe good parts first:\nCombat is a lot faster and better, and the force usage is more "powerful". The graphics are looking really good and the CG is a lot better than it was in the first game. New enemy units and the lightsaber system of power crystal and color crystal have turned into one, also being considerably bigger than it was in the first game.\n\nThe bad parts last:\nIt doesn't run smoothly, 30FPS cap is there again, the story is quick and very weak, the characters feel weird too. Starkiller (or his clone) looks like he went backwards in development, he's guided almost entirely on emotion, he doesn't care about the rebellion, he seems completely off from what he was in the first game. Juno works as a damsel in distress role, barely talks... It just felt too bizarre. The enemy units, though some are new, are very, VERY, repetitive. An exemple is you fight a big riot shield ice-throwing droid at every turn, and when the devs got tired of it, they made a flame-throwing version designed to do the same thing with different effects and as frequently as the first one. The last level is a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fest, an unnecessarily big fight between you and Vader across the cloning facility doing the same thing at the same platforms over and over again.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential to be great, really great.

Force Unleashed II is very obviously a mere afterthought to its predecessor, with a campaign that without the long stretches of repetitive combat would make a fine piece of DLC, but is fairly laughable as a standalone game. The plot feels cut down to the bone marrow, with major plot points and character beats hand-waved in a way that hints ever so meekly at the epicness that could have been. Starkiller's bond to Vader could make for an explosive, compelling relationship, but we only ever see Vader briefly in the beginning and for the final boss confrontation at the end. We're to understand Starkiller is haunted by his former master throughout, but the dark lord's presence is all but forgotten after the initial escape from the cloning labs on Kamino. In general, the sometimes comically unhinged Starkiller is a completely unrelatable protagonist. Apparently his love for Captain Juno Eclipse, with whom he shared a shy kiss before plunging into the depths of the Death Star at the end of the original, has grown to such obsessive proportions that he turns his back on the rebellion he helped kickstart. Juno herself is even more of a non-entity than previously. She barely gets any lines and exist only as a lazy plot device to keep Starkiller moving along.\n\nHaving said all that, it's a beautiful looking game with a couple of truly spectacular set pieces.

I purchased this game as part of a bundle and played it immediately after Force Unleased I. The game looks significantly better, and is much less buggy than its predecessor. Hurling baddies across the galaxy is a lot of fun and the force powers work much better in this game than they did before. That being said, there are still a lot of really strange bugs that can hamper gameplay at various times. I had to restart one level because the auto-sequence wouldn't initiate due to one of the troopers getting stuck in a wall. I couldn't eliminate him and the sequence couldn't play out.\nThere are a ton of fun moments in this game. You'll fight giant monsters, use the force in powerful ways and say 'wow' more than once. That being said, the game is highly repetitive. Unlike the first game, there is little variety. For example, in the Force Unleashed, you can trigger a QTE to eliminate certain foes. There was more than one animation for these baddies because I'm sure the developers wanted things to feel fresh. Unfortunately, that variety was not carried over to this game. You fight the same guys over and over again and QTE them to the same animations over and over. It becomes boring and lackluster. The final "boss" battle was extremely repetitive and I simply tuned out. I'm sure if I had had a laser pointer, I could have had a cat jump on the strike button multiple times for twenty minutes and had won. I would have given the game an 7.5 out of 10. After the final fight, I give the game a 6. I couldn't believe how boring it was. Strike, strike, jump, repeat. That's it. And the worse part? It takes forever! I can't believe this got through the various design levels while this game was in development.\nOne thing you'll probably hear is that this game is short. I beat the game in 4 hours. Quite short indeed.\nUltimately, I would recommend the game if you can find it for less than $5. I wouldn't pay a penny more than that and even $5 is a bit of a stretch.","March 7, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh boy, was it over.  Clocking in at just over 7 hours of play time, this game feels more like a DLC pack for the first TFU.  I didn't even spend all of my experience upgrading my force powers, because I thought I had more time.  Just one bee in my bonnet- let me take you through the rest.\n\nI also thought that it might be DLC because this game is glitchy.  Like, all the glitches.  Clipping during cutscenes, random game-stopping graphical bugs and screen tears, unstoppable cutscenes that lead to character death, character death due to clipping after cutscenes, et cetera, etc.  Bee #2.\n\nThe repetition.  Oh, the repetition.  I never want to see another QTE-finishing move for the rest of my life.  I am really certain I could've finished this game in four hours if I didn't have to sit through a quick-time event after light-sabering anything bigger than a storm trooper.  And there's a lot of stuff in this game bigger than a storm trooper.  That's the third bee, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI'll stop there, because I could nitpick this game for a while.  I understand that this is someone's best effort, and it really does try to go somewhere with the story of a lonely clone rescuing his damsel in distress.  I wanted more of that, I really did.  But TFU2 just didn't deliver like the first game.  The feeling of being a formidable Sith assassin was fantastic in the first game, extremely fun and empowering.  I hate to sound like a Darth here, but the Light Side presented in this game is a little too vanilla.  Save your money and get TFU1 or Jedi Academy, both excellent games and truer to the Star Wars fanboy (or girl) in all of you.\n\nPlay this if you enjoy:\n-having more free time than you originally thought you would\n-Hayden Christianson's speech inflection\n-being disappointed in sequels","February 19, 2015","false","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/untoldlegend19/recommended/32500/","untoldlegend19","shaheel makara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/untoldlegend19/","337 products in account","Game: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II\nFormat: PC\nReleased: 0ctober 2010\nWith the recent advent of Humble Bundles or at least to me they are newish I decided to buy to star wars bundle. In said bundle I received overall a total of 12 star wars games, I won't bore you with the list but that is a lot of star wars.  The game I want to draw attention to here is Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II.\n\nNow  personally I loved the first game other than the levels on Felucia it was a genuinely stellar game. It made you feel powerful, like a real force user out for revenge. The second one? Not so much. It's good and I enjoyed my time with it but my biggest issue is time. I completed the game quit out looked and steam and there it was. FOUR hours of game play from start to finish. Granted I was running through it on medium difficulty but even so should a sequel to a game that had a solid 8-10 story with a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of DLC released after the fact last FOUR ♥♥♥♥ing hours? No is the answer to that question. I'll save that rant for later though let's talk about the good first shall we?\n\nGraphics\n\nIt was a beautiful game when it first released back in October 2010 and it really does still stand up 4 years later. Weather effects, clothing moving in high winds, the motion capture is genuinely stellar it really shines through. Environments are fantastic and true to the movies, there are really very few games that get as visually close to delivering a star wars experience like Force Unleashed II. The flip side to this is artifacting everywhere all the time. graphical glitches were many and if this were a longer game maybe it would count as less but after FOUR hours there are just far too many graphic glitches. Another thing that ties into that is absolutely no V-syncing options at all and it's constantly stuck at 30FPS no matter the hardware configuration.\n\nGame Play/Mechanics\n\nThis is another place where I feel the game before was a better example of how to do things.  It had a better level system,  It had the better skill upgrades In the prequel you gain experience, level up, earn talent spheres, and the spend them on abilities. combos, and skills. in the sequel every time you break something or someone you gain force points which you then spend on the 6 skills open to you. This is literally it. you gain minor other bonuses from different Light Saber crystals but it's so insignificant its barely even worth mentioning. The fighting is much the same but with a severe lack of combos (of which there are only about 20 as opposed to the amount from game number one) really limits the flashy combat and pulls you away from feeling like you are a stupidly powerful Jedi/Sith. No real puzzle elements or alternate paths and that really doesn't help it's case of FOUR hours.\n\nSound\n\nThis will be a real short one. It sounds like Star Wars. biggest point to note here is like the prequel Mr James Earl Jones returns as the voice of Darth Vader. Voice acting is actually very well don across the board but then again you only ever hear about 5 characters actually speak. whodathunkit?\n\nReplayability\n\nNOPE. FOUR hours. FOUR hours. On a harder difficulty I might've gone a whopping 5 hours. some challenges await after completing the game and what DLC was released when pulled from sale for whatever reason. Once this game is finished there is NO reason to EVER come back to it.\n\nStory\n\nYou play as the clone of Starkiller for game numero uno on a quest for revenge and to save the one he loves. awww isn't that cute? isn't it also the most generic thing ever? I won't rant too much here I did enjoy it even for its generic seen it before storyline the voice acting really helped me trundle through the story. Much like the first game(noticing a theme yet?) you will be required to fight Darth Vader. this is the highlight of any of the bosses but I felt even that may have dragged on a bit too long.\n\nOkay rant time. Lucas Arts all you had to do was make the first game again make it look prettier and everyone would have been so happy with the end product but no, like every other developer you decide that you should change one of the fundamentally greatest things from the first game. The progression for Starkiller. you took what made that game great and just ♥♥♥♥ all over it with number 2(see what I did there?) I really wish that you had just copy pasted for number 2 and considering that  because of Disney we won't get number 3 there are so many things you left unanswered. is he Starkiller prime? is he just a clone like all the rest? If he is a clone why can he use the force? There is a real simple solution to all of this. DONT MAKE IT FOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! another 4-6 hours and you could have told the rest of star killers story and fans would have been happy but now all I have is an empty pit of unanswered questions and disappointment for series that could have been so much more.\n\nPositives\n\n•	Graphically beautiful\n•	Stellar voice work\n•	James Earl Jones\n\nNegatives\n\n•	Story was bland and been there done that\n•	graphical glitches\n•	FOUR hours\n•	No replayability what so ever\n•	FOUR hours\n\nI wish I could rate this higher but its only worth a 5 out of 10 IF this is your first outing with SW:TFUII then it will be fine and fun but please go back and play the first one it's so much better.\n","February 15, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

( the whole clone thing)\n\n* Although i really like the titght combat, you can really swing some really cool combos together it can get a little repetetitive as the game goes on( last fight is pathetic in terms of wash rince repeat and the fact that the story doesnt make me even care that im fighting him, as we never really see the love interest thing develop much(even in the first game) , i found myself not caring what happend to her.\n* Kind of a big one that it seems a lot of people have experienced is the stuttering cutscenes and random crashes, i delt with the cutscenesas there are not that many but it can get bad , and the ridiculous slow down if you wear robes that flow ( this is apparently the reason)\n\nOVERALL; I liked the game but i was glad it was short as there was not much there to keep you interested in the campaign.

I d reccomment getting it on sale for 5 bucks if you can and playing it with a 360 pad, at least i found this a lot easier.

Alot of the areas look almost identical to other areas on a mission\nLess combos then SWTFU1\nThe lightsaber combo just doesn't feel as smooth as it did in the first game\nQuick time events are horrible\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who has not played the first SWTFU game. SWTFU1 is far superior to this game. I would highley recommend any Star Wars fan to try out the first game. This game I would only recommend buying if you can get it for under 5$ on a sale. My overall final impressions on the game is it felt like a beta so I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. The game is enjoyable but not as fun as the first one.","March 21, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think playing the first Star Wars: The Force Unleashed was enough. The gameplay was repetive and it was simply carried over to this game and this game didn't have nearly as good of a plot as the first, so it doesn't really add anything new or needed to the series. It has some minor improvements and a set of challenges separate to the campaign that you can do, but the game doesn't need to be played if you have the first one.","December 27, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very short (about 5 hours) and only has three different level types, Kamino clone facility, brown gas cloud type city, Rebel Cruiser (which you retrace your steps through the entire ship), Kamino clone facility. My main complaint with the first Force Unleashed was that they revisited the same levels multiple times. They did the same thing again but the levels are longer and there is even less variety. The combat is fun and enjoyable, the story is forgettable and unlike the first game doesn't make sense in the Star Wars Universe.\n\nTo sum up my feelings:\n\nPros:\nDecapitate Storm Troopers\nCombat is enjoyable\nForce lightening\nPacing\nAuthentic Star Wars feel, sounds art design etc\n\nCons:\nLack of level variety\nShort\nStability (see below)\n\nThis game requires Windows 7 Compatibility Mode be enabled if your running Windows 8. Before I enabled it the game would hard crash (power off) my machine during the intro cut scene. After enabling Compatibility mode the game would only occasionally crash to the desktop. Luckily since the game saves often and is fairly short the disruption was minimal. If the game had been longer or if the save points had been further apart it would have been a very different experience.","December 28, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted i was playing on easy, but that really only affects how fast enemies go down, you could probably add 30 mins for the difficulty increase.\nIt feels more like it was a addition mission in the Ultimate Sith Edition. but if you picked the good ending of the SWtFU1\n\nGameplay:\nYou will try to be creative with your Force Powers but, after a while you just in up fighting the same enemies and you lose inspiration.\nThe basic enemies go down with one attack lightsaber or force (on easy) and then there are enemies cant be harmed by the force so you have to use your saber. so you end up using the same saber combo over and over and throw in some force lightning every now again. Plus the occasional Context Sensitive Force Use.\n\nBoss battles were lacking, and lacking in numbers. You didnt really feel like you were doing as much damage as you were, like the opponents didnt give the fufilling reaction i wanted.\n\nMight be different on another difficulty, but seeing how there are only 4 different "planets" (3 different planets and a ship), i wouldnt expect much difference.\n\nStory:\nThe story is very, very short. Not many characters, even less character development. and weird cameos: Yoda and Boba Fett and they didnt do much.\n\nif you are just in it for the story, you may just want to read the book/comic. it will be more fufilling.\n\n\nI will recommend it, if you've played all the other star wars games and this is the last one on your list.

Its great with a controller, which is where one of my issues arises. I do not know if it is my controllers fault (doubt it, its the newest logitech one and i rarely used it before this game) but during the mission where you are on kamino jumping from platforms onto cloning tables, the sprint and jump buttons start glitching out. They also do on the ketboard. How conveneint. The way you fight is really cool, and on easy i have never died or gone below 70 percent health. That could be its too easy or that i have played this on multiple other platforms, so its cool to see the game on ps3, wii, ds. and pc. But this game lacks original map play. Every damn missions is the same ♥♥♥♥. jumping constantly, opening doors, and sprinting around. It feels like they made a small section of something, then cloned it a thousand times with a little bit of random and then theres your map. some levels are meant to make you super mad and i ended up removing the game because of it. Jumping on moving platforms while the controls glitch out for 30 minutes is boring as hell. Also the combat is way too easy. If you force lift a container and throw it ANYWHERE it automatically hits an enemy making the game super easy. Also you would think with 2 lightsabers you would cut enemies up realy fast. Nope. Just like assassins creed you are wacking and slashing for 20 seconds before someone dies. The game that adds realistic combat will be the game that wins all the cards. Its a fun game, for sure not worth 20 bucks. I got it along with many other in a humble bundle deal for 12 dollars which was a steal. If you like star wars youll like this.

The graphics are bad even compared to games such as oh i don't know Republic commando that came out almost 10 years ago. its badly modeled, the voice acting is passable but not overly entertaining  or important to the story (i use the term story very loosely). The game is basically kill this room of enemy's fight a big enemy have a quick time event  rinse and repeat a few times  then fight a boss that is almost exactly the same as the new enemy of the level only bigger with a new weakness. there are 9 levels well that's a lie there are 5 levels but they split them up into 9 parts, why i don't really know as i didn't realize until i finished that id played 9 BLOODY LEVELS its short even for a short game. but that's possibly a good thing as it would be unbearably dull if it was any longer.\n\nnow for the goodish parts, its OK for a bundle game and It has boba fett in it for all of about 5 minutes of cut scene.\nAll in all its awful so awful in fact that i would rather buy the disc break it into lots of little bits and snort them as at least then it would cause me a short death compared to the laboriousness hell that this game has put me through so unless you like quick time events and a dull unengaged story then go ahead otherwise RUN FOR THE HILLS","May 6, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ildrin/recommended/32500/","ildrin","Ildrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ildrin/","220 products in account","To oversimplify it, the first one is better.\nGenerally I look at games in terms of Gameplay, plot, systems/stability ('under the hood' judged from outside) and graphics. Usually we like sequels to improve on most of these, but to get only one out of four is slightly disappointing.\n\n\nGraphically: obvious improvements over the first one, pretty good. Generally consistent aesthetic to what I'd expect from Star Wars too. Not many really obvious graphical bugs or anything, a few things fade out of existence from now and then, but that's probably a functional thing so they don't fill your memory with pieces of broken box.\n\nStability-wise, it's a step down from the original. I completed that twice with two crashes (which I think only happened because I was alt-tabbing about). This seems to be crashing every 60-90 minutes on average. Not sure why, sometimes it's in heavy combat, and sometimes it happens when I was lurking at a checkpoint eating a bag of crisps and the game wasn't really doing anything.\nMy computer is definitely powerful enough to handle it. Maybe the backwards/forwards compatibility is causing problems.\nBut aside from occasionally crashing, the game seems fairly well built, technically at least. I've yet to run into any notable bugs.\n\nGameplay: the biggest disappointment.\nI’ll preface this by saying I’m not very good at this kind of game, I prefer a nice FPS where I can lurk in the distance and shoot people in the head, or an RTS where I can turtle away in some forgotten corner of the map. That said the gameplay was at times boringly easy on its ‘normal’ difficulty, at worst it tended to be awkward.\n\nThe cut scenes are long and there's just a massive amount of time spent in quick time events. Would calling then ‘slow time events’ be childish? It generally feels like they wanted to make an animated film, but couldn't, so they let you press buttons from time to time and call it a game.\nOkay, that's an exaggeration, but it annoys me a bit.\nFor example, one of the iconic bits of the first game is when you pull a star destroyer out the sky, you do this by force gripping it, and pulling it down. (You also have to make it face you, for no apparent reason, other than to make it hit you in the face when it lands, but drama.) In a similar sequence in this game you just sort of watch, and when it tells you to, you press a button a few times.\n\nRepetition is a bit problem, near the start fighting some giant rancor-eating monster you have to repeat identical game sections several times. While you're doing this, there's someone constantly shouting at you, telling you to do something, you've already sone once. And they complain you haven't done it yet multiple times before the sequence can repeat.\n\nI think in this game someone says something like 'A single Jedi can turn the tide of a war', and in the first one I could more or less believe that. In this game it's just odd. I guess it's technically true, given the number of enemies that perfectly resist any attempt to damage them, with anything but one specific power, so you'd need a jedi. But it's sometimes odd. Some enemies need to be hit with a radial force push, a normal straight one doesn't work, but a radial one staggers or outright kills them. Perhaps they are actually invincible, but terrified of circles?\n\nThen there's a massive number of force powered people, Sith acolytes or something, that will block your force powers. Some of them have lightsabers and block most melee attacks, so you have to grapple them; annoying I guess, but made more so by the fact there only seems to be one grapple animation. It’s slow, and very specific, and when you’re facing a few of them at the same time it’s incredibly tedious watching the same animation again and again. The only way I’ve found to make it fun is to try and line up the grapples so they fall off things when the animation completes. (You can briefly use powers on them while they’re standing up too.)\n\nThen there are the robots. Lots of identical robots, that must be killed in more or less the same way every time. Repetitive and irritating. The only difference I’ve found is which exact buttons is used in the lasts stage of the quick time event. Another animation would make this better, but whatever…\n\nThe game also seems to forget what sensible people like; random sections turn into platformers where you have to climb things or traverse spaces with a mediocre advanced movement system. Fortunately for most of these, when you inevitably fall off they send you back to the start rather than killing you, which could be worse. But, for example, on Kamino there are airborne robots that are levitating, as they do. But they’re all staying perfectly still for no apparent reason, sitting in just the right place to let you cross places that the people controlling them shouldn’t be wanting you to cross.\n\nPlot: (small rant here, sorry) It's a bit odd to be honest. Largely the apparent motivations of Starkiller. For a  large part of the game he seems to have turned into a whiney idiot, totally obsessed with a girl he barely knows, jeopardising the rebel alliance, his own life etc. for no logical reason. Which isn't inherently, I understand love is a strong motivator for people, leading to irrational behaviour, except the barely know each other. After a few mildly suggestive conversations in the first game, and a kiss he's infatuated?\nThat irritation aside, the rest of the plot is weak. Interesting enough to keep me playing, but just barely.\n\nSummary:\nWorse than the first.\nGameplay is kind of fun, tearing apart little people, but there are lots of irrationally awkward big things.\nIt likes to crash, for me at least. I’ve yet to figure out why.\nIt's kinda pretty though.","December 20, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is shorter, but more fun to play and not as frustrating as the original. Better job has also been done in porting, but still leaves a lot to be desired. It tries to follow the mediocre story of the original, and again fails to make much sense.\nOverall I liked the action packed ride and feel it is not inferior to the original as both games offer something unique.\n\nTL;DR: Jedi Knight meets God of War.\n\nTIPS:\n- Apply 60fps fix\n- Play with gamepad\n- Disconnect gamepad before pre-rendered videos if they hang. (You can also skip them after hang, and re-watch them later)","December 17, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whilst fun in parts, everything about this screams "making a sequel for the sake of cashing in on the success of the first".  The first Force Unleashed game is highly recommended in my eyes.  It had a good story, fitting within the cannon.  But this, whilst starting promising, with the whole storyline around cloning which fits well in the Star Wars universe, then fails to go anywhere, and they somehow manage to make the entirety of the game about Starkiller (if you are indeed the original one, and not a clone, though this is never cleared up) hunting down his love Juno, the pilot from the first game.  Oh, and of course foiling Vader in the process.  No real story arc or character development, with the only real other character in the game being general Kota from the first game.  Juno is the stereotypical damsel in distress, and there are a few of the iconic characters from the universe that are crowbarred in for the most unnecessary cameos (including one of the bad guys which seems to imply we were going to face-off against them at some point, but they were promptly dropped and never mentioned again.  Possibly this is potential for another sequel?  Though maybe the developers got a bit of sense as they went along as when the game ends it doesn't really seem to point that way).\n\nOkay, so the story is rubbish, how is the gameplay?  Again, this starts by showing promise.  Combat seems fluid, intuitive, varied, challenging and fun, at first glance.  Then you realise you're up against the same array of enemies constantly, with the "tougher" ones being felled by tiresome quick-time events that you have to do nearly every single time and is indeed the quickest way to bring them down.  This gets tiring, especially later only, when you face increasing numbers of them.  I say "tougher" in quotes because as long as you know where the dash key is (there's no stamina, you can dash to your hearts content all day long) you can zip round the battlefield and tear the larger enemies apart with ease.  You're as likely to be felled by them as if you're blindsided by a paltry few troopers.  Speaking of which, if you're quick on the lighting key and pointing vaguely in their general direction you can fell entire legions of the troopers within mere seconds.  And once you've figured out the other enemies weaknesses they go down just as quick.  Unfortunately, you level up to the point you're an absolute killing machine very quickly, so much so that it makes being a badass seem boring.  And as far as I could tell they only introduced 1 new move which was used in the tutorial and then I barely used it again ever.  Basically force lightning and the occasional force repulse is all you need.  Playing on hard was not a challenge and you can breeze through this game in merely half a dozen hours.  This is shockingly brief, even with the ridiculously overlong and padded end boss sequence which wasn't difficult in the slightest, and I wouldn't be an expert, reflexes-wired-to-the-max kinda player by any stretch of the imagination.  To top off the slog, near the end of the battle, a new element is added to the fray without warning which can kill you if you aren't quick and then you have to go back to very near the start of their health bar again!  Such lazy game design by adding a few zeros to a bosses health.  Basically every other boss during the game was more fun than this, even the annoying mechanical spider.  I chose the "good" ending at the end and honestly I've never regretted it so much in my life as it was so hideously saccharine and unexplainable.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, cheap cashin, which ticks just enough boxes for it to be deemed sellable.  Avoid.","August 24, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the first Star Wars the Force Unleashed the combat has massively improved. Starkiller is not only wielding two lightsabers but his powers have majorly increased. For me this was a really good thing, beacause I always wanted to see what starkiller is cable off, and in this game you experience the force at its maximum. Another thing I liked was the upgraded graphics. For its time, SWTFU 2 looked amazing and it still does on PC. Finally, the gameplay was also updated with loads of new moves and a very impressive engine. Nevertheless, SWTFU 2 suffers from a lot of problems. Let's start with the story. The story from the first game was interesting, quite comlicated and offered us a lot of lore. In this game however, the story lacks charater, polish, and doesn't make sense at some moments. This is a big flaw for me, as I enjoy Star Wars games for their story, and SWTFU 2 fails to deliver this at a passable level. Then there is the lenght. I completed the Campaign in a mere 5 hours. 5 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS. For 29,99 I expected more than pretty graphics and a few costumes. Another HUGE flaw was the easy as balls and forgetable boss battle with, you guessed it, Dark Pops. Overal does this game not what a sequel should do. The campaign is shorter, the story is duller and hard to follow and the price is too high. Lucasarts did a lot of work on the outside (graphics, moveset and engine) that they completly forgot the ambiance, the vibe and the overal experience. A Star Wars game should give the player a memorable experiece instead of a shiny, polygon physics demo. That's why I recommend that you play the first one, buy the ultimate sith edition, and let this one pass.\n\nStar Wars The Force Unleashed II Gets a 5,1 out of 10","July 14, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the one hand this game makes really fun, on the other hand you always got to think how much better it could have been with a bit more time and money for the producers.\n\nThe greatest strength of the game is its gameplay. Cutting of body parts of the storm troopers and use the force to let them fly through the air let you feel like a true bad ♥♥♥ and a powerful Jedi. The Force abilities are nearly the same as in the first game, which is fine, because they were great, but this time starkiller got 2 lightsabers instead of one. There are several types of enemies and boss fights, which all need a little bit different approach.\n\nThe Story of the game is ok, but not nearly as good as the great story of the first game. You play as starkiller or one of his clones (This not truly revealed in the game, but I personally believe the evidence pro the clone theory is stronger) and need to escape from the empire and reconnect with your friends from the rebellion. The greatest weakness of the game is the length of the story. You can easily beat this game in around 4 to 5 hours. There are only 4 real missions and a ridiculously short dogobah trip, which only consists of one 5 minutes long cut-scene with master Yoda. This is really sad, because I think with 2 or 3 more missions this game would have felt much more completed.\n\nAt least there are 4 different difficulty settings und 2 possible endings, which gives you a bit of replay value and outside of the campaign there is a shortly entertaining challenge mode. In the Playstation and X-BOX Version there is also a DLC-Level on Endor, which is quite enjoyable as well.\n\nThe Music of the game is really great. Some of the most typical parts of the soundtrack of the classic star wars trilogy are part of this game and feel really fitting in every scene.\n\nPro: -Gameplay is really entertaining\n- True Star Wars atmosphere\n- Great Sound\nContra: - Length of the game\n- Story is not as good as in the first game\n\nResult: At the end I am in the strange position, that I can neither recommend nor disapprove this game. When I think about FU2 I always feel a bit sad, but when I play it (Beat it now 3 or 4 times), I truly enjoy this game every time despite its flaws and have a great time with it.\n\n6/10\n","March 9","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would still recommend to anyone if on sale, especially if you haven't played the first - combat is great and other saber-wielding force user enemies keep it interesting - there's a fair variety of enemies & powers. A little repetitive, with some of the bossfights being laughable, however the bulk of the game, due to the short length, didn't lose its appeal so much & I had fun with it up to the Vader fight at the end, in contrast to the 1st game, which I found outstayed its welcome somewhat. Not very replayable though, and skins are limited compared to the first game. Does have Boba Fett though.\n\nThe Dagobah level also turned out to be nothing more than walking towards the cave & picking up holocrons. It's still pretty visually stunning though, even if levels are more functional than organic. Cutscenes are also well made. The game is neither particularly polished nor too glitchy, but everything that should work does so pretty smoothly.\n\nQTEs are simple and perhaps overused but do change button sequences, which is nice. I have great respect for Sam Witwer, the face & voice of Starkiller, however Starkiller's voice can be annoying and rather whiny. Nevertheless, performances are far from lacklustre. Sound design is great overall  - sabers are well done, and deflection of blaster bolts is oh so satisfying. There's little story here & while Starkiller's return as a clone is completely uncalled for, it's not unwelcome.\n\nApologies for longwindedness & lack of structure. The game has its flaws, but for a low price it's definitely worth a play. (I found it worked best for me with my Xbox 360 controller - precision from the mouse is not needed here)\n\n7/10","May 4, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is approximately 4 hours long so don't go into it expecting much. They've also cut all the stuff that made the first game super fun: alternate costumes, jedi boss fights, etc. However, if you're a huge Star Wars fan and loved the first game, just pick it up if it goes on sale and finish it just to say you did so. It feels more like a long expansion pack than a $20 game so spend at your own discretion. Have not seen the dark side ending to this one, but the light side was okay, won't spoil it but it didn't make a whole lot of sense so you'll need to use your imagination with that. Again, the game overall is decent and its still the same old Force Unleashed combat and gameplay, just with force powers that feel a bit more powerful and a little less content, but fun if you're a fan of the series looking for something different from the traditional AAA titles.","October 3, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But when you look at the story, thank God, because I wouldn't of had lasted longer listening to Starkiller's whining.

The entire game is a repetitive slog, especially the combat. If they had cut out the filler, the game would've been a fun 30 minutes. It has its spectacular moments, but they are few and far between and don't make up for the repetitive and boring gameplay. It's not just repetitive, though, it's also clunky and buggy. I had several times where I failed jumps and lost several minutes of progress because of the strange movement engine - I would jump and they would perform the jump animation but not leave the ground, then I would fall to my death. I also had cutscenes just straight up freeze on me several times. The worst case was the cutscene that plays when you finish the game. It just froze. I had to watch the ending on youtube. Combat is made even worse with the inclusion of quick time event kills. The same canned animations play over and over again when you finish off some of the tougher robot enemies. It's cool the first time only.\n\nWant an actually fun action game / brawler? Try Bayonetta, God of War, Dante's Inferno, or any of the many other games where they actually thought about the gameplay and fun and the experience of playing instead of just trying to make it a spectacle and cash in on the star wars IP. Want a good star wars game? Try republic commando (or, if you don't dislike RPGs, KOTOR and KOTOR 2).\n\nDon't buy this game, and if you do play it for some unfortunate reason, play it on easy. The difficulty scaling is stupid and doesn't make the game more interesting, it just makes it more frustrating and tiresome.","October 11, 2015","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a while to remember I'd even played Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, never mind finished it. And that really sums up the game.\n\nCompared to the original Force Unleashed, it's more fun to play, slicker, and has far fewer moments that pretend to be challenging but are actually just annoying (no Purge Troopers here!). But it's also more forgettable, shorter (and yet still repetitive), less rewarding to replay, and the story somehow manages to be tedious despite the short length of the game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this even if you liked The Force Unleashed. I did, for all its flaws. This sequel does get rid of some of those flaws, but what remains is a scant few hours of disposable and unnecessary cruft. If you need to buy every Star Wars game that exists, then maybe consider this a low priority.

The graphics are bad even compared to games such as oh i don't know Republic commando that came out almost 10 years ago. its badly modeled, the voice acting is passable but not overly entertaining  or important to the story (i use the term story very loosely). The game is basically kill this room of enemy's fight a big enemy have a quick time event  rinse and repeat a few times  then fight a boss that is almost exactly the same as the new enemy of the level only bigger with a new weakness. there are 9 levels well that's a lie there are 5 levels but they split them up into 9 parts, why i don't really know as i didn't realize until i finished that id played 9 BLOODY LEVELS its short even for a short game. but that's possibly a good thing as it would be unbearably dull if it was any longer.\n\nnow for the goodish parts, its OK for a bundle game and It has boba fett in it for all of about 5 minutes of cut scene.\nAll in all its awful so awful in fact that i would rather buy the disc break it into lots of little bits and snort them as at least then it would cause me a short death compared to the laboriousness hell that this game has put me through so unless you like quick time events and a dull unengaged story then go ahead otherwise RUN FOR THE HILLS","May 6, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

QTE moments do their job, but there are so many of them it starts to feel pretty horrible.\n\nThere's really not much to say about it. It tries to have a plot, develop characters and elicit emotions.
