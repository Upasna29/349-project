This in addition to the general problem of online games being invisible to the player or knowing how many people are online playing at a given time - thus giving the impression of a dead multiplayer experience. Hell you can't even vote to restart a multiplayer match in-game that you might have drawn no lands in.\n\nConfusing, overpriced DLC that often ends with people not knowing what they have bought, have already, or should have and thus ends with a multitude of complaint threads on these forums.\n\nSlow UI, slow load/boot up, problems with card selection/assignments, & genreal bugs that seem to never be fixed year to year as one game is thrown out for the next.\n\nThis game has now 4 editions 2011,2012,2013,2014. The consistency between all versions seems to be a lack of attentiveness to increasing value to the basic player experience through debugging and improved multiplayer funcionality while adding as many ways to fleece the player of their money.\n\nThis combination of problems diminishes intrest year over year and will eventually lead to a product few want because those potentially interested have already had some form of irritation or negative experience with a past iteration of it.\n\nThe future is dim for a product that adds little - if any - value, year to year, while holding fast to the mountain of mistakes in its past.\n\nBuyer beware.","May 1, 2014","false","25.5"," 139 of 184 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","139","184","2","0"

I chose to unlock the cards through winning games since I don't want to pay for something i can get for free whilst playing a game I enjoy. I would recommend this game since the game is only around £15 if you purchase the DLC which gives you more decks and it's a load of fun, especially the multiplayer.","July 1, 2014","true","229.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Lonely? Vastly overweight? Covered in zits and random patches of facial hair? Do you have no-one to share your extensive knowledge of Star Trek weaponry with? Have you ever found a dry roasted peanut under your many armpit folds...4 days after eating said bag of peanuts, then gone ahead and eaten it anyway? Do you spend your days wondering what the touch of a woman would feel like? Are you thinking about ending it all? Well none of that will matter when you buy 'Magic: The Geekening'! Available for a sniff of the price of most individual cards online. It's like The Lord of the Rings had sex with a game of Poker, and then genetically mutated it so that the computer knows EXACTLY what card to play to end you. This game teleports you to 2013 where you can play against the same people as you did in 2012, and some others who I've never heard of. Time travel is the 'Magic' aspect of it. Not much changes between now and 2013, apart from the revelation that Kim Jong Il isn't dead. He's actually the Gangnam Style man, after extensive facial roundening surgery. One great thing about this game is that you only need to use the mouse, freeing up the other hand for you to interfere with yourself while watching Shemale Schoolgirl Tentacle Hentai on your duel monitor set-up, and arguing online about who is better, Captain Kirk or Professor X. Before, you had to leave the house to play this game with other like minded freaks. Now, you don't even need to get out of bed. That's 98.6% less wheezing and movement required. If that isn't worth the price of admission, then I'm a sexual predator (I'm not, by the way. I prefer the term, 'Enthusiast').","December 12, 2012","true","27.0"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","61","31","51","44","2"

Here, you get a number of decks to play with, several modes and styles of play including multiplayer.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nYou won't find cards from the early era of magic you may recall from ages past. Alpha, beta, The Dark, Arabian Nights? Unlimited, & 3rd edtion? Not here. What you will find are a selection of decks from moderan 2013 era magic. What matters however is that you are given numerous ways to play the game and a number of various decks to mess around with.\n\nYou can buy this with a number of unlocks set, or with all cards unlocked. The locked variant might be for you if you enjoy the challenge of unlocking cards and the related achievement pleasure that can be had from unlocking. If you just want to play with cards, as many as you can get your mits on (without grinding) - you may want the 'Complete' edition.\n\nAt worst, in this release you can't build decks from an entirely raw ensemble of cards. You can however heavily modify the numerous decks that you are given. Most of these decks have anywhere from 30 to 40 specific deck limited extra cards that can be added or used to replace default deck setups to modify your style of play. Despite these official limitations of the 2013 M:tG game, there is actually something of a modding scene. Google for mods and you may just stumble into what you want if you really want to build decks from scratch / have minor game play bugs fixed.\n\nA very minor user specific issue that can be disabled: Foil cards. IRL they're entertaining and in the game you can have them too. Yet they're animated and constantly glimmer. The constant animation can become a little irritating, turning a novelty special card into a literal headache. Fortunately, - the game has an option to remove the appearance of foil on all foil cards.\n\nSo, all in all this is a solidly entertaining version of Magic to mess around with on a computer. Be it offline multiplayer locally, online multiplayer, or in single player vs. AI's of varying difficulties.","August 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The main problem with this game is that the save function is glitched and only saves the previous match but not the one that you just finished, and the company behind the game doesn't give a damn. This game is well made, but at its core, it is still a cash-in by Wizards of the Coast. Buy this game if you have friends to play with, or if you just really enjoy Magic enough that you don't mind your game not always saving.

If you dislike luck factor in your games this is a definite no-no for you. There are many overpowered and many weak decks. You can't build a completely custom deck. If you want that www.mtgonline.com is what you are looking for. However you can customize the premade built-in decks by adding and removing unlockable cards from them. There are many bugs, exploits etc. in this game and they are never going to be fixed. The developers are horrible. They only care about making money as making a proper game then fixing & updating it with new content is much more difficult than releasing basically the same game every year. You don't want to play DotP with strangers all the time. There are cheaters, the folks who never get bored playing the same overpowered decks forever, people who leave if they don't get the perfect opening hand they want etc. Easy to make friends in this and people who play this game are generally real nice and interesting. You don't miss much by not playing but I still recommend this game anyway. I have to warn you though, when the new version will be released this summer, the multiplayer of 2013 will die and the multiplayer is everything this game is about.

While 2013 has less decks available (16 versus last year's 19), they are overall more accessible for quick play because of the 10 promo unlocks provided post-release. The decks are also more balanced in power overall because you aren't locked out of the best cards anymore. However, this is a double-edged sword; While you can unlock a total of 40 cards per deck, many of them are dups and you can only unlock one at a time. To put this into perspective, beating the first campaign (the longest in the game) will unlock 26 cards.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the difficult challenges (the hardest challenges of the DotP games in my opinion), this game is riddled with issues that will never get fixed or improved since the devs have moved onto their next yearly release. Locking out all but two decks at the start is a terrible way to introduce new players to MTG, especially considering the target market for these games. The one new game mode, Planechase, is only worth playing with friends; The AI is terrible at it, seeming to attack and roll the planar die randomly. Despite being marketed towards new and casual players, this game can only be recommended for experienced MTG players because of the unlock systems and frustration with non-human Planechase.","August 22, 2013","false","26.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The cards are new, some abilities are new but all are easily understood.  It's a great nostalgia game for me sans the hassle of having to obtain the physical cards.  Not being able to create your own deck is a bit of a let-down but most - if not all - of the pre-made decks are full of potential and quite capable of defeating any opposing deck in its own way.  The challenges are also excellent thinkers and a bit more difficult than in the previous game.  The new Planes Chase mode is interesting - it is akin to playing Magic in the spaceship, Heart of Gold, while the Infinite Improbability Drive keeps kicking in and chaning the rules every turn.

While I appreciate all the new cards that were added, the experience as a whole felt less interesting than Magic 2012\n\nFortunately I was able to unlock cards this time around. Given the sheer number of decks, they really should have awarded at least two cards per battle. 30 battles per deck is just a horrible time sink, especially when it's not as fun as it used to be. I'm also starting to wish they had an option to turn off ALL animations. If I'm going to be grinding a long-♥♥♥ game, I don't want to see every card taking 5-10 seconds to play.\n\nSadly Archenemy mode is gone, and 2-headed giant only exists in custom games. I actually found both of those fun. In its place is Planechase mode which... *shudder*. Every round you wait for 3 CPUs to take their turns and they spin that atrocious dice over and over again. It's just... kill me now. Every time.\n\nTo the game's credit, decks felt more balanced overall. There's some strategy involved where some decks fare much better versus others, instead of a one-size-fits-all deck, but I kind of miss the feeling of overpoweredness from the previous game. The puzzles are still fun too.\n\nOverall it's a distinctly inferior game compared to 2012. On its own, only average. I'll rate it 6/10.

You start with a fully unlocked Garruk deck and then unlock additional decks and cards as you play.  The first campaign is deceptively easy... the revenge campaign requires some deck building skill to beat.  Beyond that there are the usual challenges and the new "planechase" mode which requires that you constantly shift your strategy.  Overall this is a fantastic upgrade... the new decks have some very interesting cards, and as usual I love the artwork sprinkled throughout the game.

The plot becomes very strange as you begin to summon monsters rather than kill them. Additionally it seems the game isnt very well balanced, with some portions being completely random while others are incredibly difficult and frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty Geralt has no simple sword attack, so youre completely reliant on dumb animals. Additionally it seems all of the exploration is created by you. To make matters worse theres no RPG elements in this and certainly none of the promised sex scenes. I bought this game for two reasons: to fight monsters with a big sword and to masturbate to pixels.

Magic DotP 2013 offers some much needed multiplayer variety.  Two headed giant, Planechase, and just playin multiplayer with up to 4 players add a new twist of fun.  Still lacking a full deck editor, there is a wide variety of preconstructed decks available and you can customize up to 30 cards in each of them as you win games and unlock new cards.  For a small fee, you can unlock entire decks to speed up the process.\n\nThe biggest downfall is the computer AI in single player.  Set teh difficulty too low and the computer plays like a complete newb.  Misplaying and skipping obvious combos.  Set the difficulty higher and the AI alwasy gets taht one card they need to stop whatever combo you are trying to pull off.  It's a little more than luck when the AI gets the exact card it needs out of its 60 card deck to counter the exact combo you are trying to pull off every time.\n\nOnly stomach the single player to unlock things that you want, if you don't want to spend the $1 to unlock a whole deck faster.  Stick to the multi-player if you want to have any real fun with this game.  The decks are nothing spectacular, but against each other they are fun enough to enjoy a good game.  The interface was designed for console games and is a little clunky at times, but manageable.  It can be a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with, and is an excellent tool for showing new players the basics.","January 6, 2013","true","114.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2nd was an absolute total bomb that was little more than a few cards added to the decks of the 1st release and rearanged past the point of being broken till there are basically 3 or 4 OP decks. Those decks (in the 2nd release) are so powerful that its useless using the rest of the decks in the game - thereby making the 2nd release 80% useless. I actually came BACK to this game and enjoy playing it much more. The only thing they got really good in the 2nd release that makes this one a bit annoying is that you can choose how many land cards in your hand. If you can grit your teeth a bit and get past that fact, then this game is 98% playable and fun. Don't waste your money on the second.

My step father knows nothing about Magic but knows I have an interest and tried to play it on his own and he got a handle on it very quickly because you have the options as you play to see what each thing means.

Pleasant graphics, local and online multiplayer makes this game make this game a must-have for a MTG fan or even someone new to the series. The only thing that bothered me at first is that you can't make a new deck from scratch, you just choose a pre-made one, which, once unlocked can have up to 90 cards, but you can customize those, choosing which leaving and which taking with you. So overall, the customization is not perfect, but it's there and it is enjoyable, I guess they didn't want this to beat MTG online which is full of micro transactions for the cards you specifically want.\nBut which one to buy? This is quite important :\nI recommend the gold version because the base version doesn't have all decks you are supposed to have and doesn't have the expansion campaign. While the complete version, which costs a lot, just breaks the game for me, because it unlocks every deck and cards, while the gold version, you have everything in-game, but you unlock cards and decks beating bosses, players and encounters (which is a lot more enjoyable if you ask me).\nIt is both fun to beat friends or bots in the campaign, or even co-op with your friend to take down some strong decks controlled by bots.

The campaign is fun for the first 30 minutes, then it goes steadily down hill with no light ahead. The final boss, Nicol Bolas, uses a completely over powered deck compared to the ones given. After playing 20+ times with various decks I still havent beat him and its not because of my skill but because of the ♥♥♥♥ poor cards provided in the player decks. After beating all campaign matches other than the last I was only able to unlock cards for the basic beginer green deck. This allows no customization of the other decks seen in the game. Also, when playing online, I have seen attack phases and 2nd main phases completely skipped for players,. this is a glitch & should not happen. So there is nothing good to say about this game other than that it tries to imitate mtg the card game, which is a wonderful game. Being a true mtg fan I'm grealtly disappointed by this game..\n\nGame Grade: F- (Took a great card game & turned it into dry, unfair and irritating experience)","January 24, 2014","false","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also encounters such as fighting the hydra. Each encounter has a different touch to them, such as the hydra it gains attack/health for each turn.\nWhen you have beaten the game you unlock the revenge campaign that upper the difficulty if you found the first campaign too easy.\nThere is also a challenge mod (that actually is challenging!) where you are presented by different scenarios and have to win the game within a set number of rounds.\n\nThere are a few modes to play such as Two headed giant that is basically 2vs2. A classic free for all mode. Last a mode called plane chase that have a extra set of cards where these cards may turn the whole situation upside down by giving all creatures to given player flying or extra creatures.\n\nOh, and you don’t need to buy card packs in this game as you will unlock cards as you play.

Same old in new dressing.\n\nThere are some variety on decks, so gameplay isn't as predictable as on MtG 2012. This also means you have to pick&customize decks which are able to beat opponent (on 2012 it was very possible to play whole campaign game with only one deck).\n\nThis is welcome gameplay adjustment against human players, but when playing against Planeswalker AI (which knows players' hand and library) to unlock decks there will be some frustating moments as without unlocks you don't have any kind of edge against AI.\n\nSome decks have been beefed up considerably (e.g. Garruk), other my old favorites are barely playable (Jace, Lillian). One of funniest 2012 modes on single player, Archenemy, is replaced by boring Planechase lottery mode.\n\nGame has still same interface bugs as MtG 2012 (and earlier MtGs). So you're sometimes practically screwed by game as you can't do certain actions. This is especially bad when playing MP games.\n\nRecommending 2012 for new players.","June 2, 2013","true","164.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Duelling is accomplished by buying endless amounts of cards and the winner is the one who can buy the most cards. Where the real Magic happens is in the surreptitious way the game 'Planeswalk' money out of your bank account leaving behind worthless cardboard like the calling cards (so to speak) of a serial killer murdering your net worth. It's a process so brazenly ruthless and brutally efficient it makes even the most avaricious of Investment Bankers blush with embarrassment. Even Blizzard is jealous. Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 is the computerised rendition of Magic for those who want to play cardboard Magic but can't afford a second mortgage or don't have kids they can sell on eBay.

Same fun game, same crappy engine with broken multiplayer that works fine for some people and fails to connect or arbitrarily locks up/desyncs for others in completely reproducible ways that they've never even acknowledged since the first game, much less fixed. It does work fine in single player for the most part though, and it allows for more deck customization than the previous two games did (being able to remove terrible cards from the base deck after you unlock better ones is nice). There is a decent variety of decks like usual, but not quite as much that really grabbed me in this one like the blue/white one in the first game or the blue/green one in the second, although five thumbs up for including a WUBRG deck that's even kind of playable. For whatever reason I got kind of tired of this one before finishing everything in it, unlike the first two where I did everything other than grinding to unlock every single card in every single deck. It doesn't help that it's extraordinarily poorly optimized and takes like two minutes just to load everything and get to the main menu (and 30 seconds just to get from clicking on it in Steam to showing ANYTHING on screen), and that's running it off an SSD on a rather fast desktop. I really wish their post-release budget for supporting these games (other than milking it through worthless DLC) were more than tree fiddy so any of this stuff would ever get fixed over the years.","January 10, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem is that whenever I unlock a card and then exit the game, the card is locked again when I come back to play later. I did some research and it seems to be a pretty common issue for some people that's been around since release with no known real solution - at least not that I could find.

The campaign is fun for the first 30 minutes, then it goes steadily down hill with no light ahead. The final boss, Nicol Bolas, uses a completely over powered deck compared to the ones given. After playing 20+ times with various decks I still havent beat him and its not because of my skill but because of the ♥♥♥♥ poor cards provided in the player decks. After beating all campaign matches other than the last I was only able to unlock cards for the basic beginer green deck. This allows no customization of the other decks seen in the game. Also, when playing online, I have seen attack phases and 2nd main phases completely skipped for players,. this is a glitch & should not happen. So there is nothing good to say about this game other than that it tries to imitate mtg the card game, which is a wonderful game.

There are also encounters such as fighting the hydra. Each encounter has a different touch to them, such as the hydra it gains attack/health for each turn.\nWhen you have beaten the game you unlock the revenge campaign that upper the difficulty if you found the first campaign too easy.\nThere is also a challenge mod (that actually is challenging!) where you are presented by different scenarios and have to win the game within a set number of rounds.\n\nThere are a few modes to play such as Two headed giant that is basically 2vs2.

If you don't know about the game I would wait until a sale or I wouldn't buy it, the game will teach you how to play but if you don't know if you will like it what's the point. I do play the card game a lot and I can only review the game on it's hardest difficulty. I'm going to split the review into different portions\n\nCampaign- The game has a single player campaign that's seperate from the custom matches, don't expect a super great plot but it's enjoyable. The campaign in my oppinion as an experienced player was to easy even on the hardest difficulty aside from a few challenges, at least until you face Nicol Bolas the final "Boss", although by using Jace's deck he is super easy. I did think it was fun though and will get you through if you feel like playing magic and nobody else you know does.\n\nDecks-The game features a bunch of decks unlocked through the campaign mode, for those new to the series you cannot create your own deck but by defeating oppenents with a deck you unlock specific cards that can be added or removed to that deck and only that deck. You also cannot modify lands, which is a huge bummer. Playing through the campaign I noticed the decks don't really seem to be balanced, the game is much easier using certain decks.\n\nMultiplayer- I can't say to much I don't play online to often, I hear there are a lot of cheaters but I can't say for certain that there are.\n\nCustom matches- Not only are there normal matches ranging from 2-4 players but the game has a planeschase option, it definitely adds a lot of fun to the game. Some frustation too.\n\nI reccomend this game to anyone who plays Magic, in all honesty I enjoyed this one more than Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013","March 2, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Duelling is accomplished by buying endless amounts of cards and the winner is the one who can buy the most cards. Where the real Magic happens is in the surreptitious way the game 'Planeswalk' money out of your bank account leaving behind worthless cardboard like the calling cards (so to speak) of a serial killer murdering your net worth. It's a process so brazenly ruthless and brutally efficient it makes even the most avaricious of Investment Bankers blush with embarrassment. Even Blizzard is jealous. Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 is the computerised rendition of Magic for those who want to play cardboard Magic but can't afford a second mortgage or don't have kids they can sell on eBay.

Interface, sound and music is a huge downgrade from the first Duels game. The decks here are less clever and original than in the previous game. Most of the story mode consists of 'encounters' which aren't fights against other Magic decks, but just an AI that casts the same spell infinitely until you find a way to beat it. This has nothing to do with the rules of Magic. The cinematics with the 'animated' comic book panels is beyond outdated for a 2013 game, and do not serve to 'actionize' the superfluous story. (Wizards, please. This is a card game, not a Marvel cartoon.)\n\nThere are some hours of entertainment in this title, but you might want to skip the cheesy cinematics and the great amount of forced tutorials and just get the first Duels, which is better and cheaper. The few things in 2013 that work, work a bit better in the 2012 Duels and much better in the 2009 Duels.\n\nIf you are playing to learn the rules of Magic, this title might be a tad easier to get in to, but once you're learning, you'll find the encounters boring and the real opponents too few. You might try your hand at playing online, and with luck the servers are faster and more stable than they were at release. Otherwise you're SOL.","January 31","false","146.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice variety and great card synergy.\n\n- A lot of different variety of decks to suit your playstyle.\n\n- Game plays swift and responsive (unlike the newest Magic Duels).\n\n- Plane Chase: This game mode is essentially is a regular 2, 3 or 4 player FFA which you battle across a variety of diverse worlds, each with its own unique effect on the game. This makes the game unpredictable as it can quickly turn the tables. This game is pretty fun but does not seem very balanced. For instance if you encounter the plane called Jund, you better prepare to get steamrolled very fast if you are a non-green, non-black, non-red colour player and your enemy is.\n\nCONS:\n- Virtually no one playing the game online. If you want to play against other players online, the 2014 and 2015 is still the best options. 2014 will mostly be Two-Headed Giants mode. 2015 lacks Two-Headed Giants mode but will have better chances of finding FFA games.\n\nBUG: Deck "Peacekeepers" does not seem to unlock cards properly. You can unlock the first 10 cards with a promo code. The rest will unlock as you win games but as soon as you exit the game, the unlocked cards will be lost. This is extremely annoying. Peacekeepers is probably the strongest deck in the game. I have tried several times to unlock them. Each time I exit the game, the game returns to 10/40 cards unlocked. I have not encounted the bug with any of the other decks yet.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDespite a VERY annoying bug in the game I would still recommend this game. I would say that the 2014 version is still the best Magic: DotP because it doesn't have major bugs like this. But 2013 version is still better than 2015 and MUCH better than the new free Magic Duels, which is an atrocity to be perfectly honest.\n\nIf you are new to Magic Duels of the Planeswalkers and have yet to decide wich version to try, I would recommend 2014 for the above reasons but especially if you want to play online. There are not exactly a lot of players playing it, but you can often find Two-Headed Giants games in 2014 version. This does not seem to be the case in this version.\n\nKeep in mind that this game is very rarely on sale. If you see it on sale you should buy it.","January 20","true","77.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Duels of the Planeswalkers is a digital version of the game that is mainly designed for people that are just getting into M:TG and its rules. The game is lacking some of the core features of its physical counterpart, but can be very addictive nonetheless. It's still the most complex game in the genre and it is being upgraded year after year. One of my dreams is to have a game like that, but with all the M:TG cards in it, a trading system, tournament action and everything else the non-digital version has. This would be just perfect.

So take from that what you want.

Decks in the game also have 40 unlockable cards, making great diversity even among similar decks possible as each deck can have multiple strategies present.\n\nIt still feels a bit like a bad console port, but it seems that bugs found in the game are being handled and fixed at a much better rate than the previous planeswalkers games.","July 13, 2012","true","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a mage who "casts" the cards and you have one or more opponents who play/cast cards of their own. Each player starts with 20 life and  you must lower the life of your opponents to 0 to kill them.\n\nI would recommend this game for fans of MGT and for people who don't have experience with the trading card game but I would advise you don't pay too much for this game. This game is well suited to teach you Magic: The Gathering's rules. There are a nice selection of decks to choose from and there  are some puzzles you can solve as well as a campaign. The graphics are very slick and smooth, the music is great and the sound effects are good too. I have some negatice criticism about the game too. You cannot create a deck from scratch. As such, if you wanted to play a custom deck and build it all from scratch, well here you can't. The campaign feels very short and be finished in just a few hours (on normal). The decks that you are provided with all begin with just a subset of the full deck. To get the cards that you are missing, you must win battles with that deck. Cards are unlocked one at a time and it feels extremely long to unlock all cards. So to resume, let's say it's a nice magic but very limited in terms of replayability. So my advice is: Buy this game if it's really cheap, say 5$. You'll then get enough entertainment from this game for your 5$. But otherwise, the game will quickly feel like it's missing some features that were deliberatly locked in order to include that content in Downloadable Content (DLC). I have not purchased a single DLC.","April 10","true","140.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It costs 10 euros but really it costs 19euros (which still isn't a lot) because it's hard not to buy the expansion and the six additionnal decks, all the more so as the expansion is included in the interface of the game and simply not available when not bought and as the ten decks of the normal version are only unicolored decks.\nAnyway, it's a real pleasure to play through the different modes available and to unlock the cards of the numerous decks (you shouldn't forget to go get the 10 bonus cards for the ten normal decks). Planeswalkers, 2vs2 or free-for-all modes are particularly nice. And again unlocking overpowered cards and trying to understand the numerous playstyle is quite enjoyable.\nI was annoyed by some details though, like the loading times which are long for a game of that type. It seems quite irrelevent at first but tend to get annoying really. The interface of the different menus is horrible. Going through the cards that compose your decks and adding some or removing some is a pain.\nThe sounds are ok, but some of them are a bit annoying and as you hear them constantly it can become very tiring.\n\nAnd last but not least, mana flood and mana starvation are intolerably frequent ! It's just as if your player didn't know how to shuffle his library. Of course, things shouldn't go perfectly each time, but truly, we are really near to "If you keep a hand with only one land, it means you're going to have a game with very few lands" and "if you accept a hand with five lands, well, you're going to draw a lot of lands just after that" I've lost too many games because of land starvation or flood and it is all the more annoying when your opponents never seem to encounter these problems.\nAlso very strangely, the game seems to always forget the last card you've unlocked before quitting which makes every first game you play useless from that point of view as it unlocks the last card you had unlocked the previous time you played. It's VERY annoying as winning 40 times with a deck to unlock all its cards is already A LOT.\n\nAnyway, I totally recommand the game. It's really enjoyable on the whole. I might even buy the 2012 edition or 2014 once I've unlocked all the cards of that one.\nI've read a lot of complains on "micropayments" ruining the game (the 2014) but I truly think 19 euros for the entire game and all the decks is totally fine in that case. And I also think that being able to buy everything little by little is nice. I don't have the feeling I'm in front of another Street Fighter IV.","November 13, 2015","true","356.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicnova/recommended/97330/","sonicnova","Sonic Nova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicnova/","63 products in account",""The AI cheats... really my main complaint."\n\nMagic: The Gathering can be a fun trading card game, but for the new guy it can be equally overwhelming. Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 can be a reasonable introduction for anyone with interest in Magic without breaking the bank or the rules. In this more "safe" environment you are taught how the game works at your own pace without the criticism of others. Beginner tips really help with understanding the different abilities and how the game plays out, when I started playing this was an invaluable aid.\n\nHowever, for the more mature Magic audience, this game does cheat, in the sense that AI opponents will always get what they need, and you never get what you need. I was frustrated when my 1 health enemy, running a green deck, pulled their last flyer kill spell when I, running a white deck, could have finished them off with another attack, I had over 40 HP and when it came my turn I drew a plains, the absolute last card I needed at that time, and was squashed the very next turn as she summoned an army of tokens and buffed them all in their final attack. Another gripe is that, no matter how much you press "continue" or the TAB key, you have to wait the annoying few seconds for a phase of a players turn to finish up.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it for someone starting out, it's cheap, it's helpful, and ultimately fairly harmless. The nice thing is that if you decide Magic isn't your thing, you haven't gone out and spent the hundreds of dollars it could take making even one good deck. Give it a shot at your own expense!","May 3","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each player starts with 20 life and  you must lower the life of your opponents to 0 to kill them.\n\nI would recommend this game for fans of MGT and for people who don't have experience with the trading card game but I would advise you don't pay too much for this game. This game is well suited to teach you Magic: The Gathering's rules. There are a nice selection of decks to choose from and there  are some puzzles you can solve as well as a campaign. The graphics are very slick and smooth, the music is great and the sound effects are good too. I have some negatice criticism about the game too. You cannot create a deck from scratch. As such, if you wanted to play a custom deck and build it all from scratch, well here you can't. The campaign feels very short and be finished in just a few hours (on normal). The decks that you are provided with all begin with just a subset of the full deck. To get the cards that you are missing, you must win battles with that deck. Cards are unlocked one at a time and it feels extremely long to unlock all cards. So to resume, let's say it's a nice magic but very limited in terms of replayability. So my advice is: Buy this game if it's really cheap, say 5$. You'll then get enough entertainment from this game for your 5$. But otherwise, the game will quickly feel like it's missing some features that were deliberatly locked in order to include that content in Downloadable Content (DLC). I have not purchased a single DLC.","April 10","true","140.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
