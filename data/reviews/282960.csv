Although it is  nowhere near finished I've enjoyed a few hours wandering around, exploring,  collecting and  killing  zombies etc. Sadly the developer has announced that the games  development team are dispersing and  that development will be put on hold.  The main developer has said  he will  probably work on it  slowly, but couldn't say  how long or whether the game would ever be completed. as its no longer  a priority; ill health and  financials have  something to do with his stand.   He has offered  refunds to all those who have purchased the game and are  not happy with this decision.\n\nI would have gladly given this a thumbs up, but, in view of the news about developments I can in all fairness only give it a  thumbs down.\n\n\n\nTo those that are still interested in the game (any survivalists will enjoy this)  and who don't   already have the game, you can no longer buy the game via Steam, but the developer has offered free keys to anyone who wishes to contribute to the games development by sending in bug reports.  Alan, the developer  does intend to continue  development albeit  in a much  slower manner.\n\n\nYou can read  what the developer has said HERE\n\nHere's an excerpt from an email the developer just sent to me:\n\n''development going forward is slow but when I do get the time between paying gigs I tend to get a lot done. There is an upcoming update that makes many improvements to the game , hopefully if my current client is happy with the work done this week and doesn't require any further work done I should be able to get it up over the weekend.''","March 31, 2015","false","13.5"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","0"

There are so many games out there that are half-made then abandoned when they get enough money, or it gets a little difficult, but this man showed a sense of respect for himself and everyone involved with this as well as a clear sense of right that I find truly inspiring. From what I understand even though he is no longer making money from this and he works on many other jobs he still finds the time to work on this promise he made so long ago. That is why I will always recommend this game and even though I have received a free CD key I will still purchase the game when he does feel it it complete enough to sell again, and why I have so much respect and admiration for the Honest and ethical man that is working on this game.\n\nThank you sir, thank you.","July 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","0"

There's a bit of distortion around the edges of the models (notably trees) and the characters move in awkward ways at times.\n\nThe inventory and crafting menus are...primitive and not terribly helpful. There's an unexplained "crotch" slot that I'm wierdly curious to see what eventually goes there. I'm guessing it's a belt but stranger things have happened in games.\n\nThere are no crafting recipes as of yet and while the basic process of playing the game is relatively familiar to people who've played survival games, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot to actually do yet. I do like survival games and the Arabian theme is new in terms of the survival genre.\n\nThe game does snarl the video drivers and crash rather regularly on my machine. This is not a point in its favor but I'll withold outright hate because I don't know if this is a problem exclusive to my rig or not.\n\nAtajrubah could be a really solid addition to the survival genre if it follows through on full release with the promise it's showing in the open beta and fixes some of the more glaring issues.\n\nA couple of things that *must* be fixed before launch:\n\n- Day/night cycles are somewhat erratic. Sometimes at night it's like someone just turned out the lights and there's no indicated way to make fire or light of any kind. I did respawn with a torch a couple of times but there was no indication of how to light it so I just stumbled around in the dark. The shadows also move incredibly fast as the sun moves across the sky, faster than your character can actually run. This isn't major but it is definitely disorienting and visually odd.\n\n- The game does not pause when you open the menu. This is a pretty serious problem for obvious reasons.\n\n- Items do not stack and that's a pretty crippling flaw when one arrow takes up one inventory slot. I'm willing to bet this will be fixed later on but for now it's not a pleasant bug.\n\n- The crashing does not add to the experience.","December 24, 2014","true","1.0"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","16","29","2","16"

The developers have open minds for player reccomendations, and i believe once the game becomes more stable through patches and updates, and multiplayer is released, this game wll be a true masterpiece.","January 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","11","31","3","0"
