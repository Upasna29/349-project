However, the later levels increase the difficulty curve far too much. The amount of patience you need to complete some of the later levels is so high that you would need to play the whole level on slow motion and just pray it all goes well.\n\nIt's more frustrating than it is fun. Definitely not one I would consider playing unless you have a lot of time to kill and the patience of a saint.","January 30, 2014","false","13.7"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","42","62","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/president_xaero/recommended/29180/","president_xaero","Xæro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/president_xaero/","258 products in account","The principle of this game is fairly easy: you start off as a small sphere shaped object (I call it the “cell”) and seek to be the largest object on the rectangular shaped map. The rules are simple: if you touch a cell smaller than you in dimensions, you consume the counterpart and grow larger. If you make contact with a larger object, you will be consumed. You can move only by discharging mass from within your cell in the opposite direction you wish to move along. The repulsive force will accelerate your movement. Of course this will make you shrink and be exposed to new threats. So you better not waste too much mass. You are given only one tool and that is the control over the pace of time.\n\nWhile the rules are readily comprehensible, the gameplay might be a challenge. There are modes where you are concerned with finding the most economic “route” of consumption from a logistical point of view. In another game mode you will find AI controlled opponents who try to grow large as well and eat you before you can eat them. Lastly, you will find a game mode where the organisms are organized like stellar systems – these maps ultimately require basic knowledge of orbital mechanics in order to be mastered.\n\nNo matter what game mode you choose, basic knowledge about mass, force, acceleration, velocity, momentum and gravity will come in handy. I wouldn’t say that this is strictly a physicist’s game though. I am sure the game is also fun for people who play it by intuition only, I would recommend it to any puzzle solving gamer. There are an infinite number of maps - each time you beat a map a harder one will be generated, what a perfect challenge!\n","May 22, 2014","true","34.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

They give you the opportunity to control a... well... cell. You need to find other cells that are smaller than you so that you can absorb them and grow bigger. This concept, of course, also means that you need to avoid bigger cells until you are big enough to absorb those, as well. If I remember correctly the criterion on each level is always to become quite big (not necessarily to absorb all the cells on the map).\n\nI like how you need to proper yourself ahead to gain momentum - in the process you are losing matter so you cannot really do this forever as you are gradually becoming smaller. Patience is a virtue!\n\nThere are several levels and all are part of 3 major zones - each require you to follow a different playstyle and some of the later levels can be pretty challenging.\n\nThe game has an excellent soundtrack full of ambient tracks. They accompany this unique gameplay perfectly. I believe Osmos is one of those indie games that is a must-have.","October 4, 2014","true","4.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

The puzzles require a high degree of patience and they reward forethought. This is not an easy game.

To propel yourself in a certain direction you must jettison pieces of your blob, which other blobs can absorb and grow in the same manner as you. In early stages the main challenge this brings is the decision of what is and isn't worth chasing- that blob might be bigger than you are by the time you get to it. Later levels add to the difficulty by requiring careful management of where your refuse travels and which order you absorb your foes in, lest you accidentally make another blob too large to ever absorb. Osmos doesn't last for too long, but it's a fun ride while it lasts.","December 28, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You're supposed to move carefully and are punished for changing directions, which isn't a very fun gameplay mechanic. In other words, you're playing this game at its best when you're only making small corrections to your movement instead of big changes, so you're forced to be patient. You can speed up time if you don't want to wait, but this can result in you missing stuff because you aren't observing your movement as carefully. It's an interesting idea but somehow it just isn't very enjoyable once you get to a certain level of difficulty. I found myself at that level within the first few stages. Instead of being motivated to try again, I just got frustrated and quit because each attempt involved lots of patient waiting and observation.

I'm not 100% sure if it's in space or in a microscopic environment) in order to eat the smaller ones so you can grow. Let's say I enjoyed this game for about 10 stages, then I kept going just because of the achievements. But it got harder and harder and even harder, until the point I was stuck for 3 hours on the same stage and it was wise to just rage quit. In the end, despite its qualities, it wasn't fun to play. Whoever tagged this as "Relaxing" definitely haven't played enough.\n\nPros:\nI think it's safe to say its physics aspects are spot-on: gravity, orbits, momentum, action and reaction etc.\nGraphics are beautiful in a simplistic, clean way\nThere's a great variety of levels--some rely more on skills and agility, others are more focused on puzzle and strategy\nBeing able to play procedurally generated versions of a level you're having trouble with is a great feature that might help you move on\nCons:\nThe speed flow was the most annoying thing to me. Some levels get waaaaay too slow, even on the fastest speed. It's even more irritating when you're retrying a level for the 213048th time.\nControls aren't as intuitive as one would hope--it gets better with practice, but it remains relatively weird\nThe BGM used could be nice in a different context, but when you're on a stage for 10 minutes, for the 213048th time, those interesting noises are just obnoxious (even though it's quality music).\nMoves way too fast from easy to insanely hard\nMade me actually dizzy and I caught myself biting my nails after many, many, many years--I'm serious! Osmos is anything but relaxing!\nBought on / for: Humble Mozilla Bundle by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.20 (R$ 0.50).

In that game you were a fish in the ocean and you had to eat smaller fish to get bigger so you could finally eat the bigger fish that were actively trying to eat you. It was a lot of fun, the game had a huge scenic map and a wide variety of fishes to see/consume.\n\nIn this game you're an orb in a tiny circle shaped map absorbing smaller orbs so you can absorb orbs that were bigger than you.  The other orbs simply bounce around aimlessly, completely doing away with that uncouth motivational aspect of kill or be killed.  If you think about it, Osmos is a lot more sinister than the previously mentioned game.  In Osmos there is no need to get stronger to live, you simply get strong so you can be the strongest.\n\nYet Osmos is a widely talked about game that some have called a "meditative experience".\n\nThis is why I have blind hatred of indie games.","March 15, 2012","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I did find some of the harder levels get a bit tedious, as I ended playing them over and over in order to solve them.\n\nIt is entirely mouse based, and it works well. You basically control where your propulsion goes, and attempt to absorb entities that are smaller than yourself. You can slow/speed up time as necesary with the mousewheel, which does a good job at preventing the game from being slow in places.\n\nThe graphics are very nice in this game, it does look like what I imagine to be deep water microscopic biology, but in some cases it looks like deep space objects. This is a good combination in the context of this game. Plus, the music in the levels matches well with the graphics.\n\nI couldn't find any bugs while playing this game, but I do feel that maybe a custom level editor would have made a nice addition.\n\nI would definitely reccomend this game if you like puzzles.","December 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It starts out so easy, so relaxing, it has the ambience sound effects and sound track, one just enjoys clicking through the first few levels.\n\nThen it gets a little more challenging and I thought, oh well there is actually some gameplay involved here. And finally the simple principle was taken to almost unfair difficulties. At first I just wanted to quickly get all the achievements, because I thought it would be easy. It took me a lot of time to really achieve all of them in the end.\n\nThe bottom line is: This is probably one of the most relaxing games you can play besides Higher (a flash game with rather similar music), but it actually has some potent game mechanic in it that will pose a challenge if you want to take it that far.\n\nThe visuals are very suitable and quite nice indeed, the soundtrack is absolutely fitting and plays a huge part in the atmosphere that the game creates. The basic principle is easy to learn and difficult to master, just how it should be.\nThis game can teach you patience.\n\nOn a side note: Awesome game for smartphones and I imagine perfect for tablets (I also played through it on my smarthone).","January 30, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was a really fun game with amazing soundtrack and decent puzzles. Then I forgot about it, until one day, I was browsing through HumbleBundle when I found it. I am glad I did too.\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward in terms of gameplay. You are in a world filled with things similar to bubbles (yay!) and your goal would be, to the most part, to absorb and grow in size until you are the biggest in the cluster. Sounds easy enough don't it? But heres the catch: You can only absorb things smaller than you. If you touch bigger bubbles, you will be absorbed and the game might end. Again sounds simple right? Think again. In order to move in the cluster, you have to eject some of you mass, and with newtons laws, you will be propelled in the opposite direction to that of the stream. Now keep in mind, the more you want to propel yourself, the more mass you lose. These all factors make it a really worthwhile challenge. You have to be as efficient as possible, and there may be close situations where one extra push might mean certain death! And there will be seemingly impossible levels, but they can be solved with a little bit of patience and a little bit of using the physics of the world.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, very pleasant. The game developer is in fact giving away the soundtrack for free! A quick google search can get you to the place you need.\n\nAll in all, this little game packs quite a bit punch. Would highly recommend if you are into physics related puzzles.","July 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just a few sections later, the pace speeds up and competing AI complicate everything, becoming notoriously difficult. I can understand challenges, but a lot of the frustration comes from awkwards controls and gameplay that punishes single mistakes. Later levels require speed to outpace the AI growth, and the relaxing style quickly disappears.\n\nI made a push to finish off the game, and there is the potential for unlimited levels. These Forever levels continue to ramp up in difficulty, and it really seems like the game is intended to be more challenging than relaxing. After finishing off the requirements, I've have my fill. The Ambient Impasse levels were the most enjoyable in the end, as they have no rushing elements. Strategy and planning is key in Impasse, instead of urgency and random luck.\n\nI'd recommend trying the demo and checking out videos. Gameplay is solid, but is probably a bit dated compared to the mobile market options. It's not as bad as I remember, but fails to shine or impress anymore. Definitely not worth $10 USD.","December 18, 2011","false","16.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

At first I was reminded a bit of Agar.io (minus being attacked by giant racial slurs), but Osmos really holds its own as a unique and totally awesome idea. The game play is simple: absorb smaller motes, navigate through gravity wells, become huge, and dominate.\n\nNow, the bad: the game is just too damn hard. Osmos starts you off just right with a slow intro to get you used to everything, and then exponentially accelerates the difficulty once the tutorials end. The controls are hard enough to master on their own, but when the level is also fighting against you: it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, plain and simple. I want to like this game - I really, really do - but I can't, because I'm too busy grinding my teeth every time I have to reset a level (and trust me, you'll be doing it a lot). I know a game without a sense of challenge isn't much of a game, but there's a point where it stops being fun and becomes a headache.\n\nI see a lot of downvotes on the negative reviews here, and I understand why. Osmos is gorgeous and it's easy to appreciate it as something fresh. That said, I simply refuse recommend this game on the grounds that it's unenjoyable because of the difficulty. I'd say your mileage may vary, but honestly, I don't expect it to.\n\nGrab it in a bundle or a sale if you want to give it a go, but be prepared to feel aggravated.","February 26","false","8.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Just a few sections later, the pace speeds up and competing AI complicate everything, becoming notoriously difficult. I can understand challenges, but a lot of the frustration comes from awkwards controls and gameplay that punishes single mistakes. Later levels require speed to outpace the AI growth, and the relaxing style quickly disappears.\n\nI made a push to finish off the game, and there is the potential for unlimited levels. These Forever levels continue to ramp up in difficulty, and it really seems like the game is intended to be more challenging than relaxing. After finishing off the requirements, I've have my fill. The Ambient Impasse levels were the most enjoyable in the end, as they have no rushing elements. Strategy and planning is key in Impasse, instead of urgency and random luck.\n\nI'd recommend trying the demo and checking out videos. Gameplay is solid, but is probably a bit dated compared to the mobile market options. It's not as bad as I remember, but fails to shine or impress anymore. Definitely not worth $10 USD.","December 18, 2011","false","16.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If Osmos was hailed as a challenge game, then I might change my recommendation to positive. But even then, the challenge is still largely based on what random mote layout you got at the start of the level. And the difficulty curve spikes massively after the beginning levels, especially depending on which of the three level paths you choose to do first.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to agar.io, but with more floatiness, so you have to plan out your moves more. It's decently fun, though it will take a bit of time to get used to the movement system. If you are looking for a good challenge, this might be worth a look. But don't expect a relaxing experience unless you have a rediculous amount of patience.","May 14","false","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The description even makes the laughable usage of the word "elegant" to describe its game play style. It couldn't be farther from the truth. The controls are clunky, obtuse, and unprecise. The music is boring, uninspired, and uneventful. It feels like you're playing a simplistic and limited cell phone game, and for the most part, that is correct. The difficulty is simply broken. In the first five or so levels, you will become acquainted with the game's narrow mechanics, and every single level after that, you will learn lessons in what unaffluent programming looks like and experiment with poor game design. Worst of all, is that Osmos has the tendency to flicker the screen and generally display what appears to be coding garbage and fragments of menus at random and persistent times. The only way to correct this serious problem is figure out how to quit the game without being able to read the menu options due to the bugs, and restart it. This screen flickering and fragments display problem will continue incessantly, and there are many others who have tried the game who have the exact same problems. All one has to do is go to the Steam forum for the game and read about the numerous problems this poor attempt at game design has to offer. The developers have not shown any signs of life in relation to correcting the game's various serious flaws, or made any relevant commentary whatsoever. They just don't care. For a game that is supposed to be relaxing and intriguing, Osmos is the perfect antonym to those experiences, and should only be given a try by the most patient and forgiving gaming persons around. This game is yet another example of ideas being implemented lousily and in an incredibly unsound manner. It is an unbalanced and confined mess, and its value is clearly in the realm of free cell phone games. The developer's thoughts on what an adequate asking price for such a poor showing is also downright ridiculous, as for the same amount, one could make much better use of their hard earned money. Osmos is a drab cell phone game reminiscent of a screen saver.\n\nOsmos is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If there was one thing i'd have to say, this version of the game controls REALLY well because of the mouse control, but it's mostly this very good control that leads to it's undoing; it makes the game really easy. Sure, you'll have a satisfying time going through the levels, but they last very little time. Like, as in very little time, like 30 minutes. I just booted this up and got through more than half of the game in the span of 10 minutes. I got this in a humble bundle, so i don't regret my purchase, but it's definitely not 9$, and it's definitely not 9$ when there's a cheaper version for mobile that has WAAAY more content.

Games like Flow and Thomas Was Alone come to mind.  But when you play the game, it isn't like those games.  It's brutally difficult and incredibly unforgiving.  A typical level will require you to quickly capture one or more enemies much faster, more maneuverable, and all around superior to you in every way, before they grow to large to defeat (which takes only a few seconds or a couple of mistakes from you to happen).  But the failure state isn't immediately obvious, so you often waste several minutes trying to struggle out a win (and sometimes you luck out and get it).\n\nPlay this game only if you like extremely frustrating, zero-margin-for-error physics simulation games with no plot, minimal gameplay variety, and a significant luck element.","October 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

At first, this game is very relaxing, and very interesting, however some of the levels were insanely difficult later on, (especially if you try to get all of the achievements.) There are some great physics mechanics in this game (and in some of the epicycle levels, you'll learn about orbital physics...if you do the research yourself) but it's also lacking proper tutorials for the more difficult epicycle levels, and although the tool for slowing down and speeding up time is immensely useful, this game would have benefited so much from a time rewind tool, similar to something in Braid. You could be attempting a level in Osmos for a very long time, and mess up just in the slightest, and have to start all over again.\n\nI think the game should have also involved a greater variety in the graphics. Different colours, effects etc. And I think it would have been a lot more engaging for the player to include more levels of similar difficulty, rather than just ramping up the difficulty with each respective level. (But on that note, you can randomly generate your current level to anything you want which is very useful.)\n\nAll the negatives aside, this is a really relaxing game during the early stages with some fantastic ambient music. The physics for the most part is really well done, and the variety in the main levels is excellent. In the end I would classify this as an above average, 5.8/10 game. There is enough in Osmos to make me hate it as much as there is to make me enjoy it. It was a Humble Bundle game, and regardless of MSRP/Steam Sale price, it's pretty cheap, so I guess it's worth it.","March 5, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Three ways to play the game set to three different musical tracks ranging from fast-paced electronica to deep ambient to somewhere in between. The game can be likened both to the freeware game Phage Wars where you play bacteria and the freeware game Asteroid King, where you collide with smaller planets to grow in size.

In the game you play a blob, a blob that can absorb other blobs and if you aren't careful, get absorbed yourself (thus losing). It's almost a puzzle game of sorts, or perhaps strategy. You're constantly trying to balance gravity, momentum and mass as you make your way around. Your main way of moving is by expelling mass, shooting out your own 'essence' in order to move in a given direction. This is the crux; balancing how much you'll lose by moving versus how much mass you may absorb, assuming everything goes according to plan. That's the goal in the game, absorb lots of other blobs until your blob is supreme. Easy, right? Wrong, it gets very difficult and chaotic in the later stages of the game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, you've just got to put all you've learned to task. Some of it is luck, some of it is perfect timing.

Just a beautifully done game, both in its visuals, atmospheric ambient music (my favourite genre!) and simple concept and controls.\n\nYou are a mote - a speck, particle or cell. You can propel yourself in a direction by ejecting some of your mass, which makes you smaller. You can absorb smaller motes upon touching them and enlarge yourself, but larger motes will eat you.\n\nAnd that's about it really. Level goals vary from "become the biggest" to "hunt this specific mote", but don't be fooled - there are intricacies that will emerge as you progress.\n\nBut why take my word for it? Give the demo a try. I have this game on Steam and Android, that's how much I like it.","September 14, 2012","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a pretty simple game mechanic, but in Osmos, there are many different scenario types which play out like physics puzzles. In some scenarios, you're like an asteroid orbiting a star, and must absorb the rest of the "solar system" by manipulating your orbit; in another scenario, all other blobs are motionless but tightly packed together around you, meaning that you need to plan very carefully to figure out the right sequence of events to escape without getting swallowed.

There's one serious difficulty spike at the end, which doesn't disrupt the game too much.","May 17, 2011","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Osmos is an ambient puzzle game where you play as a cell absorbing other cells. You can only absorb cells that are smaller than yours. If you glaze the side of a larger cell, you'll lose matter at a rate proportional to how much is cell is touching, and a head on crash will see your cell instantly absorbed. To move, you must jettison some of the material from your cell.  You click to spray a little, click rapidly to make minute adjustments, and hold for bigger bursts of thrust. All movement is physics based, including the movement of all other cells. Movement, positioning, and timing are the three aspects most used in these puzzles. By this I mean to say that since you only have a limited amount of movement, sometimes you will have to be frugal with your fuel/size and be patient until an opportunity to absorb your next target comes around. Besides the click to move system, there's a few other handy controls you'll want to know. First of all, in this game, you can actually control the rate at which time passes. If you hold ctrl+scroll with the mousewheel, you can adjust to exactly whatever rate you want, which is great because sometimes I found myself scrolling it back and forth often for speeding up time as I crossed empty spaces, and then slowing it down a lot as soon as I got close to an object, or otherwise had to wait for an obstacle to clear and then had to manuever carefully so as not to lose matter. Right click also switches between lowest rate of time, and middle. Two more controls you'll want to know are...well...restarts. If you find that you've lost too much matter, or another cell has grown absurdly huge, or an attractor (I'll get to that) is collapsing, you'll probably want to hit alt+r. Alt+r is a restart for the level just as it was. HOWEVER, if you find yourself on a level that has a completely unfair start, you can always hit alt+z. Alt+z rebuilds the level, and places things differently. Now, that doesn't work for all levels because some have very specific challenges, but if you seem stuck, give this a shot.\n\nNow that the basics are out of the way, let's get more specific about actual levels. In the beginning you'll play a short tutorial. The tutorial will have one or two levels each for the three types of levels. In Osmos, once you've completed the tutorial you'll be placed at level selection and find three branches coming off of the tutorial levels. There's a survival of the fittest branch where you'll be competing against other kinds of cells to see who can come out on top. These are cool because there's a few different types, and they all move in different ways-one floats around daintly and slowly, one flings itself around wildly, one uses controlled bursts to get where it wants to go, and finally, theres a (boss?) cell which is really smart and manuevers in all the ways you can. Those levels are a bit more action-y than the rest. Lets say you want a more relaxed experience. You'll turn to the purity branch. These levels are a lot calmer. They mostly involve puzzles wherein both light and dark matter cells cover the board, and you'll have to figure out how to survive them bumbping around or boxing you in. Finally, there's the force branch. This one is definitely the most difficult, because, well, it requires the most understanding of forces! These levels are often uncluttered, and fewer cells on the whole, but they present their own dangers in the form of black hole attractors and repulsors and such. All branches will require a good amount of brainpower, but forces will likely require the most.\n\nI'd like to finish by elaborating on the 'ambient puzzle' part. As you know by now, the game is about cells. Well, the backgrounds of the levels are somewhat minimalistic, and sometimes it just reminded me of looking through a microscope at all these little things floating around in their own little microcosmos. The cells are wonderfully designed and have very pretty effects. The backgrounds remind me of other little things in the water, or sometimes space, or some beautiful kaleidoscope. Then there's the music. Wow. There's about an hour and fifteen minutes worth of music, and other than one track that is a bit too energetic for this game, it's a great fit, and really draws you into the experience. It's so good I used it to help me write an essay because it promotes calm and focus so well.\n\nAltogether, this game is a great experience that was lovingly crafted. It's worth the small bit of cash. The only bad thing I can say about it is that maybe the final levels in each branch break the relaxing feel of the game by requiring a lot of quick interactions, and by being especially challenging, but on the otherhand, completing them is really rewarding, and I probably wouldn't enjoy this game as much if it didn't provide some good challenge.\n\nI rate this beauty a 9/10. I believe there is a demo, so if you're still (somehow) second guessing, you can give some levels a go and see how you feel.","November 22, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are what appears to be a sentient soap bubble and you must collide with and absorb all the bubbles smaller than you to grow. There are some unique conditions such as antimatter, bubbles that run away from you, and other AI controlled bubbles to compete against. In order to navigate you must click a direction from which to launch a tiny piece of yourself. This will propel you in the opposite direction and gives a very interesting trade-off between mobility and growth. The game definitely gets tricky fast and I feel like some of the later levels put you at the mercy of the RNG gods, however there is still this overwhelming peacefulness about the whole presentation.

At first, this game is very relaxing, and very interesting, however some of the levels were insanely difficult later on, (especially if you try to get all of the achievements.) There are some great physics mechanics in this game (and in some of the epicycle levels, you'll learn about orbital physics...if you do the research yourself) but it's also lacking proper tutorials for the more difficult epicycle levels, and although the tool for slowing down and speeding up time is immensely useful, this game would have benefited so much from a time rewind tool, similar to something in Braid. You could be attempting a level in Osmos for a very long time, and mess up just in the slightest, and have to start all over again.\n\nI think the game should have also involved a greater variety in the graphics. Different colours, effects etc. And I think it would have been a lot more engaging for the player to include more levels of similar difficulty, rather than just ramping up the difficulty with each respective level. (But on that note, you can randomly generate your current level to anything you want which is very useful.)\n\nAll the negatives aside, this is a really relaxing game during the early stages with some fantastic ambient music. The physics for the most part is really well done, and the variety in the main levels is excellent. In the end I would classify this as an above average, 5.8/10 game. There is enough in Osmos to make me hate it as much as there is to make me enjoy it. It was a Humble Bundle game, and regardless of MSRP/Steam Sale price, it's pretty cheap, so I guess it's worth it.","March 5, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are what appears to be a sentient soap bubble and you must collide with and absorb all the bubbles smaller than you to grow. There are some unique conditions such as antimatter, bubbles that run away from you, and other AI controlled bubbles to compete against. In order to navigate you must click a direction from which to launch a tiny piece of yourself. This will propel you in the opposite direction and gives a very interesting trade-off between mobility and growth. The game definitely gets tricky fast and I feel like some of the later levels put you at the mercy of the RNG gods, however there is still this overwhelming peacefulness about the whole presentation.

Good...\n\n...but this game can quickly become frustrating and is extremely difficult. Indeed, I remember an old "friendlyware" dos-based lunar lander game I had which sought to have fairly realistic controls. This is harder than that game ever was. In this game you control some sort of microscopic super-organism (I always pretend it's some sort of genetically engineered thing) and generally try to make it become the biggest creature in the petri dish (or microscope slide rather). You control it by ejecting parts of itself out in particular directions. Hence moving makes you smaller. You consume any other creatures (well most other creatures) which are also smaller than you are (bump into them to consume them) to get bigger (In a way it reminds me of that old Mortal Engines young adult book except there it was entire cities, not micro-organisms). The bigger you are the more you need to eject to move or even change direction. This dynamic quickly gets really complicated and challenging because you have to balance your need to move (both to hunt and to avoid danger) with your need to consume. I admit the game is now too hard for me to win (I'd have to be totally obsessed with this game to even try at this point) but despite this I still had a lot of fun getting to this point along the way. This game has peaceful, relaxing music and has a great visual athstetic. This is certainly one of the best, though one of the hardest, puzzle games I have ever played.","February 6","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auramancer1247/recommended/29180/","auramancer1247","Auramancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auramancer1247/","590 products in account","Enter a dreamy, minimalist environment where you are a single-celled organism.  You can absorb other organisms smaller than you, but beware any that are larger, as they will consume you.  Your only method of locomotion is to expel mass, propelling you in the opposite direction.  But you must be discerning in your movement, as this will also make you smaller, leaving yourself more vulnerable to attack.  Osmos is a game that rewards patience and thoughtfulness.  Its main draw is not its challenge, though it can be plenty difficult.  Osmos strives to bring you serenity and relaxation.  How well does it succeed?\n\nThe game has 3 modes, Ambient, Force, and Sentient.  You can progress through each path independently through harder and harder levels.  This is a great design choice, as the three modes play out completely differently, and allows each player to find their own favorite style of game to play.  Ambient is probably best described as the “base” game.  The main objective is usually to become the biggest mote on the level, or to absorb a certain percentage of the available mass.  Force throws a twist into this formula, bringing gravitational motes that act like stars you and all the other motes will orbit.  Sentient adds other intelligent motes, that will avoid you or try to consume you, depending on how large they are.  After you complete the main levels in each mode, you unlock endless random levels of that type, giving the game great replayability.\n\nThe hardest of these, by far, are the Force levels.  You are thrown into an environment that does not behave like a normal 2D plane, like most video games or life in general.  The levels are radial in nature.  You will be forced to develop a working understanding of orbital mechanics.  This guide from the developers is crucial to understanding the effective strategies to complete these levels.  I spent an entire semester in college studying the principles used here, and I still struggle with interpreting the different orbits and planning my moves accordingly.  A huge benefit to the player in any level is the ability to speed up or slow down time.  This allows you to execute maneuvers within tight spaces or time frames.  Very useful for sneaking through two larger motes at just the right angle to capture a smaller one, for instance.\n\nThe soundtrack is empty, aetheric, and spacy.  It fits the game very well, as you’ll feel like you’re floating in a void.  The music doesn’t push you ahead or drive you, it is calming and instead allows you to focus on the task at hand.  Grab some headphones and get lost in the game.\n\nThe graphics are also beautifully realized.  There’s no way to play this game but at fullscreen, your entire field of vision taken up by these beautiful motes floating through space.  Simple and very easy to understand.  Blue motes you can consume.  Red motes will consume you.  Blue motes with a ring of red just near the edge: those you should be very careful approaching, as they are almost your size.  Can you make contact with it without expelling too much mass in transit and tipping the scale in its favor?\n\nThe choice to split up the levels into discrete sections is a welcome one.  I found the Ambient levels to be the easiest, and completed those first.  The Sentient levels required a more aggressive approach, as the other motes would usually be quick to outgrow you and hunt you down.  I feel this went a little against the stated goal of the game, which was to be a source of relaxation and serenity.  Turning down the AI’s aggression a little bit would have helped that.  The Force levels, however, were a constant source of frustration to me.  Often there are not very many motes that you would like to pursue near your initial orbit in these levels, so you will have to do some tricky maneuvering right out of the gate.  Wait too long to make these moves, and the level will coalesce into only a few large motes that you have no chance of absorbing.  This gives these levels an unwelcome sense of urgency that leads to many mistakes, because you are trying to literally learn rocket science.\n\nOsmos is a really interesting game.  A simple ruleset, stunning visuals, and ethereal music give this game a really unique atmosphere that I haven’t seen anywhere else.  While sometimes it can be frustrating or almost unfair, the experience of mastering the laws of physics to grow your mote is truly rewarding.","April 5","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing particularly bad about them, but they're not interesting - the same strategy of growing as quickly as possible before enemy cells can catch up is generally effective regardless of enemy type. I was relieved that there were less of these stages than the other two main categories, as Osmos' gameplay doesn't seem particularly well suited to competitive action and there wasn't much memorable about them.\n\nThe Force levels are just seriously terrible. None of the three categories is enjoyable to play, unless perhaps you have a burning passion for orbital physics and waiting ages for cells to slowly drift into place. I'm not ashamed to say that I didn't finish these.\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed my time with it and think that it's worth playing for the Ambient stages alone.","March 12","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a mote. You propel yourself by shooting out part of your own mass.\nYou get absorbed by motes larger than you. You absorb motes smaller than you.\nOn every level, you are attempting to grow much larger.\nThere is a time control mechanism allowing you to speed up and slow down how quickly time passes. This is essential.\nWhy you may need to speed up time: You're moving in the correct direction, but very slowly. You could speed yourself up by shooting out more of your mass, but you generally don't want to waste mass doing that.\nWhy you may need to slow down time:  Sometimes things are moving fast and you need to propel yourself in a very particular direction.\n\n\nPros\n+ Decent variety of levels. For example:\n* Entire map covered with motes and the motes are non-moving. You start in middle and have to carefully maneuver yourself around. Be careful! The pieces you shoot out can hit the other motes and start to move them. These feel a little bit like puzzles.\n* Orbits. You and other motes orbit around one or more "Attractor" motes.\n* Sentient motes. You have to absorb some motes that have some basic AI.\n+ The orbit prediction arc. This arc predicts your orbit around another object.  You can then see if your path matches what you want. The game would've been too hard without it.\n\nCons\n- Can be very frustrating. You may have been playing a level for 10-15 minutes when you lose because of:\n* a moment of inattention.\n* you realize you've reached an unwinnable state. That one other mote you need to absorb is just a tiny bit bigger than you.  (Note: the game will warn you when the level has reached an unwinnable state. You'll see "Doesn't look good..." at the bottom of the screen.
