No way to control the power of how you spin the wheel, and you can't save and quit your game either.  They did away with LIFE tiles and in place they have these cards that reward you either money, or force you to play a game where you spin the wheel and whoever lands on red gets money or the highest spin wins.  Finally when you get to choose your job, you only have a selection of 4 cards.","November 3, 2015","false","0.4"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","33","50","0","3"

I disagree with the notion that it doesn't matter it's no fun to play because it's only $5.  I wouldn't pay $5 for a pile of dog crap even if it was on sale.  I almost didn't buy it when I read that it isn't the board from the actual board game of the same name, but it's certainly possible for the game's board to be improved as long as they hold to the original mechanics.  They don't.  And the result is a much flatter game without dynamic options like Promisary Notes and Stock purchases.\n\nAs far as options go, you can adjust music and sound effect levels.  And while alt-return does activate windowed mode, you can't adjust the size of the window past its full-screen size.   The graphics have bright colors and sparkles, but no anti-aliasing, so it's a pretty rough clash.\n\nLots of times the cards you get dealt from landing on tiles aren't up long enough for a slow reader like me to absorb.  Consequently during many of the unnecessary minigames I find myself saying, "Wait, what the hell is going on?  What happened to the Game of Life?  Is it my turn?  Where did I set the bong?"\n\nIn that light, I wouldn't recommend it even for a 5 year old, partly because of the game's assumption that you read quickly, and partly because a 5 year old can be amused by an empty egg carton.  The fact that a 5 year old finds the bright colors amusing in this game isn't a very good litmus test for the value of the game.\n\nWouldn't recommend this game for 99 cents.  You might as well shove that dollar bill up your butt.  The sensation will be more pleasant.","April 24","false","0.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

The game takes NO parent assistance after kids get used how it works.\n\nIf you have very conservative views on same sex marriage you may want to avoid as kids can pick either sex for marraige, i.e. men can marry men, women can marry women if selected.  I think it's great though, my kids got a kick out of being able to make the choice on thier own!","November 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

It can be a fun family game, but only young kids will really enjoy the game.\n\nThe game is fun to play with a group of kids. Adults may tire of the lack of any real interaction. There are times when you have to compete with others using the spinner and these events can be fun with a group.\n\nThe biggest problem is the lack of interaction. You simply click the spinner and the pieces. By the end of the game, passing the mouse around can get kind tedious and boring. Maybe this is a problem of playing a board game on PC rather than in real life. In any case, you shouldn't come into this with lofty expectations.","November 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

The core gameplay is there, with a couple additional options for flavor. Nothing exciting, just 2  options, that aren't really explained when mousing over them. There are instructions, which I didn't read, since I've played L.I.F.E for many years. My failure is not reading the docs. Theirs is not making mouse-over pop-up a small description.\nThe game itself plays slowly. The actions (drawing a card, moving the car, spinning all take way too long. It's like the creator decide that since they drew all of these actions, you *will* be watching them, over and over and over and over.\nAfter the first 4-5 times, the animations and uninterruptable pacing makes the entire game feel slow. You can't skip anything, no matter how many times you've seen it.  I just wanted to play a game.","February 28","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There was a lot added to make it feel unique, such as mini-games, video clips and cut scenes, an announcer.  It was pretty fun.\n\nWhile this version may stray a lot from its original counterpart, I don't really see that as a bad thing.  I will say that compared to the other computer version of this game, this one just feels kind of bare bones, but it does still have the charm of the original.\n\nThe lack of online multiplayer is an odd choice, and I don't like the fact that the mini-games are exclusive to single player.  I would have also liked new themes or layouts of the board just to add a little more variety (much like Mario Party).\n\nOverall, I think that this is a pretty good game to play when you need to relax, because it is very easy to win, even against three AI players, and the mini-games are a joke (except for Spin to Win, which is just roulette).","April 26","true","6.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you wondering which to pick, pick this one. This one, in my opinion, looks better, it runs better, it's not stuck in window mode like the other one. and its cheapier.\n\nThis game is basically your standard Game Of Life, the only difference is that you get life tokens on every yellow tile and its not just blank tiles. There's little actions involved with them, which (in my opinion) makes the game more interesting. Though, there's none of those Spin To Win cards, or Exemptions Cards like the other game. The game graphics are colorful, sharp,bright, and cute. The animations/cut-scenes are cute and help give the game more life. This game is great for children and fun for adults.","November 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
