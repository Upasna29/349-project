I was really looking forward to playing this game, because I am a fan of the actual roleplaying game. To say the least, I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nThe game suffers from lighting errors early in the game, which already establish a bad image for the rest of the game. The annoying lighting errors aside, the actual graphics of the game aren't horrible, but aren't impressive either. I recall some texture errors on armors, in which a glitchy texture covered the entire armor set. In addition, I also recall many of the armor models being reused, so  quite a few of the armor sets look the same.\n\nThe actual game play is accurately described in the description as, "hack and slash", so I can't complain about the mostly tedious game play. There really isn't much room for character development, which is limited to four different classes, each with a set race. I will however say that despite limitations, the concept of leveling up, and upgrading your equipment, is what keeps the game playable.\n\nAs for the actual storyline, I won't spoil any of it, but I will say that in my opinion, the storyline isn't satisfying and the final boss fight is nothing short of frustrating and redundant (and for me, one of the lowest points of the game).\n\nIf all of the bugs were fixed, and there was more room for character development, then with some expansions onto the actual content (like maybe a sandbox mode or more of a storyline, because the actual game is very short), then this game would be a decent game. However, at its current phase, I cannot say I would recommend it, and overall I was disappointed.","November 25, 2013","false","16.9"," 94 of 102 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","94","102","0","0"

In the note Volo spake in words with his famous quill:\n\nSir Spamicide, one best not slip a foot into this false interpretation of our wondrous realm, or thou will surely feel as thou hath been flatulated upon by a Pit Fiend and under compulsion to consume the fecal pie of an Ettin, which is the consistency of packed clay containing various undesirable items such as goblin feet, unusual bones, teeth, hair, mushroom-like gut flora and at least a few fingernails. I know this my dear friend as I have played the game and only Khelben Blackstaff of Waterdeep could restore my sanity. So, I extend this offer to you or any of your companions that hath endured the torturous experience of this game: Stop by Neverwinter any day during Kythorn and meet me at the Sunken Flagon where Sand, a mage of renown and thine own self will cast an "erase selected memory" spell, followed by a "permanence" spell, which are the instruments Kehlben used to cure me of the memory; we perform said services free of charge. With departure I must bestow this wisdom upon you - only play games that have been developed on the Black Isle near Evermeet or by the Biowarians deep with the Jungles of Chult.\n\nSafe travels my good sir,   ~Volo","October 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","76","55","72","51","0"

I actually liked Daggerdale, despite its shortcomings, and I still do. My biggest complaint would be the fact that you cannot remap your keys without some tweaking in the ini or through the use of software such as autohotkey. Very annoying even though I got it to work in the end.\n\nAlso, the current price for it is likely a bit steep.

The graphics aren't that bad, but they ARE bland and the faces are ugly as hell. It's like I'm looking at people with down syndrome (no offense meant). Add some (and now I'm being generous) bugs and glitches and NO FUN whatsoever and this game is the result. I normally love dungeon crawlers, but the combat is clumsy, as well as the interface. The loot is crap. NPC's are (or get) stuck in environments and objects, (solved) quests aren't always triggered, the camera swirls around so much that it disorients me and I could go on and on and on.

Though i didnt mind the action hack n slash implement, it was not fluid enough to maintain the role play aspect of what D&D has been about all these years. Ive seen 1 patch for the game come up and it still didnt fix the Large GFX issues; i.e. broken armor textures, or even the save and exit while in the middle of a quest. Doing so does not save your quest progress but instead saves everything else and makes you start the quest from the begininning.\n\nI do not wish to bash a D&D series over one mishap child in the series, but i do would like to call out a Development team that really needs to gather background information on a Series before they start their own off-series title.","June 25, 2011","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like it'sa game that's been  in Alpha testing and then they've just decided to release it as a joke.\n\nThe game advertises it's 4-player co-op, however you are unable to connect to any Multiplayer games. There is absolutely no options in the lobby so you just have to sit and wait, and hope someone else can connect to your game. Trying to join someone elses game presents the same issues. I can only imagine that the game is so horrible no-one else is playing it.\n\nSo stuck playing 1P. First item I received was a helmet. I equipped it, and it had no textures. The controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The 'cutscenes' that tell you what's supposed to be going on in the game are jerky and disjointed. Sound = horrible. When you click the button the guy swings his weapon. This is about the only thing that actually works.\n\nThis is just about the worst game I've ever played. $15 down the drain...","June 25, 2011","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For something released in 2011, it sure feels and looks like the early 2000s.  I guess the DnD license can just be used by anyone to create terrible games nowadays.\n\nThe graphics are horrible, the music is awful, and the gameplay is mediocre.  Instead of actually having voiced lines, someone decided to just give all the conversing characters grunts instead of actual words.  Textures in the game kept failing on me and the only reason I bothered beating it was... well I don't know.\n\nRandom loot drops is the *only* thing the game had going for it.  Nothing else.  This is definitely one of those "play and uninstall as quickly as possible" types of games.  Don't even bother looking back.\n\nRating: 2/5 (Just barely)","February 7, 2013","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
