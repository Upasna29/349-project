This game is beyond terrible. The gameplay is tedious and extremely boring and repetetive. Graphics are about Sega Saturn quality. The background is in 2 dimensions and looks like it was copy/paste from Google Earth. Vehicles have crap speed and handling. You can capsize a truck when going 20 mph! The mechanics are extremely confusing and take about an hour to grasp. The whole thing is sloppy. TNT doesn't cause explosions, it just makes dirt "magically" dissapear. The glitches are AWFUL. In one vehicle, the camera spased out and I couldn't see it, even after restarting the game. The TDM requires concrete in order to build the tunnel. But there is not enough concrete within the level to suffice the TDM and it doesn't respawn. So, that's how I failed the TUTORIAL. The biggest problem about the big picture is, it doesn't feel like the player is in control. He has to do whatever the game allows him to. For example, you can't drive into certain parts of the excavation site, losing sense of freedom. Which is what the simulator is all about. It just makes you feel like building an actual tunnel in real life. But that's the big issue with this game. The ENTIRE purpose of a simulator is to augment an experience in which feels like real life, without it actually being so. The fact that it fails the one key piece of a simulator, just makes this a bad simulator. So, just forget about ever having a fun experience with this game, and just get Euro Truck Sim. You'll have many more hours of entertainment than this garbage. Also, I've heard about some performance issues. But, I have a GTX 760 and can run the program with max details just fine. So I haven't really found this as a valid issue.","March 8, 2014","false","2.3"," 73 of 89 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","73","89","0","0"

You don't just move rocks - you move hearts. The roar of the machines is the only motivation you need. They're there not just for manual support - they give more approval to you than your boss-bailiff, whom you never meet face-to-face. Your frustrations are almost literally blown away by the satisfaction of moving masses of earth, which is as simple as T...N...T.\nI was amazed at the concept of using gentically identical clones as manual labourers, and the subtle argument for its' establishment in the workplace portrayed by the game. While I disagree with oligopolistic conglomerates cloning its' own workforce, the game makes a convincing argument for the "pros" side of the argument.\n\nOh and P.S., this game is boring. Really boring. You must detonate, pick up, and move gravel until your fingers, eyes, and brain bleed and you have the brain activity of a tomato. If you buy this game, I will call Interpol and notify the international criminal court of your heinous act.\n\n(don't buy it pls)","November 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","81","42","52","30","2"

I nearly aged another year by playing this game for a few minutes. It's incredibly dull and boring and cannot fathom as to why anyone would purposefully purchase this game. Still, I guess it's a decent attempt at simulating a tunnel boring process, for some obscure reason you may want that. I received this as part of a bundle, so please don't assume I bought it, I'd be embarrased.\n\nI took me a few minutes to figure out exactly why I was provided with a utility van when I just wanted to blow something up. The game starts you off with in a utility van, you need to visit various marked off locations near the tunnel boring site in order to place TNT (which is invisible), it goes boom! then you have to shift a bunch of rocks (which glitch through the front-end loader), followed by a digging/boring process, followed by... ok, I didn't get that far.\n\nPro's:\n\n1. If you like digging holes - this is for you. But bear in mind, they are predetermined craters.\n2. If you are attracted to the notion of holding 'F' several times for seemingly no real reason, then this is for you\n3. If you like driving poor handling utility vans and front-end loaders, then this is for you\n4. It has explosions, but barely depictable, I had to take a few screenshots at the time to see if it actually was an explosion or just a bit of dust. Yes, it's just dust.\n\nCon's:\n\n1. Graphics are probably worse off than games produced in the late 1990's. Some serious low quality 2D texture stuff going on.\n2. Frustrating gameplay\n3. Poor physics, I'm not actually sure why they bothered with that.\n4. Your brain might shutdown from boredom\n\nGo spend your ten bucks somewhere else. Or just give it away altogether.","January 1","false","0.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","13","14","4","0"

After finally placing them the tooltip said to pick up the rubble and throw into the designated area with the minimap showing the way there. I figured it meant take the rubble away from the area using the loader and dump truck but the loader takes too long to maneuvre, the camera makes it hard to see positioning and you can only carry a couple rocks from the ground into the loader at a time. As the loader was about half-full I guess back of the loader was caught on the front of the dump and it just sent both vehicles flying away from eachother. It just looked too tedious to continue and finish the job with I expect not much more to be added apart from monotomy...","June 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Sim Ant, Sim World, Sim City, Sim Life etc.\n\nI had luck, this game was in a bundle so it came quite cheap - but, if you look closer to this simulation you can see that it goes without the merits of the old time simulations that fans of the simulation genre fancy so much. It isn't as bad as some other simulations that were published over the past few years, but still it isn't a good simulation - it lacks the long term motivation thing, that kept us playing Sim City, the novelty of Sim Ant, and the complexity of Sim World and Sim Life.\n\nI even have to ask myself, is this a "Simulation" in the original sense of the meaning? I had to say: No. It is a "drive around a site of civil engineering and mining and try out the construction site equipment. I like building machinery, I like tractors - mostly because I grew up on a rural town, were you had those things as "toys" to play around.\n\nThus the game fails the descriptor - "Simulation", at least in the most obvious ways.\n\nAnd then, is a game that simulates day to day routines of a "everyday"-job a good thing to simulate? Do you want to be a construction site worker for real (I have been for three years after grammar-school), or a trucker, a farmer or forester? And to what extend do you wish to "simulate" the job?\n\nIf you answer any of this three questions with a denial, this game clearly isn't for you. If you answer just two of those with a no, or say you don't like simplifications on sims - be wary of this game. If you answer all those with yes, or say that you want a casual, simplified sim - you might have a hit here; there are no calculations of quantities required, no structural engineering calculations and no insurances for your workers... so much for the Sim Part of the game ;-)\n\nSince the user base is very limited, I won't recomend the game - though I sometimes might enjoy that kind of "simplification"...","November 19, 2014","false","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nope, but in bundle or a discount, it is good buy\nWould I play this for an hour a day? No way, I'd rather take up knitting\nWould I dig another tunnel? Yes, I think I would.\n\nThere are some minor technical issues like wrong texture clipping when frantically moving the camera inside the tunnel or when driving trucks close to some objects, but nothing critical.\n\nTunnel creation stages\n\n1) Strip mining the entrance\nDriving in the van and setting up dynamites. Driving model is just HORRIBLE. It does not take too long, so its bearable. But hey, it's not a van driving simulator, right?\n\n2) Cleaning up the debris\nWith an excavator you must load stones onto a truck and then drive with them to dump them. This part actually is not one big 'Physics, what physics?' mess and it's fun to do. Also kinda frustrating, because the rocks are not very cooperative. And again, it does not take very long, just about the right time to do the work\n\n3) Digging the tunnel\nLast part which is both the most interesting and the most frustrating. From a control room you control the TBM that diggs the tunel. The controlling part of the TBM is complex and requires some practice. Thats the interesting part.\nBut you have to supply the TBM with concrete. Loading the blocks onto a train was difficult at first and was fun to learn it. But then I find out A LOT of LOTS of concrete. For a tunnel of 6 kms you need to load like 7 FULL trains. First train was to learn, second to practice, third to try some cool moves... Fourth started to be tedious.... For a tunnel of length 89 kilometers, I'd have to break something.

Graphics and controls are what you can expect from a simulator but as your tunnel grows it feels great to take a van down it, while trying to avoid hitting your train. From what i can tell the first thing you have to do is turn the graphics quality down because you can't really see a difference in quality but the performance improves like crazy.","March 5, 2014","true","2.9"," 54 of 152 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","54","152","0","0"
