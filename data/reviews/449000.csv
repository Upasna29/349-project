"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyzak/recommended/449000/","kyzak","Kyzak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyzak/","217 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull review below.\n\nPros Clean, well-designed, aesthetically appealing UI\nAddictive and unique gameplay, interesting mix of rhythm and typing game\nSmooth, responsive control\nGood choice of musician in my opinion, anyway!\nRaises awareness for a grossly underrated and disused skill\n(Presumably) A good learning tool for amateur stenotypists\nCons Very little content available for those capable of beating it\nVisual style is Atari-level retro; an understandable art direction for a shoestring-budget indie game, but some may find it charming, others unappealing\n\n\nEdit: As of 05/04/2016, Steno Arcade received an update that added two songs with much lower BPM and slower vocals; it's infinitely more accessible for the average player now, which makes it much easier to recommend to non-typing experts. Obviously this does not compromise on the fact that, by design, anything above easy is likely to be incompletable for a keyboard user. It's great to see that For All To Play & co. are listening.\n\nThis game is a kind of genius that not many people will understand or appreciate at first glance. Stenotype is to keyboards as bicycles are to walking: Both are many orders of magnitude more efficient than their alternatives, offering faster speeds for greatly reduced effort. On a bicycle, you can move at the speed of a full-out sprint-or faster!-- with the equivalent effort of a leisurely walk; largely the same can be said for our dear friend, stenotype. Any frequent typist can benefit from the speed and convenience of steno, just as any frequent pedestrian can benefit from the speed and convenience of a bicycle; nevermind the freedom either offers to those with injuries or disabilities.\n\nBut much like the bicycle, unfortunately, steno is a century-old advancement stifled by a world that makes little effort to accommodate it. Learning stenotype is prohibitively costly due to the absurd tuition fees that for-profit schools charge, and even used, student-grade stenotype machines run upwards of several hundred dollars; think thousands for professional equipment. Further, these machines are simply not designed with non-professional usage in mind, much less the software they operate on.\n\nThis game is a part of an ongoing effort to change that by facilitating a cheap entry barrier, compatibility with any software and ease of learning, bringing steno into the mainstream. It isn't just for middle-aged-and-up court reporters and other professionals; everyone can benefit from stenotype.\n\nBut what about the game itself? Unfortunately, there's not much to talk about at this juncture. I personally feel that For All To Play pushed this to Early Access a bit too early; it shows in the lack of content and the absence of accessibility that the average person has to that content. My understanding is that Steno Hero is designed to be the hardest of the four games planned for Steno Arcade, and in my view implementing it first was misguided- perhaps it was the easiest to code/produce assets for? I can't be certain, but the attitude of the negative reviews here are telling.\n\nThe difficulty curve at the time of writing is less like a curve and more like a wall; I type at an average of 115wpm with an unmodified QWERTY layout and no shortcuts or other aids. The easiest of the four songs was challenging for me, but I managed 95% accuracy; my accuracy plummeted to <50% on the second song and only got more abysmal from there. This readily highlights the obvious advantages of steno over traditional keyboards, but many players won't know what they're getting into when they start this game, and their first impression will be one of frustration rather than wonderment. It fails to have broad appeal to the already-niche community of typing game enthusiasts because of its uncompromising difficulty, which cheats it of its most likely audience.\n\nThis can easily kill an Early Access game before it has any chance to blossom by depriving it of positive reputation and revenue, though Steno Hero, being a passion project, is not directly reliant on Early Access success since it's, well.. free. This was a smart move, as I doubt it would get off the ground in this state otherwise. My advice to the developers would be to implement at least one or two songs that cater toward the average typist, as first impressions are everything. Additionally, the growth of an actual community is likely to hinge on the possibility of community-generated content, so I would be one to make that a focus.\n\nUltimately, though, there's a lot of love and polish behind this game, and undoubtedly a very competent team working on it. I'm excited to see it progress. Thanks for reading.","April 26","true","0.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/449000/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSteno Arcade is made for teaching and drilling steno writers.\n\nThe idea is brilliant: type the lyrics of a song while it's played. Indeed, you have a guitarist on the scene, that is singing for the audience in front of him. The more you're writing correctly, the best it is.\n\nHowever, this is insanely too hard. The easy song was a disaster, the very hard is impossible and the game wants you to write names that aren't common. Worst of it, I fail to see how it will help indeed to be a steno writer with that speed. Besides, I may have been also disavantaged because of my keyboard layout, which is an AZERTY. And when you read the description, you need the accurate keyboard to fully enjoy the game.\n\nAfter 9 minutes, I was frustrated. I'm used to write English but in the end, with that game, you'll resort to write the easy words. Also, for it to be validated, you need to press SPACE at the end of each word. And when it's passing to another sentence, if you're writing, you'll have to be quick to press SPACE and to write another word.\n\nWhat is missing is easier levels. I mean why not imagine to begin with words to write in the lyrics instead of the whole sentence. Or to imagine to have a music and to have more time to write a sentence than the real singer is saying? Besides, if it's a matter of being fast to write something, usually, you're using shortcuts before writing properly.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, the graphics are nice too as they're retro. But it doesn't save the game to be a huge challenge for whoever doesn't own a steno keyboard or for whoever hoped to have a nice typing game. For that, there is Epistory.\n\nAnyway, if you're not a steno writer or if you don't own the proper material, just be prepared to be frustrated. Everything is there to have a good moment. But for a huge base of players, at this stage, if there is no easier difficulty or other challenges that could to type songs, even if it's free-to-play, it will be too hard for you. I'm not even sure if this game could be used in school without the proper material.","April 15","false","0.2"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","29","45","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morinted/recommended/449000/","morinted","Hashable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morinted/","773 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, this is a steno game. What is steno? Look here at me playing this game on a QWERTY keyboard and a steno machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtQzTUEuPWo You can see that I don't write individual letters, rather words at a time. And writing words at a time means that my hands don't move much, much less than a QWERTY keyboard where you have to type every letter.\n\nThe steno machine is much faster at text entry than a regular keyboard, but it takes months to become proficient. Part of the reason that many haven't heard of steno is that for the longest time it wasn't public information! A major stakeholder in this game, Mirabai Knight, tried to bring steno to everyone, starting in 2010. She first had a program made that interfaced with steno machines and handled all the steno logic → that program is Plover, and I use and develop it now.\n\nThat was a great first step. Free software meant that anyone could download and play around with a steno engine. But, software is no good without hardware, so that's where the SOFT/HRUF, Stenosaurus, and Stenoboard come in → they are all efforts to make the hardware cheaper (compared at professional steno machines that start at $1,000, these efforts are about one to two hundred dollars)\n\nGreat! Hardware, software…but how do you do it? Mirabai worked with a technical writer to create "Learn Plover!", a free online textbook that teaches steno theory. Many people I know, myself included, self-taught themselves steno using this book. That makes hardware, software, and learning resources. But once you are at the basic level, it's a lot of practice. In steno school, they just listen to people talk at pace and rewrite what they say. It's boring and costs lots of money.\n\nSteno Arcade is the opposite of boring and expensive. It's supposed to be fun, to help people learn steno in an engaging way, and it tops off Mirabai's dream of free stenography for everyone. The difficulty scale is meant for a steno machine. 100 words per minute is rather "easy" for an intermediate steno student, but you'll see that regular keyboard users will find it impossible (and it nearly is). However, I really encourage you, if you want to write faster, to start learning steno. There's a great, active community, and it's a very fun skill. I use a steno machine instead of a keyboard full-time now, I write code with it. I'm writing this review on a steno machine.\n\nSo, by all means, try the game and enjoy it for what it is at the "very easy" level, and know that if you want to do the hard levels, an entire steno community is around to help you learn. It's not easy, but nothing worth your time is. I've been going for less than 2 years and I write at about 150 words per minute. Some people hit 225 (the graduation speed for steno students) in less than a year, some take up to 4 years. It all depends on how much time you put into it and how dedicated you are.\n\nI'm excited for Steno Arcade to grow. As it is at the time of review, it's good for about 30-60 minutes of fun and I can see myself drilling and building my dictionary for the harder levels. I still replay levels when I'm feeling bored and want to practice the steno machine. (I should add that I've played the game since before it was on Steam and so my play times are off by a few hours)","May 12","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, the concept of this game is unique. I had my hopes high for this game. However, when I played the game hands on, my opinion brutally changed.\n\nPros- Nice music\n- Great game if you enjoy typing\n- Bragging rights\n\nCons- Hard to keep up with\n- Not a lot of music to choose from\n- Very little content in general\n- Mainly for experienced typers\n\nPlease, if you dislike my personal Pros and Cons, keep in mind I'm only giving this game a bad review because there are more Cons than Pros. Again, yes, I know this game is in early access, but games should not be added onto Steam unless they have a decent amount of content in them. I may remake a review if this game ever gets near completion.","April 19","false","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

I average 140 WPM which is 99.9% faster than the average typist and this game is hard on easy, further than easy it's a massacre... I tried very hard just for fun and I doubt anyone can type this quickly, unless they're a guiness world record owner.\n\nThis game would be better if the songs were easier i'm fairly sure. I do think this game is made for Steno keyboards mostly, so if you have one of those, go ahead and play it, it's free anyway.\n\nIf you have a normal keyboard, however, it is unplayable... :D","April 23","false","0.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","1"

Maybe for the "easy" mode you could allow the typer to type the words in advance and not when it gets up to the line.

Its pretty neat and if that sounds appealing I would say you should give it a try.\n\nNote however that I do recommend you use a steno keyboard of some sort, especially if you want to try for anything above normal difficulty.\n\nEDIT: Updated with a new "Very Easy" difficulty. I had seen many people wanting for such a mode, and honestly it shows the devs listened. If you were one of the people craving easier difficulties I hope you enjoy the new mode.","April 1","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

A song plays, and you try to type in time with it. That's it. For now, at least. There looked like there were other "challenges" in the starting screen, but they were locked.\n\nThe difficulty levels need adjustmentI managed the easy one fine, but the "normal" one was actually exceedingly hard. You have to type words like "Mandelbrot", "pterodactyl", "Rorschach", etc in a zillisecond. The "easy" should be "normal", and the "normal" something like "expert" or "guru" or "god" or something like that.\n\nWhat's the point?I liked the concept of typing along with music, but just didn't see the point of it. I mean, if we want to, any one of us can just open a YouTube music video and type along with that; why would we need a game to do this? (I used to do something similar when I young by the way. It was the late '80s/early '90s, and whenever a song I liked played on TV, I would quickly try to jot down as many lyrics as I could.)","April 8","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","5"
