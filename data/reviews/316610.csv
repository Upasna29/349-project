Video review embedded below.\n\nAs I toddled around in the snow as its adorable monster, I couldn’t help but draw parallels between A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build’s focus on companionship, and my consistent inability to find it in my own life.\n\nI’ve always been introverted and awkward around people, content to spend my time alone with the easily understood companionship of a book or computer. But even as I told myself I was fine being alone, there are times when loneliness becomes overpowering; when I needed someone to talk to, someone to just be there to shake my from the confines of my subconscious and remind me life isn’t something you’re meant to go through alone.\n\nThe point of this is not to attempt to garner your sympathy, as I’ve no one to blame but myself for the solitude I’ve spent so much of my life in, but because it’s under these circumstances that I found myself connecting to A Good Snowman and it’s little monster. Trapped alone inside a walled garden, they’re desperately looking for someone to hold no matter how odd it might outwardly seem, a struggle I’m all too familiar with.\n\nBut A Good Snowman isn’t a game designed to empathize with those who feel isolated from society, but to show them that maybe it doesn’t have to be that way. It acknowledges both of the necessity of friendship, and that it’s something you have to work for and are going to make mistakes trying to find, but are never going to get there if you sit waiting for it to come find you. Figuring out how to build a snowman was important to me, not solely because of the satisfaction of solving a puzzle, but because it meant my monster didn’t have to be alone anymore.\n\nIt’s hard to properly put into words exactly why I felt so strongly about it, but standing wrapped in a hug with my new icy friend, I found it hard to let go. It’s a useless mechanic, but its inclusion was what changed A Good Snowman from a cute puzzle game, into something that felt personal and meaningful to me. I wasn’t building stacks of snow anymore; I was bringing people together, all with their own names and faces, and in some small way finding comfort in the fact that my monster’s garden was no longer empty.\n\nPerhaps I’m reading too much into it, projecting myself on to a game in a way that was never intended, but I don’t know if it really matters to me in the end. Whatever it was originally proposed to be, to me A Good Snowman was the video game equivalent of a warm hug from someone as longing for a friend as I was. Digital or not, I didn’t realize how badly I needed one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9smxbUK8sLM&feature=youtu.be\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 157 of 189 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","157","189","11","19"

I took my PC over to my Grandpa's house, where we generally eat and watch crappy TV movies every Saturday or Sunday. No one there plays games. Period. Well, no one happened to be watching the TV, so I plugged my computer in and fired up steam in big picture mode, and started to play some Poker Night 2. Once I switched over to A Good Snowman, my family started to ask...\n\n"What the crap is this?"\n"Uhm... What?"\nand my personal favorite... "You don't have a girlfriend, do you?"\n\nBut everyone kept watching. Then my cousin, my age, started to help. It took us about 15 minutes to figure out one of the puzzles, But when we did, it was like, "ohhhhhhh, wow we're dumb". My dad came over and watched a bit and laughed when I'd kick the tables or chill on the hedge while we discussed the strategy.\n\nI must have told the game mechanics to five or six of my family, seperately, as they all started to watch and "help". My aunt finally plopped down and really started getting into it. I was starting to get bored, and tried to change games, but she started getting agitated and said, "put the snowman game back on!"\n\nAfter I handed the controller over, she played with intense concentration for about an hour before we told her we needed to leave. She asked if I could build her a PC so she could play it and other similar games on her own.\n\nThanks, Snowman team, You guys got some of my family to actually play with me.

Seemingly the only creature of your kind, you will play as a introverted and lonely, but bond-hungry Monster. Your mission is building snowmen/ma'am for a battalion of friendship to fill the void you feel whilst trapped inside your beautiful, but hopelessly empty garden. As you interact with your environment: rolling snowballs to proper sizes, sleeping on benches, hugging snowpeople you've built, and maybe ever chasing a butterfly or two, you will slowly feel empathy and maybe even frustration (depending on your puzzle skills) with Monster's situation in his botanical cell. Free yourself, and crave for something more than solitude's wintry embrace.\n\n8.9/10","February 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/316610/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","A must-have for puzzle enthusiasts!\n\nThis is without a doubt the most charming puzzle game I have ever played. You play as a featureless and lonely-looking monster who builds snowmen and gives them all their own character traits and names. And then he hugs them. Well, it's up to you really, but naturally you want to hug your new friends?\n\nThe mechanics are similar to Sokoban, but your goal is to stack three snowballs with gradually decreasing size on top of eachother to create a snowman. Snowballs come in three sizes, and what makes this less trivial than it might sound like is that a snowball rolled through a tile filled with snow will increase by one size. And if you don't have one of each size lined up properly when it's time to stack them, you'll probably have to start over. Like in Sokobond, there is a convenient erase-one-step feature too though, so if you haven't messed up too badly, you might be able to save your effort without starting over from the beginning.\n\nAs you solve puzzles, you open up more routes through the snow-clad park the game is set in. You can choose which puzzles to tackle when, to some extent, and if one particular puzzle stumps you initially, it might help to come back to it later. As you progress, you'll find more and more complex puzzles, and some of the trickier ones even require you to build two or three snowmen in the same area. If things get too tough, you might enjoy a breather on one of the many benches scattered throughout the park.\n\nThe game allows for many different interactions with your environment beyond building and hugging snowmen and they are all animated in a simple, yet delightful manner. Try kicking a table, shaking a bird bath, roughing up a flower or wrestling a pine tree. Most of these actions are inconsequential beyond adding atmosphere to the game, which they do brilliantly, but some might have unexpected results. Don't be afraid to experiment.\n\nMy first run through the game took about three hours. Or so I thought. The last required puzzle of game has you building the developers Ben & Alan's snowman equivalents. On completion of this puzzle, the gate to the exit opens and the camera pans over the park of snowmen, before a dubious "THE END?" is displayed on screen. So what's this then? I don't think I'm spoiling too much by saying that, yes, this game contains secrets. Furthermore, the secrets are excellent and complex, and they at least double the length of the game.\n\nI am a sucker for both cleverly designed puzzles and secrets in games, and this game offers heaps of both. The switch to Haxe in place of the Adobe AIR runtime used in the developer's last game, Sokobond, even further sweetens the deal for Linux users. Throw in the gorgeous visual and audial design direction of this game and a few dozens of hugs and I'm completely sold.\n\nIn conclusion, I compell you to buy this game now if you too have a monster within you who is desperate for puzzles and affection.\n\nNote, this is a small rewrite of a review I wrote for GamingOnLinux.com: http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/adorable-sokobanlike-puzzler-a-good-snowman-is-hard-to-build-released-today-a-musthave-for-puzzle-enthusiasts.5012","February 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","6"

This game took me slightly more than one hour to complete, and thus left me a bit underwhelmed. Nevertheless, the visuals are lovely, the sound is excellent (full disclosure: I have a soft spot for Ryan Roth's music), and the puzzles are clean and satisfying, albeit lack in number.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IHNN/recommended/316610/","IHNN","IHNN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IHNN/","118 products in account","I'm often torn about whether or not to recommend a game I enjoyed, but asks for too much.\n\nAs you've probably guessed, A Good Snowman is Hard to Build (Snowman from this point forward) is a puzzle game with its roots in block pushing, or sokoban games. The variations on the standard "one block at a time" mechanics in the three sizes of snowball, stacking and rolling balls in the snow to enlarge the size are a welcome addition to the genre. The puzzles are, for the most part, crafted to teach you something new about these mechanics throughout the game.\n\nI blazed through the 30 puzzles the reached "The end?" in as many minutes. Went back and solved the "Alice" snowman without leaving the room after another few minutes, and then found the dream world shortly after. This is where the game starts getting a little shaky, as apparently sitting on a bench and then leaning into the bench enters a sort of fast travel world. And doing this in the dream world reveals that the three snowmen corresponding to the first three have corresponding snowballs in the fast travel dream world, that, if made in the right places, can make a snowman in that world!\n\nThat's pretty cryptic and ultimately leads into doing the same thing with rearranged versions of every other puzzle, where looping around through rooms is required in some places. Once all the snowmen are created in the alternate dream world, that's it, game is done. This second group of puzzles took me about an hour, with most of it extended by the problems that I kept running into.\n\nIn the 90 minutes I played Snowman, it crashed 6 times (Win8). I found a softlock that even autosaved via the fast travel- coming in on a bench with an object in front of you required closing and re-opening the game several times to be able to re-enter the fast travel world. The general pace of the game is fairly slow as well, which just served to make executing the solutions I had figured out in my mind take longer, especially in the dream world half of the game. Interaction animations just added more delay as well, which happened often as the movement felt a little jilty.\n\nOn that note, the puzzles themselves might stump most people, but I'm fairly familiar with sokobans and had recently come off of Snakebird which heavily influenced an "endpoint first" approach to solving, and Chip's Challenge (1, 2 and fan levels) which helped significantly with shuffling blocks around in enclosed spaces.\n\nSo I suppose it comes down to a target audience. Snowman isn't aimed towards puzzle fanatics, though they will enjoy it- the length and slow controls are a bit of a hindrance there (as mentioned, I solved everything in an hour and a half). Newcomers to the genre will likely be stumped, but may get frustrated with the dfficulty- it's certainly not trivial. So that leaves the smaller subset of puzzle fans who haven't played too many puzzle games as the group I think this is aimed towards.\n\nBut for $12, that's a lot-I was given this as a gift and thoroughly enjoyed it, but even though it was on a 50% off sale I would have been disappointed had I bought it myself. That would have been $4 per hour (8 at normal cost!) of gameplay. There's no real replay value to the game either, as it doesn't track move counts for puzzles, have a timer, or any of the usual replay-encouraging features.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd recommend picking up the game if it's on a sizeable sale- 66-75%+ off. Give it a pass if it's higher than that.","December 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game has perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing visual style of any puzzle game I've played. This game has also got some good spirit, each snowman you build get it's very own name and clothing style and you can even hug your frosty creations. If that doesn't spell out FUN then I don't know what else does. Perhaps a fun twist to sokoban style puzzles will do it instead?\n\nThe main twist from standard sokoban puzzles is that anytime you push a smaller or medium sized snowball across a snow patch it will increase in size until it grows to the large size. You are only given three snowballs (of varying initial size) per snowman (or snowwoman) you have to make. Each snowman is comprised of one large snowball, one medium sized snowball, and one small snowball. As you can tell, it takes some care and attention to make sure end up with the right sized parts...if you push the only snowball through a snowmatch, your future snowman is now headless (and you'll have to restart). This makes for some pretty fun and interesting puzzling, you definitely have to think things through on some of the harder puzzles. The better you can make sense of your spatial layout, as well as the how and where of how each snowball will end up the easier it is to solve the puzzles. The last puzzle really exemplified this the most. I pushed around the snowballs a bit to get some ideas but really had to think critically about what I was trying to achieve and what problems I would encounter by pushing the snowballs in certain directions/patterns. I didn't find any single puzzle to be too difficult (in the "IT'S WAY TOO DAMN DIFFICULT" sense not the "meh, it wasn't too difficult" sense) and I was pretty happy with the progression in terms of difficulty.\n\nI will say the game is on the short side. I beat the "base" game in around an hour and a half. I will say that I found that the final puzzle was really well made, it was difficult but satisfying and it really made me think. While it was a great last puzzle, other puzzles like that would have been a great bonus. Also worth noting that there is apparently some hidden content, but I'm not sure what it all involves as I have yet to find it. If you are a budget gamer or if you prefer games give you a lot of playtime for their buck, I'd caution you towards getting this game. It is a great game, and I do recommend it, just keep the game length in mind before purchasing. Despite all this, I was still very pleased with the game. I'm not exactly someone who can throw money around, but I would not have been upset with what I got out of the game, even if I had paid full price for it. It's a very memorable game and it's something that I wouldn't mind replaying in a year or two once I forgot all the solutions just for the enjoyment of re-experiencing the game.\n\np.s.

Not only that but the simplistic graphics are done exceptionally well, and there is much attention to detail with everything your character does, it's a real treat to see played out in the game.\n\nMy only one qualm is how cryptic the dream world can be, as it takes quite a bit of trial and error and lengthy guesses to figure out what works, but the dream world merely serves as a sort of bonus area so it's not required in completing the game.

It was also awesome to meet little nice details like that you can sit on a bench, touch different objects, chase butterflies and so on. Some of the puzzles were really tight, but most of them were of moderate difficulty and some were pretty straightforward.\n\nHowever while progressing through the game I was getting more and more tired and bored as the game for me at the moment have become mostly a set of puzzles without further developing of mechanics or another interesting changes in gameplay, and I just wanted to complete them all to finish the game. But when I've completed seemingly the last puzzle I've found that it's not the end!\n\nI just want to give a hint to others (without spoilering) that besides this first obvious part of the game there is another one, at least as large as the first one. And exactly after I've reached this second part I've become very intrigued by new strange things that start to happen and by new mechanics. This have revealed the game for me from another side and all of the tiredness and boredom disappeared and I was like "OMG, what's happening here? I certainly want to complete it to see what else the game have for me in the end". I became much more emotionally closer to what was happening on the screen while proceeding the second part. I couldn't calm down until I've truly (I hope) completed the game. Recommend it to all who like to solve puzzles and who like unexpected turnaround of events. :)\n\nThe only truly annoying thing with this game was that it crashed sometimes in the late part of the game and in "about" menu after choosing a name on my 64-bit linux system. Thankfully, after quick relaunch the game continued exactly at the same moment it crashed.\n\n(Русский)\nС самого начала игры я получал истинное удовольствие от наблюдения за очаровательным, милым и забавным главным героем, великолепной анимации и художественного исполнения в целом, замечательной атмосферной музыки и звуковых эффектов и весьма интересно развитой механики классического сокобана. Впечатление ещё больше усиливало множество небольших приятных деталей, таких как возможность сесть на лавочку, трогать разные объекты, гонять бабочек и тому подобное. Над некоторыми из головоломок мне действительно пришлось поломать голову, но большая часть из них были средней сложности, а некоторые были довольно просты.\n\nОднако, по мере прохождения игры мне становилось всё более и более скучно, я даже стал несколько уставать, поскольку на тот момент игра для меня по большей части представляла собой просто набор головоломок без дальнейшего развития механики или каких-либо других интересных изменений в геймплее, и мне уже хотелось побыстрее выполнить их все чтобы закончить игру. Но когда я решил казалось последний паззл, я обнаружил, что это ещё не конец!\n\nЯ хотел бы дать другим подсказку (при этом не спойлеря), что помимо этой первой очевидной части в игре присутствует ещё одна, по-крайней мере не меньшая первой. И сразу после того, как я достиг этой второй части я стал весьма заинтригован новыми странными вещами, которые начали происходить, и новой механикой. Это раскрыло для меня игру с совершенно другой стороны, и всю усталость и скуку как рукой сняло. У меня на уме было только "Боже мой, что здесь происходит? Я хочу обязательно пройти это всё, чтобы увидеть, что ещё игра приготовила для меня в конце." Я стал эмоционально гораздо ближе с тем, что происходило на экране, пока проходил вторую часть. И не мог успокоиться до тех пор, пока действительно (надеюсь) не прошёл игру. Рекомендую её всем, кто любит решать головоломки и кому нравятся неожиданные повороты событий. :)\n\nЕдинственным досадным моментом с этой игрой было то, что она время от времени вылетала в поздней части игры и в меню "about" после выбора имени на моём 64-битном линуксе. Слава богу, после быстрого перезапуска игра продолжалась ровно на том месте, где она вылетела.","February 26, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The difficulty progression was perfect; never being too easy and never devolving into puzzles being so complicated that they can only reasonably be solved by mindlessly trying things out until they work. The game kept making me go "oh, that's clever!".\n\nIt is only after you complete the game and access the secret dream world that I feel the game truly begins. Completing the dream world took longer to solve than the initial game! I think the game should have communicated better to the player how to access these extra levels (after you finish the game, go through the newly opened gate in the room you began in, and sit down on a bench to fall asleep). Not only because the game is a bit too short without them, but in particular because the dream world is so cleverly designed that you gain new appreciation for the game.","March 15, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Right off the bat, this new game should have puzzle game enthusiasts jumping for joy. It’s got adorable graphics, it’s tailored to the season it’s been released during, and it promises simple rules, much like Alan Hazelden’s last effort. Does it really live up to its legacy, though?\n\nRight off the bat, A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build is undeniably charming. You may be a nondescript monster living out a lonely existence but exploring a world with such an art style as this and watching the monster call out the names of the snowmen as it’s going along, giving them each their own unique look and personality through different garb, it’s hard not to get lost a bit in the inherent charm. This charm is further extended by the fact that the monster can literally interact with anything. If there’s a bird bath nearby, it can tilt it back and forth, careful not to spill it. It can lean up against the hedges and peek through the parts of the hedges blocking the view of the next puzzle. It can sit on benches. It can use telescopes to admire its handiwork from more of a bird’s eye view as it goes along. There are quite a lot of little details that I hardly would have expected from a puzzle game such as this one and it adds to the charm in spades.\n\nAs for the rules themselves, there are extremely simple rules in place. There are three sizes of snowball. If you roll a snowball over a tile of snow that has not been rolled over before, the snowball will go up a size. Once a snowball has reached the third, and largest, size, it cannot grow anymore and will just sort of “absorb” the snow instead. Snowmen must be built in order from largest to smallest. Any smaller snowball can go on top of a larger one and can promptly be removed, as well, so long as the snowman has not been completed. You can push the snowballs but not pull them.\n\nThe rules really are simple and they become second nature in no time. The only part I personally had issues with was learning to move snowballs around by placing them on top of others and removing them right after. There are several puzzles that beat that into your head, though, and you will soon be keeping that in mind during puzzles. Most of the difficulty comes from trying to alter your perception of the rules by limiting resources or adding an extra snowman or two to make in a specific puzzle. Sometimes, it works. Other times, it just ends up making the puzzles feel tedious as you wheel a tiny snowball carefully around a path you’ve made for it with one of the larger snowballs.\n\nPuzzles involving multiple snowmen were exceptionally disappointing, though. There were a number that tried to be clever by giving you just enough snow and a full set of tiny snowballs to try and get to the right sizes. In theory, this sounds great. It could be a nice challenge after a few easier puzzles. Ultimately, it ends up being entire puzzles based on carefully micromanaging which larger snowballs to push smaller ones over and when. There are times they begin to feel almost too delicate and the ability to instantly rewind either one move at a time or the entire puzzle becomes an extremely welcome feature.\n\nThat’s not to say that all of the puzzles are frustrating. Many are very nicely crafted, balanced to perfection, providing just the right amount of sleight of hand to throw the player off as they begin to think they almost have it down. They just aren’t all that way. I found that the best puzzles were the carefully crafted puzzles that made use of only one snowman. I really liked one two snowman puzzle, in particular, as it required a significant amount of attention to detail while not feeling tiresome, but most of my favorites were of the one snowman variety.\n\nThere’s a larger problem with the puzzles, though, and that’s that the level of difficulty varies greatly from puzzle to puzzle. There’s an open world design of sorts in play, with many puzzles hidden in corners, and some puzzles opening two or three puzzles at once. Others open new ways into already unlocked puzzles. This last one is important because puzzle progress is maintained when you leave the puzzle and come back. You can use entrances to a puzzle to almost bend the rules of the puzzle, pushing a snowball from a direction you might not have been able to previously. The result of all of these factors combined is that, while puzzle complexity tends to go up as you move towards the end of the game, puzzle difficulty varies wildly as you go through the game. I could easily breeze through one puzzle and then be hopelessly stuck on the next, just to leave and find another attached to the last that I breeze through, as well.\n\nOverall, though, the puzzles remained relatively easy throughout. I finished the game in about an hour and a half and only got stuck to the point of quitting and coming back later maybe two times. It was disappointing at times to find that, often, if I was stuck, the solution was simply to roll over as much snow as I possibly could with a fully grown snowball before continuing but, ultimately, the puzzles gave a sense of accomplishment on completion.\n\nAs did the game. Despite its meager playtime of an hour and a half and puzzle game roots, the ending felt natural and satisfactory. I wish that the puzzles had flowed a bit better and that the game had more effectively made an attempt to state whether entrances were intentionally made to be used as ways to push different snowballs around but it is a charming little game that makes great use of the rules it does have, nonetheless. It is, however, going to retail for $12 after the first two weeks on sale and that doesn’t quite sit well with me. It’s more expensive than Sokobond for a fraction of the content. Yes, it’s charming. Yes, the puzzles are challenging at times. No, I don’t think it’s quite worth $12. Especially considering the amount of playtime you get for that. Sure, you could start over but puzzle games aren’t the most replayable of games. In the end, its price betrays it.","February 25, 2015","false","1.5"," 38 of 79 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","38","79","4","6"

The biggest puzzle in the game came at the end after clearing the last puzzle and trying to find the rest of the content - there's no clear indication you're done, just several empty variations of the park map that you can wander around in.  The game might last someone that isn't very good at puzzles longer and be a more satisfying experience, but all this has going for it is the cute atmosphere and one challenging puzzle at the very end.","January 3","false","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Most puzzles begin with three small snowballs, which you roll into the snow to make larger.

You can also pass a smaller snowball over a larger one (i.e. medium/small over large, small over medium) in order to solve some puzzles.\n\nOnce you complete a puzzle, your snowman magically grows clothes and has a name (don't forget to hug them afterward)!

This one is so hard, that it really challenged me and got me excited. Therefore I am excitingly recommending this one!\n\nThe main game is played through in about an hour, but to complete the Big Ultra Puzzle it takes triple the time and triple the wits.\n\nAbsolutely recommended for logic puzzle likers and extreme puzzlers!!!\n\n\nI know a game similar to this one from the past, about from the 90s or something. I'm searching for it, does anyone know it? Please leave a comment if you do :-)","May 13","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
