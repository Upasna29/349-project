After a while (presumably a memory garbage collection) it gets fast again.  Using some of the shortcuts like right-click to move makes the slow-down bearable.","September 24, 2014","true","429.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"
