THANKS!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYlaP0N1BSI\nElegy for a Dead World is not exactly a game in the strictest sense. There is not final goal to achieve, there is no failure state and there are only barebones in terms of its mechanics. Elegy for a Dead World really is more a way to explore your fantasy. More specifically, by offering all kinds of writing prompts and premises for you to bring your ideas into short stories. But let us start from the beginning. You can currently choose between three portals, each with a selection of writing prompts, which range from humorous, like quickly finishing the homework on the way to school, to serious topics, like analysing the downfall of a civilization or the extinction of a race. Additionally, all worlds also offer free form writing, without any prompts at all. Once you selected the basis of your short story, you are thrown into one of the three beautiful worlds. Aesthetically, they remind me of Banner Saga, as the layers of two dimensional artwork slowly pass by while you walk and enjoy the environments. Your character constantly breathes audibly and while it might sound confusing and annoying, it actually is quite atmospheric, especially coupled with the underlying music, that changes depending on where you are in the world and creates an unsettling alien mood. At certain points, a feather asks you to fill in the blanks and thus your story begins. If you so choose, the given writing prompts themselves can also be changed, to alter the story to your liking. I do not consider myself a great writer at all to be quite honest with you, especially in terms of creativity, I always need a nudge in some direction to get going. This is why the formula of Elegy for a Dead World works so well with me. It took me about thirty minutes to go through the first world, writing a short story from the top of my head, and I quite enjoyed reading it again afterwards as well. The quite simple concept of providing writing prompts, combined with audio visual input works wonders in triggering my imagination. Well, at least once for each world, as now I am always thinking of my earlier stories, even with the new writing prompts underneath, and thus I find it hard to grasp new ideas and attach them to the world in the background. Some writing prompts especially seem very disconnected from the world you are exploring.\nIf you ever feel exhausted of writing yourself, you can just read what others have produced. The attached Steam Workshop makes sharing and reading other stories very easy, however I also find it quite difficult to browse through the massive amount of stories already. As you can only see the title and the first few words in the game, and no sorting or rating options are available in-game, finding interesting reads could be quite tedious in the future. In my honest opinion, the interface and the accessibility of other stories overall should be improved, since a mere list with titles is quite tedious to go through. I would love to be able to sort by views, recommendations and writing prompts used as basis. Ideally this browsing of other stories would use the whole space available on screen instead of just a measly list of a few titles.\nAnother gripe I have, is that when reading other stories, you only get simulated book pages, instead of the interactive walk through the story experience, which takes away so much of the atmosphere, especially since the pictures in the book cannot be controlled in their shapes, sizes and the like. I understand that when reading through multiple stories on the same portal, it might get very repetitive to go through the world over and over again, however I think that there should be an option to read a story either in the fast, booklet form, or in the exploratory, walking experience.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTo sum it all up, Elegy for a Dead World is a truly unique interactive experience that might trigger your imagination towards writing short stories to unknown levels, however it also has problems in terms of its interface and its content overall. Three short worlds with two handfuls of writing prompts each make it a tough sale, if you are not heavily into writing or reading sci-fi already. If you love to sit down and think about stories, while needing a little bump to get going tough, Elegy for a Dead World is probably the best option you can currently get your hands on.","December 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 117 of 136 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","117","136","0","0"

The default writing guides give you a framework to write in (eg. "The first settlement ended because ____"). It gets your ideas going, but it doesn't ever constrain you to a particular story. That's all up to you. Or, you can turn off the writing guide and write freely.\n\nThe genius of the game is meticulously designed ambiguity. In both the artwork and the writing guides, there are loads of things to get your mind going, but none of them have an explicit meaning. Like a Rorshach ink blot, everyone will see something different. So you aren't so much writing a story from scratch, as seeing a story unfold in front of you: one that the designers didn't necessarily intend, but that will have meaning to you. By the end of it, if you took the writing task seriously, you will feel like a moving story has been told to you, and then you realise that you told it yourself.\n\nA big part of the game is the sharing and reading experience, and it's also the most flawed. The game lets you share stories in public and read other people's stories. It's fun to see other people's interpretation of the same visuals, but the reading experience is greatly hampered by its presentation: instead of seeing the full scenery to accompany the text, you see one or two small windows of objects in the scene. You see so little that you basically have to remember what you saw when you played it, or the text will often make no sense. The other thing is that the game seems to "score" you based on how many people commended your work, and this suffers the same problem as all user-created content systems: that a few popular stories will rise to the top, while the vast majority will never be read at all. This leaves the dream of reaching the game's stated goal of 1000 commendations well out of reach to most players.\n\nThe game is best enjoyed without any expectation of others reading your work, or by comparing stories with a friend. I think it would make an excellent teaching aid for creative writing in the classroom. A highly recommended experience.","December 13, 2014","true","1.8"," 68 of 68 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","68","68","0","0"

As others have mentioned it's a little side scrolly thing where you explore an uninhabited little world via side scrolling, and there are writing promps, and you look at the background and stuff and invent backstories to write and you can read other people's stuff. It's not a 'game' in the traditional sense but it lets you be creative in ways the traditional video game can't, and it's a bit more stimulating than just firing up a word processor.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend is because there are 3 worlds that each take about five minutes to get from one to the other, tops. Of course you're writing for much of it, but still, you're talking about MAYBE squeezing 3-4 hours out of it. I mean look at all the other reviewers: as of now there's one guy with 7 hours played out of the 29 positive reviews, and nobody else has hit 4 hours.\n\nConsidering they aren't much more than slideshows that are a few minutes long, it breaks my heart that there are only 3 of them. Of course they are interesting and engaging and beautiful but seems like there are a lot of games that are all that and have MUCH more content.

There are 3 planets and each of them can be finished in a couple of minutes. I spent only ONE hour with the game and I even had time to read the top rated stories written by users for each of the 3 planets.

There's no opposition, no story save what you create, and no competition.  Rather, it's an exercise in writing.  You travel across one of three worlds, all varied, and write.  You can either use prompts supplied by the game, or, if you already have your inspiration, you can go without, writing whatever you like.  Once you finish, you can put your work online for others to read.\n\nUltimately, it's a rewarding experience.  It probably won't make you enjoy writing if you don't already, but if you like exercising your literary muscles, it's a good way to get some inspiration, put out something others may enjoy, and see what the same images and prompts inspired others to write.","December 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

She couldn't really understand mine, but was quite pleased with hers.

You can replace the entire text if you so choose.\n\nThis game is more of a creative writing framework.

The three worlds, while short and static, provide a scaffolding on top of which you can build as little or as much as you want.\n\nI think this is best played in short busts. Once you've let a new take on the world flow out of you, I think it takes a while before another worthwhile one pops in your head.\n\nOn the other hand, you can easily spend an hour reading other people's contributions, and this I would say amounts to 50% or more of the game's value.\n\nIt looks beautiful, by the way. It's kind of a shame that only three static worlds are available. I am hoping for more to come as free updates. No wonder the game was released three months in advance.\n\nSo to sum things up, this is for people who enjoy imagining, writing and reading.

I ended up writing a pretty neat story that I was happy with, but I felt pretty worn out afterwards and wasn't sure if I would come back.  However I got home today and felt like pulling it up again... and I played through Byron's World again with different writing prompts, and wrote something just utterly different and also awesome.  I feel like this game is something I'm going to keep coming back to over time... I haven't even started on the other two worlds yet, and I could definitely spend more time on the first.\n\nThis game does a great job of providing you lots of creative cues and stimulation without pushing anything specific on you... the result is an incredibly wide variety of pieces generated by yourself and the community, sharing a handful of symbols and themes.  It seems suited to gradeschool classrooms, but it is certainly not juvenile.  I think the concept is an excellent one, and I'd recommend the game to anyone willing to put some creative effort into it.\n\nIt does have a lot of downsides, however.  One, the menu system is not great.  Publishing your stories and reading and voting on other people's stories is confusing; it's difficult to search through other people's writing (there's basically no tools for doing so, just one view showing most recent works and one view showing most voted for works); there are bugs and/or just poor behavior (like being shown the same story again and again even after voting on it).  But at the end of the day, once you figure out how it works, it is not too big a deterrant.\n\nPerhaps more frustrating is the disconnect between reading and editing your story; you write and edit your story while walking through a richly illustrated landscape, and then when you are done you can read your story in a sort of picture book format, with images taken from the landscape automatically populated in your book.  However, you can't edit the story from the picturebook view as far as I can tell, and reading the story while walking through the landscape is slow and awkward, since it takes quite a bit of time to get from one place to another.  Looking back on it now, it is fairly easy to switch between book and landscape, but I just get a general feeling of clunkyness and frustration from the post-experience editing.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is an excellent, novel idea, good for adults and children alike, and with beautiful artwork and well chosen, stimulating writing prompts.  It lacks a lot of UX polish, but definitely still worth the time.","March 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Yes, it is a game. No, it is not a typical game. It is a 2-D side scroller where the objective is to write. It gives many writing prompts to help warm you up to the concept (mostly from romantic poets Byron, Keats, and Shelley in the public domain).\n\nThis is not the part I like about the game. I like the freeform writing option. You are not limited to certain spots to write, and you are not confined to a previously written prompt. You can stop wherever you want and write whatever you want.\n\nThe art and music are minimalistic yet stimulating. I find myself staying in one area and writing for a bit and then moving to the next area to seek more inspriation. This works, because the music and scenery change as you wander through the areas. Neither are overpowering and act as more of a white noise to help you maintain focus.\n\nI recommend this game to any writer.

With three relatively small worlds to select from, and with a small number of writing objectives for each, the strength of Elegy isn't its gameplay, but rather its use as an artistic outlet. You get to create the story as you wish, either rigidly adhering to the framework they provide or starting from scratch, with nothing more to use than the aural and visual stimuli they provide.  Ultimately, at the end of each exercise, you then get to submit your work to be "published" throught the Steam Workshop of the game, where others can read and commend (or not) your efforts.  Likewise, you can read the interpretations of others for those same worlds, and commend them (or not) accordingly. It's a surprisingly engaging experience.","December 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You are given the option to change a story already set in stone, create your own story or use a workshop item such as grammar to improve your grammar. But if you're more into reading stories then you are also able to read other users stories and if you like it then you can commendate it which lets the writer know you enjoyed it.\n\n---Gameplay---\nThe gameplay consists of walking right along a beautiful background and making up what happens, if you are free forming it then you can place story marks anywhere you like and when you come around to reading it whatever is in the background where the marker is you will see a small snapshot of it. Otherwise you will be editing markers places around the map.\n\n---Conclusion---\nThe game is a nice turn on the gaming market and is a fun relaxing experience.

There are some prompts that can help you get started, but I was really hoping for more thought-provoking tid-bits and something to keep me flowing and excited to get my ideas out in words. The worlds are very short and don't do much in the way of inspiring unique story lines. I bet if you lined up all the story lines that users have generated, they're all going to be pretty much the same. It's a great tool if you already have a pretty detailed idea in your head, but if you're just coming in to it casually, there won't be a lot of 'spark' to help you create something cool.\n\nIt's a very unique concept and it definitely has a place in the community, it just needs some more help before it can really take hold.

No action.\n\nAlso, the paintings are inspired by three famous writers.  I didn't get into all that, but the scenary is quite beautiful.\n\nThe interface is raw and the game smacks of being someone's first go with GameMaker but the idea is unique to say the least.

I used to write when I was young and in school, but eventually I stopped. I never had time for it, even though I loved it.  (Whether or not I was any good at it is another story...)  Its something I've often wanted to get back into, but there always seems like there's something else to do. This game offers me a wonderful opportunity to get back into writing, and it makes the whole thing so effortless.  There's a variety of prompts in each world to get you going, but I have to wonder if you even need that.  Each location that you wander through is so evocative and was clearly created with a lot of care and attention to detail.  Its easy to forget that these strange lands aren't real when you get caught up in the art direction and haunting ambient melodies.  Finding some still functioning relic or some drawing scrawled on a wall is thrilling. I'm so, so glad I backed this on Kickstarter and I couldn't be happier with the end result!

It's a good introduction to writing from a prompt, and the three worlds presented all have somewhat different styles that suggest different storylines. Each also has several prompts, providing structures for your writing from prose to poetry to comedy songs, so even though there are only three worlds there's plenty of replay value in each. You can also read other people's creations based on the same prompts as you, which can be an interesting window into the writing of others and sometimes lets you stumble on a small-scale masterpiece or two.\n\nMy only complaints - and they're trivial ones - are that the game does nudge you towards a somewhat melancholy outlook when writing, and if anything the visual cues are too good at guiding people in their writing, leading to similarities in the stories written about each world even when using different prompts. But these really are minor issues.\n\nAlso, I want more worlds to explore - but that's just me being greedy.\n\nIf you're interested in writing, or just unusual games that are a step outside the norm, pick this up.

It honestly feels like a preview rather than the whole product. It's also certainly not for everyone. It's geared more towards the type of person who writes long headcanons for their villagers in Banished or create elaborate backstories for their Bioware characters. For people who have used programs like Zen Writer, this gets you into the same kind of simplified mindset-- there's nothing but you, the art, the sound, and the words. You won't get the editing and organizational capabilities of programs like Scrivener, but it's extremely useful for allowing you to write without the distraction of fiddly program features. That said, there's a lot to recommend it to gamers and writers alike.\n\nPROS\n+ Beautiful artwork. Like absolutely stunning.\n+ Great prompts-- just enough to get you thinking if you need them, but without guiding you too much\n+ Export option-- love the ability to export your stories, though only as HTML\n\nCONS\n- Too short! Needs many more worlds, with more complexity\n- No spell check\n- Space available for writing is limited to 1000 characters per prompt-- definitely not enough when you're on a roll!\n- No ability to export as a simple word or txt document\n- Atmospheric sounds are good, but repetitive (and loud!)\n\nWhat I would dearly love is a game that expands on the worlds available by tenfold, and that gives a more comprehensive writing program with adjustable capabilities.\n\nSUGGESTIONS (just in case the devs ever want to expand or someone wants to make a similar program)\n\n* Add a lot more worlds\n* Spell check during edit mode\n* Quick access to each prompt area on a world from the end menu, with short previews of each prompt text (so that users don't have to read through each area chronologically to find where they want to edit).\n* Include a manual save option so that we can simply press, say, f11 to save without closing the prompt box\n* Unlock the word limit for each prompt area\n* Allow users to import music from their hard drive into a "writing playlist" (like Zen Writer) to use when they don't want to listen to the in-game music/sounds.\n* On-Screen volume control\n* Export to text document option","March 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It intrigued me as a writing prompt with incredible images, beautiful and captivating settings, and interesting outlines to fill in with stories. In practice it's somewhat interesting but there isn't a lot of reason to utilize the game in order to write*. It's a nice looking game, and does it it sets out to do. While I recommend it, I don't think it's something that I'll return to very often. I'd rather just write without the use of this game.\n\n*As a side note, and has been pointed out in the discussion threads, the developers really missed a great chance to get more people writing by including three impossible achievements instead of smaller ones that people may have actually pursued. Receiving 1000 upvotes across ten stories requires an awful lot of participation from the fans of a game that is about writing and, not reading. Sure, you want to share your stories with people, and you want people to read the stories and such created within the game but that number is absurd. There are a great many better ways that the achievements could have been implemented to engage the player base in a way that would prompt participation - completing stories using each of the prompts, sharing your stories or other's stories on social media, upvoting, or even running a writing contest using the game as an engine. Unfortunately none of that is realized and the game is unfortunately, much like the shells of the civilizations you explore in-game, left empty and lifeless.","March 17","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The majority of the reviews are extremely positive, and I love to write. If my expectations were a bit too high, well.. Sorry.\n\nActual Gameplay: Lacking. Honestly, I was extremely excited when I first saw this. I started it up, and saw an impressive starting point. I seemed as though I was floating around in a nebula, with a jetpack to propel me where I wanted to go. 'Whoa.' Was pretty much my first thought. Then I jumped into a wormhole/portal and got down to the writing part. It turns out, it just shows you a 3D-ish landscape in which you can move forwards and backwards. Around the place are little 'Prompts' that start you off with a few words. You are supposed to continue on from these promts, or if you are unhappy with what they said, you can change it. Personally, I found that it felt like a joke. "And here is a church where the worshipped-" and you were supposed to fill it in. Another example: "Here is a school were children were taught-" Again, continue on. If you read through other peoples work, then you would see random words jumbled together, or lackluster 'Poetry'. This bothered me, as I'm a stickler for grammar, flow, and spelling.\n\nOver all, the game is decent, but it felt like a joke in my opinion.                                                                         -Silver\n\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bentsea/recommended/252290/","bentsea","Ralph Ellison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bentsea/","723 products in account","I really deeply wanted to love this game. The very idea of writing as I progress and cooperatively creating a narrative with the world in a way that is more meaningful than simply interpreting the game world internally or writing about it afterward is amazing and speaks to me very personally. So regardless of being unable to recommend this game to the audience I imagined it was for, I do want to say that the idea was amazing, and that I very much wish there were more to this.\n\nElegy for a Dead world does stand out as a teaching tool. You move slowly through superficial environments and are frequently given prompts to fill in the blanks, or if you choose to write entirley free form whenever and wherever you feel moved to do so. If I had kids, I'd love to have them play this and I'd love to play this with them as an exercise in exploring art mutually. However, as a solo exercise, this game lacks any ability to look deeper or to try to understand the environments and doesn't offer any rewarding exploration. There is no interaction with the world and no capacity to interact with the environments, so all interpretation is done from affar and entirely superficially.\n\nBecause of this, Elegy for a Dead world totally fails as a vehicle for exercising curiosity. It lays the burden of creation entirely on the player rather than putting the effort to create cooperatively with the player. It gives nothing but a pretty landscape and leaves you wanting to touch and inspect what lays around you while asking you to tell it what you see. There is a ton of potential here which is very much unrealized. I hope that someone does much more with it in the future.\n\nThere is an audience for this, however it does not extend far beyond the normal audience for basic educational games. The sad thing is that it very much could have.","December 16, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You will take on the task of writing the stories of this Dead World. You can either take on pre-created stories with fill in the blanks, or you can strike out on your own in several different areas and create a masterpiece with only your mind as the guide.\n\nGraphically you are given a soft and colorful world, devoid of any body, minus you. There are several different areas that you will be interacting with, and each piece can be the key to the next part of your story. If you are going the pre-created story route you will notice writing quill symbols appear where the next part of the story will take place. You will also be presented with a side scrolling flow, which is fitting since you need a beginning, middle, and an end. The really nice thing though is that there are different levels in the scenery, so there's a feeling of depth to the worlds that you will be walking through. To guide you along your journey you will be walking a person in a suit through the areas. To be honest weakest piece of this entire experience is the person that you will be controlling, especially when it comes to time to write something into the story, the arm just doesn't seem to act the way it should on the being, but serious that's about it for weakness.\n\nSince you will be penning much if not all of the story there's not going to be any voices to work with, unless of course you want to lend your voice as you type the story out (but of course that will be just for you, there's not option to record voices). There is, however, music, and it is truly haunting. I believe its that way to help add to the atmosphere of where you are, and allow you to think about what the next piece of the story will be.\n\nThe controls are quickly explained to you, you are going to be moving from left to right, and you will need to hit tab to enter a writing piece. You will also need to press up in you want to go into structures, or down into different areas.\n\nYou might have noticed that I've been shying away from the term game because this, to me, isn't a game, its a tool, and experience, that definitely deserves some attention. This is really a writer's sandbox. Sure there's a couple of boundaries you can't really break out of, the setting, and the overall theme (all though I'm sure if you really put your mind to it you could change the theme to whatever you want it to be). I've written a couple of stories, and to be completely honest every time I finish one I'm ready to write another. The experiences I have within these worlds stirs up my creative juices and I feel like I have to get more words out.\n\nNow that being said if you don't like reading and writing when you don't have to, then this is definitely not for you, but for those who want to see where your creativity can take you, you have to try this out. Seriously, I was a little hesitant when I heard about Elegy for a Dead World, and wondered how well it would allow me to write my own stories, but after going through the pre-created stories, I have to say that I'm not only impressed but blown away. The greatest thing is that it digitally publishes your work to their own little cloud where others can read it and then comment on it. It also gives you a story book form where people don't have to traverse the world to read your story, but do get what you are trying to convey through words and pictures of the area where you wrote pieces of the story.\n\nI truly hope that this takes off and that stories come pouring out of this. I would like to see more worlds to put my stories into, but as it is, this is definitely something that I highly recommend. This EASILY gets a 9.3 out of 10.","January 5, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just having used some of the starter prompts I found myself getting carried away with jotting down some drabble, much less imagining the free writing mode.\n\nThat said I think this game could use something a little more, namely a little more in the way of backgrounds. While scarcity and pressure can be the seat of art, this is a game. Much as one can update the words for stories written and published here (and in many self publishing venues), one can update the electronics here. I would think adding a few more worlds with their own prompts would make all the difference here.\n\nThat said as it is Elegy for a Dead World is an amazing experience, I think just about every gamer should at least challenge themselves to try this, especially younger gamers so they can understand what they can do with their creative writing (which is to say just about anything).

The only reason I am here on Steam is because of Elegy for a Dead World.\n\nI will first describe my motivations behind the said-sole reason a little bit, before I share about my experiences in the game and what I think of it.\n\nAs a writer and casual gamer, I was absolutely thrilled to discover this game some months back. A game where one can write?? Who knew that writing and gaming would one day be so elegantly combined?\n\nI wanted it so much that it was at the top of my wishlist from the moment I read about its existence. I waited patiently until I had the right time to do whatever I needed to do to get my hands on the game. Install Steam, even though I never had plans to do so previously. Purchase Elegy for a Dead World, even though I had never purchased any games or in-game purchases. This was the game that would make me change my plans.\n\nAnd was the plunge worth it? Oh hell yeah.\n\nI loved the gorgeous visuals that greeted me when the game launched. I chose to enter Keats' world, and I was not dissapointed. It was simply breathtaking, so beautiful that I explored so slowly, just to soak in the views, notice all the little details.  The audio crept up on me, mysterious, subtle, haunting, but never too overwhelming, which helps to evoke the atmosphere of the world. All these little things add up to create a richly-inspiring landscape, which is very helpful to writing if you ask me.\n\nBut the best bit was, of course, the writing. I was surprised to find that there are several types of prompts to choose from, which would definitely allow me to revisit the same world multiple times, because different sets of prompts would inspire completely different tales in my head. One of the choice of freeform writing is fantastic too. Even though I really appreciated the prompts triggering my imagination and creativity, I like knowing that I do have the choice to use the freedom to write whatever I want in that world.\n\nMy first try was to fill in the blanks at Keats' world. Not only did I enjoy the act of writing a tale inspired by such a breathtaking setting, my brain was already coming up with ongoing streams of ideas even before I received each prompt. The prompts were at first surprising, but I went with the challenge to create a tale that was shaped by both the prompts and my own words. I was again delightfully surprised to learn that I could edit the given prompts too, which further spurred my creativity as I played with various ideas and phrases until I was satisfied. This took me approximately one and half hours as I crafted and then refined my story.\n\nSuffice to say, it was a real treat, happiness and satisfaction swelling in me as I finished that first story. I have since went back to Keats' world for a second visit using a different set of prompts. I still have several other ideas to write about that place. My plan is to try all the different prompts, and then attempt the freeform writing, and possibly go back for yet another try if I want to. I will do this slowly, over the weeks and months to come. I have yet to even touch Byron's and Shelley's world. I expect the other two worlds to be no doubt as breathtaking and inspiring as Keats', serving as the springboard to many more tales.\n\nOh, and gameplay has been quite smooth. No major glitches. As long as I can write without disruptions, I am happy.\n\nOne thing I will say about this game is that while it has been an enjoyable ride, I don't think it is for everybody. The reason why I enjoy it so much is because I derive a lot of pleasure from writing. My internal drive to write is why the gorgeous visuals and mysterious audio only added to the richness of the scene before my eyes, amplifying my enjoyment of the writing experience. How could I not enjoy the writing process when I could get inspiration in spades from this game? There are also, of course, some who will greatly benefit from the breathtaking visuals as a starting point and be inspired to write about it. But I doubt that everyone will enjoy the writing process as much.\n\nIf you're the type to glance at a scene and want to move on to something different within a short period of time, this might not be the game for you. But if you're the type who could marvel and admire a richly detailed scene for a long time, or if you're the type who could come back to the same scene to discover something new every time, then I would recommend Elegy for a Dead World. And if you like writing or plan to try it, I would also recommend this game.\n\nIt has been a rewarding journey so far, and I have just started. I cannot wait to see my future tales unfold in the three amazingly breathtaking worlds. I don't know the final forms of the stories, but I'm damn sure that I will find inspiration every time I visit one of the worlds.","December 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
