Yes, I was using the CD Key.  SecureRom does not accept the CD Key given to me by Steam.  I used both the "Copy to Clipboard" method as well as writing it down and keying it in manually to attempt to activate my game.  Neither method work.  I get the same Activation Failed issue.  The SERIAL was not found in the database.  Most likely the SERIAL has been entered incorrectly.  I"ve contacted Steam - they say contact SecureRom - I contacted SecureRom, they say Steam gave wrong key.\n\nI sent screenshots to Steam of my key and error pages and they say its a valid key, but neither company is willing to correct the problem. Honestly, I purchased this game from Steam, I expected them to either assist in fixing issue or refund my money so I can get the game off my library list (I was hoping to try to purchase/download a new version with a new code) but can't download another if it is in my library. So, no Age of Booty to play.\n\nNOTE:  by repeatedly downloading and trying to install this game, I've noticed that STEAM counts that as "Played" Time so my attempts today at trying yet again, added more time to what is displayed as Played.  Be careful with that NEW STEAM REFUND:  refunds only with < 2hours "Played" time.","June 25, 2014","false","0.7"," 328 of 353 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","328","353","0","8"

Yes, you can't play the multiplayer part, tho, but right upper the "Add to Cart-Button" is a Note, that says, that the multiplayer is not working and the game only supports single player mode.\n\nTo the game itself:\nI've just finished all of the 21 challenges and thats enough for a game that cost me just .99 Pens.\nYe' arrrrre a Pirrrrrrate an' have to capture towns. In each Challenge you will fight against other Opponents, Sometimes you're alone with your ship and there are 3 other Factions you have to battle against for the Towns and Resources.\n\nThe Resources are gold, trees and grog/ale/mead.\nYou need the gold to build on captured town to an Stronghold with 2 Town upgrades for each town.\nWhen an Enemy captures your town the upgrades just vanish for the enemy and for you, so if you re-capture the town\nthe town will start at defense-level 0 again.\n\nThe grog is for ship upgrades, like power of your cannons, speed and armor (self-explaining).\n\nI recommend this game for people who wants to play some funny game for a little break.\n\nYaarrrr, an' ye' forgot t' tak' ye Grog!\n\n███████████████████████████\n███████▀▀▀░░░░░░░▀▀▀███████\n████▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀████\n███│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│███\n██▌│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│▐██\n██░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░██\n██░░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░░██\n██░░┌┘▄▄▄▄▄░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄└┐░░██\n██▌░│██████▌░░░▐██████│░▐██\n███░│▐███▀▀░░▄░░▀▀███▌│░███\n██▀─┘░░░░░░░▐█▌░░░░░░░└─▀██\n██▄░░░▄▄▄▓░░▀█▀░░▓▄▄▄░░░▄██\n████▄─┘██▌░░░░░░░▐██└─▄████\n█████░░▐█─┬┬┬┬┬┬┬─█▌░░█████\n████▌░░░▀┬┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┬▀░░░▐████\n█████▄░░░└┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┘░░░▄█████\n███████▄░░░░░░░░░░░▄███████\n██████████▄▄▄▄▄▄▄██████████\n███████████████████████████","June 29, 2015","true","5.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Single player game can be quite frustrating as you depend heavily on AI to cooperate with you, and it probably won't requiring many trials to win even easy maps.\nUnfortunately multiplayer was heavily damaged by GameSpy shutdown, and the game feels broken if you're not authenticated on a server, as you can't even use the map editor. Also, the best part of this game is the multiplayer, and that will require a third party server to authenticate. Do not buy the game unless you're savvy enough to use a GameSpy emulator. I used qtracker with my friends and we played smoothly over LAN. It worked great, we had great fun. Totally worth the R$ 1.69 and the fiddling to make it work on a different server.","May 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are simple but the game is entertaining.  I know others have had problems getting the game to run, so be careful - I did not have any trouble.  It is a bit simple for my tastes, so I tend to play other games, but I keep thinking I should come back to play this one for a while.  I like the simplicity of roaming the seas, capturing and holding ports, and generally just taking over the map.  It is real time, but has elements similar to board games.  You can spend resources to upgrade your ship or the defenses of individual ports.  There are some team maps where you are partnered with AI team mates.","March 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game itself is what you expect. It is not the greatest game out there by far, but I purchased it for one dollar so i am not upset at all. The big thing i read was that the game does not work. I started the game up, typed my 16 digit key code in and the game started up. It asked to type it again and the game started right up. I plundered the first mission and won. The game seems very short, especially since the online is no more. For the price I paid, and the game DOES work, it was worth it.

However, the control settings when setting up a Multiplayer game does not work well on PC.  The Slider bars hare not well implemented in this game - it needs to be patched and fixed, but that's unlikely to ever happen.  The other downside is Gamespy-enabled matchmaking.

I wouldn't say it's worth the full $4.99, but opinions vary. You control a pirate ship and along with your ally ships (who you do not control), you try to take most/all of the towns on the map, depending on the victory requirements. Neutral ships carry curses, which are similar to spells in Age of Mythology. Curses can send a whirpool under an enemy ship, plunder resources from the enemy, and other effects. You manage three resources -- Gold, Wood, and Ale. These are needed to upgrade your ship. Cannons, Speed, and Armor can be upgraded. Your towns can also be improved to help defend themselves, and this becomes more important to tip the balance in your favor on harder maps.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable game for casual strategy fans. I have not attempted multiplayer, and have had no trouble with the DRM like other reviews.","December 28, 2013","true","5.0"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Computer started acting odd; getting problems the same day.  Found out it has SECUREROM copy protection in the game, even if you buy it through Steam.\n\nI would HIGHLY suggest not purchasing.\n","May 26, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Isn't even worth 50 cents, as the multiplayer is COMPLETELY DISABLED. There is no way to even play LAN games. IGNORE THIS TITLE!!","July 28, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, you read that correctly, changing the resolution of the game is most fun I had in 'Age of Booty'.\n\nSince the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, you're -- yes you, reading this! -- in luck because you don't have the luxury of wasting hard earned money on this title.\nI on the other hand did waste my green on it & have set-up a Go Fund Me account to recoup my losses on purchasing this absolute piece of garbage software.\n\nYou can find my Go Fund Me at: https://www.gofundme.com/givemebackmymoneyyougamespyporkpies\n\nPlease give me your money so I feel better, Cheers!","May 7","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
