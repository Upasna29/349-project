The last game that came out before this one came out when I was eight years old and we didn't even own a computer at that point in time, so I was completely clueless about the series before getting it in my library. I read about and thought it sounded interesting and like a relatively quick game so I downloaded it first to give it a try.\n\nI am so happy that I did. It is so much fun and now I definitely want to check out the rest of the serious when I have some extra money. It was funny and kept my interest for the entire time it took me to finish it. Of course there were things I didn't understand and there were several call backs to the other games in the series that meant almost nothing to me but they weren't a vital part of the game and it didn't really take away from gameplay. It was a nice little insight into the series and a brilliant ploy to make me want to buy more.\n\nThe game feels dated. It's graphics aren't the best and who really used FMV like that anymore? But that's the beauty of it. Tex is an old-fashioned man in the future and this game is much the same. To be honest, it's refreshing. There are actual characters in this game, not just flashy designs to distracts you from how boring everyone is.\n\nOf course being a puzzle game, it can become an exercise in frustration. I played on gamer mode which disabled all of the hints and the ability to skip puzzles. Some of the objects you have to find are ridiculously small and without the flashlight hint it can take awhile to find them amongst all the background clutter. And  the last puzzle of the game is enough to make you want to tear your hair out. But in general, I enjoyed the game all the way through.","November 13, 2014","true","11.7"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","0"

I also had no idea who Tex Murphy is. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and can hardly wait to get my hands onto other similar games.\n\nThis game just left me thinking why on Earth it isn't more popular. It's got all the right ingredients: lots of jokes and humorous lines (puns and "dad jokes" all over, enjoyable even when cheesy or goofy), a quite interesting storyline (a bit childish at points but still decent), intricate puzzles for those looking for a challenge that can be quickly turned into reasonable puzzles for those that prefer a more relaxed approach, and best of all, the FMV part!... Nowadays there's no way a CGI-designed character (NPC or whatever) could look anywhere close to real humans played by actors. And this makes the game so immersive and captivating. Yeah, the acting is a bit awkward here and there, but I wasn't expecting Oscar performances anyway. And some characters are actually well-played (and I loved Jodi Russell's smile - the actress playing Taylor Lamintz). The overall graphic quality was pretty good as well. The hint (Smart Alex) system is well-done too. There are even multiple endings based on the choices you made throughout the game.\n\nI guess the only left to blame is the lack of attention and care from the publisher. They could've add some features like steam achievements, steam trading cards, some leaderboards, they could've made some proper ad campaigns and whatnot. I mean, it's quite a shame this game is rather obscure at the moment. I know it needed a kickstarter campaign to be funded and become reality, and I know it's a game that mostly claims to be made "for gamers and not for money", but still... And yeah, it's as cool as this trailer depicts it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fhaoi5_P4\n\nSimply put, Tesla Effects gets straight to my favorites.","February 10, 2015","true","16.7"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","50","53","4","1"

Add 3 points if you are a fan of Tex Murphy, you like FMVs or you plan to play this on casual mode otherwise steer clear.\n\nThere are two difficulties in the game, Casual and Gamer, my impressions are from playing the game in Gamer, in my opinion this game was made with Casual in mind.\n\nThis is a "point and click" adventure game that sadly is full to the brim with two particular adventure game tropes; item & pixel hunting.\n\nAlmost EVERY puzzle of this game is about finding out of place items, particularly small ones.\nIt gets very frustrating, specially when a particular section requires you to literally hunt tiny broken pieces to assemble a symbol and STILL every other puzzle afterwards is the same "find hidden items in the environment" until the end.\n\nUnlike other adventure games before it, puzzles don't have two or more ways to solve and they don't particularly require much deduction to figure them out, either you have that screwdriver or you haven't found it.\n\nThe game becomes more of a visual novel if you play it in casual mode, since your flashlight will highlight items in the environment and you can skip puzzles.

I've been a fan of Tex Murphy adventures since Mean Streets (coincidentally one of the first PC games I played). I loved Martian Memorandum, Under a Killing Moon, Pandora's Directive and Overseer. They all drew me in with their story line. This one does NOT disappoint. The narrative pathing (i.e., different endings based on decisions you make in the game) are great. The game play is fun, but if you hate puzzles, I recommend the Casual Gamer mode so you can skip the puzzles if you want. And there are quite a few brain-teasing puzzles. Thankfully, the only one I got stuck on (a sliding puzzle) was not mandatory to complete the game.\n\nMy only real complaint is that you can go entire hours without having a situation where you can die, so you're constantly moving around and clicking on stuff without fear. Then all of a sudden, there's something that can kill you and you walk right up to it without the game making you aware (you have to actually click on it for the game to tell you that it can kill you). This only matters if you care about reaching the highest award the game offers as a Detective. Other than that, you can die as many times without repercussion.\n\nPros:\n-Great story line, must see/play!\n-Puzzles can be fun\n\nCons:\n-Can get frustrating trying to solve a puzzle (I recommend Googling a guide if you get stuck)\n-Can get frustrating trying to find a missing object (again, Google a guide if you get stuck)\n-Some of the puzzles are so complicated that you need to Google just how to complete them (Auxiliary Power reactor puzzle was one of them I did not understand how to work)\n-Can die without notice.\n-Not much replay value.

I did not play previous games back then, so this is a newcomer review.\n\nThe idea of playing the role of a private detective in a cyberpunk world with a bit of humor is interesting, but the game has its flaws.\n\n- First of all, there are many reminiscences to previous games. They are supposed to touch the hearts of the series veterans, but looked out of place for me. The same can be said about most of the game - many things feel out of place (for example you are in a cyberpunk city, ok, and then you're solving ancient Egyptian puzzles all of a sudden) but I heard it has this cheesy feeling on purpose since all the games were designed like this. Not a design I like, but whatever.\n\n- The story was also a bit hard to follow for me, a couple of times I struggled to understand what I just uncovered while Tex acted like it is clear as day for him. I don't think I could tell you the uncovered story from start to finish even if I wanted to. Perhaps it makes more sense to those who played previous games.\n\n- Graphics outside video sequences are so-so (Unity engine), but they are light years ahead of previous games of course. I don't think I have the strength of will to play the previous ones if navigation there is represented via static images like in old Myst.\n\nIn spite of these cons, I'd recommend this game if you like detective stories and adventures.\n\n+ FMV with real actors looks good in Full HD.\n\n+ Gameplay with finding clues and combining things is good if you like adventure games. Puzzles are manageable (I resorted to walkthrough just a couple of times, there is also a casual playing mode where you can skip puzzles if you don't like them).\n\n+ There are multiple endings, too bad I didn't get the things as I wanted In the end (so-so ending without love and such). Choices that lead you to one or another are rather obscure (this is not so good).\n\nOverall, I recommend playing it if you like point-and-click adventures and don't mind the cheesy setting. For veterans of the series it is a must buy I presume.\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","2"

You play as Tex Murphy, and intrepid detective who is trying\nto regain his memory.  The conversation and the story move forward in a linear\nmanner, and while you have different responses that you can give, there is little\nimpact on the base outcome.\nThe story and the voice acting are done very well, and while the\nhumorous undertones are entertaining, this would almost be a game that is more\nenjoyable to watch as a Let's Play rather than to go through yourself.  It\ncomes accross as more of a movie than a game.\nThe player has a limited interaction with the environment, and some of\nthe puzzles are more simplistic such as scavenger hunts rather than puzzles\nthat challege your intellect.  There was no failure state in the game; combined\nwith the auto save, this means that even if you make the wrong decision and\n"die", there is no problem because the game will just reload at the most recent\nsave spot.\nIt's not a bad game, just heavy in cinematics, and limited in what\nchoices you can make and in what order.

The story is pretty good too, and the acting seems to have improved.  It's is based on an old Tex Murphy novel that begins right at the end of Overseer.  To explain the plot would be to give away the small twist thats right at the beginning of the story.  Suffice to say, the mythology is based on Tesla's work.\n\nUnfortunately they also brought back the scavenger hunts from the old games that really make it not so fun to play.  When you finally give in the towel on a puzzle and look up the solution, only to find you missed something laying under a newspaper that was supposed to look like a wheel, behind a building with absolutely no hint that it was there, it makes the game not so much fun.  Now you realize you have to scan every single inch of every single location to make sure you haven't missed any inventory items.\n\nEven with the magic flash light that makes things you can interact with sparkle, it's only slightly more bearable.  Primarily because the sparkles don't show up very well in the flashlights beam.\n\nAlso there are some puzzles in the form of simple brain teasers that seemed very out of place and lazily thrown in just to have a game with more puzzles.  Today's games have puzzles that are organic to the story.  Tex Murphy still lives in a world where people throw in Magic 15 puzzles to lock doors.\n\nSo if you liked the old Tex Murphy games, I would recommend this.  Just make sure you play on casual so you can use the hint system and even then, you might want to keep a walkthrough handy.","September 27, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Tesla Effect carries the same spirit and feel as the rest of the Tex series. It’s like no time has passed. All the awful goofy jokes are all there and Tex is as Tex as Tex can get. Seeing Chandler Ave in hi-res modern graphics made me deliriously happy and all the references to past games are enough to make a long time fan of the games tear up a little. Even the new characters to the series are a joy to interact with and get to know (and having Kevin Murphy in your pocket is absolutely AMAZING). There were one or two gory moments and some rather dark elements, I didn’t mind but they were a bit jarring when brought about. I’ve been a fan of the series for about 7 years and I’m very happy with this addition to the series.","September 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Some of them are great, others – not so much. The main thing why this game is unique is real actors acting in front of the green screen during cut scenes and dialogues. It gives some kind of old school vibe to the game. The story is kind of strange and I can see that not everyone is going to like it.\nSometimes it's very hard to spot the object with which you have to interact, so I'd recommend playing on casual mode – it will show sparkles around those kind of objects when you point your flashlight at them. I played on the harder mode and, I admit, I had to check a couple of playthrough videos on YouTube in order to continue.","November 28, 2015","true","11.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Yet this is exactly what makes this game so charming. From the camera angles, to the uneven (even amateur) acting, where a lot of times it feels like you are watching a fan-made Star Trek movie on Youtube, to the cheesy storyline/telling should made the player cringe at this day and age. But when all of those are lumped together, you can't help but feel it's very charming, down-to-earth and unpretentious in its presentation. With a budget of only about a million dollars, it has produced 5+ hours of FMV and another 8-10 hours of actual gameplay AND a branching storyline, and charge half of what a AAA title cost, you certainly cannot fault the producer for trying very hard to dedicate this game for its fans.\n\nGranted in terms of an actual point and click adventure game, the difficulty is not very hard, most puzzles are designed so that you will not get stuck and in general the clues are logical and not too out of place. The only downside is the few section where "stealth" is required to progress, they are certainly a low point for the game as they are lackluster for a FPS gamer and irrelevant/pointless to an adventure gamer.\n\nThis game where the majority of the funding came through Kickstarter is made for the fans. If you do not enjoy adventure games or one that doesn't understand the charm of B-movie level FMV, this game is definitely not for you. But if you have even remotely enjoyed games like King's/Police Quest, Sam & Max, Gabriel Knight, Phanstamgoria or Tex Murphy series itself, you will certainly enjoy this little gem and see for yourself what a FMV game in the 90s could be like if it is made today.","November 19, 2014","true","12.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

The puzzles are all challenging enough to be fun, but not so hard as to be frustrating. The dialogue and acting is always entertaining and well done, and the story is quite engrossing with an interesting mystery at its center.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that, at some points, the game tries to be something it's not. There is one terribly executed stealth section, one area where you constantly have to watch your step to avoid proximity mines, and an area where u have to run faster than flying electro-balls that will kill you on touch if you want to survive. All these don't actually add challenge or thrill as the developers may have thought, but instead they just get in the way of what's actually fun about the game. Thankfully, there aren't many of these sections, and the penalty for death is simply losing a few points that don't matter anyway.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who enjoys a well written game, clever puzzles and the whole noir atmosphere.","August 25, 2015","true","8.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Playing Tesla Effect, I kept thinking--man, we are REALLY missing out by not having more FMV in modern games. Live actors, especially likable ones with a good script to work with, add so much emotional depth to a game that just can't be delivered via 3D models. Furthermore, the FMV is integrated here very smoothly into the gameplay, and even when the segments run long, you're so invested in the story that you don't feel the game is playing itself.\n\nI guess the game won't appeal to everyone, but I am very happy to have found it. I played it through to the end without ever feeling bored or frustrated. Furthermore, all of the nods to the older Tex Murphy games (they include a lot of the footage from those games in the forms of flashbacks) have whetted my appetite to try them out, too.\n\nThis game is more focused on story and characters than Myst or Riven and the like. It's also helpfully broken into "days," which you can get through in an hour or less if you don't have all day to play. The dseigners also did a good job providing you with just enough areas to explore and options to try that you don't get overwhelmed, yet still feel that you're the one solving the case.\n\nIn short, I really enjoyed this game and highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventures. One thing's for sure--if I ever see a new Tex Murphy game on Steam, I'm buying or pre-ordering that baby. This game would've been well worth paying full price and then some.\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","12.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

ESPECIALLY if you like noir.  This is an amazing adventure game.  I adored Under a Killing Moon when I was younger, and this game is a wonderful update to that formula.\n\nDon't like the 'FMV' tag fool you; this game is NOT a "click to watch the movies play" game.  The cutscenes are FMV, as are the conversations, but the vast majority of the game is an adventure game.  You walk around the world and explore, talking to people, collecting items, and solving puzzles.\n\nI've missed really good games like this so much.  There's a few modern series that do the adventure game well (like the Blackwell games), but there's something MISSING from those games that Tex Murphy has.  I'm absolutely not saying they're bad, not at all, but this is something greater.  Something I've been missing for years.\n\nThe game does have nostalgia value, but it stands on its own very well.  The environments look nice and there's plenty to explore.  The acting is a bit goofy and corny, but that's part of the fun.   Tex is supposed to be a "lovable ♥♥♥♥♥."  The plot is serious, but the setting lapses into silliness at times, and I love that.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who likes adventure games.\n\nNote: I recommend playing on "gamer" mode, so that you don't get magic sparkles around plot items.  It's much more rewarding to figure things out on  your own.","May 7, 2014","true","12.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I never got to finish any of the games however, as CD-ROMs weren't very reliable back then and "compatability issues" entered common vernacular.  I looked up the series on steam in hopes that I could play some of the old games (I can!!) but when I saw there was a new game, I had to download it right away.  It was everything I hoped for.  I think I can appreciate it more now as an adult, since I'm sure most of the humor went over my head 15 years ago.  The game has complex puzzles but nothing that's going to stump you enough to give up.   Chandler looks exactly as I remembered it, and it was fun seeing old characters pop up (and some new ones!)  Old fans of the series should definitely buy this, and I think this is a good game for people who want to try something new.

The acting can be a bit cheesy at times but it's part of the game's charm. Everything is in line with the film noir genre that the games pulls it's roots from.\n\nThere's a whole lot of cinematics in this game but the adventure gaming part is also fully present. the game plays from a first person perspective and the controls will feel familiar to any modern gamer. (It's worth mentioning that the controls can't be remapped from the defaults.) I felt at ease with the controls within minutes, although some parts of the UI can be a bit clunky at times. The 3D environment feels a bit dated but it doesn't detract from the gameplay.\n\nThe storyline is a classic Tex Murphy adventure and pretty much picks up where Overseer left off. Returning players will feel at home back on Chandler's Avenue, but the story is being told in a way that newcomers won't feel lost from not playing the previous games. The grand theme and tongue-in-cheek humor will reel you in. Most puzzles can be solved with a bit of logic but a small number of them seems a bit nonsensical. There were also a few places where hot spots could be tricky but nothing that would put anyone off.\n\nThe game takes about 12 hours to complete, but branching storylines and multiple endings means there's some good replay value in this.\n\nIf you're a fan of the previous Tex Murphy titles, then it's a no-brainer. You need this game! Anyone not familiar with the series, but with a liking for good adventure games should also consider this little gem. Let's only hope it doesn't take another 16 years before we see another one.","May 11, 2014","true","13.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

I stumbled onto it because I was looking for a retro type FMV game after enjoying a game called "Her Story". This did not disappoint. The FMV scenes are laughably bad (in a good way) and playing a 1940's style private detective fits perfectly with the cheesy acting and dialogue. While the game has a retro feel, it also has many modern conveniences such as: being able to instantly skip puzzles that are too difficult or convoluted and being able to teleport directly to key locations. While some of the puzzles were difficult, I never felt like they were unfair or too random. Anytime that I skipped a puzzle, I always had a "Oh sh*t, I should have thought of that " moment. Would def recommend this to anyone who gamed in the 90's or is just looking for a cool retro style game without retro style crappy controls and puzzles.

Let me start off by quoting your exact thoughts: "What the hell is this game, how did I get on this store page and what on earth am I doing here? Do I own this? Why?" Well. Please read on, because that's exactly what I thought. This might just be the next best thing in your library.\n\n\nI came into this game, not knowing what to expect at all. I had bought just another Humble Bundle, and this game happened to be in there. I selected one of the titles which had a pretty interesting name. Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure.\n\nI had absolutely no idea what kind of game this was going to be, and then I looked at the screenshots. They looked like actual photo's, or videos. Interesting. Decided to give it a go and download it. Booted it up, and man I was hooked.\n\nThe game just keeps hitting you with witty remarks, thinks that break the fourth wall, but in a good way. Heck, here's an example. When examaning a wall in this game, at one point Tex says "Is this the fourth wall? Because I don't want to break it." It's just plain hilarious, and yet interesting. I love point-and-click adventures, and this takes it a step further.\n\nAt first however, I was not at all impressed with the quality of the game. I loved the dialogue, but the acting and whatnot from pretty much any actor other than Tex, felt out of place. However, the story was intruiging enough to keep me playing, and I gotta say, it was worth it. After a while I got accustomed and didn't even mind the acting; here and there it's bad, sure, but it's got it's own vibe.\n\nThis game is so refreshing from any other game I've played. I would absolutely recommend you checking this game out. You won't regret it.","July 2, 2015","true","10.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

I've had to collect 7 objects by hunting around the game's environments to unlock a door 3 times now, and have discovered how much more annoying pixel hunting can be if you're doing it in a 3D space.\n\nAll that said, Tex Murphy is definitely the most fun I've had with an adventure game in recent memory.

This game is in the spirit of all of the Tex Murphy games, especially the final 3, but updated with 21st Century technology. It's amazing what you get for $20 (that's release date price!)\n\nThere are over 5 hours of cinematography (green screen, real actors), packed full of punch lines while still telling a serious, complex story. For the puzzle-lovers, there is plenty of that in here as well. If you hate puzzles, you can go on Casual mode which allows you to skip them for a lower score.\n\nThis game also has replayability. Periodically, you are prompted to choose one of 3 dialog options. Over time, your dialog options have an effect on the game and cinematics. There are 3 different game paths, and 5 different endings.\n\nThe cinematography with the actors is the highest quality I have ever seen--movie or game. You can clearly see someone as it would look if they were looking at you face-to-face, it is that detailed. They used double HD resolution (HD is 1080p; they used 2160p). That said, the game should run on a moderate-end system -- there are graphics settings you can tweak if needed.\n\nIf you get stuck (on Casual mode), an in-game help system is available, again at the cost of a lower score. If you don't want to be tempted by hints and wish to go hard-core, you can choose to play on Gamer mode, though!\n\nIt is not necessary to have played other games in the series. There are throw-back references (and some throw-back videos cleverly presented as flashbacks), but you can follow the story well if you just ignore those. That said, if you do decide you want to explore the rest of the series, they are available on GoG.\n\nThe only mildly disappointing thing is that some of the rendered environments (when not in the cinematography) are a bit worse than typical games these days. This is to be expected for a kickstarter game with a budget of well under $1 million and only a few people to devote to graphics, and it certainly looks like it's 21st century technology, just that it's about 5 years old. But it's easy to forgive that considering the cinematography, story, multiple paths, and price of only $20.\n\nThis game is my easiest recommendation of a new game to give -- the value for the dollar is higher than I've seen in a new release in a long time. Thumbs up without any reservations! Why are you still reading this review? You should have already bought it and be firing up the game!","May 10, 2014","true","36.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

That said, I will not do this game or the community a disservice by writing anything less than a fully honest review. The game succeeds far more often than it fails, but is far from perfect, so I will not score it 10 out of nostalgia, or 0 out of disappointment.\n\nFirst, let me give this game a score out of ten. In my opinion, it falls somewhere around 7.5. I think this game will please Tex fans and newcomers alike, even if it isn't perfect. If you like a good story or adventure games, then check this one out. If you like it, I highly recommend trying out Tex's past adventures.\n\nLet me start by talking about what the game gets right. First and foremost is the story/cutscenes. Tex Murphy is definitely back and they hit the nail on the head, bringing the right balance of humour and drama to the story and protagonist. The story is a satisfying conclusion to the cliffhanger of Overseer and with multiple story paths and endings provides some good replayability. I have completed the game  twice and got two endings. One was near perfect, the other was mediocre, but easily avoided in the future. The characters in the game are mostly quite good, with some familiar faces returning to Chandler Ave, and a few new ones. I particularly like Mojo, the owner of one of the new establishments on the street.\n\nThe multiple paths and endings brings with it something new to Tex Murphy. Unlike The Pandora Directive, the path you choose will affect your ability to access several locations and will uncover different story elements. While these are all relatively small, most come with puzzles you won't get playing the game along another path. My only wish is that this was more pronounced than it was. The  gameplay is about 90% the same regardless of the path you're on.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from an adventure game: inventory and “logic” puzzles. While easier on this front than it's predecessors (more on this later), it was still fun. The atmosphere in several of the locations is excellent, particularly the last big location in the game, which manages to capture some of the atmospheric elements that made The Pandora Directive so good. The main musical theme of the game is also excellent.\n\nWhile all of these elements are good, they all fall a bit short of what they could have been, and keeps Tesla Effect from beating out Pandora or UAKM for best Tex Murphy game.\n\nWhile the story is quite good, it can feel a bit rushed or disjointed at times, like just a bit too much wound up on the cutting room floor. Sometimes you're thrown from one scene to the next with a bit of exposition in between – rather than returning control to you. You also can't visit locations whenever you want, even when there's no reason to disallow it – e.g. Why can't you return to the resort whenever you want, even if there is nothing to do there? This all gives the game a very linear feeling.\n\nWhile I noted that characters are mostly good, one in particular stands out as not: Smart Alex. Your new PDA sidekick (voiced by Kevin Murphy) feels out of place in a Tex adventure and is rarely very funny. Instead of hearing Tex's inner monologue, we're too frequently left hearing Smart Alex – this is of particular note during the death sequences. I miss Tex lambasting himself for violating PI rules, or calmly explaining that he was mauled to death by a pack of hungry coyotes (try breaking the alien abductor in Pandora for that one). All in all, I don't think this hurts the game too much, but it is part of what holds it back from being the Tex masterpiece I had been hoping for.\n\nWhile multiple paths are interesting, they seem to revolve exclusively around which woman Tex would like to romance, which is unfortunate. During the Kickstarter, it was promised that the three paths would be to find out what happened to Chelsee, uncover the truth about yourself, or find the people who were responsible for shooting you at the end of Overseer. I don't feel this was really delivered on. While the Chelsee path is there, the other two don't seem to be. It would have been more satisfying if the woman Tex ended up with was caused by which path you're on, not the other way around. Though Pandora's pathing was a bit too rigid (try getting the good or bad endings without a walkthrough – few people can), it was stronger as it relied on your actions as a whole (are you good to everyone, bad to everyone, etc.).\n\nAs I said earlier, the gameplay is a bit too easy. There are fewer logic puzzles in the game than in the past and not enough head-scratchers. Only for one or two puzzles did I feel the need to take out a pen and paper. Objects are also frequently too close to where they will be used. I assume this was to save players from wandering around, but to me that was part of what makes an adventure game an adventure game. I want to feel stumped, if even for a just a few minutes. With the full walkthrough system right in the game, this would have been possible without frustrating players who just want to move on. It would have also been nice if the “Gamer” difficulty (which doesn't let you access hints or bypass puzzles) had some differences that made it more challenging than the Casual difficulty setting.\n\nThe graphics are good, but certainly nothing to write home about. I don't really care, either. To me, graphics always take a back seat to everything else (unless they impact the gameplay somehow). That said, a few environments are a bit too empty, giving them an incomplete feel. The sewers are particularly uninteresting and made moreso by the fact that they are just a maze. Even in the more complete feeling areas (which is the majority, don't get me wrong), there are so few things for Tex to look at. One of the greatest things about the previous games were Tex's humourous comments about mundane things, but almost every location has too many things that can't be interacted with – things ranging from vending machines to hot tubs to miscellaneous stuff on a shelf can't be looked at, but all of these things would have been in any of Tex's previous adventures.\n\nIn summary – 7.5/10 :\n\nPros:\nGood story, with plenty of Tex humour\nGood cast of characters (mostly) with some excellent newcomers\nMultiple story paths and endings provide replayability\nSome good adventuring gameplay\nAtmospheric locations come close to matching Pandora's and UAKM's\n\nCons:\nSome story feels rushed or incomplete in a few places (not enough to seriously affect enjoyment, though)\nStory pathing relies too much on which woman Tex wants to be with\nGameplay is a bit too easy at times given that stumped players would have a hint system at their disposal\nSome sparse environments\nToo few items can be commented on by Tex\nSmart Alex","June 28, 2014","true","22.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game has an interesting story, well developed characters, especially the main protagonist Tex Murphy and thrilling asmophere that drawn me into the experience.\nFMV's are often making fun of, of how crappy they are and there comes a time when a game amazes you and this is the game.

As someone who never played or even heard about a Tex Murphy game, it makes you feel like you too have just forgoten like Tex. You fit right into the game never feeling like you missed something. Now that I have played it through I am now making my way through the other 5 games and I love every bit of them. Besides nostalgia, or even anti nostalgia, The game plays extramely well. Some puzzles can be a bit hard, but that's the point. The only one thin about it is that the graphics aren't up to date, but now playing the older ones, I wouldn't want them to be (I know it was a kickstarter and they only had so much budget).

I remember how outraged I felt after seeing that cliffhanger at the end of Overseer, and the subesequent hiatus in the series only served to further justify that anger. However, Tesla Effect makes up for the wait with its cinematic production quality (filmed in 2K video) and its solid classic FMV adventure-puzzle gaming experience. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into its development, and were anxious to please their fan base with a quality sequel that was highly improbable ever to happen, and yet greatly desired and made possible only with a wildly successful (by adventure gaming standards) Quickstarter campaign. Since watching the story unfold is one of the most satisfying parts of the gaming experience, I won't spoil it for anyone with further details, other than to say it has a multipath story with different possible endings based on your choices (akin to Pandora Directive). Fortunately, most of the actors were able to reprise their roles in this sequel. Overall, everyone really delivered the goods, which is a rarity in and of itself these days. Suffice it to say that veteran adventure gamers like myself, or anyone with a desire to see a good "interactive" story with puzzles will want to play this game. Best of all, it ends with a true sense of closure, with just an open-ended allusion to another possible sequel in the future. Please make another sequel possible by supporting this game with your friends, because this is the kind pf gaming experience we need to see more!","May 28","true","71.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Tex is back in a brand new adventure about 15yrs or so after the last game came out. This one is set 7yrs after the events of Overseer and Tex has lost his memory after some shady events went down at his apartment block. Now he has to get his memory back and find his girlfriend Chelsee which ends up drawing him into the world of Nicola Tesla and his disciples.\n\nAfter playing the original Tex games back in the 90s it was amazing to play this game and it doesn't disapoint for old fans. All the old characters are there and being back on Chandler Ave is like coming home. Not much has changed since those previous games. You still move around the world in a first person view, clicking on things, picking up objects, solving puzzles and questioning characters. When you trigger a cut scene or talk to a character the 3D world switches to FMV footage. This technique was all the rage for awhile back in the 90s but hasn't really been used since then until now. The team at Big Finish have done a really good job with the quality of the FMV here. It's hi-def, the acting is pretty good (in a Tex way) and it fits pretty seamlessly into the rest. As with all the prior Tex games the humour is a big part and it's still here. Gotta love those eye rolling Tex jokes.\n\nThe story is not bad, puzzles are pretty decent and gameplay is pretty easy to get a handle on. There were a couple of times in later sections of the game I found myself wandering around for ages trying to work out what to do next but I was playing on Gamer difficultly with no hints or guides. Luckily they also have a hint system and a Casual difficulty which will highlight objects if you get stuck.\n\nI've played this one through twice now and really enjoyed it. There is a team also working on remaking Overseer (the game that is a prequel to this one). Check out the site. www.thepoisonedpawn.com Will be looking forward to playing that one to.","May 25","true","25.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Worth every penny, and reason 4,592 that the metacritic model is absolute crap. Yes, I got it on sale, but it would still be very much worth your dollar at full price. I was introduced to the franchise a few years ago courtesy of GOG.com. Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon got me stoked for the franchise and may be the ideal place to start.\n\nThis is a very thoughtful, fully-realized game world where I want to spend time. The main reason is Chris Jones' stellar sense of humor, and his interactions with other cast members.\n\nThe game play is point-and-click, and there are puzzles with various levels of difficulty. I was pretty pleased with myself for figuring out the one where you have to activate the six power points. Nice little thrill there, after experiencing a a few minutes of despair looking at a seemingly-unsolvable puzzle. The only puzzle I skipped was the slidey puzzle over the fireplace. I guess it was late and I didn't feel like exerting my brain much. The hint system here is simplified. I kind of liked the old hints/points system better, but that's a fairly minor nit to pick.\n\nThere is a good deal of exploring to do as well. I had more than a little bit of trepidation willfully walking into a big maze, following some kind of giant spider. But I was rewarded for my bravery (after dying a few times).\n\nIt was a treat to see Todd Bridges from Diff'rent Strokes in here (and now I'm showing my age). Also, June freaking Lockhart. There are a bunch of great character actors that will have you thinking, there's a familiar face. It was fun to look at the cast on IMDB. My favorite character beside Tex would have to be the mutant Louie Lamintz, who in real life is a lawyer practicing in Utah! Brilliant, just brilliant. Really enjoyed the acting bits. The only one that somehow seemed a bit wooden was Holly, but hey, she's a hologram, what do you expect? And I don't want to hear from you hologram activists!\n\nThe "paths" hinge on your romantic interests. I haven't seen all the endings. I elected to stay true to Chelsee the first time through. Anyway, some of those scenes are a touch cheesy, not necessarily in a bad way, but I always kind of got a kick out of Tex getting rebuffed at every turn in the previous games. He seems to have somewhat better luck here, although it's sort of important to the story. And there is a double-slap moment that's pretty good. So I'm more than satisfied with this aspect.\n\nIf you're on board with the idea of detective noir satire, this is pretty much the pinnacle of the genre. I'm not sure of anything else that qualifies as such. You will have fun, which some of us think is what video games should be about.","July 9, 2015","true","13.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/261510/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Let me just say I hate adventure/point and click games because they have the most annoying and obtrusive gameplay. This game is no different. You hunt around locations in first person picking up random items that you are supposed to somehow know that you can make random nonsensical combinations and then think to use them 30 min later on a part of the background that doesn't let you know you can use items on it. When you aren't doing that, which is 75% of the gameplay, you are solving sometimes annoyingly frustrating, random, and lacking direction puzzles, and sometimes fun puzzles. The place where this game shines is the story. I have never played a game with FMV's before, and this game does a great job with it. I have not played a Tex Murphy game before this one, and while you may miss some connections and characters, the story does a good job of staying grounded in the present. The cutscenes with real actors make the story feel more real and thus more interesting, than pixels. I found myself invested in the story and wanting to know what happened. I dreaded actually playing the game, but I loved watching it. I also loved all of the optional dialogue and many branching paths. I loved how I got to do an extra part because I chose to bang this one chick. The dialogue options could have been better in the sense each one is basically one word, and you have no idea what that word leads into. I would pick a word and then I would see the option was sarcasm and not sincerely saying the word, but the game didn't let me know that. Other ones just gave no real description what you said and it was open-ended. For that reason I had to replay some dialogue options with reloading, which they could have minimized by giving a better understanding of what you are going to say. Hey if Bioware can, so can they. The game graphics are actually terrible, like from a game in 2008, but I didn't play this for the boring annoying gameplay. You will need a walkthrough for a lot of solutions. It is super annoying how games like this, because you need to use EVERY single thing you find, that if you missed 1 little thing in 1 little drawer in one of the 10 rooms you had to look through, you'll be stuck, but you won't know why, because the game expects you to somehow never miss anything. And other parts in facilities, where you are supposed to know you need to go up to this 1 room and then back down 2 flights and go to this specific room to use it, are the definition of stupid. Still, because of the branching paths and FMV and interesting story dealing with Tesla, some grounded in truth and superstition, I give the game an up-vote. But it would be higher if it were actually "fun" to play. 6.5/10.","April 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnymurda/recommended/261510/","johnnymurda","Geek Citadel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnymurda/","472 products in account","Geek Citadel's Video Review of Tesla Effect\n\nI admit it; I love everything about adventure games. I’m especially a sucker for the ones featuring detective elements of any kind. Yet in this odd and twisted world, I have never played a single Tex Murphy title. That’s right, not even Mean Streets or Martian Memorandum. So I figured it was time to break my fast of Tex games by stepping into the world of Tesla Effect. Tex Murphy returns after the events of Overseer, and things have changed in the world of the not-so-famous detective.\n\nYears have passed since the cliffhanger ending of Overseer, and Chandler Street knows Tex Murphy as a completely different person. He became a hard-boiled, unforgiving, private ♥♥♥♥ who would do anything for a buck, at least until he got knocked on the noggin during a possible kidnapping. Now he has forgotten everything over the past seven years, and his memory remains in line with the events of Overseer.\n\nI won’t spoil the story from here, but I will say that I had a blast getting to know Tex and the gang. Tesla Effect injects a heavy dose of dark comedy move along the storyline. Tex is a bumbling detective with a sly wit, and he always finds himself in the most ridiculous situations. The best thing about Tex Murphy is that it has an intriguing set of storylines designed around multiple choices. The main storyline path focuses on Tex and his memory, but the player can branch off into a lovelorn relationship, and many other pathways.\n\nIt all comes down to the way that you’ve been playing Tex as a character. There are multiple choices that appear during conversations with other citizens of New San Francisco. You can find yourself being a witty clown, or a straight up ♥♥♥♥ to the other characters in the world. Depending on the demeanor of Tex and the choices made, it will change the path and take him closer to an alternate ending. It’s fantastic and gives the player a reason to come back for more.\n\nTesla Effect doesn’t sugarcoat the fact that it’s from the early days of adventure gaming. It utilizes full 3D roaming similar to titles like King’s Field, and Myst for exploring the world. Tex can walk around freely examining clues, solve puzzles, and explore the rundown city of San Francisco. Conversations are handled in FMV (Full-Motion Video) format. The game will switch to real-life footage and allow the player to choose from a variety of dialogue. It has that throwback feel of the 90’s, and it’s impressive that dialogue was specifically recorded for each comment made by Tex.\n\nTesla Effect has pretty much advertised itself as a retro title, and that’s incredibly evident in the old-school graphics. Wandering around the city is as smooth as a baby’s bottom, but the city itself looks like it was created in 1998. The aesthetic is obviously on purpose, and it adds a hit of nostalgia of the good old days of adventure gaming. I absolutely love the way the title was designed, with the green screen backdrops behind the actors, and the Blade Runner themed cityscape. I won’t lie though, if you aren’t looking at it through rose colored goggles… it’s just ugly.\n\nThe sound design on the other hand is incredibly well-done. The acting is on par with cheesy B movies, and it makes for some entertaining viewing material. Chris Jones is stellar in his role as Tex Murphy, and it’s clear that he was born to play the character – since he’s the designer after all. His deep rich voice lends well to the character, but his wacky antics on screen sell him perfectly as a buffoon who may be in the wrong line of work. A few of the other cast members are great as well, like Louie LaMintz, and Rook Garner. Okay, especially good ol’ Rook Garner, he’s just a guy you love to hate. The remaining crew plays their roles well-enough, but some of them just can’t help but look at the teleprompter during questioning sequences.\n\nI was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed Tesla Effect. The hours flew by as I became engrossed in the world of Tex Murphy. It may not be the most beautiful game on the market, but the FMV scenes shot in beautiful 2k resolution more than make up for it. Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure receives four stars out of five from Geek Citadel. This title is an old-school classic created for the modern day, and as soon as I finish beating each path in the game.  I’m going to go back and boot up the old Tex Murphy titles.","May 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Steam only counts online play, I've played mine while offline.\n\n\n\nFunny story driven detective game.  That's this game in a nut shell but it's so much more.  If you have played the previous Tex games, this is a must have game since it will fill you with nostolga and you will fully appreciate the occasional "inside jokes"  If you are new to the Tex universe, this game stands well on it's own as it explains enough of the previous games(back story) so you know exactly whats going on at all times.\n\nIf you like games that are story driven, like comedy, and figuring out clues in detective style game play...  This game is for you.\n\nIf you're the type of person that fast forwards past the dialog in your games so you can get back to the action, hate small puzzles (not jigsaw, all types), or has to have cutting edge graphics in your game (FMV scenes are cutting edge, it's the 3D enviornment you navigate around in the game that are about 10+ years dated) .....then this game is not for you.\n\nGraphics:    Full motion video : 10  ---   3D environment: 5\n--Two scores here, FMV is awesome, the 3D is meh but it does get the job done.\n\n\nSound:  9\n--- Awesome music and voice work, they should sell the music it's so good.\n\nControls:  7\n--- The controls are nothing new or special and any person who has played a 3D game will jump right in.  Other than ladders seeming a bit aquard to climb, all other motion contols work fine with no glitches or getting stuck.\n\nReplay: 6\n---  This game has 5 different endings and the 3 different paths you can take have a unique location(s) to them which increases replay value but once you beat all five endings, the replay value does drop.\n\nGameplay: 10\n--- This game is unique in this day and time and is truley something that should not be missed.  I can't remember how many times I laughed or got engrossed in the story that was unfolding before me.  The writing for this game is really awe inspiring and done quite well.  You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you piece clues together to get to the next part of your case.\n\nOverall: 9\n--- The only thing that keeps this from being game nirvana is the 3D engine being a bit dated.  That being said, the 3D environments looked good enough to me and they did quite well for the budget that BFG had.\n\n","May 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

That name was Tex Murphy. Over the course of the 1990s, Tex stumbled his way through five point and click adventures, most of which were highlighted by the same FMV goodness that made Mad Dog McCree a household name. Now, thanks to the magic of crowdfunding and nostalgia, Tex is back for a new adventure in 2014, ready to take advantage of both the lowered expectations of FMV games and the high quality cameras available in our own far flung future. Tesla Effect nails it when it comes to weird video insanity, but drops the ball when it comes to basic gameplay. This shouldn’t matter for FMV fans who’ve been waiting for a new fix since Lococycle, but fans of point and clicks may not be satisfied with what’s presented here.\n\nRead the rest of my review over at Geekenstein.com! http://www.geekenstein.com/tesla-effect-tex-murphy-adventure-review/","May 21, 2014","true","12.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But after playing half-way through, I found myself questioning whether I should even bother finishing the game.  It was only through sheer force of will and a weird, nostalgic obligation, that I managed to see it through to the end.  *sigh* So where to begin?\n\nLet's first talk about the things it did well:\n\nRevisiting Chandler Avenue and reuniting with the old cast was a treat for old Tex Murphy fans like myself.  And honestly, I didn't mind the mediocre graphics, as it felt reminiscent of the old Tex Murphy games.  The FMV sequences were well-done for the most part, and I enjoyed exploring areas without running into loading screens or having to change discs. (I know I'm throwing a bone here, but it's the little things that count, right?)  Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.  Now on to my personal gripes:\n\nWhat's with the talking, Tom Servo gadget?  In the beginning and throughout the game, I was questioning the purpose of this supposed "character".  Other than the tutorial, and occasional out of place quips, it didn't really add to the story - or much of anything else for that matter.  Tex's  inner monologues could have easily replaced this character - so why even bother with this?\n\nWhen initially exploring your apartment and Chandler Avenue, you come across seemingly random objects which upon closer inspection, will play back clips from the old Tex Murphy games.  While it's a nice trip down memory lane for fans like me, the references seemed out of place for the game's story.  I understand the intent, but the clips felt rather shoe-horned in, and were unnecessary to the story's progression - not to mention confusing for those who are new to the franchise.\n\nIn terms of game-play, the pixel hunting wasn't a big deal for me.  What was a big deal was having to cope with:\n1.	Awkward and unpredictable stealth mechanics (which will kill you)\n2.	Navigating security systems via clunky controls (which will kill you)\n3.	Dealing with random enemy patrols with questionable aggro radius (which will kill you)\n\nAll the while looking for obscure objects hidden in the environment to progress further in the story.  It was an immense frustration, and made me want to quit several times--it was just, not, fun.  Now if the stealth mechanics were actually fleshed out and developed, I don't think it would have been a problem.  As it was however, the deaths felt cheap, and you can't help but feel as if the game is working against you.\n\nThe story...oh man, the story.  For the record, this contains *SPOILERS* - so don't say I didn't warn you.\nThe story picks up where the last game left off, with Tex suffering from amnesia from the past seven years.  Now it's up to you to figure out what happened.  Pretty straightforward, right?  As you progress, you're introduced to more characters from your 'previous' life that you have no recollection of.\n\nHowever, one of the major flaws of this game is that you never fully interact with ANY of these new characters...at all!  I found myself scratching my head, trying to put names to faces and their overall place in the timeline of events.  When I asked questions to folks around town, I had to remind myself who the heck "so-and-so" was and why did I care?  Overall, the story telling suffers from a severe case of exposition.  You are TOLD who these characters are, and what your prior relationship with them was, but in terms of experiencing these relationships first-hand throughout the game and having meaningful interaction with any of them?  Pfft! Forget about it.  This is because the characters are either:\n\nA.)  Dead\nB.)  Soon to be Dead\nC.) Meet in 2-3 FMV scenes only to be never seen or heard from again\n\nThe game lacks context in so many areas, that as a player I was left struggling to put the pieces together.   On top of that, the game adds soap opera-esque plot twists, as if the story wasn't convoluted enough! (Chelsee was actually the daughter of Margaret Leonard but was given up for adoption because of....reasons.  And J.T Donnelly was actually the past incarnation of Tex Murphy... WTF? Seriously?!  What does ANY of this have to do with ANYTHING!  *slaps forehead*)  Jesus, in terms of trying to make sense of the story - don't even bother.  The way the game plays out, it's like getting handed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and asking you to piece it together - in the dark, while riding on a roller coaster.\n\nTLDR:\nI really wanted to like this game, but even as an avid Tex Murphy fan - I felt this was a bit of a disappointment.  It had potential, but with frustrating stealth mechanics, convoluted story-telling, and dangling plotlines with no resolution or relevance to the story - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.\n\nI hope that if future installments are made, they get rid of stealth/patrol sequences, tighten the story (less plot holes please!), emphasize more character building and interaction, get rid of 'transition' characters (i.e. Tom Servo, Ariel, St. Germaine) and rely less on references from the older games -- it will make it infinitely more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a Tex Murphy fan, pick it up when it's under $5.  I can't see spending more than that.  If you're not a Tex Murphy fan - skip this one, and instead pick up "Under a Killing Moon" - it's dated, but it's definitely a solid and entertaining game.","September 6, 2015","false","15.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","14","25","3","0"

I got it on sale for $4, and it was certainly worth it for that price. However, I wouldn't buy it for $20 unless you are a Tex Murphy fan.\n\nThe good:\nThe live action videos were actually pretty well done, and the story was better than I expected. The environment looks pretty good, and Tex makes subtle jokes all time when you click on various things. There are also random puzzles scattered around that must be completed to unlock containers or doors. These puzzles don't really fit the story, but I enjoyed them nonetheless.\n\nThe bad:\nThe gameplay eventually becomes burdensome, and I just wanted to get to the next part of the story. For a while wandering around and looking for clues was interesting, but eventually it becomes so annoying walking back and forth to pick up this, activate that, pickup this, bring it over there, etc. I guess that sort of thing can be considered a puzzle, but it is like a puzzle where upon figuring out what to try next, you have to walk for 2 minutes to the proper location to try it (and sometimes avoid obstacles like landmines). Basically too much of the game is spent walking around, wasting the player's time.\n\nI would like to see the other endings, but I am afraid it will take too much time to see them.

The game engine is intuitive and fun to use, the graphics are very servicable considering the budget of just $1 million dollars and the 2K video footage is truly sublime. It's a game with enormous replay value and more than 30 hours of gameplay.

You play as a bumbling cybernoir detective named Tex Murphy in this reboot of a series that had its last installment in 1998. This game was crowdfunded by fans so newcomers (like myself) can feel a little lost but the story opens with Tex losing his memory of the last seven years which can help ease you in to the universe.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. Full motion video cutscenes are separated by 3D envrionments that you must explore to find clues and solve puzzles in order to progress. The puzzles are not very difficult and you'll find most of the challenge comes from finding small items hidden in obscure locations. These scenes are made more lively with Tex's commentary as you observe different items in the games world. Depending on how observant and you are and your profficency for puzzle-sloving this game will vary from around 8 to 16 hours. I took just shy of 14 hours to complete my first playthrough and the only other FMV title I have played is the old X-Files game.\n\nThe real charm from this game comes from its characters and acting. It feels like watching a cheesy B-Movie in the best way possible. There are some real gems of good delivery to be found complemented by awkward lines that will make you grin. Tex himself is absolutely lovable and you will meet several genuinely interesting people along the way. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and focuses on being as enjoyable as possible.\n\nOverall it's a well-executed modern interpretation of the old FMV adventure games and I am so glad I picked it up. If you are on the fence watch the "OMG FMV GOTY" trailer (it should be the first video on the store page). It sold me on buying this in under four minutes and I haven't looked back since.","April 3, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Waking up with the past 7 years as a gap in your memory, you set out to put the pieces together of who you became during those years, and find out why you lost your memory.\n\nPros: This is a new sequel to well beloved FMV franchise of the 90s. All recurring characters, 8 of which I can think of, are played by the same actors as those who left us off in Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directives and Overseer, which is quite an accomplishment 16 years later, although only 7 years have passed in-game. The memory blank allows players of the previous games to jump right in where they remember the story, which is where Tex remembers it. Jokes are corny but Tex's smirk remarks are always worth a smile, giggle, or even laugh. The game has 4 different endings, and even branching path as entire levels could only be played with certain paths, like the Sewers, the Blue Dragon, and many flashbacks. There are many easter eggs of clips from past games of the franchise, as well as many locations where points can be gathered by looking at the many portraits of Kickstarter backers on the walls (every single one of them with a personal one-liner from Tex!).\n\nCons: In the first person perspective, the textures are awful, and I mean it. Any FPS players will be turned off by the game's graphics, and is obviously not where the attention was put. The game is somewhat short for an adventure game, and you don't feel as much as a P.I. as you did in previous games and barely spend any time in your office, or getting "cases" from clients. Money and shopping were completely removed from the game. The puzzles were for the most part easy, while the conversation options that define how your story will unfold are utterly vague, often misleading.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nHeck, I had fun playing this game! There is no doubt everything that did carry over from the franchise was an improvement over previous games. Some things could be better for sure, but the game's heart is in the right place: an homage to an underrated FMV franchise that should've been remembered as one of the best of its time, and it's great to have one more go at it. FMV as a whole might not make a comeback, but Tex Murphy is welcomed to do so!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 15, 2015","true","17.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Is it for everyone?  Absolutely not.  Is there things I did not like - absolutely.  The game is very archaic in everything outside of its cutscenes and dialogue.  The game relies on almost 3D-like pixel hunting to find items in the inventory.  I cannot tell you how many times I was stuck because I couldnt find an item that was hidden or under a table or in a dark corner.  The puzzles rage from borderline  easy to incredibly obtuse/time consuming.  Most of it results in trial and error.  Some puzzles dont have solutions when you think there would be.  When you get stuck, especially on Gamer mode when there is no hint, expect to take a few dozen minutes to hours to find that random item you need to complete a puzzle.\n\nThe game also includes something which I found very distracting/annoying - a computer companion named (Smart) Alex.  I understand why he's in the game as hes pretty much the only one you have with you at all times and gives the game needed exposition from time to time.  However for the most part I found his prescense annoying, he detracted from the immersion.  This is however a minor detail, or nitpick.\n\nThe gameworld is pretty hollow, or empty.  Mean Streets is the same you remember, almost too similar.  You cant explore stores anymore and the characters you talk to from previous games seem to be just there to forward the plot.  Its pretty remarkable to get most if not all of the original cast back but none of them actually do anything for the plot other than forward it to the next scene.  Probably a smaller game world next time will make the game feel less barren.  Currently you're feel like you're on rails - going from one plot point to another until you're in a completely different location and doing the same thing but this time trying to find items to complete puzzles.\n\nI have played all the 3D Tex Murphy games, although this game is excellent I personally feel Pandora Directive is better but only because of the game world.  As previously mentioned, where this game excells is the video quality and quantity.  There is a staggering amount of detail in the game world.  It is unfortunetely however how convuleted the plot is at times - how the characters will reference or drop information as it was already common knowledge.  There are several times when they will say something critical or profound and just say, "Oh I'm sure you know this already Tex."  I dont know if this is intentional as the basic plot deals with Tex losing his memory, or because the plot branches so much but its very jarring.  It creates a disconnect with the plot and in the end I had no idea what was going on, or probably as much as Tex did.  Maybe it would be different on a different path?\n\nI would recommend this game first to previous players of Tex Murphy games - it will be interesting to see if multiple playthroughs make the plot more coherent.  Also due to the branching paths it will be interesting if theres different areas or puzzles that open up with it as well.  If you're new to Tex Murphy or even old school pixel hunt adventure games I'd try the demo first.  If I could give this game a score, it would be a 7 out of 10.","May 10, 2014","true","12.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For those that don't, Tex Murphy is a perpetually down on his luck, old school, wisecracking private eye, in the vein of Sam Spade.  The games take place in the near future, but with a distinctly Film Noir vibe to them.  They are a series of FMV-heavy point & click adventure games where Tex generally starts out with what seems like a simple case that leads him into conspiracies and wacky cults seemingly over his head.  Through a combination of investigative skills, wit, charm, and dumb luck, you, as Tex, must solve the case and save the world.\n\nThis game, 16 years after the release of the previous Tex game, Overseer, is a Tex game through and through.  It plays just like the old games, albeit better looking and with a more modern interface.  The gist is still the same and the game has the same self-depreciating humor of the old Tex games.  It also packs a ton of fan service.  If you're new to the series you will miss a lot of references, but they're not critical to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nLike any point & click the game is filled with puzzles.  Most of them aren't too difficult, but there's at least some challenge to some of them.  Best of all, none of them are completely nonsensical, they at least make some sense, even if it is in a cartoonish way.  Like previous Tex games, the game is very heavy on dialogue, even more so than most point & clicks, and you have options to how you want to talk to people, generally giving you options to try to be charming, be a smartass, play it straight, and so on.  You also get to make some choices during the game and there are multiple endings.  I've only gotten one so far, but I intend to play the game again in the future to get the rest.\n\nThe game took me a little over 14 hours to complete, which is pretty meaty for a point & click.  In my experience, most point & clicks last 8-12 hours.\n\nVisually, the game is a mixed bag.  The FMV video is super high resolution and quite nice, while many of the textures are kinda low res and sometimes clash with the FMV.  It;s not exactly a big budget game so I'm more surprised by how great the FMV looks rather than how low res the textures are.\n\nOn the audio front, as in previous Tex games, the voice acting is all over the place, from amateurish and cheesy to professional and high quality.  This strange mix has always worked before in Tex games, and it works well here as well.  I think because the game doesn't take itself too seriously the cheesy acting winds up being a plus rather than a negative.\n\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalinFreeborn/recommended/261510/","PalinFreeborn","Palin Freeborn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalinFreeborn/","512 products in account","Tex Murphy was a staple of my growth into manhood and I have an incredible amount of nostalgia for the old series. When Tesla Effect hit Steam, I purchased immediately, because I had a feeling they were going to deliver and make a decent adventure game.\n\nMan, was I way off-mark.\n\nThey made an INCREDIBLE adventure game. Like, really friggin' nailed it. Most adventure games nowadays suffer from uninventive puzzles (use a broom to sweep, use gun to shoot), but Tex Murphy is the first game in the last decade that has made me feel like I was enjoying the adventure games of my youth, exploring and inspecting everything, fitting together random, disparate items in hopes of gaining some positive outcome. And, more often than not, the game can be brain-bendingly difficult, which means that finally discovering the answer is so incredibly satisfying.\n\nBig Finish Games really struck the anvil while the fire was hot with this game. The music is amazing. The cutscenes and atmosphere are dead-on some of the best cyberpunk/noirpunk I've seen, and the FMV in this game is far and above the best I've seen across any medium. Even the actors are quite good at keeping you immersed in the game.\n\nThere are only a few problems. The textures are fairly low-resolution in the game, but considering the amount of FMV and the fact that the game is a love-letter to late 80s-early 90s adventure games and isn't over 30gigs, I'm completely okay with it. The game is of a really decent length, but a lot of that may have been because I spent so much time exploring every possible nook and cranny, so you could feasibly finish this game in a few short hours by powering through. Additionally, there were some areas where I found a few holes in the world that I couldn't get through, but could still see through the map, which is a bit of a problem.\n\nOtherwise, though, this game is a solid 9 out of 10 for me. If you aren't a fan of the originals, this might be a pass for you, but I highly recommend at least giving the demo a shot and deciding for yourself if you want to purchase it, because I guarantee it is at least worth some of your time. This is the first time I have ever seen a franchise resurrect itself in another era of electronic media and not only pay PERFECT homage to it's predecessors, but grown and delivered a compelling experience of it's own. It's also the only adventure game I've played that understands it's audience's sense of humor and level of maturity.\n\nPlease please please give this game a chance, for your own sake, and support a great developer, so they continue delivering amazing gaming experiences.\n\n-Palin\n"Danger is like Jello.

Being an FMV game might turn some people off, but it’s worth checking out if you’re a fan of noir or apocalyptic stories. More casual players might shy away from it, particularly those who aren’t big fans of tough puzzles, but over 7,000 people had faith in the concept to make the game a reality. It’s not without its flaws, but thanks to two different difficulty settings most of these can be overlooked or worked around. While it’s not classic point-and-click, the first person exploration might bring over shooter fans who want a more relaxed exploration-based title that uses controls very similar to today’s FPS games.\n\nhttp://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/tex-murphy-tesla-effect-review/","June 1, 2014","true","14.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The first part of the investigation is enjoyable, walking around, talking to people, picking up clues, solving a few puzzles.  But, wow, does this thing go off a cliff around the halfway mark.  One of the worst stealth sequences in gaming history is followed by a painfully stupid section that drags on forever in an abandoned lab.  I died about 40 times probably in the stealth area from the completely arbitrary and unfair stealth mechanics.  Then I must have died 50 more times suffering through the lab building, killed by hidden mines, electric balls that fly around and kill you, and by a giant fly that randomly pops up every few minutes to kill you (which makes no more sense in game than it sound like).  By that point the story has long since descended into incoherent gibberish, and I had no idea what was going on anyway.  The last puzzle (not really a puzzle, just click and drag, click and drag until the right thing happens) is then a timed fight with the controls, which the the imprecise mouse controls won a dozen times before I was able to finish it.","September 28, 2014","false","15.1"," 43 of 83 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","43","83","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/261510/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","Tesla Effect is the latest game in the Tex Murphy series, a first person point and click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on FMVs (full motion video). FMVs were quite popular in the early nineties because computer graphics still weren't able to provide a good character representation. However they fell out of favour because most of them had bad gameplay and even worse acting. The only games I played which really used FMV effectively were the Command & Conquer games. The FMVs there felt like a reward for progressing through the story.\n\nIn Tesla Effect I get a similar feeling, I enjoyed most of the FMV sections. Mostly because of the protagonist Tex Murphy, who is played in a very self aware manner, the game knows it's cheesy and doesn't take itself too seriously. And if you strip away all the videos there's still a pretty good game underneath it all. While the 3D graphics certainly aren't anything to special (they look like something out of a decade old game) they were actually better than I expected, especially since the levels themselves are reasonably large. I am pleased with the size of the world they constructed, there isn't that much of revisiting the same locations and they are quite varied as well. However pretty much the whole 3D world is dead, there are very few encounters with living beings outside of the FMVs.\n\nThe story itself is cheesy and by the end of the game I felt it became pretty much ridiculous. The game played much better when it wasn't focusing on the main premise of the game. It would have been nice to have some side quests, but in true adventure game fashion every single thing is connected and you can not progress without doing everything. I wouldn't fault most other adventure games with this, however as I mentioned I felt the game was best when it wasn't focusing on the main story.\n\nThe videos themselves are quite well made, the acting is cheesy but not bad. There are barely any real world objects, almost everything besides the characters themselves is CGI, which is on par with the rest of the game. So, not great, but considering the budget they had to work with I think it's good enough.\n\nAs an adventure game there are quite a lot of puzzles, I was OK with most of them, however I certainly needed help sometimes. Thankfully there's an optional help system included in the game and an option to skip the puzzle mini game sections, which I used once because the puzzle itself made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nTesla Effect is not an easy game to recommend, it's a throwback to a type of game which existed for a very short amount of time, due to limited technical capabilities of the time. And the series from which it comes is probably one of the best of its type. When I played the game I took it as such and mostly enjoyed what I got, so if you do the same you can go ahead and try this out. I hope the series continues, as I think a really good game can be made from this, with the right story.\n\n6 / 10","May 15","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't matter how good 3d graphics are , because to be able to watch a character being played by real human being it gives something to the player that it is impossible to emulate with computers. All this depends on the actor's interpretation and how good he is or she is of course.\n\nThe story, interestingly enough, has good potential...being about Nicola Tesla, his revolutionary creations,  but...finally...it is a total waste. The story wich begins very very well, goes nowhere, and besides that, the narrative it is a total mess by the second half of the game. Really sad because there was some good beginnings there.\n\nTechnically.... the game is 50 / 50. The fmv (video) parts are great, they are filmed with a 4k digital camera and they had a pretty good post production work. Not so much the production part, wich alltough it has great work done with the green screen and the actors, it has, from time to time, some basic image errors, like complete out of focus sequences, bad editing, weird cuts, and bad compositing (some sequences doesn't make too much sense, the character says something you should know, but in fact you don't , because you didn't play that part. And for a game that plays with choices and interactive fiction, that's a big mistake sadly.\nEven then....if you played a previous tex murphy game (the last one was from 1998....) you can clearly see the advancements in video technology and what it can be done today, and that's a great thing. Mixing real actors with computer graphics has come a long way.\n\nThe 3d graphics on the other hand.... they are pretty bad, mediocre at best, even taking into consideration that they are done by a small team with little budget to spend, they could have done better even with this budget. Maybe they should have hired some people for making the 3d graphics part, because it has proven in many games that camed out recently, that you can do much better than this, even with low budget...you just have to know your limitations and hire someone who can make good use of the available tools.\n\nFinally, this is and adventure for people that played tex murphy adventures in the past, and wants to have some closure to the characters they knew from the 90s, reuniting one more last time. A bitersweet ending.\nTo newcomers maybe you should pass.\n\nUPDATE 24/03/2016 :\n\nFinally after playing many adventure gamers from 2014, i have to say my opinion for tesla effect changed drastically. I still am happy to have played one more time with tex murphy, and to be able to put and end to his story. I am happy also to see what can be done with fmv in 2014, it is great. But the adventure has many problems , beginning with the story, the story has potential,begins interesting enough, but goes nowhere, and it is a mess of a narrative by the second half. There are some parts of the story that are necesary to understand what is hapenning and they are blocked from the player in certain paths. So you are playing , tex suddenly starts saying something HE knows, but you don't and the player gets totally lost. Then the story itself becomes completely ridiculous with all that happens after the first half....the guy dressed as the phantom of the opera, the 2 girls throwing themselves at tex (we are a little old for those games right?) the egyptian temple of the followers of tesla, wich works as a military base (???) the 3d graphics are horrible, it's not excuse to have low budget, better things can be done with it, you just need the right people to do it. As they are, the graphics for this game seem made in the 90s... And to be honest, when i played tex murphy games in the 90s, they not only had great FMV , but also great 3d graphics for that time. Those  games were pretty advanced, in all regards. I m sad to say this but Tesla effect is not that.","December 23, 2014","false","60.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How hard it is to review it. One one hand, this is AMAZING reboot of a FMV adventure series. On the other hand... its a FMV adventure, packed with some of the same issues it used to have back then, and a few new ones packed in. Yes, we still have some amateurish acting in here. Yes, we still have bad looking rendered backgrounds that don't mesh too well with the characters. And we also have another issue here: after 16 years, the actors aren't exactly at their prome. Hell, one of the main characters looks so old (and fatter) compared to his/her last game that it kinda ruined some scenes in the game. And that's one of the main issues with the FMV genre...\n\nAs an adventure game, Its a great entry. It does have a few casual puzzles (you know, the ones you usually find in hidden object games - sliding, jigsaw, etc), but there are also some amazingly designed ones, and the detective stuf is till top notch. You can open every drawer, you can look at every corner of the maps, you can still click in everything just to hear Tex cracking some jokes... Fact is: even if the game is indeed flawed, its easy to forget about the issues when you have a game that delivers EXACTLY what the fans where looking for: an answer to the question that has been living on our brains ever since we saw the end of Overseer. And unlike most recent adventure games, you DO have a nice inventory management, including the ability to combine items. Yeah, like the classics. ^^\n\nMuch like Pandora Directive, Tesla Effect features two things that are usually NOT found in FMV games: branching dialogue trees and multiple endings. This is nice, because it gives you a reason to replay the game. The story will be the same, but you'll be able to see different dialogues, different scenes and different endings (there are 5 of them, BTW). The story, BTW, is, in my opinion, amazing. Very complex, very detailed and very creative. It VERY fictional, but not absurd. While it continues from the cliffhanger ending presented in Overseer, it also features a new plot, involving Nikola Tesla's inventions and some urban legends around it. In fact, the connections between all the older games and this new plot are so natural that you REALLY have to congratulate Chris Jones for its amazing writing.\n\nThe gameplay is actually quite good. You still are able to navigate full 3D backgrounds in first person view, but all dialogues and most actions are presented in FMV scenes with branching  dialogues. You don't really choose WHAT Tex is gonna say, but HOW he will deliver his next line (sarcastic retort, weird PI humor, change subject, etc). This is nice, since you never know what he is gonna say until he does. This game has two difficulty settings, but unlike the older games, you have can select between casual, which is VERY easy, and gamer, which is just "normal". Yeah, this game doesn't present too much challenge for classic adventure players. But it's still harder than most adventure games coming out nowdays, and still feels like a real game, not an interactive movie, which is nice.\n\nThe graphics are ok. For some lame reason, they decided to use Unity (YUCK!), so expect unstable framerates, VERY low res textures and weird 3D models. But the game doesn't really look BAD. Hell, for a budget game, some places are actually quite pleasing to the eyes. The FMV scenes are fantastic though. Not only they are in a very high resolution (blu-ray quality!), but most of them are quite well produced (the ending scenes specially have amazing special effects!). The sound department is perfect. The sound effects are realistic and VERY atmospheric and the musics are great and always set the right mood to most scenes. I have nothing to complain about the soundtrack. Heck, they even put the UAKM day transition song in here!! :p\n\nAnyway... Tesla Effect isn't perfect. It doesn't poop on Tex Murphy's name, and actually make it even stronger. In fact, its a better game that most people expected, and considering how dead the FMV genre is, its amazing that we got a new game that feels so similar to the older ones. It's a game that REALLY delivers to fans of the series. If you are not a fan though... well, I recommend that you try the demo first, because this game is aimed at the fans.\n\nI give this game an 9/10. And I REALLY hope they do a new one in the near future. At least before the actors get even older. :p","May 21","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't matter how good 3d graphics are , because to be able to watch a character being played by real human being it gives something to the player that it is impossible to emulate with computers. All this depends on the actor's interpretation and how good he is or she is of course.\n\nThe story, interestingly enough, has good potential...being about Nicola Tesla, his revolutionary creations,  but...finally...it is a total waste. The story wich begins very very well, goes nowhere, and besides that, the narrative it is a total mess by the second half of the game. Really sad because there was some good beginnings there.\n\nTechnically.... the game is 50 / 50. The fmv (video) parts are great, they are filmed with a 4k digital camera and they had a pretty good post production work. Not so much the production part, wich alltough it has great work done with the green screen and the actors, it has, from time to time, some basic image errors, like complete out of focus sequences, bad editing, weird cuts, and bad compositing (some sequences doesn't make too much sense, the character says something you should know, but in fact you don't , because you didn't play that part. And for a game that plays with choices and interactive fiction, that's a big mistake sadly.\nEven then....if you played a previous tex murphy game (the last one was from 1998....) you can clearly see the advancements in video technology and what it can be done today, and that's a great thing. Mixing real actors with computer graphics has come a long way.\n\nThe 3d graphics on the other hand.... they are pretty bad, mediocre at best, even taking into consideration that they are done by a small team with little budget to spend, they could have done better even with this budget. Maybe they should have hired some people for making the 3d graphics part, because it has proven in many games that camed out recently, that you can do much better than this, even with low budget...you just have to know your limitations and hire someone who can make good use of the available tools.\n\nFinally, this is and adventure for people that played tex murphy adventures in the past, and wants to have some closure to the characters they knew from the 90s, reuniting one more last time. A bitersweet ending.\nTo newcomers maybe you should pass.\n\nUPDATE 24/03/2016 :\n\nFinally after playing many adventure gamers from 2014, i have to say my opinion for tesla effect changed drastically. I still am happy to have played one more time with tex murphy, and to be able to put and end to his story. I am happy also to see what can be done with fmv in 2014, it is great. But the adventure has many problems , beginning with the story, the story has potential,begins interesting enough, but goes nowhere, and it is a mess of a narrative by the second half. There are some parts of the story that are necesary to understand what is hapenning and they are blocked from the player in certain paths. So you are playing , tex suddenly starts saying something HE knows, but you don't and the player gets totally lost. Then the story itself becomes completely ridiculous with all that happens after the first half....the guy dressed as the phantom of the opera, the 2 girls throwing themselves at tex (we are a little old for those games right?) the egyptian temple of the followers of tesla, wich works as a military base (???) the 3d graphics are horrible, it's not excuse to have low budget, better things can be done with it, you just need the right people to do it. As they are, the graphics for this game seem made in the 90s... And to be honest, when i played tex murphy games in the 90s, they not only had great FMV , but also great 3d graphics for that time. Those  games were pretty advanced, in all regards. I m sad to say this but Tesla effect is not that.","December 23, 2014","false","60.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is really great in building atmosphere of future city. Scenes are gorgeous and our main hero Tex, is an complex character and a very funny one. He could've read an TV manual in such a way that we would all burst into laugh. Many stories to tell many riddles to solve.

While I never even heard of Tex Murphy prior to this game, it does make me want to go back and play the older ones. The FMVs are the great, using the advances of the past several years. The 3d graphics are notably dated, reminding me of early 2000 games. But we arent here for the graphics, it would be like playing CoD for the story. The story is excellent, given its goofy/campy nature (which I feel makes it even better, too many games these days try to make themselves to be more serious and profound that they really are). The plot is something right out of the 90s-00s cyperpunk genre. I could rattle on and on about this game, but I wont. So Ill just give it a good thumbs up. If you like cyberpunk, film noir, have about of nostalgia for 90s-00s games and/or point/click adventures.

Not so with Tesla Effect. The gameplay is more or less identical to the last few efforts,  for good or ill. While not as fiendishly difficult as Under a Killing Moon or TPD, there are still puzzles to be found sprinkled throughout the game. There are many surprisingly well-acted and high budget, high-resolution FMVs, some great humour and alternate endings depending on some decisions taken. Weaknesses are the length and the way the story seems to fizzle out half way through (many major plot events are simply left hanging).","October 1, 2014","true","14.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Now, here it is. It's a dream come true! T.E. is everyhing I'd hoped it would be, and more.\n\nThe cutscens are where the $$$ went in this game, and it shows. The acting is pretty good, with only 1 or 2 exceptions. Chris Jones is back again as Tex Murphy and it's wonderful to see him on screen again. He's not really an actor, but his talent and charm is what makes all the Tex games so special.\n\nChris also designed the puzzles, as before. They are hard, but not too hard, and you'll be hunting for objects too, like any Adventure game. There are 2 modes: causal and gamer.\n\nI'm really happy with the way the game looks and feels. But Is the game kinda ugly? Well... yes, sometimes. The textures are not that complex, and neither are the 3D models. It has the looks of a game from about 2005. But please remember, this is not a AAA title. It's a small company indie game, and there were only about 3 dudes working on the levels. But I never really noticed any of that.\n\nFor $20, you can't go wrong!

The acting is pretty average and yes you can see actors occassionally reading from the cue cards, but that's just how all Tex games are and I wouldn't have it any other way! The use of the Unity engine breathes new life into the world although some areas appear to have been rushed and a lot of textures are below par for what I would expect from todays games. On the other hand the full motion HD video is top-notch, a massive leap forward over the older games. It could have been easy for these guys to change the formula and go down a more open-world route with this game but they've stuck to the old formula well and it's a credit to them, it works and provides a nice bit of nastalgia.

So much so that I am actually bothering to write a review for it. Which I don't often do.\n\nEverything in this game captures what a Tex Murphay game is and what a Tex Murphy game should be. Humor, intelligent puzzles that aren't obtuse, mystery, and a brancing story line. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my first playthrough so much that as soon as the credits were done rolling I started a second playthrough right away.\n\nWhile the 3D enviornments you explore in game are average at best the game lives and dies by it's astonishingly beautiful FMV. I played a lot of FMV games back when they were popular and even as a fan I understood why the meduim fell out of favor. They were expensive to produce and video quality was low. There is no evidence of that here. The video is beautiful, every scene helps to draw you in and increase your immersion.\n\nIf you have any appreciation at all for adventure games you should play this. Even if you've never played another Tex Murphy game you should play this because it's a great example of the form.","May 11, 2014","true","17.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Now, here it is. It's a dream come true! T.E. is everyhing I'd hoped it would be, and more.\n\nThe cutscens are where the $$$ went in this game, and it shows. The acting is pretty good, with only 1 or 2 exceptions. Chris Jones is back again as Tex Murphy and it's wonderful to see him on screen again. He's not really an actor, but his talent and charm is what makes all the Tex games so special.\n\nChris also designed the puzzles, as before. They are hard, but not too hard, and you'll be hunting for objects too, like any Adventure game. There are 2 modes: causal and gamer.\n\nI'm really happy with the way the game looks and feels. But Is the game kinda ugly? Well... yes, sometimes. The textures are not that complex, and neither are the 3D models. It has the looks of a game from about 2005. But please remember, this is not a AAA title. It's a small company indie game, and there were only about 3 dudes working on the levels. But I never really noticed any of that.\n\nFor $20, you can't go wrong! There are different story paths to follow, and multiple endings, so it's always worth playing again.","May 16, 2014","true","40.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Not so with Tesla Effect. The gameplay is more or less identical to the last few efforts,  for good or ill. While not as fiendishly difficult as Under a Killing Moon or TPD, there are still puzzles to be found sprinkled throughout the game. There are many surprisingly well-acted and high budget, high-resolution FMVs, some great humour and alternate endings depending on some decisions taken. Weaknesses are the length and the way the story seems to fizzle out half way through (many major plot events are simply left hanging).","October 1, 2014","true","14.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm completely new to the Tex Murphy games and FMV games a whole. The only others I'd really seen were the phantasmagoria games and the handful of Wing-commander games in the same format, which were kinda like interactive movies.\n\nThis game is no different, but it was cool to see a dead genre reborn. The game was definately one for the fans, and you can tell a lot more work went into the FMV sequences rather than the game-play itself. The acting is very cheesy a lot of the time, just like most FMV games. For example, in at least two scenes, actors were supposed to be dead, but you could see them still breathing.\n\nThe puzzles in the game were pretty basic and the puzzle difficulty ranged tremendously throughout the game. Sometimes I had to use brute force to pass a puzzle, other times I managed to solve them very quickly.\n\nWith all this said, I still really liked the game and would happily buy and play a sequel. Hopefully we may also see other FMV games return in the future.","January 10, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Now, fair warning, this is a point-and-click adventure game, so if you do not like that type of game, then you probably won't love it the way I do. However, if you do like that genre, this is a wonderful game for you. If you played any or all of the Tex Murphy games from about ten years ago--Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive--then you are in for a double treat. Many of your favorite characters are back, and Tex is played by the same actor with all the wisecracking and corny P.I. jokes (of course). One of the things I got the biggest kick from is the flashback sequences drawn from the old games triggered by objects in the environment (remembering how Tex got a hole in the brim of one of his fedoras was one of my favorites). The flashbacks appear to be the FMV from the old games displayed in a little letterbox in the center of the screen. The new FMV shot for this game is high-def and full screen and looks and plays beautifully. There is a casual mode for beginners with hints as to what to do next and objects that are needed for the story highlighted by Tex's trusty flashlight. More experienced adventure gamers are going to want to play without the hints or the object-highlighting, but either way this is a great ride--especially if you played any of the earlier games. I played without the help, and while there are a few items that took a bit of work to find and a challenging timed puzzle at the end of the game, I only had to rely on the Universal Hint System two or three times.\nSo a great point-and-click adventure for anyone, and a special treat for Tex Murphy fans from earlier games, Tesla Effect is not to be missed.","August 21, 2014","true","29.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Despite the bad textures. TE has an interesting setting of Blade Runner inspired San Francisco, 2050 where norms and mutants live together. The story mashes together the genius of Nikola Tesla with a quirky witted P.I to create a really interesting story.\n\nThe strongest points of TE are apparent as soon as you start the game; the FMV action sequences. Everything about them works well; the characters, make up, acting, directing, and lighting. The actors play out the story very well, and the involvement of Tesla and his inventions were creatively used to create intrigue and spur the story on. It never felt like the story was difficult to follow or boring.\n\nA lot of effort went into how the FMV sequences looked, and it paid off, however the same can’t be said about the free roaming parts. San Francisco in 2050 looks like a dump, with dull, flat textures that really lack in imagination and detail. This also creates a problem when looking for items to collect, because sometimes those items are on a small scale and blend into the background.\n\nThe death sequences will sometimes show how you died, which is useful when trying not to repeat the same mistake. However there are times when you’re left questioning it, or you’re learning the boundaries so to speak.\n\nThe puzzles hold a certain amount of logic to them, and though you come across them with no initial idea how to execute them, by pressing the right mouse button a radial menu will appear with a “?”; pressing that button will have Tex explain what is needed to be done to complete the puzzle, without giving away the answer.\n\nThe way that the dialogue is executed between characters brings up a menu with highlighted options for you to select from, when you have chosen a subject matter that subject is greyed out. This is useful to know what you have and haven’t asked of someone. The multiple selection you have to reply to a conversation\n\nI have never played a Tex Murphy game before this one, but I get a feeling from playing it that the developers played homage to the legacy and the fans together. There are flashbacks and references to previous games, characters hold memories of others, and Tex kept bringing up something about “monkeys in barrels”. Backing at a certain tier probably got photos of the backers into galleries that you come across in the game, which is really cool because Tex has a comment for each one.

However, this is the only game that has successfully melded the game and full motion video. All other previous hybrids I have played before have been misreable failures.\n\nAnd even though I hadnt heard of Tex Murphy before this game its very easy to jump right into the story, identify with Tex, and realize that the pulp and noire feel just works seamlessly. Tex really needs no intro. Prior to starting the game I feared there was going to be too many references that were inside jokes from previous chapters of the Tex Murphy saga. Im glad to say that this stands alone well and everyone can get the same level of enjoyment whether they were very involved with previous storylines or are a total newcomer like myself.\n\nEasily a 4.5 out 5 stars.

They were very much on my radar and I remember quite well wanting to play Under a Kiling Moon when I was young.  FMV games for the most part were a flash in the pan fad that really overstayed their welcome in the early/mid 90's.  Some did it very well and are among my favorite adventures (Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within,) some were flawed but still highly enjoyable (Phantasmagoria) and some were pretty abysmal (anything released on Sega CD.)  Tesla Effect falls promptly into the middle catagory.\n\nThe story, characters, presentation and FMV are pretty fantastic.  The acting is terrible but in the best possible way.  Any positive things I have to say about this game all center around those aspects.  The game environment and gameplay on the other hand did leave quite a bit to be desired.\n\nThe world itself is pretty ugly by todays standards.  It was like navigating a 1999 poly environment.  I guess you could argue that works for the game since it's a return to a medium long dead since the 90's. The gameplay relies HEAVILY on finding items as every adventure games should.  The real trouble here is that the items and world are so murky and blocky that they blend together.  I highly recommend playing on "casual" settting because your flashlight will call sparkly attention to these things.  Even then it was still difficult finding them.\n\nI feel bad for complaining about this game because it has so much character.  I just wish more time and effort were put into the gameplay.   Also I hugely enjoyed the easter eggs that pulled video from the original Tex adventures.  They really made me want to go back and see what I was missing.  Sadly they were missing from the final half of the game or I was just missing them.\n\nStill a recommended play for anyone looking for a nostalgic trip back to 90's FMV","March 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The dialogues, ask the right character the right question or basically make sure you talk with everyone about everything, even if it’s not required to advance, the dialogues are the most fun part of the game, so don’t skip any.\n\nAnother little thing that bugged me in the game was when i got stuck because a previous unavailable location became available and i had no idea that this location was even a part of the game, it was one of the rooms in the hotel, i would have give the player some indication that this location will be a part of the game later on, even if the character just scream at you through the door “Come back later, i can’t talk right now”, i would know i should try it again every time i get stuck (for those of you who played the game i am talking about Saffyre).\n\n3. the puzzles in TE are not easy by today’s standard, but are easier and somewhat plainer than in the previous installments, I remember getting stuck on the Mayan calendar puzzle in Pandora Directive for over a week, but solving it was 7 times more satisfying and rewarding, i acknowledge that most gamer today do not have the patience for this type of puzzles and i believe that’s why they were dumb down, but this was not a deal breaker for me and i enjoyed the puzzles nevertheless.\n\nThere was a small issue that bothered me with some of the puzzle, the camera view was way too far and it was hard to see what’s going on in the puzzle, this happened in about 3-4 puzzles in the game.\n\n4. the graphics, there was and still is a lot of chatter around the graphics and 3D models used in TE, the graphics are 10 time better than the previous games and that is obviously expected, but they are a little dated, which may draw back some of today gamers, i personally enjoyed the art and it didn’t bothered me one bit, so just watch one of the videos online and judge for yourself.\n\nIn conclusion:\nAs I said in the beginning of this review, I enjoyed playing TE, i got the experience i was looking for, but I think there is room for improvement on future installments.\n\nI am looking forward to see how the gaming community will react to this game and hopefully i will get the pleasure of playing a new Tex Murphy game in the near future.\n\nFor now i’ll settle for a second run through with a different path on Tesla Effect.\n\nTime Played: 10-20 hours","May 14, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game just like Tex, has awoken with amnesia with no idea where the hell all the years went. It would seem FMV's have no place in today's gaming scene however this game seems to carry on regardless, despite the fact that FMV's have been dead for a long time. Tex Murphy is finally back to his old self with a game that delivers, with funny and cheesy dialogue and an interesting story. This game however is not for everyone and i would check out the demo if unsure. If you are looking for a game that has great graphics you will not find it here, however if you can look past the graphics then you might find something you will like. As a backer i thoroughly enjoyed the game despite its downfalls and only discovering the Tex Murphy games a few years ago.

Definitely not for everyone, but one of the more enjoyable/better ways to giving FMV adventure games a chance once it inevitably lands in a sale. I'd expect this to be the best-looking adventure game with such focus on full-motion (greenscreened) live action video for a good while, if only because there probably won't be any more of the kind in several years.\n\nGameplay: The bulk of the adventure is viewed from the first-person perspective and the player can walk freely around like in FPS games, except there's no jumping or crouching. In this mode, the game looks really ugly. Low-detail models, low-resolution textures, very few no character models (and those that are shown are usually even worse). The stealth and action sections are... something that can be cleared, but no highlights of the game. There are no ridiculous item combination puzzles, which is a big plus.\n\nDialogue: The dialogue in the game is played by greenscreened live actors. In these, there are usually several options to pick from - two to three - but I can't say if they branch the game plot outside one or two rather obvious points. Once this dialogue tree is handled, it's back to picking one from the list of topics. I'd call the acting mostly passable - at least better than what is shown in the clips from the old games.\n\nPuzzles: When it comes to puzzles, it's nothing overly difficult. I don't recall any "how was I supposed to know I had to combine these?!" problems, and the "in-situ" puzzles (a Simon Says -puzzle, solving a board game problem, ...) are relatively straightforward, if you listen to Tex telling what you're supposed to do in it. (The board game, I'm talking about you!)\n\nIssues: For me, the biggest problem was finding all items. I played the game without the flashlight aiding me and I had to check a walkthrough maybe three times. (Wheel, hook, glue). Some items are hidden so well and/or in unlikely places, making the game too much like a 3D hidden object game. On the other hand - this is the investigation part that some might find interesting.","May 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I was so pleased to see a new episode coming out. FMV is all my youth after all. I rushed on Harvester when it was re-released, own both the 7th Guest and the 11th Hour and enjoy them almost as much as first time.\nAnd if I must be honnest I would go down on my knees for some Phantasmagoria or Gabriel knight but this is a totally different story.\nOk, so this new Tex.\nThose new gen FMV's are gorgeous, I connected my notebook to my 55" TV and were all "WOW" like when I saw Tex HD. The intro is great, sweating Blade runner from all its pixels.\nThe first minutes were plain joy, a nicely done optional tutorial and then, here I went on my own ready to investigate this new open world. Then...\nWell, yeah, then...\nTHEN, I realized that the game is just no more than FMV's and a nice scenario continuing the main serie story.\nLet me explain myself, the game got a single and only bad point: it's realisation is rubbish. It seems like the team spent all the budget on the movie part and the rest of the game, the interractive "real" playable part, was build using HL 1 engine. It's cheap, cubic, empty for the most part with plenty of 3D models repetitions trying to furnish the maps but failed.\nThe level design, if I can call it that way, is madly wrong and screams: "So boring to do those additional buildings, anyway you would have no interraction on them except maybe an optional object to find so why try harder".\nNo joke, I saw some better textures on Minecraft...\nClick on one of those "useless buildings" and enjoy Tex repeating again and again the same comment.\nCountless amounts of objects here and there triggering some "flashback" style videos getting the player back to the old episodes of the serie but with no links with the actual story would then finish the work and make you understand that the Dev's are just imploring you hands joined to buy the older episodes.\n\nAnother epic fail was the translation. For those who master english, no problem at all. Characters are all on ol'time noir movies slang and they sounds great.\nHeh, me bad. english isn't my mother's tongue so I turned on the subtitles.\nI'm not stupid. I pretty well know that slang or expressions are sometimes really hard to translate as they sometimes got no compare on another language but dude!\nWho the hell did you guys picked to do the job? We have litteral translation here, word for word. Not any comprehension of the original meaning and worst, on some dialogues with multi answers choice it becomes plain luck to choose witch one you must or want choose from...\n\nSo after all that was said, you would certainly ask yourself: "So, good or not?"\n\nFor myself, as a real lover of Tex' debuts, it will definitly be a YES. I played some serious ♥♥♥♥♥ way more awfull than that and enjoyed them.\nFor new incomers, those who never played Under a Killing Moon and even don't know what is it, don't loose your time here.\nIf you're just curious about the franchise, get yourself one of the firsts.\n","August 15, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Everything I enjoyed about the Tex Murphy adventures, the silly and witty puns, the surprisingly deep storylines, the crazy cast of characters and engaging puzzles are all here in the Tesla Effect.  This time, they're wrapped in shiny Ultra HD and the video is SHARP!  There's definitely a tongue-firmly-in-cheek, silly Mystery Science Theater 3000 flair to the sets, costumes and makeup for the filmed scenes - but that's a REALLY good thing!  It feels like you're playing a B movie which is exactly what the Tex Murphy adventures have always been.  To lose that kitchy appeal would completely ruin the experience.\n\nTesla Effect is kind of a love letter to the fans, bringing back a large number of the cast from previous games.  There are a few jokes that won't quite zing if you haven't played the game before, but do not be discouraged if this is your intro to the Tex Murphy canon.  Thanks to some lovely flashbacks, new players can familiarize themselves with the past games' plots and characters.  NOTE: I still encourage anyone to play the previous games because they are wonderful - I actually replayed Under A Killing Moon, Pandora Directive, and Overseer before playing Tesla Effect.  These games have stood the test of time.  Sure, the graphics are dated, but the story, characters, gameplay and puzzles are just as much fun as they were when I first played them years ago.\n\nChris Jones still has me cracking up as the titular character, Tex Murphy, and the rest of the cast is obviously having a ball as well.  The puzzles are overall very good - similar in difficulty and creativity to those from the past games.  There are multiple endings (of which I have only found 2 thus far, but I hear there are at least 4) which are unique and worth replaying the game for.\n\nMy only minor gripe is that the in-game graphics were only ok.  And that's mainly because so many of the textures were low resolution and some were sloppily applied to the models.  While this didn't detract or deter my enjoyment of the game, I would have liked to have seen a little more care put into the in-game graphics - the same kind of care that was put into the film sequences.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Tesla Effect and I hope that Tex Murphy will be back again soon to again save the world from annihilation.\n\n","June 26, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To 1994, to be exact, when Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon came out. It was a live-action, point-and-click adventure game, with bad acting, cheesy special effects, but a story that was pretty interesting and gameplay that backed it up nicely.\n\nWant the TL:DR?\nA great throwback to two decades ago, with an interesting story, and the same cheesy special effects and acting. It’s brought down by blurry graphics and a multitude of clipping issues, and is overly short. Play it in Gamer mode, not Casual, for the best experience.\n\nThe Good\n+ Story. Like the previous games, the story is what makes this game. It’s humorous, serious, and at times, weird and offputting. But that’s the draw. There is lots to take in, from the required story portions to the optional questions you can ask pretty much anybody, all in typically cheese FMV.\n\n+ Acting. The acting is cheesy, and not the greatest, but it beats the previous games. Tex really is a character you’ll want to hate.\n\n+ Puzzles. Some of the puzzles are odd, but most wind up fitting nicely into the theme of the game. However, they’re all pretty easy, and you shouldn’t have any issues whatsoever with any of them.\n\nThe Bad\n- Clipping. My word, the clipping is atrocious. You’ll clearly clip through windows, doors, gates and holes. It’s as if the dev’s didn’t even try to add collision detection. The worst is when you clip through a wall you clearly should be ducking under, but can’t because there’s no duck option, yet when you watch the subsequent cutscene, the people duck under through. It’s odd.\n\n- Poor graphics. Very poor graphics. Walls and backgrounds are blurry, the flashlight looks weird. A non-static point-and-click game doesn’t need to have the fanciest of graphics, but these are just bad.\n\n- Very short. The game can be completed in a couple of hours, and if you play on Casual mode, every object that is of importance sparkles for you when you shine the flashlight over it. Playing in Gamer mode removes the sparkle, as well as stops you from asking for hints, but it’s still over very quick.","February 5, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is the first FMV game I've ever played and this is what I liked about it:\n- Quality of graphics and FMV scenes exceeded my expectations. Transitions between cutscenes and in-game content is smooth and 3D environments in general are a real eye candy (for a game this type)\n- Story is interesting, full of some (sometimes) cheesy humour but overall very engaging - the cheesy parts are actually funny and enjoyable rather than annoying. Acting is great but then again, you won't see much of acting from the secondary characters in the game (mostly short dialogues)\n- Puzzles are logical for an adventure game and mostly enjoyable rather than frustrating. The game auto-saves a lot, so even if you happen to die (which in some parts of the game may happen a bit more often), you won't have to replay anything\n- There is a decent hint system (pretty much an in-game walkthrough), so if you get stuck, you can always review the solution of this particular puzzle/episode of the game. I used the hint system a few times in the beginning of the game until I got used to the mechanics of character control and interaction and almost haven't used it since\n- Hunting for items/interactable objects can sometimes be a pain in the butt, since it's much harder to do pixel hunting in 3D environments as opposed to 2D environments used by most point and clicks/adventure games. I am playing the easy mode which makes an item "sparkle" when you use the flashlight but I still had some difficulties noticing several items in the game (they were only noticeable when Tex approaches them closely). I think that this happened 2-3 times so far, so definitely not a frustrating experience (if you play it on the hard mode, some items may be very challenging to find :))\n\nPlaying the game felt a bit like L.A. Noire (due to its unique Film Noir like setting), a bit like Fallout 3 (in terms of exploring relatively spacy areas and buildings) and a lot like a very good adventure/point and click game. I even went ahead and bought all other Tex Murphy adventures even though I probably won't be able to stand the old graphics for too long but as all point-and-click games fans know, these games are not about the graphics (e.g. Wadget eye games) :)\n\nI sincerely hope they will make another one or remake one of the older ones - I will buy it instantly.","January 12, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I personally never played Tex Murphy games before, so I can't say if it's a good sequel or not. It has a detective mystery, jokes and some (mostly unoriginal) puzzles. What does feel both very familiar and, at the same time, very new, is the live actors and filmed cutscenes. You know, the games and movie makers strive for decades to make computer generated faces look realistic, and yet you can always learn to tell it's a fake. It's surprisingly refreshing to see actual live real human people talking to you from the screen. Even if their acting skills are not Oscar-winning :) And it's cool to watch pre-rendered cutscenes with flying cars and special effects. The clever way developers combine 3D world where you can walk around like in any FPS game, with full motion video dialogs and cutscenes, was also a pleasant surprise for me. The gameplay is mostly about dicovering pieces of the mystery through dialogs with real actors in full motion video, and walking around and finding hidden objects in full 3D. It's a good solid game, relaxing mostly, I'm enjoying it. And it makes me want to see the FMV genre developed further, with more games and more creative ideas on using real actors in a gaming environment.\n\nSo, my personal opinion is that Tesla Effect is a nice game, but not a blockbuster; what it really deserves a big praise for, is showing that FMV gaming still has a potential. If you're a fan of adventure titles, you're most likely to enjoy it, but if you're just curious to know what FMV is like in 2014, I'd recommend waiting for a sale.","January 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Except for some annoying 'jumping-through-the-hoops' at times (some puzzles and items quests were a bit 'unintuitive'...), it was, overall, an entertaining ride. Good writing and appropriate music, too.\n\nOn the downside, there are some graphic scenes of violence (Tex getting beaten unconscious with an iron rod, which I did NOT find funny...), depictions of decapitation, and certain 'adult' themes, all of which make this game inappropriate for pre-17s.\n\nWhat I also liked about it was that it appears to be designed to help raise awareness about the life of Nikola Tesla and his work.  If you get a chance, read up on some of Tesla's monumental discoveries and their importance in not just our daily lives (e.g. AC power, brushless motors, etc.) but also in the implementation of certain advanced technologies (e.g. wireless transmission of power, resonant systems, scalar electromagnetics, etc).

A slick satire of the entire genre, packed with references to it's root, and modern pop culture, you play as a walking, talking parody  of the Film Noir Grizzled Detective trope in a Shadowrun-esque 2050, filled with mutants, radiation, and a story that seems way to intense for the shlock the game revels in for the first half of the game, but, after a harrowing, almost horror-esque section at the end of the second act, it hits it's tone nicely.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games, this is probably going to be quite the fun ride.\nLike playing Fallout New Vegas on wakcy wasteland, but wish there was less shooting, and more interacting with NPCs? You've struck gold.\nJust looking for a fun way to spend an evening or two? You could do worse.

However, this is the only game that has successfully melded the game and full motion video. All other previous hybrids I have played before have been misreable failures.\n\nAnd even though I hadnt heard of Tex Murphy before this game its very easy to jump right into the story, identify with Tex, and realize that the pulp and noire feel just works seamlessly. Tex really needs no intro. Prior to starting the game I feared there was going to be too many references that were inside jokes from previous chapters of the Tex Murphy saga. Im glad to say that this stands alone well and everyone can get the same level of enjoyment whether they were very involved with previous storylines or are a total newcomer like myself.\n\nEasily a 4.5 out 5 stars.

It's certainly something different from conventional games, both in terms of gameplay and its awesome FMV storytelling. The narrative was well-written and the characters were well-played. Sometimes the gameplay got a little frustrating when looking for something for a long time, but you can always get a hint when you need one. The music was great near the end but slightly lacking in the earlier parts. My main complaint with the game is how its graphics feel like they're from around 2006 when the game was made in 2014. Things are very low-poly and the texture resolution is pretty bad. As a result, the worlds felt much less immersive and engaging than they could have. I felt more time should have been put into the level art. The backgrounds of the FMV scenes were also from the in-game scenes so they were also lacking in visual fidelity except at the ending which was pre-rendered out-of-engine (and, as such, was quite awesome!) Due to the graphics and slightly slow gameplay, I would give this a 7/10 rating. It wasn't fantastic because it felt rather lifeless during the gameplay portions but it was still a very enjoyable story with some pretty unique FMV which is uncommon in gaming!","March 28, 2015","true","15.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

While the gameplay itself is 1st person 3D, the game narrative uses FMV. It's a real flashback from the 90's, when FMV was the latest craze, only to die because of overuse in less than stellar games. Tex Murphy series never was bad though.\n\nIn its day Tex Murphy games were one of the few that got FMV right. The games weren't poorly acted choose your own adventure types, but real, honest adventure games with exploration and character interactions. They were, and still are, good games. And then FMV died and so did Tex, at least so it seemed.\n\nPrevious Tex game, The Overseer, left things in a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger, that would take over decade to be resolved. Tesla Effect doesn't continue directly from the end of the Overseer, but the mystery it left is part of the mystery that needs to be resolved in Tesla Effect as well. At the same time Tesla Effect is its own story, so being familiar with previous games isn't mandatory.\n\nWhile Tesla Effect is a bit lacking in graphics, especially in comparison to modern AAA games, it is a great game none the less and especially the FMV sequences look pretty damn good. So if you are a fan of adventures, or pulp sci-fi, then Tesla Effect might just be a game for you.

Tex needs the hollywood Budget... it's too big a game to pass off for less than a few mill... What they've done is amazing... The FMV's are truely great. Interviewing people for clues is well done... but it needs to be bigger... There should be 3-4 Cases for Tex to be solving... I hope Modding crews get onto it... could be done (Although FMV's wont be usable... maybe freeze frames of the actors?)\n\nThe low budget shows in the Graphics... although it's not too bad if you played the originals newbies will wtf at the seemingly dated graphics... most painful if you get a glimpse of an NPC. I do understand that the effort was put into the FMV's and storyline. Maybe TM7 will get the publisher backing it needs. The road Tex lives on has been brought to life... it does look good... it's not next gen graphics... certainly does the trick... but it's not as good as it should be for the wonderous game it is.\n\nFew other nitpicks about items generally being small and you have to painstakingly examine rooms inch by inch (Certainly on the harder mode where you don't have the flashlight and *Sparkle* effect on items of interest)\n\nBut it is a long game... first playthough took around 20 hours on hard. Like I say finding items can be a task. But certainly a great deal longer than the 8 hours on the recent COD game... there are also multiple endings and multiple chat paths which is nice.\n\nCan't help but think if a couple of mill had been thrown at the game for a decent graphical engine we'd be looking at a Game Of The Year easily. It's all well and good for those who loved the originals and wish to find out what happened to Tex and is a nice bit of closure on one of Gamings underdogs. But it needs more... I hope someone out there reognises this is a niche market that does have a fanbase... there are plenty of mature gmaers who'd eat this up... also there are a whole hoard of younger gamers sick of the 'run here, shoot that, run here, shoot that' games that are released daily. Tex encourages you to use your mind.\n\nAside from that... I'm well glad I have this in my libaray with the other Tex games... they'll easily come out on a wet weekend where I can sit down as NSF's finest PI and crack a case wide open.","June 14, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was so pleased to see a new episode coming out. FMV is all my youth after all. I rushed on Harvester when it was re-released, own both the 7th Guest and the 11th Hour and enjoy them almost as much as first time.\nAnd if I must be honnest I would go down on my knees for some Phantasmagoria or Gabriel knight but this is a totally different story.\nOk, so this new Tex.\nThose new gen FMV's are gorgeous, I connected my notebook to my 55" TV and were all "WOW" like when I saw Tex HD. The intro is great, sweating Blade runner from all its pixels.\nThe first minutes were plain joy, a nicely done optional tutorial and then, here I went on my own ready to investigate this new open world. Then...\nWell, yeah, then...\nTHEN, I realized that the game is just no more than FMV's and a nice scenario continuing the main serie story.\nLet me explain myself, the game got a single and only bad point: it's realisation is rubbish. It seems like the team spent all the budget on the movie part and the rest of the game, the interractive "real" playable part, was build using HL 1 engine. It's cheap, cubic, empty for the most part with plenty of 3D models repetitions trying to furnish the maps but failed.\nThe level design, if I can call it that way, is madly wrong and screams: "So boring to do those additional buildings, anyway you would have no interraction on them except maybe an optional object to find so why try harder".\nNo joke, I saw some better textures on Minecraft...\nClick on one of those "useless buildings" and enjoy Tex repeating again and again the same comment.\nCountless amounts of objects here and there triggering some "flashback" style videos getting the player back to the old episodes of the serie but with no links with the actual story would then finish the work and make you understand that the Dev's are just imploring you hands joined to buy the older episodes.\n\nAnother epic fail was the translation. For those who master english, no problem at all. Characters are all on ol'time noir movies slang and they sounds great.\nHeh, me bad. english isn't my mother's tongue so I turned on the subtitles.\nI'm not stupid. I pretty well know that slang or expressions are sometimes really hard to translate as they sometimes got no compare on another language but dude!\nWho the hell did you guys picked to do the job? We have litteral translation here, word for word. Not any comprehension of the original meaning and worst, on some dialogues with multi answers choice it becomes plain luck to choose witch one you must or want choose from...\n\nSo after all that was said, you would certainly ask yourself: "So, good or not?"\n\nFor myself, as a real lover of Tex' debuts, it will definitly be a YES. I played some serious ♥♥♥♥♥ way more awfull than that and enjoyed them.\nFor new incomers, those who never played Under a Killing Moon and even don't know what is it, don't loose your time here.\nIf you're just curious about the franchise, get yourself one of the firsts.\n","August 15, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The characters and cutscenes are superbly written and a joy to behold, and the game really hits its peak when it gives you a mystery to unravel and an open space for you to find clues within.\nHowever, half the game's puzzles seem to exist just to exist. Too often I was left in an interesting location, with uninteresting objectives. At one point, I found a sliding block puzzle in an old woman's mansion and simply quit because it completely broke immersion for me.\nStill, an enjoyable experience, and a tentative recommendation. However, if you're looking for gameplay that actually makes you feel like a detective, I'd recommend the Sherlock Holmes' or Blackwell series' instead.","April 21, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Adventure game with real 3D scenarios and, where all dialogs with characters and all cinematics are videos, like in a series B film. The atmosphear of the videos is somewhat similar to Doctor Who and that kind of TV series with that odd series B look.\nStory line is strong, deep and interesting enough. Typical anti-hero detectivesque atmosphear but, full of humor, as well.\nPuzzles aren't mostly that hard and, usually easy to figure out (except very few). Things to do are so variate that you don't go easily bored.\nIt takes a little while to understand games mechanics, since your character wakes up with no memories and, in a world where you can freely move. The tips come when you interact with characters and, your memory gaps start to be filled in.\n3D graphics aren't spectacular but, serve to the purpose.\nVoice acting is good and actors do a good job.\nTranslation is a tad defective, at least, in Spanish. This can confuse you about tips and clues. Bad translated words or sentences can lead you to a dead end.\nWell, this game greatefuly surprised me!.

I have missed you!!\nBeen 16 years I have been waiting to find out what happened to Tex and Chelsea at the end of Overseer and I never thought I would see another game after Microsoft bought out Access Software and pretty much killed it all. But here we are and those questions have been answered. For any Tex Murphy fan, this is a must have. Is it tough seeing him aged?? Yes. Is this game as groundbreaking as the games he released in the 90's. No. But this game is still a blast.\nThe graphics aren't spetacular, but they are solid and the  cutscenes are excellent. The same Tex wit we were used to then is still present in this game and i found myself laughing throughout the game. And the host of co-start is also present here just like in the all the other games. There are also many items throughout the game that u click that takes you back to the old games and shows you clips from those games as well.\nThis game also brings back many characters from those older games and keeps the nostalgia going, making this feel like old times.\nSome of the puzzles are quite complicated and there is very little direction as to what you are supposed to do, but eventually, it can be figured out and solved. Most of the puzzles are very cool and the game continues to move at a fairly quick pace. But be sure to search and click on everything you can find because there are several little gems to be found that are absolutely hilarious.\nWhen the game ended, there was alot of hope that this would not be the last, and I hope that is the case. There is alot left in the series as far as I am concerned and I hope to enjoy a couple of more games before they call it quits.\nThanks Chris Jones and Adrian Carr for keeping Tex alive and please don't give up. there are hardocre fans out there who have been waiting for this and will suppport you as much as we can. .\nUntil then, I have this game, and if you don't have it (especially you Tex fans), get it. Nice price for an excellent challenging game.","December 14, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although just another adventure game, it's not just the adventure game part. It's the "tongue in cheek" humor that, anyone who knows this game well, understands and appreciates.\n\nIn this game, you are, once again, Tex Murphy, P.I., working on another case. Becuase of the humor it presents, there are MANY jokes and references to many icons, cultures, and even some movies and music. Indiana Jones, 1960's song, even flashbacks of the previous games, are in this adventure game.\n\nOne thing that has not changed since the beginning is that they have used the same actor for all the Tex Murphy games. Because I have been a big fan of this series, it's great to see some things are not lost and haven't changed. Atlus designed a great game that follows how "Access Software" used to make. Thank you for making a classical game more classical than ever and keeping the original actor for this game.","January 26, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have missed you!!\nBeen 16 years I have been waiting to find out what happened to Tex and Chelsea at the end of Overseer and I never thought I would see another game after Microsoft bought out Access Software and pretty much killed it all. But here we are and those questions have been answered. For any Tex Murphy fan, this is a must have. Is it tough seeing him aged?? Yes. Is this game as groundbreaking as the games he released in the 90's. No. But this game is still a blast.\nThe graphics aren't spetacular, but they are solid and the  cutscenes are excellent. The same Tex wit we were used to then is still present in this game and i found myself laughing throughout the game. And the host of co-start is also present here just like in the all the other games. There are also many items throughout the game that u click that takes you back to the old games and shows you clips from those games as well.\nThis game also brings back many characters from those older games and keeps the nostalgia going, making this feel like old times.\nSome of the puzzles are quite complicated and there is very little direction as to what you are supposed to do, but eventually, it can be figured out and solved. Most of the puzzles are very cool and the game continues to move at a fairly quick pace. But be sure to search and click on everything you can find because there are several little gems to be found that are absolutely hilarious.\nWhen the game ended, there was alot of hope that this would not be the last, and I hope that is the case. There is alot left in the series as far as I am concerned and I hope to enjoy a couple of more games before they call it quits.\nThanks Chris Jones and Adrian Carr for keeping Tex alive and please don't give up. there are hardocre fans out there who have been waiting for this and will suppport you as much as we can. .\nUntil then, I have this game, and if you don't have it (especially you Tex fans), get it. Nice price for an excellent challenging game.","December 14, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While Tesla Effect won't tax any modern computer, it still offers a compelling game with good graphics, which will hopefully stand the test of time.\n\nI'm a diehard Tex Murphy Fan. When I first started the series with Under a Killing Moon and its four CDs under DOS, I was instantly hooked. Having played the games that followed, I was always keen for more, so when Microsoft bought Access and effectively killed Tex Murphy, especially after the cliff-hanger that ended Overseer, I was devastated. Thankfully, due to a successful Kickstarter campaign, we now have a conclusion to that story, with spectacular results.\n\nTesla Effect continues the same formula as its preceding games, which is actually not a bad thing. If you've ever played Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive or Overseer, then you know what you're getting into. In terms of gameplay mechanics, Tesla Effect benefits greatly from being produced in the modern era, with fantastic graphics and a solid control system in place that's a massive improvement from the clunky controls (relatively speaking) of the prior games.\n\nTesla Effect continues the trend of Full Motion Video (FMV) embedded within a digital game world the franchise was famous for, which offers a great experience. While most games these days tend to use digital models for people, Tesla Effect, and its preceding games, capture real actors and place them within their digital environments. This provides for (IMO) a much better story delivery method, which has always been used to great effect in the Tex franchise.\n\nWhile the game can be played stand-alone, it's probably better if you jump back to Overseer as its story bleeds into Tesla Effect's to a degree. There's plenty of homage to the franchise, which should bring great excitement to fans (Which I certainly loved!), but it may not have the same effect on those who've never played the series before.\n\nTesla Effect essentially boils down to a detective adventure game within a 3D world you can explore. It is loaded with lots of puzzles for you to sink your teeth into, as well as a witty story rife with choice. You will be expected to look closely at the environment to find elements to assist you on your quest, which at times can be a little irritating as the items are either obscure, or blend into their environments a little too well, but the reward for correctly identifying, combining and utilising the items is satisfying.\n\nAll interactions with characters are provided through simple but vague options which you can choose. Importantly, the game is designed such that the choices you make as you interact with the characters have the ability to shape the game's ending, which is nice. Each of the options provides an interesting and often humorous reply from Tex, sometimes leading to your downfall if approached poorly.\n\nFor fans of the series, all of the key actors are back and this is absolutely fantastic. It's great to see so many actors from the franchise put their hands up to recast their roles after such a long time, which provides great continuation for the series and continues to anchor the game in the franchise's world. The new cast members for this game, such as "The Soup Nazi", also work well, but there are also a few other well known celebrity actors included in the game too, much like in the earlier games.\n\nOverall, if you're a Tex Murphy fan, most definitely pick this up. If you've never played Tex Murphy games before, you owe it to yourself to try out what was, in my opinion, one of the greatest gaming franchises of the 90s. If you’ve never played Tex games before, pick up the preceding three games and give these a go too. While their graphics become increasingly dated and ordinary with age, their stories and detective mechanics are what really make them shine, and therefore, still worth pursuing.\n\nTesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, is a game I most highly recommend!","February 7, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now I have to actually go back and finish my playthrough of Overseer, which I have kicking around somewhere.  But back to Tesla Effect.\n\nThe best parts of the whole thing are the cast.  A few are soooo bad it's hilarious, most are decent, and a few, especially Tex himself and Rook, are really great.  Lots of laughs.  The humor from the previous games has survived.\n\nThe story is interesting at first, but about 2/3 of the way in, things start getting weirdly complicated, like four or five people were writing while off on their own and then feeding their plotlines into the final product with only occasional collaboration.  I mean, you could follow what was happening, but it got pretty dumb by the end.  Also, while I very much appreciated the handful of branching choices, I would have liked more contextual clues when they popped up.  On my first playthrough I got one of the odd endings that didn't feel like it really fit the overall story up until that point, because of a single choice I took to be a joke at first.\n\nGameplay is all about picking up everything that is pick-up-able, examining and trying different combinations of items, as well as asking every single person you encounter about every single topic available.  Death traps are situational and sometimes annoyingly cheap (I'm looking at you stealth section and lab exploration).  There is no combat.  It is a point-and-click adventure, afterall.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple speed bumps a small child could solve, to the occasional head-scratcher needing a bit of trial and error, to the classic adventure game standby of "now what were the devs thinking when they came up with this one", where you have to imagine what would make sense in the immediate context rather than what would work in real life.\n\nThe FMVs were all very clear and polished, while the rendered art style was classic Tex, and barely updated.  The devs were clearly writing a love letter to the series, the characters and the old school fans.  I had a great few nights running through this with nostalgia goggles on, and will probably do so again after I finish Overseer.  I would highly reccomend this to any fans of the early 90s FMV adventure genre, and it's a must have for anyone wanting to see one last Tex Murphy case.  If you're neither, however, odds are you'd be better off just watching a Let's Play, if only for the cutscenes, because the older style and sensibilities will probably be lost on you.","April 4, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And then I found I really wanted to at least mildly enjoy it. And then I really just wanted to finish it and get it out of the way to free up my HD.\n\nI'm an oldschool fan of the Tex Murphy series, and have played all the previous games multiple times, and still have fond memories of those previous games. But this game was a tragic pig-piling of incredibly vague dialogue choices, badly cliched characterization, lame sexist jokes, and all around a boring story with no mystery.\n\nAs far as gameplay and puzzles go, it's pretty much what you'd expect from any other point and click. Most of the puzzles were fun, but some where just so obscure and unintuitive in their execution that I often found myself rolling my eyes and sighing more and more.\n\nBeing a fan of point and click adventure games, and having been an avid Tex Murphy fan, I can't even honsetly recommend this game to other Tex Murphy fans, let alone other adventure gamers.

It could be debated that this adds to the challenge, but I've always been a fan of intentionally doing stupid things in adventure games to see how the programmers went about them.  This means intentionally falling off cliffs etc.  If I could make one suggestion, it would be to make the points system based on finding items, examining things, and solving puzzles; and not have points deducted for dying (or, lessen the blow of lost points during deaths)","November 24, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The puzzles are neither too easy nor too difficult. Some objects are hard to find but in casual mode there is a way to highlight them. The acting is hit-and-miss. The music fits well.

There are some things the game does really well and some things that were disappointing.\nThe look of the game was overall good the cg backgrounds only sometimes clashing with the actors in front of a green screen.  There were some cut scenes that I wish they actually had real sets.\nThe acting was good with the exception of a few characters.\nWhere I take issue with the game is in the story.  Tesla Effect seems to want to ride the rails between serious noir detective story and goofy comedic game which was to its detriment.  One minute Tex has a bad pun and the next there's people getting violently murdered and heavy sexual innuendo.  I would have much prefered the game if they picked one direction and stuck with it.\nThe gameplay is in the very traditional adventure game style of: use x on y and combine x with z, so if you like that it's fine.\nThe puzzles with one exception were well done (if not a little easy) with the exception of one which requires the player to know of an ancient egyptian puzzle from outside the game to know what the goal of the puzzle is.\nAs a new player to the Tex Murphy series, I found the game to be geared too much towards old players.  Several Items are strewn about the game that if you click on them it plays a clip from an old game.  I think these were supposed to be funny parts from the originals, but without their context i didn't find them funny at all, just stange and confusing.\n\nIf you are a fan of the series you probably will like it, but if like me you are an adventure gamer new to Tex you'll probably be unimpressed.

I have to sadly say, that at this time, I am not impressed.  I'll keep it simple...\n\n-The first person camera is poorly done, and leaves me with severe sea sickness like queezy feeling, even for hours after I save and close down the game session. (fiddling with the field of view in options helps but doesn't completely fix this problem)  I've played First person shooters for years, and I don't have this problem with AAA designed FPS titles that perfect the veiwing angle, which eliminates motion sickness for me\n-Opening game story/writing is very bad\n-dialog writing and acting delivery is extremely bad and lacking the charm of the old Tex games.  Tex was never known for great acting, but he was known to pull off bad acting and all sorts of hokiness with a fantastic endearing quality and I'm just not agreeing with it in this new release.\n-the early game puzzles are really lame (Spoiler' ' an overly complicated and obnoxious game of simon and running all over town without much aim or directive just to find a ladder and have some forced introductions with currently useless new characters who aren't very interesting ' ')\n-I cannot stand the Mystery Science Theatre sounding PDA voice that is constantly a part of the game, it's the voice of the personal electronic organizer.  I'd rather be alone with Tex's internal monologue and not annoying interuptions of MST voices popping in with awful one liners and insults.\n\nI only played through the first hour or so of the game + I finished the entire demo before the final game was released.  I found the demo to be a tad bit better than the intro of the new Tex game, so perhaps the game gets better as it goes on, but with nothing so far that I find endearing or appealing combined with the naseau inducing first person camera implementation, and I don't think I'll be back to find out if I'm missing out or not.\n\nPersonally I'd rather replay UAKM or Pandora Directive or go replay Myst III, IV and V than try this again anytime soon.\n\nSorry Tex, I still love ya, but please, try again.","September 11, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

I want to make sure before I spill out all my complaints I make this very clear: games like this need support, dev teams who are willing to take the risk faithfully resurrecting the genres and characters many of us cherish from our childhood should be applauded. No matter how much I dislike this game I think that it was a competent remake of a classic game that has a strong cult following and a lot of loving support. I would be a hypocrite if I condemned this game for being itself simply because I’m not into the content while at the same time begging for developers to bring back Banjo Kazooie.\n\nWith all my respect for the resurrection of the Full Motion Video (FMV) crime adventure on the table, I thought The Tesla Effect was not very good. Right from the beginning, inspecting objects around the opening area leads to a multitude of (what I presume to be) clips from the original Tex Murphy games. They are abysmally cheesy and for someone who never experience the franchise in the past, they feel like inside jokes that I’m completely left out of. The cheese I can absolutely forgive because the original games were from a very different time culturally and technologically, however the feeling of being left out as a new player is really disheartening. Next up is a very personal and subjective complaint with very little merit in a review of a game like this, but I find FMV cutscenes to be disturbingly unnerving. Every time a cutscene would trigger I was so uncomfortable. I’m not sure if it’s the clash of real people against digital backdrops or if it’s just that principal of the uncanny valley, either way I just could not stomach that art style. On to a very different issue; I’m not sure how the original game played, but not being able to walk while moving the mouse is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t care if that was part of the “charm” of the original game or not, having to walk forward, stop, look left with the mouse, and then be able to walk forward again is just inexcusable. Finally, I have never had a game run my rigs so hot before. On my brand new laptop (which I frequently use to play games like Space Engineers Civilization BE and Bioshock Infinite) after only 15 minutes of play I was unable to use the keyboard. I typically hit around 40-45C near the GPU but running Tesla Effect caused the majority of my keyboard to hit 50 degrees!\n\nI support the developers with all my heart and I think more risks like this need to be taken, but Tesla Effect was just not right. Between personal and mechanical issues, I would not recommend this game to anyone.","March 5, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 30 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","11","30","2","0"

The graphics are rather low in detail and not too inspiring. Puzzles ; ive done some of the puzzles in the game, some of the first puzzles, really really got on my nerve, and is the biggest contributor to me disliking it somewhat, the other parts i sort of could live with, with no big impact, ...puzzle that got to me : the wheel puzzle above the electronics shop ; flashing lights on a wheel in different colors flashing by fast, repeat combination ; seriously... how am i supposed to repeat the last and second line when the flashing of the lights is 8 spots on a wheel... and it flashes 4-5 times a second . Sorry im not rainman...cant memorize that fast.  And secondly its not fun at all! Yes i moved past the puzzle... by using a walkthrough, and still missing the buttons at times...\nSound : very spartan ... and alot of sound effects arent even synced up within a second(!) of the spot where it supposed to be there ( read : coit tower elevator) . The story so far aint all that bad, it has some humourous points now and then, but the game so far feels very rushed and unfinished in the finish.

I did not complete the game for reasons which are clarified below.\n\nWhat the game got right:\nThis game is very cheesy. The cutscenes and character interactions, the one-liners from the PI you play as -- those are the strong points of this game. The FMV parts of the game are really well done: the resolution doesn't make you feel sick, the green screen is just viewable around the edges of the characters but not too distracting. The 2k resolution for the FMV sequences is probably nice for people who have the hardware to display that kind of thing.\n\nWhat it got wrong:\nHowever, I would not recommend this game. It just doesn't feel like a game. On top of that, the graphics of the main street you first walk around it sicken me. It feels like Deus Ex. Both games were set in the future, and both games look like they were made in 2000. Deus Ex WAS released in 2000, but Tesla Effect was released in 2014. There's a car I saw on Main street that looked almost exactly like a flattened blackened, car from DE. I know this is a game which is trying to appeal to older folks and older gamers by mimicking older games, but come on. It's hard to go from 1080p FMV sequences to crappy everything else. It's immersion breaking.\n\nSo, as a game, I would not recommend this. It's like you're swimming in an ocean of outdated graphics and mediocre gameplay, and every FMV sequence is a breath of fresh air before you have to plunge your head back into the ocean to get to the next part so you can breath in the FMV again. Some people say, once you get immersed in the story, the graphics will become insignificant. Maybe. I did not get immersed in the story, and after quitting the game once, had little inclination to go back.","April 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","5","18","2","0"

The story starts as Tex suddenly awakes disoriented in his office at the Ritz Hotel with strange markings and signs of violence on his body and no memory of the past seven years. He then discovers that Chelsee has been missing ever since the attack and is presumed dead. He sets out to find out what happened to him, what became of Chelsee, and to regain his past memories, and in so doing uncovers a web of intrigue involving murders, double crosses, and the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla.\n\n\n\n(+)Graphics : Graphics are great , the game can support graphics up to 2K to support live-action sequences .\n\n\n(-)Cutscenes / Story :  I know that most of you won't be agreeing with me , but the cutscenes are boring , acting is really below the charts and story looks nice but its executed terribly . Of course it changes from people to people but to me i don't like too long cutscenes with terrible acting .\n\n\n(+)Gameplay :  You can navigate 3D environments in first-person, search for clues, and use inventory items. The game also includes logic puzzles and a branching conversation system for interviewing characters. Like The Pandora Directive, it features "narrative pathing" where player choices affect the story and ending\n\n\n\nInteresting story , too long real-life cutscenes with terrible acting . It would have been better as a movie .\n\n5/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","November 26, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","0"

I have never been so annoyed nor gotten as angry at a game in my life, and I've played all the Souls games, among other games that have a tendency to make you lose your cool at some point or another.\nSome puzzles I thought I had figured out the logic behind, but when solving it didn't work I resorted to trial and error until it worked, and I still don't know the logic behind those puzzles.  I've seen others complete them on Youtube, and it only confused me more when, in 1 instance in particular, they solved a puzzle by doing what I had done.. except for me it didn't work.\n\nPuzzle and point-and-click games aren't my favorite genres so if you're a big fan of those you may get a better experience, especially if you're a Tex Murphy fan.\n\nOn the other hand, I enjoyed the FMVs.. good cheesy fun.  The intro movie was the best part of the game.. got me pumped to be immersed in a movie I'd play in as the main character.. and then I got plopped into the gameplay and I barfed in my mouth a little.\n\nTL:DR - Great B-movie, terrible game.","June 25, 2014","false","13.3"," 10 of 31 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","10","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdonis/recommended/261510/","mcdonis","McDonis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdonis/","631 products in account","20 years ago FMV was a very new and cool concept in PC gaming.  It promised to bring ultra realism and a whole new level of immeration in gaming.  Unfortunately the games that came out with FMV were less than steller.   One game series that went all in on FMV was the Tex Murphy series of adventure games.  Tex 3, 4, and 5 (Under a killing moon, Pandora, Overseer) all featured this new technology.  The Tex series was an enjoyable if cheezy adventure game series that focused on an out of luck PI who was 2 parts buffon and 1 part saint.  The draw initially was the FMV but the series milked successfuly the humor and puzzle elements for all they were worth.  For the most part the Tex series enjoyed moderate success with gamers but not at the same level of a Monkey Island or a Sierra title.\n\nNow we have yet another Kickstarter romp though an old game series that is long since dead.  Very dead in fact....   Its been 16 years since Overseer left Tex fans on a clifhanger.  As one of those fans I have to admit I was excited at the prospect of seeing the old Tex in action again and finally geting a proper send off for a beloved series.  Its painful for me to admit but I REALLY wanted to see another game in this series.  Enough for me to fork over 100 bucks 2 years before it was released. In this case I think it might have been better to have Tex stay dead.\n\nWhile the game industry has moved on its clear the designers either havent or thought they had to stick to the old forumla because TeslaEffect is basicly a slight upgrade from their last outing.  The backgrounds are so pixulated that I think I am back playing in 1997.   Some of the actors are either not professionals or just mailing in their performances (similar to what we saw in UAKM).   The puzzles seem random and dont tie into the world and its story.  When playing as tex and choosing from a text bubble the options are so random it really doesnt matter what option you choose or to even bother to read them.  Clearly the skills of the storytelling and game design for these folks havent advanced a day from the late 90's\n\nThe story itself is corny (what you would expect from the series) and at times hard to follow.  There are many many gems hidden for Tex fans to reminace about the past.   Its mostly overdone and in poor quality, which leaves this Tex fan disapointed.  As of this date (May 2014) there are many bugs still in the game, most are of the audio nature.  The game can get offsync with the audio and at times the audio will cut completely out for a few seconds.\n\nBottom line is that if you really really really must see a new tex game its probably worth it to you to spend the 15-20 bucks for the cost.  The other 99.999999% of the population however should stay away.   Literally this game is made for about 20-30 indiviudals who stayed true and talked tex in message boards (Unoffical Tex Murphy) all these years.\n\nMe I thank Tex for the fun we had in the 90's but to me he died in that speeder in Overseer.\nHappy trails Tex","May 18, 2014","false","6.8"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","11","34","0","0"

The areas are too big and you can spend a lot of time wandering around. It also keeps going back to some dated footage from the previous game. The odd clip might give some veterans of the series nostalgia but for me it's just anoying.

It's not going to win any new hearts and minds.\n\nAlmost all other PnC adventures released in the past 5-6 years as part of a revival of the genre outshine this game in every aspect.

If you are afan of the old games you may get a certain feeling of nastalgia from playing it. Having not played any of them beyond a demo for under a killing moon i cant comment to the accuracy to the old style.  Regardless, the world which you walk around in is graphicly below par for a game made this side of 2000. I realise this game was funded through crowd funding, but this doesn't excuse the old textures and graphic models used, not a slap dash approach to CGI rendered animations. Accepting that a substantial amount of the budget did go into making the cinematic cut scenes doesn't excuse them from being lazy elsewhere.\n\nThe story though did have a certain amount of charm, even if it lacked in the complexity i normally enjoy. The puzzles for the most part were easy to solve and weren't really much of a challenge. The only exception being one which required you to have looked at something a lot more carefully then i did. Several were confusing only in the lack of instructions. Show me what appeared to be a drafts bored and then i find its actually a puzzle where i cant have more then 1 of each tile on each row. Solution was easy once i realised my goal. In some ways this is a hall mark of the style and not really something you can hold against the game, though it is nice when the items aren't limited to only one use.\n\nThe cheeseyness of the acting though either makes or breaks this game...you will either love it for it, or you will find it distracting from the story telling. For me it was somewhat distracting, i could see what they were trying to do, but the actors just didn't feel up to it. To me it felt like they were overacting.\nThe world felt empty, apart from a few roaming insta killers, there was no real interaction with anyone outside of their preset boxes.\n\nWhen it came up i had considered supporting the kickstarter. Having now played the game, i'm really glad i didn't.","January 4, 2015","false","10.1"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","2","18","0","0"

It holds many mysteries, chuckles and grins, and a lot of great private investigator clichès. The story - at least up until where I got - keeps you riddling and being at that the puzzles are mildly challenging, too, yet nothing compared to Myst, which in my opinion is unsolvable without a walkthrough.\n\nSo in comprehension if you are a fan of detective stories and 1940's-60's ones at that and want to see them transitioned into a very well woven athmosphere of this era set in the future of 2050 be assured this game will not let you down.","June 14, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The same branching dialogues, the same silly puzzles that usually aren't difficult, and the same questionable logic which determines which random objects go together to make functional objects to solve problems.\n\nPros:\n~ The 4K camera work looks great.  The quality of the FMV portions look fantastic.\n~ Cheezy dialogue and acting.  It's a YMMV thing, but I love it.\n~ For those who have followed Tex through his recent adventures in the Pandora Directive and the Tex Murphy Radio Saga, it attempts to tie up all the loose ends and explain what has all happened.  It's a pretty well written story.\n~ Multiple endings based on dialogue decisions, and while some are better than others, Sapphyre's is great.\n~ The game is legitimately funny.\n~ All digital, so NO DISC SWAPPING HALLELUJAH!\n~ Tons of references to the earlier games, especially Under a Killing Moon.\n\nCons:\n~ The puzzles aren't really as difficult as you would think.  And the game follows a fairly predictable thread of 1.) Talk to people on the street 2.) Find items needed to get into a place  3.) Find items in place, and solve puzzles, 4.) Rinse, Lather, Repeat.\n~ The camera work is great, but the in game 3D world looks like it came right out of 2003, in a not good way.  The world is much more open than previous games, and there aren't the frequent, epic length loading screens, or disc swapping THANK GOD.\n~ If you didn't play the earlier Tex Murphy games, especially Overseer and Pandora Directive, it may be difficult to grasp the story.  Under A Killing Moon is suggested, because it's the best, but doesn't contribute as much to the story.\n\nUltimately, if you're an oldschool Tex Murphy player, a fan of Point & Click games, interactive movies, or like comedies with a film noir setting, you may love this game.  If you're not into those, you could probably pass on it.","June 26, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it in a bundle. At first, this appeared to be a rather cheap adventure-style game with some kind of retro charm. However, as I went along with playing it, I started to enjoy the story and the cheesy characters.\n\nGameplay-wise I found myself stuck several times with absolutely no clue how to progess. The searching and trying very quickly felt combersome and frustrating. While it *is* in the spirit of the adventure games of old, today I don't find the time anymore to come back and do the chores of what feels like hours of searching. Also, I had to use a walkthrough in a couple of places to proceed, only to find out that I either would never had realized the solution on my own (too confusing) or that I had all the right ideas but the game expected a very specific sequence of progression (which should be more open to similar solutions).\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game, although I happened upon it as a free extra in a bundle. I very much doubt that I would have bought it on Steam or elsewhere. Then again, this is a game with a main audience of longtime Text Murphy fans for whom this game is obviously created. Throughout the game, I always felt a bit excluded, like standing on the sidelines and not getting all the jokes. I then turned that into archaelogical curiosity, exploring the pieces of a culture remembering itself. That was kind of special.\n\nNow that I know Tex Murphy exists, I would play a followup game. But then again, it felt lacking a little too much polish to be sold for 20 €.","November 2, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/recommended/261510/","GoldenGuy","GoldeFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/","253 products in account","Before you read further, I am a "Tex Murphy Newbie" so this was my first exposure to the series... and if this is my first exposure then I sure do love what I have played. A suprisingly well written and well acted and entertaining game that should serve as a template for future adventure games.\n\nThe Story:\nI don't want to spoil much but Tex Murphy wakes up with a case of amnesia... sounds boring right? A lot of games have done this but I feel that Telsa Effect does this in a unique way. Instead of it just being a plot device for the sake of helping players learn what is going on, it serves as an integral part of the plot that isn't intrusive and actually makes the story even more interesting as it goes on. As the story does seem confusing at first, the game surprisingly does an excellent job of giving just enough exposition for it to makes sense, and to not bring down the pace. The twists aren't hamfisted and are very well put (and once you replay the game the twists definatly help you enjoy it even more because you can see a scene again and say "yep makes sense, the twist."\n\nGameplay:\nThis is unlike any other Adventure game I have ever played... It is basically what i'd call a FPPC (First-Person Point and Click) it has the idea of a first person shooter, without the shooting,  and makes you explore to solve puzzles... and it works too very well. It is the adventure game genre in the modern age and it plays great. Sure the enviroments look like they came from the early 2000s, but it runs great and honestly it didn't hinder my enjoyment.\n\nPuzzles:\nSurprisingly the puzzles are very intuitive and never get on my nerves (except for the Sliding puzzle... I always hate those) if a puzzle seems confusing then you can press the help button and Tex will tell you, basically, what to do to solve the puzzle (not the answer or correct way... but an instruction) which makes puzzle a lot more tolleratable (looking at you Nancy Drew)\n\nCharacters:\nSince this is an adventure game the characters play a major role... and I have a soft spot for every single one of them... they are all surprisingly entertaining to watch and complement off of each other fairly well. The only character I could not stand was the guy who you meet at the BBQ place (can't place his name) he was just obnoxious.\n\nPacing:\nThe pacing is where my first fault with the game comes. The game is split up into 12 days and each day acts as an "episode" with two amusing pun names to introduce them. My problem with the day system is sometimes you will have a crap load of stuff to do and could total to around an hour of game time... but then the next "day" could only be a puzzle and a cutscene totaling to about 12 or so minutes. This is especially evident in the final few days where it just flys by as though the writers were like "oh we are at the end but we are schedualed to do 12 days... oh well rush the next 2 days" It didn't hinder my enjoyment much (besides me being sad that the game would end) but it was definalty something I noticed. Day 8 took me a good hour and a half while the following day only took me about 30 minutes. Either way the whole Tesla Building segment besides creeping me out badly with its use of Bee and Spiders really drug REALLY badly.\n\nMusic:\nFrom jazzy noir styled tunes to an epic orchestral ending this game's soundtrack is REALLY good. It may not be something you'd listen to all the time, but I'd be damned if I didn't enjoy everytime I heard the Chandler Avenue theme or feel a sense of bombast and dread when I hear the Tesla Building Theme. Very well done. And the opening song is freaking fantastic.\n\nOther Nuances:\nSome graphical glitches here and there (which didn't affect my liking) and a few green screen errors (artifacts were definalty noticable) and there was an exchange with one of the characters where the background behind them shifted all around. Again it didn't hurt the enjoyment at all.. but they were noticable. Also that sneak area was balls. Should be been developed much more.\n\nOverall:\nIs this the end for Tex Murphy? Honestly, if this game's quality speaks for the series I say I hope it isn't. Well acted, very entertaining, and a surprisingly excellent story helps Tex's newest adventure (and my first) become one of the best adventure games I have played ever. Sure there may never be another game with this being a "reunion" game, but for what is here it is certainly worth the 15 dollar price tag. And now I am off to play the other 3 FMV Tex Murphy games I have missed..\n\nHIGHLY RECOMENDED\n\nOh and yes, there are MT3K references, rejoice!","June 3","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played each Tex Murphy game as they came out starting with Meanstreets and I was thrilled to find out that Tex and crew was back in the Tesla Effect. The game did not disappoint. In two words, it was cinematic Tex.\n\nThe video quality was excellent with highly detailed FMV that looked great on a big screen. The sound and music were excellent, The acting carried the story and humour along well with the varied characters convincing in their roles with only a couple of missteps. Although they don't reach Crysis levels of reality, the 3D environments were detailed, varied and atmospheric. The interface was clean, elegant and easy to navigate. Through all of it there was the great mix of humour and depth. Tex wants to find out what happened and he does it only as Tex can: sticking his fingers where they shouldn't go, always making a wry quip, and in the end doing the right thing with a little bit of luck, heart and battered thick-headed determination.\n\nThe only drawbacks for me were the usual problems for an adventure game: occasionally spending an excess of time searching for a small clue in all the detail and some puzzles which are only very loosely tied to the story. That and the flow-breaking vagueness of the dialogue choices titles.  But for all the rest, the puzzles are finding and assembling the clues to tell the story, which is as it should be.\n\nI'm into the game for the story and the fun of it, so I played in casual mode and took my time to explore eveything I could. In honour of it being a new chapter in Tex's life, although I wanted to stay true to Chelsea, on my first run through, I thought Tex deserved to make the most of what his circumstances had granted him, and went with Taylor. Making those choices, Taylor vs Chelsea vs Ariel, was agonizing, in a good way.\n\nIf you are a fan of Tex you'll enjoy the game. If you are a fan of Noir, Science Fiction, quirky characters, and a silly but heartfelt homage to hard-boiled detectives, you will not regret the experience of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure. And if you are new to  Tex, and enjoyed this game, all the previous ones are available too for a retro-adventure gaming time and a Big Finish Games blessed fan remake of Overseer is in production as "The Poisoned Pawn" thepoisonedpawn.com projected for release in fall 2017.","June 5","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
